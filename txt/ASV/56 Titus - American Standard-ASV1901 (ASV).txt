Titus - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
[1:1] Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
[1:2] in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
[1:3] but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
[1:4] to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
[1:5] For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
[1:6] if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
[1:7] For the bishop must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
[1:8] but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
[1:9] holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
[1:10] For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
[1:11] whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
[1:12] One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
[1:13] This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
[1:14] not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
[1:15] To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
[1:16] They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
[2:1] But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
[2:2] that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
[2:3] that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
[2:4] that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
[2:5] `to be' sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
[2:6] the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
[2:7] in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine `showing' uncorruptness, gravity,
[2:8] sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
[2:9] `Exhort' servants to be in subjection to their own masters, `and' to be well-pleasing `to them' in all things; not gainsaying;
[2:10] not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
[2:11] For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
[2:12] instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
[2:13] looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
[2:14] who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
[2:15] These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
[3:1] Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
[3:2] to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
[3:3] For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
[3:4] But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
[3:5] not by works `done' in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
[3:6] which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
[3:7] that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[3:8] Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
[3:9] but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
[3:10] A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
[3:11] knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
[3:12] When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
[3:13] Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
[3:14] And let our `people' also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
[3:15] All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
