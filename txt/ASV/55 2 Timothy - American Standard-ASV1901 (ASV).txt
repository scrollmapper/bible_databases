2 Timothy - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
[1:1] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
[1:2] to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:3] I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day
[1:4] longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
[1:5] having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
[1:6] For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.
[1:7] For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
[1:8] Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;
[1:9] who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
[1:10] but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
[1:11] whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
[1:12] For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.
[1:13] Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
[1:14] That good thing which was committed unto `thee' guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
[1:15] This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
[1:16] The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
[1:17] but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
[1:18] (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
[2:1] Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[2:2] And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
[2:3] Suffer hardship with `me', as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[2:4] No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of `this' life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
[2:5] And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.
[2:6] The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
[2:7] Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
[2:8] Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
[2:9] wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
[2:10] Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
[2:11] Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
[2:12] if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
[2:13] if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
[2:14] Of these things put them in remembrance, charging `them' in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
[2:15] Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
[2:16] But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
[2:17] and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;
[2:18] men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
[2:19] Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
[2:20] Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
[2:21] If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work.
[2:22] after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[2:23] But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
[2:24] And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
[2:25] in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,
[2:26] and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.
[3:1] But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
[3:2] For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
[3:3] without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
[3:4] traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
[3:5] holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.
[3:6] For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
[3:7] ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[3:8] And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
[3:9] But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
[3:10] But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
[3:11] persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
[3:12] Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[3:13] But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[3:14] But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
[3:15] And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[3:16] Every scripture inspired of God `is' also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.
[3:17] That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
[4:1] I charge `thee' in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
[4:2] preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
[4:3] For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;
[4:4] and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.
[4:5] But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.
[4:6] For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
[4:7] I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
[4:8] henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
[4:9] Give diligence to come shortly unto me:
[4:10] for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
[4:11] Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
[4:12] But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
[4:13] The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
[4:14] Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:
[4:15] of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
[4:16] At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
[4:17] But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
[4:18] The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom `be' the glory forever and ever. Amen.
[4:19] Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
[4:20] Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
[4:21] Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
[4:22] The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
