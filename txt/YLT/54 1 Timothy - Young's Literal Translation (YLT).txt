1 Timothy - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)
[1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
[1:2] to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,
[1:3] according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,
[1:4] nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --
[1:5] And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,
[1:6] from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,
[1:7] willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,
[1:8] and we have known that the law `is' good, if any one may use it lawfully;
[1:9] having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,
[1:10] whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,
[1:11] according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
[1:12] And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put `me' to the ministration,
[1:13] who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did `it' in unbelief,
[1:14] and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that `is' in Christ Jesus:
[1:15] stedfast `is' the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom I am;
[1:16] but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:
[1:17] and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, `is' honour and glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.
[1:18] This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,
[1:19] having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,
[1:20] of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil.
[2:1] I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:
[2:2] for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,
[2:3] for this `is' right and acceptable before God our Saviour,
[2:4] who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;
[2:5] for one `is' God, one also `is' mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,
[2:6] who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --
[2:7] in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.
[2:8] I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;
[2:9] in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,
[2:10] but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works.
[2:11] Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,
[2:12] and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,
[2:13] for Adam was first formed, then Eve,
[2:14] and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,
[2:15] and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
[3:1] Stedfast `is' the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;
[3:2] it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,
[3:3] not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,
[3:4] his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,
[3:5] (and if any one his own house `how' to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)
[3:6] not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;
[3:7] and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.
[3:8] Ministrants -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,
[3:9] having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,
[3:10] and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.
[3:11] Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.
[3:12] Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,
[3:13] for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that `is' in Christ Jesus.
[3:14] These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,
[3:15] and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth `thee' to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the truth,
[3:16] and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!
[4:1] And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,
[4:2] in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,
[4:3] forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,
[4:4] because every creature of God `is' good, and nothing `is' to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,
[4:5] for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.
[4:6] These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,
[4:7] and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,
[4:8] for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;
[4:9] stedfast `is' the word, and of all acceptation worthy;
[4:10] for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing.
[4:11] Charge these things, and teach;
[4:12] let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;
[4:13] till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;
[4:14] be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;
[4:15] of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;
[4:16] take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee.
[5:1] An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;
[5:2] aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all purity;
[5:3] honour widows who are really widows;
[5:4] and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.
[5:5] And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,
[5:6] and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;
[5:7] and these things charge, that they may be blameless;
[5:8] and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.
[5:9] A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,
[5:10] in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;
[5:11] and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,
[5:12] having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,
[5:13] and at the same time also, they learn `to be' idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;
[5:14] I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;
[5:15] for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.
[5:16] If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.
[5:17] The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,
[5:18] for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and `Worthy `is' the workman of his reward.'
[5:19] Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.
[5:20] Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;
[5:21] I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.
[5:22] Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;
[5:23] no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;
[5:24] of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;
[5:25] in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.
[6:1] As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;
[6:2] and those having believing masters, let them not slight `them', because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;
[6:3] if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the teaching according to piety,
[6:4] he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,
[6:5] wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;
[6:6] but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;
[6:7] for nothing did we bring into the world -- `it is' manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;
[6:8] but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves;
[6:9] and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,
[6:10] for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;
[6:11] and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;
[6:12] be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses.
[6:13] I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,
[6:14] that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[6:15] which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,
[6:16] who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom `is' honour and might age-during! Amen.
[6:17] Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; --
[6:18] to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,
[6:19] treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during.
[6:20] O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,
[6:21] which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve; the grace `is' with you. Amen.
