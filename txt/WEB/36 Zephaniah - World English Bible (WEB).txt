[1:4] I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place: the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,
[1:5] those who worship the host of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,
[1:6] those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those who haven't sought Yahweh nor inquired after him.
[1:7] Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests.

[1:15] That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,
[1:16] a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.

[2:2] before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before the day of Yahweh's anger comes on you.
[2:3] Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the land, who have kept his ordinances. Seek righteousness. Seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh's anger.

[2:6] The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
[2:7] The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God, will visit them, and restore them.
[2:8] I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
[2:9] Therefore as I live, says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.
[2:10] This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Hosts.

[2:15] This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, "I am, and there is none besides me." How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists.
[3:1] Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!
[3:2] She didn't obey the voice. She didn't receive correction. She didn't trust in Yahweh. She didn't draw near to her God.
[3:3] Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.
[3:4] Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.
[3:5] Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn't fail, but the unjust know no shame.
[3:6] I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.

[3:16] In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, "Don't be afraid, Zion. Don't let your hands be slack."
[3:17] Yahweh, your God, is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will rest in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.
[3:18] Those who are sad for the appointed feasts, I will remove from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.

[3:20] At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, says Yahweh.
