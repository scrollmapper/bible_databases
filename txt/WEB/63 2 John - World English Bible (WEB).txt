2 John - World English Bible (WEB)
[1:1] The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;
[1:2] for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:
[1:3] Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
[1:4] I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.
[1:5] Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
[1:6] This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
[1:7] For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
[1:8] Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.
[1:9] Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
[1:10] If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,
[1:11] for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.
[1:12] Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.
[1:13] The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
