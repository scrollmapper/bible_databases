Titus - World English Bible (WEB)
[1:1] Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
[1:2] in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times;
[1:3] but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
[1:4] to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
[1:5] I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;
[1:6] if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
[1:7] For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
[1:8] but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober-minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
[1:9] holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
[1:10] For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
[1:11] whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
[1:12] One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
[1:13] This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
[1:14] not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
[1:15] To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
[1:16] They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
[2:1] But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
[2:2] that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:
[2:3] and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
[2:4] that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
[2:5] to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.
[2:6] Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober-minded;
[2:7] in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
[2:8] and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.
[2:9] Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
[2:10] not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
[2:11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
[2:12] instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
[2:13] looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
[2:14] who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.
[2:15] Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
[3:1] Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
[3:2] to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
[3:3] For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
[3:4] But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
[3:5] not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
[3:6] which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
[3:7] that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[3:8] This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
[3:9] but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
[3:10] Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
[3:11] knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
[3:12] When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
[3:13] Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.
[3:14] Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
[3:15] All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
