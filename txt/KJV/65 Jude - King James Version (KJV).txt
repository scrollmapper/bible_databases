[1:12] These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
[1:13] Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
[1:14] And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

[1:24] Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
[1:25] To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
