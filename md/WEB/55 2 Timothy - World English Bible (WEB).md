# 2 Timothy - World English Bible (WEB)

**[1:1]** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,

**[1:2]** to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

**[1:3]** I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day

**[1:4]** longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;

**[1:5]** having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.

**[1:6]** For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

**[1:7]** For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.

**[1:8]** Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Gospel according to the power of God,

**[1:9]** who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,

**[1:10]** but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.

**[1:11]** For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

**[1:12]** For this cause I suffer also these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.

**[1:13]** Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

**[1:14]** That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

**[1:15]** This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

**[1:16]** May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,

**[1:17]** but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me

**[1:18]** (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

**[2:1]** You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

**[2:2]** The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.

**[2:3]** You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

**[2:4]** No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.

**[2:5]** Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.

**[2:6]** The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.

**[2:7]** Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.

**[2:8]** Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel,

**[2:9]** in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.

**[2:10]** Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

**[2:11]** This saying is faithful: For if we died with him, We will also live with him.

**[2:12]** If we endure, We will also reign with him. If we deny him, He also will deny us.

**[2:13]** If we are faithless, He remains faithful. He can't deny himself.

**[2:14]** Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.

**[2:15]** Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.

**[2:16]** But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,

**[2:17]** and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

**[2:18]** men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.

**[2:19]** However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads "Christ" instead of "the Lord"} depart from unrighteousness."

**[2:20]** Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.

**[2:21]** If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.

**[2:22]** Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

**[2:23]** But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.

**[2:24]** The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,

**[2:25]** in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,

**[2:26]** and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.

**[3:1]** But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.

**[3:2]** For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

**[3:3]** without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,

**[3:4]** traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;

**[3:5]** holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.

**[3:6]** For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,

**[3:7]** always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

**[3:8]** Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

**[3:9]** But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.

**[3:10]** But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,

**[3:11]** persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.

**[3:12]** Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

**[3:13]** But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

**[3:14]** But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.

**[3:15]** From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

**[3:16]** Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,

**[3:17]** that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

**[4:1]** I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:

**[4:2]** preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.

**[4:3]** For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;

**[4:4]** and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.

**[4:5]** But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.

**[4:6]** For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.

**[4:7]** I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.

**[4:8]** From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

**[4:9]** Be diligent to come to me soon,

**[4:10]** for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

**[4:11]** Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.

**[4:12]** But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

**[4:13]** Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.

**[4:14]** Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,

**[4:15]** of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.

**[4:16]** At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.

**[4:17]** But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

**[4:18]** And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

**[4:19]** Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.

**[4:20]** Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.

**[4:21]** Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.

**[4:22]** The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
