# Philemon - World English Bible (WEB)

**[1:1]** Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,

**[1:2]** to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:

**[1:3]** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**[1:4]** I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,

**[1:5]** hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;

**[1:6]** that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.

**[1:7]** For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

**[1:8]** Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,

**[1:9]** yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

**[1:10]** I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,{Onesimus means "useful."}

**[1:11]** who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.

**[1:12]** I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,

**[1:13]** whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Gospel.

**[1:14]** But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.

**[1:15]** For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,

**[1:16]** no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

**[1:17]** If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.

**[1:18]** But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.

**[1:19]** I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).

**[1:20]** Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.

**[1:21]** Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.

**[1:22]** Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

**[1:23]** Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,

**[1:24]** as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.

**[1:25]** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
