# 3 John - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)

**[1:1]** The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.

**[1:2]** Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

**[1:3]** For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.

**[1:4]** Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.

**[1:5]** Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;

**[1:6]** who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:

**[1:7]** because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

**[1:8]** We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.

**[1:9]** I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

**[1:10]** Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth `them' out of the church.

**[1:11]** Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.

**[1:12]** Demetrius hath the witness of all `men', and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.

**[1:13]** I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write `them' to thee with ink and pen:

**[1:14]** but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace `be' unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
