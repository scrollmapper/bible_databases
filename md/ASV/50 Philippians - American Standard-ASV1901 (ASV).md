# Philippians - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)

**[1:1]** Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

**[1:2]** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**[1:3]** I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,

**[1:4]** always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,

**[1:5]** for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;

**[1:6]** being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:

**[1:7]** even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.

**[1:8]** For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.

**[1:9]** And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;

**[1:10]** so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;

**[1:11]** being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

**[1:12]** Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things `which happened' unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;

**[1:13]** so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;

**[1:14]** and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.

**[1:15]** Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:

**[1:16]** the one `do it' of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;

**[1:17]** but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.

**[1:18]** What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

**[1:19]** For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

**[1:20]** according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but `that' with all boldness, as always, `so' now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.

**[1:21]** For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

**[1:22]** But if to live in the flesh, --`if' this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.

**[1:23]** But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:

**[1:24]** yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.

**[1:25]** And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;

**[1:26]** that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.

**[1:27]** Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;

**[1:28]** and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;

**[1:29]** because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:

**[1:30]** having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

**[2:1]** If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,

**[2:2]** make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;

**[2:3]** `doing' nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;

**[2:4]** not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.

**[2:5]** Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

**[2:6]** who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,

**[2:7]** but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;

**[2:8]** and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient `even' unto death, yea, the death of the cross.

**[2:9]** Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;

**[2:10]** that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of `things' in heaven and `things' on earth and `things' under the earth,

**[2:11]** and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

**[2:12]** So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;

**[2:13]** for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.

**[2:14]** Do all things without murmurings and questionings:

**[2:15]** that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,

**[2:16]** holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.

**[2:17]** Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:

**[2:18]** and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.

**[2:19]** But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

**[2:20]** For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.

**[2:21]** For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.

**[2:22]** But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child `serveth' a father, `so' he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.

**[2:23]** Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:

**[2:24]** but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.

**[2:25]** But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;

**[2:26]** since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:

**[2:27]** for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

**[2:28]** I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

**[2:29]** Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:

**[2:30]** because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.

**[3:1]** Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.

**[3:2]** Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:

**[3:3]** for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:

**[3:4]** though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:

**[3:5]** circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

**[3:6]** as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.

**[3:7]** Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.

**[3:8]** Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,

**[3:9]** and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, `even' that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:

**[3:10]** that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;

**[3:11]** if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.

**[3:12]** Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.

**[3:13]** Brethren, I could not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing `I do', forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,

**[3:14]** I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

**[3:15]** Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:

**[3:16]** only, whereunto we have attained, by that same `rule' let us walk.

**[3:17]** Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.

**[3:18]** For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, `that they are' the enemies of the cross of Christ:

**[3:19]** whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and `whose' glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.

**[3:20]** For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

**[3:21]** who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, `that it may be' conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.

**[4:1]** Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.

**[4:2]** I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.

**[4:3]** Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.

**[4:4]** Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.

**[4:5]** Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

**[4:6]** In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

**[4:7]** And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

**[4:8]** Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

**[4:9]** The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

**[4:10]** But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.

**[4:11]** Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.

**[4:12]** I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.

**[4:13]** I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.

**[4:14]** Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.

**[4:15]** And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;

**[4:16]** for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.

**[4:17]** Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.

**[4:18]** But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things `that came' from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

**[4:19]** And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

**[4:20]** Now unto our God and Father `be' the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

**[4:21]** Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.

**[4:22]** All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household.

**[4:23]** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
