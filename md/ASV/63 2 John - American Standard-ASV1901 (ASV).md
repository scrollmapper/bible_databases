# 2 John - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)

**[1:1]** The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;

**[1:2]** for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:

**[1:3]** Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

**[1:4]** I rejoice greatly that I have found `certain' of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.

**[1:5]** And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

**[1:6]** And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.

**[1:7]** For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, `even' they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.

**[1:8]** Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.

**[1:9]** Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.

**[1:10]** If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into `your' house, and give him no greeting:

**[1:11]** for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.

**[1:12]** Having many things to write unto you, I would not `write them' with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.

**[1:13]** The children of thine elect sister salute thee.
