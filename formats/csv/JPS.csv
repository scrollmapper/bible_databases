Genesis,1,1,IN THE beginning G-d created the heaven and the earth. 
Genesis,1,2,"Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of G-d hovered over the face of the waters. "
Genesis,1,3,And G-d said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light. 
Genesis,1,4,"And G-d saw the light, that it was good; and G-d divided the light from the darkness. "
Genesis,1,5,"And G-d called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. "
Genesis,1,6,"And G-d said: 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' "
Genesis,1,7,"And G-d made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. "
Genesis,1,8,"And G-d called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. "
Genesis,1,9,"And G-d said: 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so. "
Genesis,1,10,"And G-d called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and G-d saw that it was good. "
Genesis,1,11,"And G-d said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so. "
Genesis,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and G-d saw that it was good. "
Genesis,1,13,"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. "
Genesis,1,14,"And G-d said: 'Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; "
Genesis,1,15,and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.' And it was so. 
Genesis,1,16,"And G-d made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars. "
Genesis,1,17,"And G-d set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, "
Genesis,1,18,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and G-d saw that it was good. "
Genesis,1,19,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. "
Genesis,1,20,"And G-d said: 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.' "
Genesis,1,21,"And G-d created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and G-d saw that it was good. "
Genesis,1,22,"And G-d blessed them, saying: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.' "
Genesis,1,23,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. "
Genesis,1,24,"And G-d said: 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.' And it was so. "
Genesis,1,25,"And G-d made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and G-d saw that it was good. "
Genesis,1,26,"And G-d said: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.' "
Genesis,1,27,"And G-d created man in His own image, in the image of G-d created He him; male and female created He them. "
Genesis,1,28,"And G-d blessed them; and G-d said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.' "
Genesis,1,29,"And G-d said: 'Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed--to you it shall be for food; "
Genesis,1,30,"and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food.' And it was so. "
Genesis,1,31,"And G-d saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. "
Genesis,2,1,"And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. "
Genesis,2,2,And on the seventh day G-d finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. 
Genesis,2,3,"And G-d blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which G-d in creating had made. "
Genesis,2,4,"These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that HaShem G-d made earth and heaven. "
Genesis,2,5,"No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for HaShem G-d had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground; "
Genesis,2,6,"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. "
Genesis,2,7,"Then HaShem G-d formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. "
Genesis,2,8,"And HaShem G-d planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. "
Genesis,2,9,"And out of the ground made HaShem G-d to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "
Genesis,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. "
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; "
Genesis,2,12,and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 
Genesis,2,13,And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. 
Genesis,2,14,And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 
Genesis,2,15,"And HaShem G-d took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. "
Genesis,2,16,"And HaShem G-d commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; "
Genesis,2,17,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.' "
Genesis,2,18,And HaShem G-d said: 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.' 
Genesis,2,19,"And out of the ground HaShem G-d formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. "
Genesis,2,20,"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. "
Genesis,2,21,"And HaShem G-d caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. "
Genesis,2,22,"And the rib, which HaShem G-d had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. "
Genesis,2,23,"And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.' "
Genesis,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. "
Genesis,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.  "
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which HaShem G-d had made. And he said unto the woman: 'Yea, hath G-d said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?' "
Genesis,3,2,And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 
Genesis,3,3,"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, G-d hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.' "
Genesis,3,4,And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die; 
Genesis,3,5,"for G-d doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as G-d, knowing good and evil.' "
Genesis,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. "
Genesis,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles. "
Genesis,3,8,And they heard the voice of HaShem G-d walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of HaShem G-d amongst the trees of the garden. 
Genesis,3,9,"And HaShem G-d called unto the man, and said unto him: 'Where art thou?' "
Genesis,3,10,"And he said: 'I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.' "
Genesis,3,11,"And He said: 'Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?' "
Genesis,3,12,"And the man said: 'The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.' "
Genesis,3,13,"And HaShem G-d said unto the woman: 'What is this thou hast done?' And the woman said: 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.' "
Genesis,3,14,"And HaShem G-d said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. "
Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.' "
Genesis,3,16,"Unto the woman He said: 'I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.' "
Genesis,3,17,"And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. "
Genesis,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. 
Genesis,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.' "
Genesis,3,20,And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 
Genesis,3,21,"And HaShem G-d made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. "
Genesis,3,22,"And HaShem G-d said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.' "
Genesis,3,23,"Therefore HaShem G-d sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. "
Genesis,3,24,"So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.  "
Genesis,4,1,"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said: 'I have gotten a man with the help of HaShem.' "
Genesis,4,2,"And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. "
Genesis,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto HaShem. "
Genesis,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And HaShem had respect unto Abel and to his offering; "
Genesis,4,5,"but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. "
Genesis,4,6,And HaShem said unto Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 
Genesis,4,7,"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.' "
Genesis,4,8,"And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. "
Genesis,4,9,And HaShem said unto Cain: 'Where is Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?' 
Genesis,4,10,And He said: 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground. 
Genesis,4,11,"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. "
Genesis,4,12,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.' "
Genesis,4,13,And Cain said unto HaShem: 'My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.' "
Genesis,4,15,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And HaShem set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him. "
Genesis,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of HaShem, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. "
Genesis,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. "
Genesis,4,18,And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech. 
Genesis,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. "
Genesis,4,20,And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. 
Genesis,4,21,And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. 
Genesis,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. "
Genesis,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me; "
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. "
Genesis,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: 'for G-d hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.' "
Genesis,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of HaShem.  "
Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that G-d created man, in the likeness of G-d made He him; "
Genesis,5,2,"male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. "
Genesis,5,3,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth. "
Genesis,5,4,And the days of Adam after he begot Seth were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters. 
Genesis,5,5,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,6,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh. "
Genesis,5,7,"And Seth lived after he begot Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,8,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,9,"And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Kenan. "
Genesis,5,10,"And Enosh lived after he begot Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,11,And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,12,"And Kenan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel. "
Genesis,5,13,"And Kenan lived after he begot Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,14,And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,15,"And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begot Jared. "
Genesis,5,16,"And Mahalalel lived after he begot Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,17,And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,18,"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begot Enoch. "
Genesis,5,19,"And Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,20,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,21,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begot Methuselah. "
Genesis,5,22,"And Enoch walked with G-d after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,23,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years. 
Genesis,5,24,"And Enoch walked with G-d, and he was not; for G-d took him. "
Genesis,5,25,"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begot Lamech. "
Genesis,5,26,"And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,27,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,28,"And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begot a son. "
Genesis,5,29,"And he called his name Noah, saying: 'This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh from the ground which HaShem hath cursed.' "
Genesis,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,5,31,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died. 
Genesis,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  "
Genesis,6,1,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, "
Genesis,6,2,"that the sons of G-d saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives, whomsoever they chose. "
Genesis,6,3,"And HaShem said: 'My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.' "
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of G-d came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown. "
Genesis,6,5,"And HaShem saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. "
Genesis,6,6,"And it repented HaShem that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. "
Genesis,6,7,"And HaShem said: 'I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and creeping thing, and fowl of the air; for it repenteth Me that I have made them.' "
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found grace in the eyes of HaShem. 
Genesis,6,9,These are the generations of Noah. Noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with G-d. 
Genesis,6,10,"And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. "
Genesis,6,11,"And the earth was corrupt before G-d, and the earth was filled with violence. "
Genesis,6,12,"And G-d saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. "
Genesis,6,13,"And G-d said unto Noah: 'The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. "
Genesis,6,14,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; with rooms shalt thou make the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. "
Genesis,6,15,"And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. "
Genesis,6,16,"A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. "
Genesis,6,17,"And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall perish. "
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. "
Genesis,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. "
Genesis,6,20,"Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. "
Genesis,6,21,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.' "
Genesis,6,22,"Thus did Noah; according to all that G-d commanded him, so did he. "
Genesis,7,1,And HaShem said unto Noah: 'Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation. 
Genesis,7,2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, each with his mate; and of the beasts that are not clean two and two, each with his mate; "
Genesis,7,3,"of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. "
Genesis,7,4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I blot out from off the face of the earth.' "
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did according unto all that HaShem commanded him. 
Genesis,7,6,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 
Genesis,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. "
Genesis,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground, "
Genesis,7,9,"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as G-d commanded Noah. "
Genesis,7,10,"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. "
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. "
Genesis,7,12,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
Genesis,7,13,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; "
Genesis,7,14,"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort. "
Genesis,7,15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. "
Genesis,7,16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as G-d commanded him; and HaShem shut him in. "
Genesis,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. "
Genesis,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. "
Genesis,7,19,And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. 
Genesis,7,20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
Genesis,7,21,"And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth, and every man; "
Genesis,7,22,"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, whatsoever was in the dry land, died. "
Genesis,7,23,"And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; and they were blotted out from the earth; and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. "
Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days. 
Genesis,8,1,"And G-d remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and G-d made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; "
Genesis,8,2,"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. "
Genesis,8,3,And the waters returned from off the earth continually; and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. 
Genesis,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. "
Genesis,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. "
Genesis,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. "
Genesis,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. "
Genesis,8,8,"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. "
Genesis,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth; and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. "
Genesis,8,10,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 
Genesis,8,11,And the dove came in to him at eventide; and lo in her mouth an olive-leaf freshly plucked; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
Genesis,8,12,And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more. 
Genesis,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dried. "
Genesis,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry. "
Genesis,8,15,"And G-d spoke unto Noah, saying: "
Genesis,8,16,"'Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. "
Genesis,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may swarm in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.' "
Genesis,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him; "
Genesis,8,19,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families; went forth out of the ark. "
Genesis,8,20,"And Noah builded an altar unto HaShem; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. "
Genesis,8,21,"And HaShem smelled the sweet savour; and HaShem said in His heart: 'I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. "
Genesis,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.' "
Genesis,9,1,"And G-d blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth. "
Genesis,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they delivered. "
Genesis,9,3,Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. 
Genesis,9,4,"Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. "
Genesis,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. "
Genesis,9,6,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of G-d made He man. "
Genesis,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; swarm in the earth, and multiply therein.' "
Genesis,9,8,"And G-d spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying: "
Genesis,9,9,"'As for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you; "
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. "
Genesis,9,11,And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.' 
Genesis,9,12,"And G-d said: 'This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: "
Genesis,9,13,"I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth. "
Genesis,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud, "
Genesis,9,15,"that I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. "
Genesis,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between G-d and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.' "
Genesis,9,17,And G-d said unto Noah: 'This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.' 
Genesis,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. "
Genesis,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah, and of these was the whole earth overspread. "
Genesis,9,20,"And Noah the husbandman began, and planted a vineyard. "
Genesis,9,21,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. "
Genesis,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. "
Genesis,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. "
Genesis,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. "
Genesis,9,25,And he said: Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 
Genesis,9,26,"And he said: Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Shem; and let Canaan be their servant. "
Genesis,9,27,"G-d enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be their servant. "
Genesis,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
Genesis,9,29,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.  
Genesis,10,1,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood. "
Genesis,10,2,"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. "
Genesis,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. "
Genesis,10,4,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. "
Genesis,10,5,"Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. "
Genesis,10,6,"And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. "
Genesis,10,7,"And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. "
Genesis,10,8,And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
Genesis,10,9,He was a mighty hunter before HaShem; wherefore it is said: 'Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before HaShem.' 
Genesis,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. "
Genesis,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, "
Genesis,10,12,and Resen between Nineveh and Calah--the same is the great city. 
Genesis,10,13,"And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, "
Genesis,10,14,"and Pathrusim, and Casluhim--whence went forth the Philistines--and Caphtorim. "
Genesis,10,15,"And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; "
Genesis,10,16,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; "
Genesis,10,17,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; "
Genesis,10,18,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. "
Genesis,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. "
Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. "
Genesis,10,21,"And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. "
Genesis,10,22,"The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. "
Genesis,10,23,"And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. "
Genesis,10,24,And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber. 
Genesis,10,25,And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
Genesis,10,26,"And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; "
Genesis,10,27,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; "
Genesis,10,28,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; "
Genesis,10,29,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. "
Genesis,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east. "
Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. "
Genesis,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.  "
Genesis,11,1,And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
Genesis,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. "
Genesis,11,3,"And they said one to another: 'Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.' And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. "
Genesis,11,4,"And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' "
Genesis,11,5,"And HaShem came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. "
Genesis,11,6,"And HaShem said: 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. "
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' "
Genesis,11,8,So HaShem scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. 
Genesis,11,9,Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because HaShem did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did HaShem scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 
Genesis,11,10,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood. "
Genesis,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,12,"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah. "
Genesis,11,13,"And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,14,"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. "
Genesis,11,15,"And Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg. "
Genesis,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. "
Genesis,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug. "
Genesis,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. "
Genesis,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah. "
Genesis,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters. "
Genesis,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. "
Genesis,11,27,"Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. "
Genesis,11,28,"And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. "
Genesis,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. "
Genesis,11,30,And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
Genesis,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. "
Genesis,11,32,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.  
Genesis,12,1,"Now HaShem said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee. "
Genesis,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing. "
Genesis,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' "
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram went, as HaShem had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. "
Genesis,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. "
Genesis,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. "
Genesis,12,7,"And HaShem appeared unto Abram, and said: 'Unto thy seed will I give this land'; and he builded there an altar unto HaShem, who appeared unto him. "
Genesis,12,8,"And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto HaShem, and called upon the name of HaShem. "
Genesis,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. "
Genesis,12,10,And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. 
Genesis,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: 'Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon. "
Genesis,12,12,"And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive. "
Genesis,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.' "
Genesis,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. "
Genesis,12,15,"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. "
Genesis,12,16,"And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. "
Genesis,12,17,And HaShem plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
Genesis,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: 'What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? "
Genesis,12,19,"Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.' "
Genesis,12,20,"And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had. "
Genesis,13,1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. "
Genesis,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. "
Genesis,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai; "
Genesis,13,4,"unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first; and Abram called there on the name of HaShem. "
Genesis,13,5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. "
Genesis,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. "
Genesis,13,7,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. 
Genesis,13,8,"And Abram said unto Lot: 'Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren. "
Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.' "
Genesis,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before HaShem destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of HaShem, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar. "
Genesis,13,11,So Lot chose him all the plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
Genesis,13,12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. "
Genesis,13,13,Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against HaShem exceedingly. 
Genesis,13,14,"And HaShem said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him: 'Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward; "
Genesis,13,15,"for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. "
Genesis,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. "
Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.' "
Genesis,13,18,"And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto HaShem. "
Genesis,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, "
Genesis,14,2,"that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar. "
Genesis,14,3,All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim--the same is the Salt Sea. 
Genesis,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. "
Genesis,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, "
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. "
Genesis,14,7,"And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat--the same is Kadesh--and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. "
Genesis,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim; "
Genesis,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. "
Genesis,14,10,"Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. "
Genesis,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. "
Genesis,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. "
Genesis,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew--now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. "
Genesis,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. "
Genesis,14,15,"And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. "
Genesis,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. "
Genesis,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh--the same is the King's Vale. "
Genesis,14,18,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of G-d the Most High. 
Genesis,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said: 'Blessed be Abram of G-d Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; "
Genesis,14,20,"and blessed be G-d the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth of all. "
Genesis,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: 'Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.' "
Genesis,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto HaShem, G-d Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, "
Genesis,14,23,"that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich; "
Genesis,14,24,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.' "
Genesis,15,1,"After these things the word of HaShem came unto Abram in a vision, saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.' "
Genesis,15,2,"And Abram said: 'O L-rd GOD, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?' "
Genesis,15,3,"And Abram said: 'Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in my house is to be mine heir.' "
Genesis,15,4,"And, behold, the word of HaShem came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.' "
Genesis,15,5,"And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.' "
Genesis,15,6,And he believed in HaShem; and He counted it to him for righteousness. 
Genesis,15,7,"And He said unto him: 'I am HaShem that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.' "
Genesis,15,8,"And he said: 'O L-rd GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?' "
Genesis,15,9,"And He said unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' "
Genesis,15,10,"And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds divided he not. "
Genesis,15,11,"And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. "
Genesis,15,12,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. "
Genesis,15,13,"And He said unto Abram: 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; "
Genesis,15,14,"and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance. "
Genesis,15,15,But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
Genesis,15,16,And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.' 
Genesis,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. "
Genesis,15,18,"In that day HaShem made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; "
Genesis,15,19,"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, "
Genesis,15,20,"and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, "
Genesis,15,21,"and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.' "
Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. "
Genesis,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Abram: 'Behold now, HaShem hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall be builded up through her.' And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. "
Genesis,16,3,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. "
Genesis,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. "
Genesis,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Abram: 'My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: HaShem judge between me and thee.' "
Genesis,16,6,"But Abram said unto Sarai: 'Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes.' And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face. "
Genesis,16,7,"And the angel of HaShem found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. "
Genesis,16,8,"And he said: 'Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?' And she said: 'I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.' "
Genesis,16,9,"And the angel of HaShem said unto her: 'Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.' "
Genesis,16,10,"And the angel of HaShem said unto her: 'I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. "
Genesis,16,11,"And the angel of HaShem said unto her: 'Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because HaShem hath heard thy affliction. "
Genesis,16,12,"And he shall be a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.' "
Genesis,16,13,"And she called the name of HaShem that spoke unto her, Thou art a G-d of seeing; for she said: 'Have I even here seen Him that seeth Me?' "
Genesis,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called 'Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. "
Genesis,16,15,"And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. "
Genesis,16,16,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.  "
Genesis,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, HaShem appeared to Abram, and said unto him: 'I am G-d Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou wholehearted. "
Genesis,17,2,"And I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.' "
Genesis,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face; and G-d talked with him, saying: "
Genesis,17,4,"'As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations. "
Genesis,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. "
Genesis,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. "
Genesis,17,7,"And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a G-d unto thee and to thy seed after thee. "
Genesis,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their G-d.' "
Genesis,17,9,"And G-d said unto Abraham: 'And as for thee, thou shalt keep My covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations. "
Genesis,17,10,"This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. "
Genesis,17,11,And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. 
Genesis,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. "
Genesis,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. "
Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.' "
Genesis,17,15,"And G-d said unto Abraham: 'As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. "
Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her; yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.' "
Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart: 'Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?' "
Genesis,17,18,And Abraham said unto G-d: 'Oh that Ishmael might live before Thee!' 
Genesis,17,19,"And G-d said: ''Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. "
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. "
Genesis,17,21,"But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.' "
Genesis,17,22,"And He left off talking with him, and G-d went up from Abraham. "
Genesis,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as G-d had said unto him. "
Genesis,17,24,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. "
Genesis,17,25,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. "
Genesis,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. "
Genesis,17,27,"And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.  "
Genesis,18,1,"And HaShem appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; "
Genesis,18,2,"and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed down to the earth, "
Genesis,18,3,"and said: 'My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant. "
Genesis,18,4,"Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and recline yourselves under the tree. "
Genesis,18,5,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on; forasmuch as ye are come to your servant.' And they said: 'So do, as thou hast said.' "
Genesis,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: 'Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.' "
Genesis,18,7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hastened to dress it. "
Genesis,18,8,"And he took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. "
Genesis,18,9,"And they said unto him: 'Where is Sarah thy wife?' And he said: 'Behold, in the tent.' "
Genesis,18,10,"And He said: 'I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.' And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.-- "
Genesis,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.-- "
Genesis,18,12,"And Sarah laughed within herself, saying: 'After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?' "
Genesis,18,13,"And HaShem said unto Abraham: 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? "
Genesis,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for HaShem. At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.' "
Genesis,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying: 'I laughed not'; for she was afraid. And He said: 'Nay; but thou didst laugh.' "
Genesis,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked out toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. "
Genesis,18,17,And HaShem said: 'Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing; 
Genesis,18,18,"seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? "
Genesis,18,19,"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of HaShem, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that HaShem may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.' "
Genesis,18,20,"And HaShem said: 'Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and, verily, their sin is exceeding grievous. "
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know.' "
Genesis,18,22,"And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before HaShem. "
Genesis,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said: 'Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? "
Genesis,18,24,Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou indeed sweep away and not forgive the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
Genesis,18,25,"That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the judge of all the earth do justly?' "
Genesis,18,26,"And HaShem said: 'If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sake.' "
Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said: 'Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the L-rd, who am but dust and ashes. "
Genesis,18,28,"Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five?' And He said: 'I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.' "
Genesis,18,29,"And he spoke unto Him yet again, and said: 'Peradventure there shall be forty found there.' And He said: 'I will not do it for the forty's sake.' "
Genesis,18,30,"And he said: 'Oh, let not the L-rd be angry, and I will speak. Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.' And He said: 'I will not do it, if I find thirty there.' "
Genesis,18,31,"And he said: 'Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the L-rd. Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.' And He said: 'I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.' "
Genesis,18,32,"And he said: 'Oh, let not the L-rd be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten shall be found there.' And He said: 'I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.' "
Genesis,18,33,"And HaShem went His way, as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place. "
Genesis,19,1,"And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he fell down on his face to the earth; "
Genesis,19,2,"and he said: 'Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way.' And they said: 'Nay; but we will abide in the broad place all night.' "
Genesis,19,3,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. "
Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. "
Genesis,19,5,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him: 'Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.' "
Genesis,19,6,"And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him. "
Genesis,19,7,"And he said: 'I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly. "
Genesis,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do nothing; forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.' "
Genesis,19,9,"And they said: 'Stand back.' And they said: 'This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs play the judge; now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.' And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door. "
Genesis,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and the door they shut. "
Genesis,19,11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great; so that they wearied themselves to find the door. "
Genesis,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot: 'Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city; bring them out of the place; "
Genesis,19,13,"for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before HaShem; and HaShem hath sent us to destroy it.' "
Genesis,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said: 'Up, get you out of this place; for HaShem will destroy the city.' But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that jested. "
Genesis,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying: 'Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here; lest thou be swept away in the iniquity of the city.' "
Genesis,19,16,"But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; HaShem being merciful unto him. And they brought him forth, and set him without the city. "
Genesis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said: 'Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be swept away.' "
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot said unto them: 'Oh, not so, my lord; "
Genesis,19,19,"behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the evil overtake me, and I die. "
Genesis,19,20,"Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one; oh, let me escape thither--is it not a little one? --and my soul shall live.' "
Genesis,19,21,"And he said unto him: 'See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. "
Genesis,19,22,"Hasten thou, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.' --Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.--"
Genesis,19,23,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar. 
Genesis,19,24,Then HaShem caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from HaShem out of heaven; 
Genesis,19,25,"and He overthrow those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. "
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. "
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before HaShem. 
Genesis,19,28,"And he looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. "
Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when G-d destroyed the cities of the Plain, that G-d remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt. "
Genesis,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. "
Genesis,19,31,"And the first-born said unto the younger: 'Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth. "
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.' "
Genesis,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night. And the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. "
Genesis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger: 'Behold, I lay yesternight with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.' "
Genesis,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. "
Genesis,19,36,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
Genesis,19,37,"And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab--the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. "
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi--the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. "
Genesis,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. "
Genesis,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: 'She is my sister.' And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. "
Genesis,20,3,"But G-d came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him: 'Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.' "
Genesis,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said: 'L-rd, wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation? "
Genesis,20,5,"Said he not himself unto me: She is my sister? and she, even she herself said: He is my brother. In the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.' "
Genesis,20,6,"And G-d said unto him in the dream: 'Yea, I know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. "
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.' "
Genesis,20,8,"And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore afraid. "
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him: 'What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.' "
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?' "
Genesis,20,11,And Abraham said: 'Because I thought: Surely the fear of G-d is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
Genesis,20,12,"And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife. "
Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when G-d caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her: This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me: He is my brother.' "
Genesis,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. "
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech said: 'Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.' "
Genesis,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said: 'Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and before all men thou art righted.' "
Genesis,20,17,"And Abraham prayed unto G-d; and G-d healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children. "
Genesis,20,18,"For HaShem had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. "
Genesis,21,1,"And HaShem remembered Sarah as He had said, and HaShem did unto Sarah as He had spoken. "
Genesis,21,2,"And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which G-d had spoken to him. "
Genesis,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. "
Genesis,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as G-d had commanded him. "
Genesis,21,5,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. "
Genesis,21,6,And Sarah said: 'G-d hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh on account of me.' 
Genesis,21,7,"And she said: 'Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.' "
Genesis,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. "
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport. "
Genesis,21,10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.' "
Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 
Genesis,21,12,"And G-d said unto Abraham: 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. "
Genesis,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.' "
Genesis,21,14,"And Abraham arose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. "
Genesis,21,15,"And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. "
Genesis,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow-shot; for she said: 'Let me not look upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. "
Genesis,21,17,"And G-d heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of G-d called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her: 'What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for G-d hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. "
Genesis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.' "
Genesis,21,19,"And G-d opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. "
Genesis,21,20,"And G-d was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. "
Genesis,21,21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
Genesis,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying: 'G-d is with thee in all that thou doest. "
Genesis,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by G-d that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.' "
Genesis,21,24,And Abraham said: 'I will swear.' 
Genesis,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. "
Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech said: 'I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.' "
Genesis,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. "
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. 
Genesis,21,29,And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?' 
Genesis,21,30,"And he said: 'Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.' "
Genesis,21,31,Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there they swore both of them. 
Genesis,21,32,"So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. "
Genesis,21,33,"And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of HaShem, the Everlasting G-d. "
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. 
Genesis,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that G-d did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said: 'Here am I.' "
Genesis,22,2,"And He said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.' "
Genesis,22,3,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which G-d had told him. "
Genesis,22,4,"On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. "
Genesis,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.' "
Genesis,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. "
Genesis,22,7,"And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?' "
Genesis,22,8,"And Abraham said: 'G-d will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together. "
Genesis,22,9,"And they came to the place which G-d had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. "
Genesis,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. "
Genesis,22,11,"And the angel of HaShem called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.' "
Genesis,22,12,"And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a G-d-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' "
Genesis,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. "
Genesis,22,14,And Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where HaShem is seen.' 
Genesis,22,15,"And the angel of HaShem called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, "
Genesis,22,16,"and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith HaShem, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, "
Genesis,22,17,"that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; "
Genesis,22,18,and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.' 
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. "
Genesis,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor: "
Genesis,22,21,"Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; "
Genesis,22,22,"and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' "
Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. "
Genesis,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.  "
Genesis,23,1,And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
Genesis,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kiriatharba--the same is Hebron--in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. "
Genesis,23,3,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke unto the children of Heth, saying: "
Genesis,23,4,"'I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.' "
Genesis,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: "
Genesis,23,6,"'Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us; in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.' "
Genesis,23,7,"And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. "
Genesis,23,8,"And he spoke with them, saying: 'If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, "
Genesis,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.' "
Genesis,23,10,"Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying: "
Genesis,23,11,"'Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee; bury thy dead.' "
Genesis,23,12,And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. 
Genesis,23,13,"And he spoke unto Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: 'But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.' "
Genesis,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him: "
Genesis,23,15,"'My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.' "
Genesis,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. "
Genesis,23,17,"So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure "
Genesis,23,18,"unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. "
Genesis,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre--the same is Hebron--in the land of Canaan. "
Genesis,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth. "
Genesis,24,1,"And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; and HaShem had blessed Abraham in all things. "
Genesis,24,2,"And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had: 'Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh. "
Genesis,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by HaShem, the G-d of heaven and the G-d of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell. "
Genesis,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son, even for Isaac.' "
Genesis,24,5,And the servant said unto him: 'Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land; must I needs bring thy son back unto the land from whence thou camest?' 
Genesis,24,6,And Abraham said unto him: 'Beware thou that thou bring not my son back thither. 
Genesis,24,7,"HaShem, the G-d of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying: Unto thy seed will I give this land; He will send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence. "
Genesis,24,8,"And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son back thither.' "
Genesis,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. "
Genesis,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; having all goodly things of his master's in his hand; and he arose, and went to Aram-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor. "
Genesis,24,11,"And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. "
Genesis,24,12,"And he said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of my master Abraham, send me, I pray Thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham. "
Genesis,24,13,"Behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water. "
Genesis,24,14,"So let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; let the same be she that Thou hast appointed for Thy servant, even for Isaac; and thereby shall I know that Thou hast shown kindness unto my master.' "
Genesis,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. "
Genesis,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up. "
Genesis,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said: 'Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher.' "
Genesis,24,18,"And she said: 'Drink, my lord'; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. "
Genesis,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said: 'I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.' "
Genesis,24,20,"And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. "
Genesis,24,21,"And the man looked stedfastly on her; holding his peace, to know whether HaShem had made his journey prosperous or not. "
Genesis,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; "
Genesis,24,23,"and said: 'Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?' "
Genesis,24,24,"And she said unto him: 'I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nahor.' "
Genesis,24,25,"She said moreover unto him: 'We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.' "
Genesis,24,26,"And the man bowed his head, and prostrated himself before HaShem. "
Genesis,24,27,"And he said: 'Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master; as for me, HaShem hath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren.' "
Genesis,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words. "
Genesis,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain. "
Genesis,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying: 'Thus spoke the man unto me,' that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain. "
Genesis,24,31,"And he said: 'Come in, thou blessed of HaShem; wherefore standest thou without? for I have cleared the house, and made room for the camels.' "
Genesis,24,32,"And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him. "
Genesis,24,33,"And there was set food before him to eat; but he said: 'I will not eat, until I have told mine errand.' And he said: 'Speak on.' "
Genesis,24,34,And he said: 'I am Abraham's servant. 
Genesis,24,35,"And HaShem hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great; and He hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses. "
Genesis,24,36,And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
Genesis,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell. "
Genesis,24,38,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son. "
Genesis,24,39,And I said unto my master: Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 
Genesis,24,40,"And he said unto me: HaShem, before whom I walk, will send His angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house; "
Genesis,24,41,"then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath. "
Genesis,24,42,"And I came this day unto the fountain, and said: O HaShem, the G-d of my master Abraham, if now Thou do prosper my way which I go: "
Genesis,24,43,"behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say: Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink; "
Genesis,24,44,"and she shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels; let the same be the woman whom HaShem hath appointed for my master's son. "
Genesis,24,45,"And before I had done speaking to my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her: Let me drink, I pray thee. "
Genesis,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also. "
Genesis,24,47,"And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. "
Genesis,24,48,"And I bowed my head, and prostrated myself before HaShem, and blessed HaShem, the G-d of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son. "
Genesis,24,49,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.' "
Genesis,24,50,Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: 'The thing proceedeth from HaShem; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 
Genesis,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as HaShem hath spoken.' "
Genesis,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto HaShem. "
Genesis,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. "
Genesis,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said: 'Send me away unto my master.' "
Genesis,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said: 'Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.' "
Genesis,24,56,"And he said unto them: 'Delay me not, seeing HaShem hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.' "
Genesis,24,57,"And they said: 'We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.' "
Genesis,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her: 'Wilt thou go with this man?' And she said: 'I will go.' "
Genesis,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. "
Genesis,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her: 'Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.' "
Genesis,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. "
Genesis,24,62,And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South. 
Genesis,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. "
Genesis,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel. "
Genesis,24,65,"And she said unto the servant: 'What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?' And the servant said: 'It is my master.' And she took her veil, and covered herself. "
Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
Genesis,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted for his mother.  "
Genesis,25,1,"And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. "
Genesis,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. "
Genesis,25,3,"And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. "
Genesis,25,4,"And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. "
Genesis,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
Genesis,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. "
Genesis,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. "
Genesis,25,8,"And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. "
Genesis,25,9,"And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; "
Genesis,25,10,"the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. "
Genesis,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that G-d blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. "
Genesis,25,12,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham. "
Genesis,25,13,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, "
Genesis,25,14,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; "
Genesis,25,15,"Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem; "
Genesis,25,16,"these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. "
Genesis,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people. "
Genesis,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle. "
Genesis,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac. "
Genesis,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. "
Genesis,25,21,"And Isaac entreated HaShem for his wife, because she was barren; and HaShem let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. "
Genesis,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of HaShem. "
Genesis,25,23,"And HaShem said unto her: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. "
Genesis,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. "
Genesis,25,25,"And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. "
Genesis,25,26,"And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them. "
Genesis,25,27,"And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. "
Genesis,25,28,"Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. "
Genesis,25,29,"And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint. "
Genesis,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called Edom. "
Genesis,25,31,And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birth right.' 
Genesis,25,32,"And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?' "
Genesis,25,33,And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
Genesis,25,34,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.  "
Genesis,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. "
Genesis,26,2,"And HaShem appeared unto him, and said: 'Go not down unto Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. "
Genesis,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father; "
Genesis,26,4,"and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves; "
Genesis,26,5,"because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.' "
Genesis,26,6,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 
Genesis,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said: 'She is my sister'; for he feared to say: 'My wife'; 'lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is fair to look upon.' "
Genesis,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. "
Genesis,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said: 'Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou: She is my sister?' And Isaac said unto him: 'Because I said: Lest I die because of her.' "
Genesis,26,10,"And Abimelech said: 'What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.' "
Genesis,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all the people, saying: 'He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.' "
Genesis,26,12,"And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundred-fold; and HaShem blessed him. "
Genesis,26,13,"And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great. "
Genesis,26,14,"And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines envied him. "
Genesis,26,15,"Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. "
Genesis,26,16,And Abimelech said unto Isaac: 'Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.' 
Genesis,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. "
Genesis,26,18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. "
Genesis,26,19,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water. "
Genesis,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdmen, saying: 'The water is ours.' And he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him. "
Genesis,26,21,"And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah. "
Genesis,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now HaShem hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.' "
Genesis,26,23,And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 
Genesis,26,24,"And HaShem appeared unto him the same night, and said: 'I am the G-d of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham's sake.' "
Genesis,26,25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of HaShem, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants digged a well. "
Genesis,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. "
Genesis,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them: 'Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?' "
Genesis,26,28,"And they said: 'We saw plainly that HaShem was with thee; and we said: Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; "
Genesis,26,29,"that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of HaShem.' "
Genesis,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. "
Genesis,26,31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. "
Genesis,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him: 'We have found water.' "
Genesis,26,33,And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day. 
Genesis,26,34,"And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. "
Genesis,26,35,And they were a bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah.  
Genesis,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him: 'My son'; and he said unto him: 'Here am I.' "
Genesis,27,2,"And he said: 'Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death. "
Genesis,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison; "
Genesis,27,4,"and make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.' "
Genesis,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. "
Genesis,27,6,"And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying: 'Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying: "
Genesis,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before HaShem before my death. "
Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice according to that which I command thee. "
Genesis,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury food for thy father, such as he loveth; "
Genesis,27,10,"and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.' "
Genesis,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother: 'Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. "
Genesis,27,12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.' "
Genesis,27,13,"And his mother said unto him: 'Upon me be thy curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.' "
Genesis,27,14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved. "
Genesis,27,15,"And Rebekah took the choicest garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son. "
Genesis,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck. "
Genesis,27,17,"And she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. "
Genesis,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said: 'My father'; and he said: 'Here am I; who art thou, my son?' "
Genesis,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father: 'I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.' "
Genesis,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son: 'How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?' And he said: 'Because HaShem thy G-d sent me good speed.' "
Genesis,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob: 'Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.' "
Genesis,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.' "
Genesis,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him. "
Genesis,27,24,And he said: 'Art thou my very son Esau?' And he said: 'I am.' 
Genesis,27,25,"And he said: 'Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee.' And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank. "
Genesis,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him: 'Come near now, and kiss me, my son.' "
Genesis,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which HaShem hath blessed. "
Genesis,27,28,"So G-d give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fat places of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine. "
Genesis,27,29,"Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth thee. "
Genesis,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. "
Genesis,27,31,"And he also made savoury food, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his father: 'Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.' "
Genesis,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him: 'Who art thou?' And he said: 'I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.' "
Genesis,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said: 'Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.' "
Genesis,27,34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father: 'Bless me, even me also, O my father.' "
Genesis,27,35,"And he said: 'Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.' "
Genesis,27,36,"And he said: 'Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.' And he said: 'Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?' "
Genesis,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau: 'Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him; and what then shall I do for thee, my son?' "
Genesis,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father: 'Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.' And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. "
Genesis,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him: Behold, of the fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above; "
Genesis,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose, that thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck. "
Genesis,27,41,And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart: 'Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.' 
Genesis,27,42,"And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him: 'Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. "
Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; "
Genesis,27,44,"and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; "
Genesis,27,45,"until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and fetch thee from thence; why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?' "
Genesis,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac: 'I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?' "
Genesis,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. "
Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. "
Genesis,28,3,"And G-d Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a congregation of peoples; "
Genesis,28,4,"and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which G-d gave unto Abraham.' "
Genesis,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. "
Genesis,28,6,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan'; "
Genesis,28,7,"and that Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram; "
Genesis,28,8,and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 
Genesis,28,9,"so Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife. "
Genesis,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. "
Genesis,28,11,"And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. "
Genesis,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of G-d ascending and descending on it. "
Genesis,28,13,"And, behold, HaShem stood beside him, and said: 'I am HaShem, the G-d of Abraham thy father, and the G-d of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. "
Genesis,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. "
Genesis,28,15,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.' "
Genesis,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said: 'Surely HaShem is in this place; and I knew it not.' "
Genesis,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said: 'How full of awe is this place! this is none other than the house of G-d, and this is the gate of heaven.' "
Genesis,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. "
Genesis,28,19,"And he called the name of that place Beth-el, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. "
Genesis,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: 'If G-d will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, "
Genesis,28,21,"so that I come back to my father's house in peace, then shall HaShem be my G-d, "
Genesis,28,22,"and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be G-d's house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.'  "
Genesis,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. "
Genesis,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. --For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great. "
Genesis,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back upon the well's mouth in its place.-- "
Genesis,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them: 'My brethren, whence are ye?' And they said: 'Of Haran are we.' "
Genesis,29,5,And he said unto them: 'Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?' And they said: 'We know him.' 
Genesis,29,6,"And he said unto them: 'Is it well with him?' And they said: 'It is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.' "
Genesis,29,7,"And he said: 'Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.' "
Genesis,29,8,"And they said: 'We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.' "
Genesis,29,9,"While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she tended them. "
Genesis,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. "
Genesis,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. "
Genesis,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father. "
Genesis,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. "
Genesis,29,14,And Laban said to him: 'Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month. 
Genesis,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob: 'Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?' "
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. "
Genesis,29,17,And Leah's eyes were weak; but Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon. 
Genesis,29,18,And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said: 'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.' 
Genesis,29,19,"And Laban said: 'It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.' "
Genesis,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. "
Genesis,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban: 'Give me my wife, for my days are filled, that I may go in unto her.' "
Genesis,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. "
Genesis,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. "
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. 
Genesis,29,25,"And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah; and he said to Laban: 'What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?' "
Genesis,29,26,"And Laban said: 'It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born. "
Genesis,29,27,"Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.' "
Genesis,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife. "
Genesis,29,29,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. 
Genesis,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. "
Genesis,29,31,"And HaShem saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. "
Genesis,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said: 'Because HaShem hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.' "
Genesis,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Because HaShem hath heard that I am hated, He hath therefore given me this son also.' And she called his name Simeon. "
Genesis,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons.' Therefore was his name called Levi. "
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said: 'This time will I praise HaShem.' Therefore she called his name Judah;Heb. and she left off bearing.  "
Genesis,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob: 'Give me children, or else I die.' "
Genesis,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said: 'Am I in G-d's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?' "
Genesis,30,3,"And she said: 'Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may be builded up through her.' "
Genesis,30,4,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife; and Jacob went in unto her. 
Genesis,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. "
Genesis,30,6,"And Rachel said: 'G-d hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son.' Therefore called she his name Dan. "
Genesis,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. "
Genesis,30,8,"And Rachel said: 'With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.' And she called his name Naphtali. "
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife. "
Genesis,30,10,And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a son. 
Genesis,30,11,And Leah said: 'Fortune is come!' And she called his name Gad. 
Genesis,30,12,And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a second son. 
Genesis,30,13,And Leah said: 'Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy.' And she called his name Asher. 
Genesis,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah: 'Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.' "
Genesis,30,15,And she said unto her: 'Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?' And Rachel said: 'Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.' 
Genesis,30,16,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said: 'Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes.' And he lay with her that night. "
Genesis,30,17,"And G-d hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. "
Genesis,30,18,"And Leah said: 'G-d hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar. "
Genesis,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. "
Genesis,30,20,"And Leah said: 'G-d hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.' And she called his name Zebulun. "
Genesis,30,21,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. "
Genesis,30,22,"And G-d remembered Rachel, and G-d hearkened to her, and opened her womb. "
Genesis,30,23,"And she conceived, and bore a son, and said: 'G-d hath taken away my reproach.' "
Genesis,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph, saying: 'The HaShem add to me another son.' "
Genesis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban: 'Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. "
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.' "
Genesis,30,27,"And Laban said unto him: 'If now I have found favour in thine eyes--I have observed the signs, and HaShem hath blessed me for thy sake.' "
Genesis,30,28,"And he said: 'Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.' "
Genesis,30,29,"And he said unto him: 'Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me. "
Genesis,30,30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased abundantly; and HaShem hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned. And now when shall I provide for mine own house also?' "
Genesis,30,31,"And he said: 'What shall I give thee?' And Jacob said: 'Thou shalt not give me aught; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it. "
Genesis,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every dark one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire. "
Genesis,30,33,"So shall my righteousness witness against me hereafter, when thou shalt come to look over my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and dark among the sheep, that if found with me shall be counted stolen.' "
Genesis,30,34,"And Laban said: 'Behold, would it might be according to thy word.' "
Genesis,30,35,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the dark ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. "
Genesis,30,36,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 
Genesis,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, making the white appear which was in the rods. "
Genesis,30,38,And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. 
Genesis,30,39,"And the flocks conceived at the sight of the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. "
Genesis,30,40,"And Jacob separated the lambs--he also set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the flock of Laban-- and put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock. "
Genesis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; "
Genesis,30,42,"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. "
Genesis,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.  "
Genesis,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying: 'Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this wealth.' "
Genesis,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime. "
Genesis,31,3,"And HaShem said unto Jacob: 'Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.' "
Genesis,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, "
Genesis,31,5,"and said unto them: 'I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the G-d of my father hath been with me. "
Genesis,31,6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
Genesis,31,7,"And your father hath mocked me, and changed my wages ten times; but G-d suffered him not to hurt me. "
Genesis,31,8,If he said thus: The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said thus: The streaked shall be thy wages; then bore all the flock streaked. 
Genesis,31,9,"Thus G-d hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. "
Genesis,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. "
Genesis,31,11,And the angel of G-d said unto me in the dream: Jacob; and I said: Here am I. 
Genesis,31,12,"And he said: Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. "
Genesis,31,13,"I am the G-d of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar, where thou didst vow a vow unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.' "
Genesis,31,14,And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him: 'Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not accounted by him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our price. "
Genesis,31,16,"For all the riches which G-d hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatsoever G-d hath said unto thee, do.' "
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels; "
Genesis,31,18,"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan. "
Genesis,31,19,Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's. 
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he fled. "
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead. "
Genesis,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
Genesis,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. "
Genesis,31,24,"And G-d came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night, and said unto him: 'Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.' "
Genesis,31,25,And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead. 
Genesis,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob: 'What hast thou done, that thou hast outwitted me, and carried away my daughters as though captives of the sword? "
Genesis,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and outwit me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; "
Genesis,31,28,and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly. 
Genesis,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the G-d of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying: Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. "
Genesis,31,30,"And now that thou art surely gone, because thou sore longest after thy father's house, wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?' "
Genesis,31,31,And Jacob answered and said to Laban: 'Because I was afraid; for I said: Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force. 
Genesis,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live; before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.' --For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.-- "
Genesis,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. "
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the saddle of the camel, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. "
Genesis,31,35,"And she said to her father: 'Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me.' And he searched, but found not the teraphim. "
Genesis,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and strove with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban: 'What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? "
Genesis,31,37,"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two. "
Genesis,31,38,"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten. "
Genesis,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. "
Genesis,31,40,"Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. "
Genesis,31,41,"These twenty years have I been in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times. "
Genesis,31,42,"Except the G-d of my father, the G-d of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been on my side, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. G-d hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and gave judgment yesternight.' "
Genesis,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob: 'The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne? "
Genesis,31,44,"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.' "
Genesis,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. "
Genesis,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren: 'Gather stones'; and they took stones, and made a heap. And they did eat there by the heap. "
Genesis,31,47,And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it Galeed. 
Genesis,31,48,And Laban said: 'This heap is witness between me and thee this day.' Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
Genesis,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said: 'The HaShem watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. "
Genesis,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man being with us; see, G-d is witness betwixt me and thee.' "
Genesis,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob: 'Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set up betwixt me and thee. "
Genesis,31,52,"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. "
Genesis,31,53,"The G-d of Abraham, and the G-d of Nahor, the G-d of their father, judge betwixt us.' And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. "
Genesis,31,54,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.  "
Genesis,32,1,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place. "
Genesis,32,2,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of G-d met him. "
Genesis,32,3,And Jacob said when he saw them: 'This is G-d's camp.' And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Genesis,32,4,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. "
Genesis,32,5,"And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now. "
Genesis,32,6,"And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.' "
Genesis,32,7,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.' "
Genesis,32,8,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps. "
Genesis,32,9,"And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.' "
Genesis,32,10,"And Jacob said: 'O G-d of my father Abraham, and G-d of my father Isaac, O HaShem, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; "
Genesis,32,11,"I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps. "
Genesis,32,12,"Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. "
Genesis,32,13,"And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.' "
Genesis,32,14,And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: 
Genesis,32,15,"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, "
Genesis,32,16,"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. "
Genesis,32,17,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.' "
Genesis,32,18,"And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? "
Genesis,32,19,"then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.' "
Genesis,32,20,"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; "
Genesis,32,21,"and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.' "
Genesis,32,22,So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp. 
Genesis,32,23,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. "
Genesis,32,24,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. "
Genesis,32,25,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
Genesis,32,26,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. "
Genesis,32,27,"And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.' "
Genesis,32,28,And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And be said: 'Jacob.' 
Genesis,32,29,"And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with G-d and with men, and hast prevailed.' "
Genesis,32,30,"And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. "
Genesis,32,31,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: 'for I have seen G-d face to face, and my life is preserved.' "
Genesis,32,32,"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh. "
Genesis,32,33,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.  "
Genesis,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. "
Genesis,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. "
Genesis,33,3,"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. "
Genesis,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept. "
Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said: 'Who are these with thee?' And he said: 'The children whom G-d hath graciously given thy servant.' "
Genesis,33,6,"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed down. "
Genesis,33,7,"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed down; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed down. "
Genesis,33,8,And he said: 'What meanest thou by all this camp which I met?' And he said: 'To find favour in the sight of my lord.' 
Genesis,33,9,"And Esau said: 'I have enough; my brother, let that which thou hast be thine.' "
Genesis,33,10,"And Jacob said: 'Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favour in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of G-d, and thou wast pleased with me. "
Genesis,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because G-d hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.' And he urged him, and he took it. "
Genesis,33,12,"And he said: 'Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.' "
Genesis,33,13,"And he said unto him: 'My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me; and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. "
Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will journey on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.' "
Genesis,33,15,And Esau said: 'Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.' And he said: 'What needeth it? let me find favour in the sight of my lord.' 
Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
Genesis,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city. "
Genesis,33,19,"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money. "
Genesis,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel."
Genesis,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. "
Genesis,34,2,"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her. "
Genesis,34,3,"And his soul did cleave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke comfortingly unto the damsel. "
Genesis,34,4,"And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying: 'Get me this damsel to wife.' "
Genesis,34,5,Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field; and Jacob held his peace until they came. 
Genesis,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him. 
Genesis,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. "
Genesis,34,8,"And Hamor spoke with them, saying 'The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her unto him to wife. "
Genesis,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. "
Genesis,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us; and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.' "
Genesis,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren: 'Let me find favour in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. "
Genesis,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel to wife.' "
Genesis,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, "
Genesis,34,14,"and said unto them: 'We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us. "
Genesis,34,15,"Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; "
Genesis,34,16,"then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. "
Genesis,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.' "
Genesis,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. "
Genesis,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honoured above all the house of his father. "
Genesis,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying: "
Genesis,34,21,"'These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. "
Genesis,34,22,"Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. "
Genesis,34,23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.' "
Genesis,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. "
Genesis,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males. "
Genesis,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth. "
Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. "
Genesis,34,28,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field; "
Genesis,34,29,"and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the house. "
Genesis,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: 'Ye have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land, even unto the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.' "
Genesis,34,31,And they said: 'Should one deal with our sister as with a harlot?' 
Genesis,35,1,"And G-d said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto G-d, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.' "
Genesis,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him: 'Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; "
Genesis,35,3,"and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto G-d, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.' "
Genesis,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem. "
Genesis,35,5,"And they journeyed; and a terror of G-d was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. "
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan--the same is Beth-el--he and all the people that were with him. "
Genesis,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el, because there G-d was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. "
Genesis,35,8,"And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. "
Genesis,35,9,"And G-d appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. "
Genesis,35,10,"And G-d said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called his name Israel. "
Genesis,35,11,"And G-d said unto him: 'I am G-d Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; "
Genesis,35,12,"and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.' "
Genesis,35,13,And G-d went up from him in the place where He spoke with him. 
Genesis,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. "
Genesis,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where G-d spoke with him, Beth-el. "
Genesis,35,16,"And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. "
Genesis,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the mid-wife said unto her: 'Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.' "
Genesis,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing--for she died--that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. "
Genesis,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath--the same is Beth-lehem. "
Genesis,35,20,And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
Genesis,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. "
Genesis,35,22,"And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: "
Genesis,35,23,"the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; "
Genesis,35,24,the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 
Genesis,35,25,"and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; "
Genesis,35,26,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram. "
Genesis,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriatharba--the same is Hebron--where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. "
Genesis,35,28,And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. 
Genesis,35,29,"And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.  "
Genesis,36,1,Now these are the generations of Esau--the same is Edom. 
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, "
Genesis,36,3,"and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth. "
Genesis,36,4,And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel; 
Genesis,36,5,"and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan. "
Genesis,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. "
Genesis,36,7,For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle. 
Genesis,36,8,And Esau dwelt in the mountain-land of Seir--Esau is Edom. 
Genesis,36,9,And these are the generations of Esau the father of a the Edomites in the mountain-land of Seir. 
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. "
Genesis,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. "
Genesis,36,12,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
Genesis,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. "
Genesis,36,14,"And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife; and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. "
Genesis,36,15,"These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: the chief of Teman, the chief of Omar, the chief of Zepho, the chief of Kenaz, "
Genesis,36,16,"the chief of Korah, the chief of Gatam, the chief of Amalek. These are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. "
Genesis,36,17,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son: the chief of Nahath, the chief of Zerah, the chief of Shammah, the chief of Mizzah. These are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. "
Genesis,36,18,"And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's wife: the chief of Jeush, the chief of Jalam, the chief of Korah. These are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. "
Genesis,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs; the same is Edom. "
Genesis,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, "
Genesis,36,21,"and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. "
Genesis,36,22,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
Genesis,36,23,"And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. "
Genesis,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah--this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. "
Genesis,36,25,And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
Genesis,36,26,And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. 
Genesis,36,27,These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. 
Genesis,36,28,These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
Genesis,36,29,"These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: the chief of Lotan, the chief of Shobal, the chief of Zibeon, the chief of Anah, "
Genesis,36,30,"the chief of Dishon, the chief of Ezer, the chief of Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. "
Genesis,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. "
Genesis,36,32,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
Genesis,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. "
Genesis,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. "
Genesis,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Avith. "
Genesis,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. "
Genesis,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead. "
Genesis,36,38,"And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. "
Genesis,36,39,"And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of the city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. "
Genesis,36,40,"And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: the chief of Timna, the chief of Alvah, the chief of Jetheth; "
Genesis,36,41,"the chief of Oholibamah, the chief of Elah, the chief of Pinon; "
Genesis,36,42,"the chief of Kenaz, the chief of Teman, the chief of Mibzar; "
Genesis,36,43,"the chief of Magdiel, the chief of Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau the father of the Edomites.  "
Genesis,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. "
Genesis,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being still a lad even with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought evil report of them unto their father. "
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours. "
Genesis,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. "
Genesis,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more. "
Genesis,37,6,"And he said unto them: 'Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: "
Genesis,37,7,"for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and bowed down to my sheaf.' "
Genesis,37,8,"And his brethren said to him: 'Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?' And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. "
Genesis,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said: 'Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.' "
Genesis,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him: 'What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth?' "
Genesis,37,11,And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind. 
Genesis,37,12,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
Genesis,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.' And he said to him: 'Here am I.' "
Genesis,37,14,"And he said to him: 'Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me back word.' So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. "
Genesis,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying: 'What seekest thou?' "
Genesis,37,16,"And he said: 'I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.' "
Genesis,37,17,"And the man said: 'They are departed hence; for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.' And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. "
Genesis,37,18,"And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. "
Genesis,37,19,"And they said one to another: 'Behold, this dreamer cometh. "
Genesis,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say: An evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.' "
Genesis,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said: 'Let us not take his life.' "
Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them: 'Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him' --that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. "
Genesis,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him; "
Genesis,37,24,"and they took him, and cast him into the pit--and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. "
Genesis,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum, going to carry it down to Egypt. "
Genesis,37,26,And Judah said unto his brethren: 'What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? 
Genesis,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh.' And his brethren hearkened unto him. "
Genesis,37,28,"And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. "
Genesis,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. "
Genesis,37,30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said: 'The child is not; and as for me, whither shall I go?' "
Genesis,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood; "
Genesis,37,32,"and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said: 'This have we found. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.' "
Genesis,37,33,"And he knew it, and said: 'It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.' "
Genesis,37,34,"And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. "
Genesis,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said: 'Nay, but I will go down to the grave to my son mourning.' And his father wept for him. "
Genesis,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.  "
Genesis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. "
Genesis,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her. "
Genesis,38,3,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er. "
Genesis,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan. "
Genesis,38,5,"And she yet again bore a son, and called his name Shelah; and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. "
Genesis,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar. "
Genesis,38,7,"And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of HaShem; and HaShem slew him. "
Genesis,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan: 'Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.' "
Genesis,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. "
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of HaShem; and He slew him also. 
Genesis,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law: 'Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up'; for he said: 'Lest he also die, like his brethren.' And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. "
Genesis,38,12,"And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. "
Genesis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying: 'Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.' "
Genesis,38,14,"And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entrance of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife. "
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face. "
Genesis,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said: 'Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee'; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said: 'What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?' "
Genesis,38,17,"And he said: 'I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock.' And she said: 'Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?' "
Genesis,38,18,"And he said: 'What pledge shall I give thee?' And she said: 'Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand.' And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. "
Genesis,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. "
Genesis,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; but he found her not. "
Genesis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of her place, saying: 'Where is the harlot, that was at Enaim by the wayside?' And they said: 'There hath been no harlot here.' "
Genesis,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said: 'I have not found her; and also the men of the place said: There hath been no harlot here.' "
Genesis,38,23,"And Judah said: 'Let her take it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.' "
Genesis,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying: 'Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by harlotry.' And Judah said: 'Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.' "
Genesis,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 'By the man, whose these are, am I with child'; and she said: 'Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.' "
Genesis,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said: 'She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son.' And he knew her again no more. "
Genesis,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. "
Genesis,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying: 'This came out first.' "
Genesis,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold his brother came out; and she said: 'Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself?' Therefore his name was called Perez."
Genesis,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah. "
Genesis,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither. "
Genesis,39,2,"And HaShem was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. "
Genesis,39,3,"And his master saw that HaShem was with him, and that HaShem made all that he did to prosper in his hand. "
Genesis,39,4,"And Joseph found favour in his sight, and he ministered unto him. And he appointed him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. "
Genesis,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he appointed him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that HaShem blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of HaShem was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field. "
Genesis,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and, having him, he knew not aught save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was of beautiful form, and fair to look upon. "
Genesis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said: 'Lie with me.' "
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife: 'Behold, my master, having me, knoweth not what is in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand; "
Genesis,39,9,"he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against G-d?' "
Genesis,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. "
Genesis,39,11,"And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work, and there was none of the men of the house there within, "
Genesis,39,12,"that she caught him by his garment, saying: 'Lie with me.' And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. "
Genesis,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, "
Genesis,39,14,"that she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying: 'See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. "
Genesis,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.' "
Genesis,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. "
Genesis,39,17,"And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying: 'The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me. "
Genesis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.' "
Genesis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying: 'After this manner did thy servant to me'; that his wrath was kindled. "
Genesis,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison. "
Genesis,39,21,"But HaShem was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. "
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. "
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand, because HaShem was with him; and that which he did, HaShem made it to prosper. "
Genesis,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. "
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. "
Genesis,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. "
Genesis,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph to be with them, and he ministered unto them; and they continued a season in ward. "
Genesis,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. "
Genesis,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad. "
Genesis,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his master's house, saying: 'Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?' "
Genesis,40,8,"And they said unto him: 'We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it.' And Joseph said unto them: 'Do not interpretations belong to G-d? tell it me, I pray you.' "
Genesis,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him: 'In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; "
Genesis,40,10,"and in the vine were three branches; and as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes, "
Genesis,40,11,"and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.' "
Genesis,40,12,And Joseph said unto him: 'This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 
Genesis,40,13,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office; and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. "
Genesis,40,14,"But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. "
Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.' 
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph: 'I also saw in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head; "
Genesis,40,17,and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.' 
Genesis,40,18,And Joseph answered and said: 'This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days; 
Genesis,40,19,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.' "
Genesis,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants. "
Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler back unto his butlership; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
Genesis,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. "
Genesis,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him. "
Genesis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
Genesis,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favoured and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass. "
Genesis,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. "
Genesis,41,4,And the ill-favoured and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
Genesis,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. "
Genesis,41,6,"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. "
Genesis,41,7,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. "
Genesis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. "
Genesis,41,9,"Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying: 'I make mention of my faults this day: "
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in the ward of the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. "
Genesis,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. "
Genesis,41,12,"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. "
Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: I was restored unto mine office, and he was hanged.' "
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. "
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: 'I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it; and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.' "
Genesis,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying: 'It is not in me; G-d will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.' "
Genesis,41,17,"And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph: 'In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river. "
Genesis,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favoured; and they fed in the reedgrass. "
Genesis,41,19,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness. "
Genesis,41,20,And the lean and ill-favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine. 
Genesis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favoured as at the beginning. So I awoke. "
Genesis,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good. "
Genesis,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. "
Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.' 
Genesis,41,25,And Joseph said unto Pharaoh: 'The dream of Pharaoh is one; what G-d is about to do He hath declared unto Pharaoh. 
Genesis,41,26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
Genesis,41,27,"And the seven lean and ill-favoured kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine. "
Genesis,41,28,That is the thing which I spoke unto Pharaoh: what G-d is about to do He hath shown unto Pharaoh. 
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. "
Genesis,41,30,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
Genesis,41,31,and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous. 
Genesis,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by G-d, and G-d will shortly bring it to pass. "
Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. "
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty. "
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. "
Genesis,41,36,"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.' "
Genesis,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. "
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants: 'Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of G-d is?' "
Genesis,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: 'Forasmuch as G-d hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou. "
Genesis,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.' "
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: 'See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.' "
Genesis,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. "
Genesis,41,43,And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him: 'Abrech'; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. 
Genesis,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: 'I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.' "
Genesis,41,45,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.-- 
Genesis,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. --And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. "
Genesis,41,47,And in the seven years of plenty the earth brought forth in heaps. 
Genesis,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. "
Genesis,41,49,"And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until they left off numbering; for it was without number. "
Genesis,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore unto him. "
Genesis,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: 'for G-d hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.' "
Genesis,41,52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: 'for G-d hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.' 
Genesis,41,53,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end. "
Genesis,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. "
Genesis,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians: 'Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.' "
Genesis,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt. "
Genesis,41,57,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.  
Genesis,42,1,"Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons: 'Why do ye look one upon another?' "
Genesis,42,2,"And he said: 'Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.' "
Genesis,42,3,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. 
Genesis,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said: 'Lest peradventure harm befall him.' "
Genesis,42,5,And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Caanan. 
Genesis,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth. "
Genesis,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them: 'Whence come ye?' And they said: 'From the land of Canaan to buy food.' "
Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not. "
Genesis,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them: 'Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.' "
Genesis,42,10,"And they said unto him: 'Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. "
Genesis,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are upright men, thy servants are no spies.' "
Genesis,42,12,"And he said unto them: 'Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.' "
Genesis,42,13,"And they said: 'We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.' "
Genesis,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them: 'That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies. "
Genesis,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. "
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.' "
Genesis,42,17,And he put them all together into ward three days. 
Genesis,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day. 'This do, and live; for I fear G-d: "
Genesis,42,19,"if ye be upright men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses; "
Genesis,42,20,"and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.' And they did so. "
Genesis,42,21,"And they said one to another: 'We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.' "
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying: 'Spoke I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.' "
Genesis,42,23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for the interpreter was between them. 
Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. "
Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them. "
Genesis,42,26,"And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence. "
Genesis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. "
Genesis,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren: 'My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack.' And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying: 'What is this that G-d hath done unto us?' "
Genesis,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying: "
Genesis,42,30,"'The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. "
Genesis,42,31,And we said unto him: We are upright men; we are no spies. 
Genesis,42,32,"We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. "
Genesis,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are upright men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way. "
Genesis,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.' "
Genesis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. "
Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them: 'Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; upon me are all these things come.' "
Genesis,42,37,"And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: 'Thou shalt slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.' "
Genesis,42,38,"And he said: 'My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. "
Genesis,43,1,And the famine was sore in the land. 
Genesis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them: 'Go again, buy us a little food.' "
Genesis,43,3,"And Judah spoke unto him, saying: 'The man did earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. "
Genesis,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food; "
Genesis,43,5,"but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.' "
Genesis,43,6,"And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?' "
Genesis,43,7,"And they said: 'The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words; could we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?' "
Genesis,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father: 'Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. "
Genesis,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. "
Genesis,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.' "
Genesis,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them: 'If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and ladanum, nuts, and almonds; "
Genesis,43,12,and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight; 
Genesis,43,13,"take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man; "
Genesis,43,14,"and G-d Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.' "
Genesis,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. "
Genesis,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: 'Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and prepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.' "
Genesis,43,17,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
Genesis,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.' "
Genesis,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, "
Genesis,43,20,"and said: 'Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food. "
Genesis,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. "
Genesis,43,22,And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.' 
Genesis,43,23,"And he said: 'Peace be to you, fear not; your G-d, and the G-d of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.' And he brought Simeon out unto them. "
Genesis,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. "
Genesis,43,25,And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there. 
Genesis,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth. "
Genesis,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said: 'Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?' "
Genesis,43,28,"And they said: 'Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.' And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. "
Genesis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said: 'Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me?' And he said: 'G-d be gracious unto thee, my son.' "
Genesis,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. "
Genesis,43,31,"And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: 'Set on bread.' "
Genesis,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. "
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one with another. "
Genesis,43,34,"And portions were taken unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. "
Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying: 'Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. "
Genesis,44,2,"And put my goblet, the silver goblet, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.' And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. "
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. "
Genesis,44,4,"And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 'Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? "
Genesis,44,5,"Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.' "
Genesis,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words. "
Genesis,44,7,And they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. 
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? "
Genesis,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.' "
Genesis,44,10,And he said: 'Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.' 
Genesis,44,11,"Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. "
Genesis,44,12,"And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack. "
Genesis,44,13,"And they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. "
Genesis,44,14,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground. "
Genesis,44,15,And Joseph said unto them: 'What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine?' 
Genesis,44,16,"And Judah said: 'What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? G-d hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.' "
Genesis,44,17,"And he said: 'Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.' "
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said: 'Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. "
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother? "
Genesis,44,20,"And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. "
Genesis,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. "
Genesis,44,22,"And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die. "
Genesis,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. "
Genesis,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. "
Genesis,44,25,"And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food. "
Genesis,44,26,"And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. "
Genesis,44,27,And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons; 
Genesis,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since; "
Genesis,44,29,"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. "
Genesis,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad's soul; "
Genesis,44,31,"it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. "
Genesis,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. "
Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. "
Genesis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.' "
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried: 'Cause every man to go out from me.' And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. "
Genesis,45,2,"And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. "
Genesis,45,3,And Joseph said unto his brethren: 'I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?' And his brethren could not answer him; for they were affrighted at his presence. 
Genesis,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren: 'Come near to me, I pray you.' And they came near. And he said: 'I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. "
Genesis,45,5,"And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for G-d did send me before you to preserve life. "
Genesis,45,6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land; and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. "
Genesis,45,7,"And G-d sent me before you to give you a remnant on the earth, and to save you alive for a great deliverance. "
Genesis,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but G-d; and He hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. "
Genesis,45,9,"Hasten ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: G-d hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not. "
Genesis,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast; "
Genesis,45,11,"and there will I sustain thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast. "
Genesis,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. "
Genesis,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall hasten and bring down my father hither.' "
Genesis,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. "
Genesis,45,15,"And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him. "
Genesis,45,16,"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying: 'Joseph's brethren are come'; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. "
Genesis,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: 'Say unto thy brethren: This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; "
Genesis,45,18,"and take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. "
Genesis,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. "
Genesis,45,20,Also regard not your stuff; for the good things of all the land of Egypt are yours.' 
Genesis,45,21,"And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. "
Genesis,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver, and five changes of raiment. "
Genesis,45,23,"And to his father he sent in like manner ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way. "
Genesis,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them: 'See that ye fall not out by the way.' "
Genesis,45,25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. "
Genesis,45,26,"And they told him, saying: 'Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.' And his heart fainted, for he believed them not. "
Genesis,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. "
Genesis,45,28,And Israel said: 'It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.' 
Genesis,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the G-d of his father Isaac. "
Genesis,46,2,"And G-d spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said: 'Jacob, Jacob.' And he said: 'Here am I.' "
Genesis,46,3,"And He said: 'I am G-d, the G-d of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. "
Genesis,46,4,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.' 
Genesis,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. "
Genesis,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him; "
Genesis,46,7,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. "
Genesis,46,8,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born. "
Genesis,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. "
Genesis,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. "
Genesis,46,11,"And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. "
Genesis,46,12,"And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. "
Genesis,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. "
Genesis,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. "
Genesis,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. "
Genesis,46,16,"And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. "
Genesis,46,17,"And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. "
Genesis,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. "
Genesis,46,19,The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
Genesis,46,20,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore unto him. "
Genesis,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. "
Genesis,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen. "
Genesis,46,23,And the sons of Dan: Hushim. 
Genesis,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. "
Genesis,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob; all the souls were seven. "
Genesis,46,26,"All the souls belonging to Jacob that came into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six. "
Genesis,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. "
Genesis,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. "
Genesis,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. "
Genesis,46,30,"And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.' "
Genesis,46,31,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house: 'I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him: My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; "
Genesis,46,32,"and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. "
Genesis,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say: What is your occupation? "
Genesis,46,34,"that ye shall say: Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers; that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.' "
Genesis,47,1,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said: 'My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.' "
Genesis,47,2,"And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. "
Genesis,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: 'What is your occupation?' And they said unto Pharaoh: 'Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.' "
Genesis,47,4,"And they said unto Pharaoh: 'To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.' "
Genesis,47,5,"And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: 'Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee; "
Genesis,47,6,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.' "
Genesis,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. "
Genesis,47,8,And Pharaoh said unto Jacob: 'How many are the days of the years of thy life?' 
Genesis,47,9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh: 'The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings.' "
Genesis,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. "
Genesis,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. "
Genesis,47,12,"And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to the want of their little ones. "
Genesis,47,13,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. "
Genesis,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. "
Genesis,47,15,"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said: 'Give us bread; for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.' "
Genesis,47,16,"And Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if money fail.' "
Genesis,47,17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. "
Genesis,47,18,"And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him: 'We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. "
Genesis,47,19,"Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.' "
Genesis,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's. "
Genesis,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them city by city, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. "
Genesis,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land. "
Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. "
Genesis,47,24,"And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.' "
Genesis,47,25,"And they said: 'Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen.' "
Genesis,47,26,"And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's. "
Genesis,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. "
Genesis,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years. "
Genesis,47,29,"And the time drew near that Israel must die; and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him: 'If now I have found favour in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. "
Genesis,47,30,"But when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place.' And he said: 'I will do as thou hast said.' "
Genesis,47,31,And he said: 'Swear unto me.' And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed down upon the bed's head. 
Genesis,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph: 'Behold, thy father is sick.' And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. "
Genesis,48,2,"And one told Jacob, and said: 'Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee.' And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. "
Genesis,48,3,"And Jacob said unto Joseph: 'G-d Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, "
Genesis,48,4,"and said unto me: Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. "
Genesis,48,5,"And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine. "
Genesis,48,6,"And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. "
Genesis,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died unto me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath--the same is Beth-lehem.' "
Genesis,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said: 'Who are these?' "
Genesis,48,9,"And Joseph said unto his father: 'They are my sons, whom G-d hath given me here.' And he said: 'Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.' "
Genesis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. "
Genesis,48,11,"And Israel said unto Joseph: 'I had not thought to see thy face; and, lo, G-d hath let me see thy seed also.' "
Genesis,48,12,And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he fell down on his face to the earth. 
Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. "
Genesis,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born. "
Genesis,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said: 'The G-d before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the G-d who hath been my shepherd all my life long unto this day, "
Genesis,48,16,"the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.' "
Genesis,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. "
Genesis,48,18,"And Joseph said unto his father: 'Not so, my father, for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.' "
Genesis,48,19,"And his father refused, and said: 'I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.' "
Genesis,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying: 'By thee shall Israel bless, saying: G-d make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.' And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. "
Genesis,48,21,"And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Behold, I die; but G-d will be with you, and bring you back unto the land of your fathers. "
Genesis,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.'  "
Genesis,49,1,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: 'Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the end of days. "
Genesis,49,2,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. "
Genesis,49,3,"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the first-fruits of my strength; the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power. "
Genesis,49,4,"Unstable as water, have not thou the excellency; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it--he went up to my couch. "
Genesis,49,5,Simeon and Levi are brethren; weapons of violence their kinship. 
Genesis,49,6,"Let my soul not come into their council; unto their assembly let my glory not be united; for in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they houghed oxen. "
Genesis,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel; I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel "
Genesis,49,8,"Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father's sons shall bow down before thee. "
Genesis,49,9,"Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? "
Genesis,49,10,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, as long as men come to Shiloh; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be. "
Genesis,49,11,"Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washeth his garments in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes; "
Genesis,49,12,"His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. "
Genesis,49,13,"Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea, and he shall be a shore for ships, and his flank shall be upon Zidon. "
Genesis,49,14,"Issachar is a large-boned ass, couching down between the sheep-folds. "
Genesis,49,15,"For he saw a resting-place that it was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under task-work "
Genesis,49,16,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. "
Genesis,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a horned snake in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, so that his rider falleth backward. "

Genesis,49,22,"Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain; its branches run over the wall. "
Genesis,49,23,"The archers have dealt bitterly with him, and shot at him, and hated him; "
Genesis,49,24,"But his bow abode firm, and the arms of his hands were made supple, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, from thence, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel, "
Genesis,49,25,"Even by the G-d of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. "
Genesis,49,26,"The blessings of thy father are mighty beyond the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of the prince among his brethren. "
Genesis,49,27,"Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth; in the morning he devoureth the prey, and at even he divideth the spoil.' "
Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. "
Genesis,49,29,"And be charged them, and said unto them: 'I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, "
Genesis,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place. "
Genesis,49,31,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
Genesis,49,32,"The field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.' "
Genesis,49,33,"And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered unto his people.  "
Genesis,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. "
Genesis,50,2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel. 
Genesis,50,3,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days. 
Genesis,50,4,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying: 'If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying: "
Genesis,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come back.' "
Genesis,50,6,"And Pharaoh said: 'Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.' "
Genesis,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, "
Genesis,50,8,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. "
Genesis,50,9,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. 
Genesis,50,10,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. "
Genesis,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: 'This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.' Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. "
Genesis,50,12,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them. 
Genesis,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, in front of Mamre. "
Genesis,50,14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. "
Genesis,50,15,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said: 'It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.' "
Genesis,50,16,"And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: 'Thy father did command before he died, saying: "
Genesis,50,17,"So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the G-d of thy father.' And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him. "
Genesis,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said: 'Behold, we are thy bondmen.' "
Genesis,50,19,And Joseph said unto them: 'Fear not; for am I in the place of G-d? 
Genesis,50,20,"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but G-d meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. "
Genesis,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you, and your little ones.' And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them. "
Genesis,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. "
Genesis,50,23,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees. 
Genesis,50,24,"And Joseph said unto his brethren: 'I die; but G-d will surely remember you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.' "
Genesis,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying: 'G-d will surely remember you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.' "
Genesis,50,26,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.   "
Exodus,1,1,"NOW THESE are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt with Jacob; every man came with his household: "
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; "
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; "
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. "
Exodus,1,5,And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
Exodus,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. "
Exodus,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. "
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. "
Exodus,1,9,"And he said unto his people: 'Behold, the people of the children of Israel are too many and too mighty for us; "
Exodus,1,10,"come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there befalleth us any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.' "
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. "
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were adread because of the children of Israel. "
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour. 
Exodus,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigour. "
Exodus,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; "
Exodus,1,16,"and he said: 'When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon the birthstool: if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.' "
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared G-d, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive. "
Exodus,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them: 'Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?' "
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh: 'Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.' "
Exodus,1,20,"And G-d dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. "
Exodus,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared G-d, that He made them houses. "
Exodus,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying: 'Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.' "
Exodus,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. "
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. "
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. "
Exodus,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. "
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. "
Exodus,2,6,"And she opened it, and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had compassion on him, and said: 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.' "
Exodus,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter: 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?' "
Exodus,2,8,And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: 'Go.' And the maiden went and called the child's mother. 
Exodus,2,9,"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her: 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. "
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said: 'Because I drew him out of the water.' "
Exodus,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. "
Exodus,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. "
Exodus,2,13,"And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together; and he said to him that did the wrong: 'Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?' "
Exodus,2,14,"And he said: 'Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian?' And Moses feared, and said: 'Surely the thing is known.' "
Exodus,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. "
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. "
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. "
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said: 'How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?' "
Exodus,2,19,"And they said: 'An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.' "
Exodus,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters: 'And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.' "
Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said: 'I have been a stranger in a strange land.' "
Exodus,2,23,"And it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto G-d by reason of the bondage. "
Exodus,2,24,"And G-d heard their groaning, and G-d remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. "
Exodus,2,25,"And G-d saw the children of Israel, and G-d took cognizance of them.  "
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of G-d, unto Horeb. "
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of HaShem appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. "
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said: 'I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.' "
Exodus,3,4,"And when HaShem saw that he turned aside to see, G-d called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said: 'Moses, Moses.' And he said: 'Here am I.' "
Exodus,3,5,"And He said: 'Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.' "
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover He said: 'I am the G-d of thy father, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob.' And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon G-d. "
Exodus,3,7,"And HaShem said: 'I have surely seen the affliction of My people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their pains; "
Exodus,3,8,"and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. "
Exodus,3,9,"And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto Me; moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. "
Exodus,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.' "
Exodus,3,11,"And Moses said unto G-d: 'Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?' "
Exodus,3,12,"And He said: 'Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve G-d upon this mountain.' "
Exodus,3,13,"And Moses said unto G-d: 'Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The G-d of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?' "
Exodus,3,14,And G-d said unto Moses: 'I AM THAT I AM'; and He said: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.' 
Exodus,3,15,"And G-d said moreover unto Moses: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations. "
Exodus,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them: HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, the G-d of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying: I have surely remembered you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. "
Exodus,3,17,"And I have said: I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. "
Exodus,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him: HaShem, the G-d of the Hebrews, hath met with us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to HaShem our G-d. "
Exodus,3,19,"And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, except by a mighty hand. "
Exodus,3,20,"And I will put forth My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof. And after that he will let you go. "
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty; "
Exodus,3,22,"but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.' "
Exodus,4,1,"And Moses answered and said: 'But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say: The lord hath not appeared unto thee.' "
Exodus,4,2,And HaShem said unto him: 'What is that in thy hand?' And he said: 'A rod.' 
Exodus,4,3,"And He said: 'Cast it on the ground.' And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. "
Exodus,4,4,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail--and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand-- "
Exodus,4,5,"that they may believe that HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.' "
Exodus,4,6,"And HaShem said furthermore unto him: 'Put now thy hand into thy bosom.' And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. "
Exodus,4,7,"And He said: 'Put thy hand back into thy bosom. --And he put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.-- "
Exodus,4,8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. "
Exodus,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.' "
Exodus,4,10,"And Moses said unto HaShem: 'Oh L-rd, I am not a man of words, neither heretofore, nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.' "
Exodus,4,11,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I HaShem? "
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.' "
Exodus,4,13,"And he said: 'Oh L-rd, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.' "
Exodus,4,14,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Moses, and He said: 'Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. "
Exodus,4,15,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. "
Exodus,4,16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in G-d's stead. "
Exodus,4,17,"And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.' "
Exodus,4,18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him: 'Let me go, I pray thee, and unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.' And Jethro said to Moses: 'Go in peace.' "
Exodus,4,19,"And HaShem said unto Moses in Midian: 'Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.' "
Exodus,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of G-d in his hand. "
Exodus,4,21,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. "
Exodus,4,22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh: Thus saith HaShem: Israel is My son, My first-born. "
Exodus,4,23,"And I have said unto thee: Let My son go, that he may serve Me; and thou hast refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.'-- "
Exodus,4,24,"And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that HaShem met him, and sought to kill him. "
Exodus,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said: 'Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.' "
Exodus,4,26,So He let him alone. Then she said: 'A bridegroom of blood in regard of the circumcision.' 
Exodus,4,27,"And HaShem said to Aaron: 'Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.' And he went, and met him in the mountain of G-d, and kissed him. "
Exodus,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of HaShem wherewith He had sent him, and all the signs wherewith He had charged him. "
Exodus,4,29,And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. 
Exodus,4,30,"And Aaron spoke all the words which HaShem had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. "
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed; and when they heard that HaShem had remembered the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.  "
Exodus,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.' "
Exodus,5,2,"And Pharaoh said: 'Who is HaShem, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not HaShem, and moreover I will not let Israel go.' "
Exodus,5,3,"And they said: 'The G-d of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto HaShem our G-d; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.' "
Exodus,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said unto them: 'Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from their work? get you unto your burdens.' "
Exodus,5,5,"And Pharaoh said: 'Behold, the people of the land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?' "
Exodus,5,6,"And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying: "
Exodus,5,7,"'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. "
Exodus,5,8,"And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our G-d. "
Exodus,5,9,"Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.' "
Exodus,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying: 'Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw. "
Exodus,5,11,"Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nought of your work shall be diminished.' "
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
Exodus,5,13,"And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: 'Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.' "
Exodus,5,14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: 'Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore?' "
Exodus,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: 'Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? "
Exodus,5,16,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.' "
Exodus,5,17,"But he said: 'Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to HaShem. "
Exodus,5,18,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.' "
Exodus,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: 'Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.' "
Exodus,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh; "
Exodus,5,21,"and they said unto them: 'The HaShem look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.' "
Exodus,5,22,"And Moses returned unto HaShem, and said: 'L-rd, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me? "
Exodus,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.' "
Exodus,6,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.' "
Exodus,6,2,"And G-d spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: 'I am HaShem; "
Exodus,6,3,"and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as G-d Almighty, but by My name ""HaShem"" I made Me not known to them. "
Exodus,6,4,"And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. "
Exodus,6,5,"And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. "
Exodus,6,6,"Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am HaShem, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments; "
Exodus,6,7,"and I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a G-d; and ye shall know that I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. "
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am HaShem.' "
Exodus,6,9,"And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit, and for cruel bondage. "
Exodus,6,10,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,6,11,"'Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.' "
Exodus,6,12,"And Moses spoke before HaShem, saying: 'Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?' "
Exodus,6,13,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. "
Exodus,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. These are the families of Simeon. "
Exodus,6,16,"And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. "
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. "
Exodus,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. "
Exodus,6,19,And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
Exodus,6,20,And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. 
Exodus,6,21,"And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. "
Exodus,6,22,"And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. "
Exodus,6,23,"And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. "
Exodus,6,24,"And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. "
Exodus,6,25,And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families. 
Exodus,6,26,"These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom HaShem said: 'Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.' "
Exodus,6,27,"These are they that spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron. "
Exodus,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day when HaShem spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt, "
Exodus,6,29,"that HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: 'I am HaShem; speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.' "
Exodus,6,30,"And Moses said before HaShem: 'Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?'  "
Exodus,7,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'See, I have set thee in G-d's stead to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. "
Exodus,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. "
Exodus,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,7,4,"But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and bring forth My hosts, My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments. "
Exodus,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am HaShem, when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.' "
Exodus,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did so; as HaShem commanded them, so did they. "
Exodus,7,7,"And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh. "
Exodus,7,8,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Exodus,7,9,"'When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying: Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.' "
Exodus,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as HaShem had commanded; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. "
Exodus,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their secret arts. "
Exodus,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. "
Exodus,7,13,"And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as HaShem had spoken. "
Exodus,7,14,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Pharaoh's heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go. "
Exodus,7,15,"Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. "
Exodus,7,16,"And thou shalt say unto him: HaShem, the G-d of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying: Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened; "
Exodus,7,17,"thus saith HaShem: In this thou shalt know that I am HaShem--behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. "
Exodus,7,18,"And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.' "
Exodus,7,19,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.' "
Exodus,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as HaShem commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. "
Exodus,7,21,"And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,7,22,"And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as HaShem had spoken. "
Exodus,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. "
Exodus,7,24,And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
Exodus,7,25,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that HaShem had smitten the river. "
Exodus,7,26,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses: 'Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him: Thus saith HaShem: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. "
Exodus,7,27,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. "
Exodus,7,28,"And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs. "
Exodus,7,29,"And the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.' "
Exodus,8,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,8,2,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,8,3,"And the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,8,4,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: 'Entreat HaShem, that He take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto HaShem.' "
Exodus,8,5,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh: 'Have thou this glory over me; against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?' "
Exodus,8,6,And he said: 'Against to-morrow.' And he said: 'Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto HaShem our G-d. 
Exodus,8,7,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.' "
Exodus,8,8,"And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto HaShem concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh. "
Exodus,8,9,"And HaShem did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. "
Exodus,8,10,And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank. 
Exodus,8,11,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as HaShem had spoken. "
Exodus,8,12,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,8,13,"And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,8,14,"And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast. "
Exodus,8,15,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: 'This is the finger of G-d'; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as HaShem had spoken. "
Exodus,8,16,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him: Thus saith HaShem: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. "
Exodus,8,17,"Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. "
Exodus,8,18,"And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I am HaShem in the midst of the earth. "
Exodus,8,19,And I will put a division between My people and thy people--by to-morrow shall this sign be.' 
Exodus,8,20,"And HaShem did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses; and in all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies. "
Exodus,8,21,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said: 'Go ye, sacrifice to your G-d in the land.' "
Exodus,8,22,"And Moses said: 'It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to HaShem our G-d; lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? "
Exodus,8,23,"We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to HaShem our G-d, as He shall command us.' "
Exodus,8,24,"And Pharaoh said: 'I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to HaShem your G-d in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me.' "
Exodus,8,25,"And Moses said: 'Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat HaShem that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to HaShem.' "
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated HaShem. "
Exodus,8,27,"And HaShem did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. "
Exodus,8,28,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. "
Exodus,9,1,"Then HaShem said unto Moses: 'Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. "
Exodus,9,2,"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, "
Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of HaShem is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks; there shall be a very grievous murrain. "
Exodus,9,4,And HaShem shall make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.' 
Exodus,9,5,"And HaShem appointed a set time, saying: 'Tomorrow HaShem shall do this thing in the land.' "
Exodus,9,6,"And HaShem did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. "
Exodus,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go. "
Exodus,9,8,"And HaShem said unto Moses and unto Aaron: 'Take to you handfuls of soot of the furnace, and let Moses throw it heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. "
Exodus,9,9,"And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,9,10,"And they took soot of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it up heavenward; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. "
Exodus,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. "
Exodus,9,12,"And HaShem hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as HaShem had spoken unto Moses. "
Exodus,9,13,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. "
Exodus,9,14,"For I will this time send all My plagues upon thy person, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth. "
Exodus,9,15,"Surely now I had put forth My hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth. "
Exodus,9,16,"But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee My power, and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth. "
Exodus,9,17,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against My people, that thou wilt not let them go? "
Exodus,9,18,"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. "
Exodus,9,19,"Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.' "
Exodus,9,20,He that feared the word of HaShem among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses; 
Exodus,9,21,and he that regarded not the word of HaShem left his servants and his cattle in the field. 
Exodus,9,22,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,9,23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and HaShem sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and HaShem caused to hail upon the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire flashing up amidst the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. "
Exodus,9,25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. "
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. "
Exodus,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them: 'I have sinned this time; HaShem is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. "
Exodus,9,28,"Entreat HaShem, and let there be enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.' "
Exodus,9,29,"And Moses said unto him: 'As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread forth my hands unto HaShem; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is HaShem'S. "
Exodus,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear HaShem G-d.'-- "
Exodus,9,31,"And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. "
Exodus,9,32,But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they ripen late.-- 
Exodus,9,33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto HaShem; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. "
Exodus,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. "
Exodus,9,35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go; as HaShem had spoken by Moses. "
Exodus,10,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these My signs in the midst of them; "
Exodus,10,2,"and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what I have wrought upon Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am HaShem.' "
Exodus,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of the Hebrews: How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? let My people go, that they may serve Me. "
Exodus,10,4,"Else, if thou refuse to let My people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border; "
Exodus,10,5,"and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field; "
Exodus,10,6,"and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.' And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh. "
Exodus,10,7,"And Pharaoh's servants said unto him: 'How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve HaShem their G-d, knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?' "
Exodus,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them: 'Go, serve HaShem your G-d; but who are they that shall go?' "
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses said: 'We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we will go; for we must hold a feast unto HaShem.' "
Exodus,10,10,"And he said unto them: 'So be HaShem with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones; see ye that evil is before your face. "
Exodus,10,11,"Not so; go now ye that are men, and serve HaShem; for that is what ye desire.' And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. "
Exodus,10,12,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.' "
Exodus,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and HaShem brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. "
Exodus,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. "
Exodus,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said: 'I have sinned against HaShem your G-d, and against you. "
Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat HaShem your G-d, that He may take away from me this death only.' "
Exodus,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated HaShem. "
Exodus,10,19,"And HaShem turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt. "
Exodus,10,20,"But HaShem hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go. "
Exodus,10,21,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.' "
Exodus,10,22,And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 
Exodus,10,23,"they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. "
Exodus,10,24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said: 'Go ye, serve HaShem; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed; let your little ones also go with you.' "
Exodus,10,25,"And Moses said: 'Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto HaShem our G-d. "
Exodus,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve HaShem our G-d; and we know not with what we must serve HaShem, until we come thither.' "
Exodus,10,27,"But HaShem hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. "
Exodus,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him: 'Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.' "
Exodus,10,29,And Moses said: 'Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.' 
Exodus,11,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence; when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. "
Exodus,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.' "
Exodus,11,3,"And HaShem gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. "
Exodus,11,4,And Moses said: 'Thus saith HaShem: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt; 
Exodus,11,5,"and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle. "
Exodus,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. "
Exodus,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know how that HaShem doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. "
Exodus,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down unto me, saying: Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out.' And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. "
Exodus,11,9,And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.' 
Exodus,11,10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and HaShem hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land. "
Exodus,12,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying: "
Exodus,12,2,'This month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. 
Exodus,12,3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying: In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household; "
Exodus,12,4,"and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. "
Exodus,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats; "
Exodus,12,6,and ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at dusk. 
Exodus,12,7,"And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. "
Exodus,12,8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. "
Exodus,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. "
Exodus,12,10,And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
Exodus,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste--it is HaShem'S passover. "
Exodus,12,12,"For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am HaShem. "
Exodus,12,13,"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,12,14,"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to HaShem; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. "
Exodus,12,15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. "
Exodus,12,16,"And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. "
Exodus,12,17,And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever. 
Exodus,12,18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. "
Exodus,12,19,"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land. "
Exodus,12,20,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.' 
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: 'Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover lamb. "
Exodus,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. "
Exodus,12,23,"For HaShem will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, HaShem will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. "
Exodus,12,24,And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
Exodus,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which HaShem will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. "
Exodus,12,26,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you: What mean ye by this service? "
Exodus,12,27,"that ye shall say: It is the sacrifice of HaShem'S passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.' And the people bowed the head and worshipped. "
Exodus,12,28,"And the children of Israel went and did so; as HaShem had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. "
Exodus,12,29,"And it came to pass at midnight, that HaShem smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. "
Exodus,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. "
Exodus,12,31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said: 'Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve HaShem, as ye have said. "
Exodus,12,32,"Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.' "
Exodus,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said: 'We are all dead men.' "
Exodus,12,34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. "
Exodus,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. "
Exodus,12,36,"And HaShem gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians. "
Exodus,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children. "
Exodus,12,38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. "
Exodus,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. "
Exodus,12,40,Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 
Exodus,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the host of HaShem went out from the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,12,42,It was a night of watching unto HaShem for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; this same night is a night of watching unto HaShem for all the children of Israel throughout their generations. 
Exodus,12,43,And HaShem said unto Moses and Aaron: 'This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no alien eat thereof; 
Exodus,12,44,"but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. "
Exodus,12,45,A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
Exodus,12,46,In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
Exodus,12,47,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
Exodus,12,48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to HaShem, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. "
Exodus,12,49,"One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.' "
Exodus,12,50,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as HaShem commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. "
Exodus,12,51,And it came to pass the selfsame day that HaShem did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts. 
Exodus,13,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,13,2,"'Sanctify unto Me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast, it is Mine.' "
Exodus,13,3,"And Moses said unto the people: 'Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand HaShem brought you out from this place; there shall no leavened bread be eaten. "
Exodus,13,4,This day ye go forth in the month Abib. 
Exodus,13,5,"And it shall be when HaShem shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. "
Exodus,13,6,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to HaShem. "
Exodus,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders. "
Exodus,13,8,"And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying: It is because of that which HaShem did for me when I came forth out of Egypt. "
Exodus,13,9,"And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of HaShem may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath HaShem brought thee out of Egypt. "
Exodus,13,10,Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. 
Exodus,13,11,"And it shall be when HaShem shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, "
Exodus,13,12,"that thou shalt set apart unto HaShem all that openeth the womb; every firstling that is a male, which thou hast coming of a beast, shall be HaShem'S. "
Exodus,13,13,"And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. "
Exodus,13,14,"And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: What is this? that thou shalt say unto him: By strength of hand HaShem brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage; "
Exodus,13,15,"and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go that HaShem slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast; therefore I sacrifice to HaShem all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem. "
Exodus,13,16,"And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand HaShem brought us forth out of Egypt.' "
Exodus,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that G-d led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for G-d said: 'Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.' "
Exodus,13,18,"But G-d led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying: 'G-d will surely remember you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.' "
Exodus,13,20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. "
Exodus,13,21,"And HaShem went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night: "
Exodus,13,22,"the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people. "
Exodus,14,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,14,2,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon, over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. "
Exodus,14,3,"And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. "
Exodus,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am HaShem.' And they did so. "
Exodus,14,5,"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the people, and they said: 'What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? "
Exodus,14,6,"And he made ready his chariots, and took his people with him. "
Exodus,14,7,"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. "
Exodus,14,8,"And HaShem hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand. "
Exodus,14,9,"And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon. "
Exodus,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto HaShem. "
Exodus,14,11,"And they said unto Moses: 'Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? "
Exodus,14,12,"Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying: Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.' "
Exodus,14,13,"And Moses said unto the people: 'Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of HaShem, which He will work for you to-day; for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. "
Exodus,14,14,"HaShem will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.' "
Exodus,14,15,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Wherefore criest thou unto Me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. "
Exodus,14,16,"And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. "
Exodus,14,17,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. "
Exodus,14,18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am HaShem, when I have gotten Me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.' "
Exodus,14,19,"And the angel of G-d, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them; "
Exodus,14,20,"and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet gave it light by night there; and the one came not near the other all the night. "
Exodus,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and HaShem caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. "
Exodus,14,22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. "
Exodus,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. "
Exodus,14,24,"And it came to pass in the morning watch, that HaShem looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians. "
Exodus,14,25,"And He took off their chariot wheels, and made them to drive heavily; so that the Egyptians said: 'Let us flee from the face of Israel; for HaShem fighteth for them against the Egyptians.' "
Exodus,14,26,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.' "
Exodus,14,27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and HaShem overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. "
Exodus,14,28,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them. "
Exodus,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. "
Exodus,14,30,Thus HaShem saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. 
Exodus,14,31,"And Israel saw the great work which HaShem did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared HaShem; and they believed in HaShem, and in His servant Moses. "
Exodus,15,1,"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto HaShem, and spoke, saying: I will sing unto HaShem, for He is highly exalted; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. "
Exodus,15,2,"HaShem is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation; this is my G-d, and I will glorify Him; my father's G-d, and I will exalt Him. "
Exodus,15,3,"HaShem is a man of war, HaShem is His name. "
Exodus,15,4,"Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea, and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. "
Exodus,15,5,The deeps cover them--they went down into the depths like a stone. 
Exodus,15,6,"Thy right hand, O HaShem, glorious in power, Thy right hand, O HaShem, dasheth in pieces the enemy. "
Exodus,15,7,"And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou overthrowest them that rise up against Thee; Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. "
Exodus,15,8,And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up--the floods stood upright as a heap; the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said: 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.' "
Exodus,15,10,"Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters. "
Exodus,15,11,"Who is like unto Thee, O HaShem, among the mighty? who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? "
Exodus,15,12,Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand--the earth swallowed them. 
Exodus,15,13,Thou in Thy love hast led the people that Thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation. 
Exodus,15,14,"The peoples have heard, they tremble; pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. "
Exodus,15,15,"Then were the chiefs of Edom affrighted; the mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. "
Exodus,15,16,"Terror and dread falleth upon them; by the greatness of Thine arm they are as still as a stone; till Thy people pass over, O HaShem, till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten. "
Exodus,15,17,"Thou bringest them in, and plantest them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, the place, O HaShem, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O L-rd, which Thy hands have established. "
Exodus,15,18,HaShem shall reign for ever and ever. 
Exodus,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and HaShem brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. "
Exodus,15,20,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. "
Exodus,15,21,"And Miriam sang unto them: Sing ye to HaShem, for He is highly exalted: the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. "
Exodus,15,22,"And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. "
Exodus,15,23,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"And the people murmured against Moses, saying: 'What shall we drink?' "
Exodus,15,25,"And he cried unto HaShem; and HaShem showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them; "
Exodus,15,26,"and He said: 'If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of HaShem thy G-d, and wilt do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am HaShem that healeth thee.' "
Exodus,15,27,"And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and three score and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters. "
Exodus,16,1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,16,2,And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 
Exodus,16,3,"and the children of Israel said unto them: 'Would that we had died by the hand of HaShem in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.' "
Exodus,16,4,"Then said HaShem unto Moses: 'Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My law, or not. "
Exodus,16,5,"And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.' "
Exodus,16,6,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel: 'At even, then ye shall know that HaShem hath brought you out from the land of Egypt; "
Exodus,16,7,"and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of HaShem; for that He hath heard your murmurings against HaShem; and what are we, that ye murmur against us?' "
Exodus,16,8,"And Moses said: 'This shall be, when HaShem shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that HaShem heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him; and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against HaShem.' "
Exodus,16,9,And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel: Come near before HaShem; for He hath heard your murmurings.' 
Exodus,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of HaShem appeared in the cloud. "
Exodus,16,11,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,16,12,"'I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak unto them, saying: At dusk ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am HaShem your G-d.' "
Exodus,16,13,"And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp. "
Exodus,16,14,"And when the layer of dew was gone up, behold upon the face of the wilderness a fine, scale-like thing, fine as the hoar-frost on the ground. "
Exodus,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: 'What is it?' --for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them: 'It is the bread which HaShem hath given you to eat. "
Exodus,16,16,"This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded: Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.' "
Exodus,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. "
Exodus,16,18,"And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. "
Exodus,16,19,And Moses said unto them: 'Let no man leave of it till the morning.' 
Exodus,16,20,"Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was wroth with them. "
Exodus,16,21,"And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating; and as the sun waxed hot, it melted. "
Exodus,16,22,"And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. "
Exodus,16,23,"And he said unto them: 'This is that which HaShem hath spoken: To-morrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto HaShem. Bake that which ye will bake, and seethe that which ye will seethe; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.' "
Exodus,16,24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not rot, neither was there any worm therein. "
Exodus,16,25,And Moses said: 'Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto HaShem; to-day ye shall not find it in the field. 
Exodus,16,26,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.' "
Exodus,16,27,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none. "
Exodus,16,28,And HaShem said unto Moses: 'How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws? 
Exodus,16,29,"See that HaShem hath given you the sabbath; therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh clay.' "
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day. 
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. "
Exodus,16,32,"And Moses said: 'This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded: Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Take a jar, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before HaShem, to be kept throughout your generations.' "
Exodus,16,34,"As HaShem commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. "
Exodus,16,35,"And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. "
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.  
Exodus,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment of HaShem, and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink. "
Exodus,17,2,"Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said: 'Give us water that we may drink.' And Moses said unto them: 'Why strive ye with me? wherefore do ye try HaShem?' "
Exodus,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said: 'Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?' "
Exodus,17,4,"And Moses cried unto HaShem, saying: 'What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready to stone me.' "
Exodus,17,5,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. "
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.' And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. "
Exodus,17,7,"And the name of the place was called Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tried HaShem, saying: 'Is HaShem among us, or not?' "
Exodus,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. "
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses said unto Joshua: 'Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of G-d in my hand.' "
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. "
Exodus,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. "
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. "
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
Exodus,17,14,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.' "
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Adonai-nissi. "
Exodus,17,16,And he said: 'The hand upon the throne of HaShem: HaShem will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'  
Exodus,18,1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that G-d had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how that HaShem had brought Israel out of Egypt. "
Exodus,18,2,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, "
Exodus,18,3,and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said: 'I have been a stranger in a strange land'; 
Exodus,18,4,"and the name of the other was Eliezer: 'for the G-d of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.' "
Exodus,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of G-d; "
Exodus,18,6,"and he said unto Moses: 'I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.' "
Exodus,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. "
Exodus,18,8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that HaShem had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how HaShem delivered them. "
Exodus,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which HaShem had done to Israel, in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. "
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro said: 'Blessed be HaShem, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. "
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that HaShem is greater than all gods; yea, for that they dealt proudly against them.' "
Exodus,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for G-d; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before G-d. "
Exodus,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening. "
Exodus,18,14,"And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said: 'What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?' "
Exodus,18,15,And Moses said unto his father-in-law: 'Because the people come unto me to inquire of G-d; 
Exodus,18,16,"when they have a matter, it cometh unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of G-d, and His laws.' "
Exodus,18,17,And Moses' father-in-law said unto him: 'The thing that thou doest is not good. 
Exodus,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. "
Exodus,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and G-d be with thee: be thou for the people before G-d, and bring thou the causes unto G-d. "
Exodus,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. "
Exodus,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear G-d, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. "
Exodus,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves; so shall they make it easier for thee and bear the burden with thee. "
Exodus,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and G-d command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.' "
Exodus,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. "
Exodus,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. "
Exodus,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. "
Exodus,18,27,And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.  
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. "
Exodus,19,2,"And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. "
Exodus,19,3,"And Moses went up unto G-d, and HaShem called unto him out of the mountain, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: "
Exodus,19,4,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself. "
Exodus,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; "
Exodus,19,6,"and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.' "
Exodus,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which HaShem commanded him. "
Exodus,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said: 'All that HaShem hath spoken we will do.' And Moses reported the words of the people unto HaShem. "
Exodus,19,9,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever.' And Moses told the words of the people unto HaShem. "
Exodus,19,10,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments, "
Exodus,19,11,and be ready against the third day; for the third day HaShem will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
Exodus,19,12,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death; "
Exodus,19,13,"no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the ram's horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.' "
Exodus,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. "
Exodus,19,15,And he said unto the people: 'Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman.' 
Exodus,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. "
Exodus,19,17,And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet G-d; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
Exodus,19,18,"Now mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because HaShem descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. "
Exodus,19,19,"And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and G-d answered him by a voice. "
Exodus,19,20,"And HaShem came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount; and HaShem called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. "
Exodus,19,21,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto HaShem to gaze, and many of them perish. "
Exodus,19,22,"And let the priests also, that come near to HaShem, sanctify themselves, lest HaShem break forth upon them.' "
Exodus,19,23,"And Moses said unto HaShem: 'The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou didst charge us, saying: Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.' "
Exodus,19,24,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Go, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto HaShem, lest He break forth upon them.' "
Exodus,19,25,"So Moses went down unto the people, and told them. "
Exodus,20,1,"And G-d spoke all these words, saying: "
Exodus,20,2,"I am HaShem thy G-d, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. "
Exodus,20,3,Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. 
Exodus,20,4,"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; "
Exodus,20,5,"thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I HaShem thy G-d am a jealous G-d, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; "
Exodus,20,6,and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments. 
Exodus,20,7,Thou shalt not take the name of HaShem thy G-d in vain; for HaShem will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. 
Exodus,20,8,"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. "
Exodus,20,9,"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; "
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is a sabbath unto HaShem thy G-d, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; "
Exodus,20,11,"for in six days HaShem made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore HaShem blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. "
Exodus,20,12,"Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee. "

Exodus,20,14,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. "
Exodus,20,15,"And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off. "
Exodus,20,16,"And they said unto Moses: 'Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not G-d speak with us, lest we die.' "
Exodus,20,17,"And Moses said unto the people: 'Fear not; for G-d is come to prove you, and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not.' "
Exodus,20,18,And the people stood afar off; but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where G-d was. 
Exodus,20,19,And HaShem said unto Moses: Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
Exodus,20,20,"Ye shall not make with Me--gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you. "
Exodus,20,21,"An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come unto thee and bless thee. "
Exodus,20,22,"And if thou make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast profaned it. "
Exodus,20,23,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon. "

Exodus,21,2,"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. "
Exodus,21,3,"If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. "
Exodus,21,4,"If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. "
Exodus,21,5,"But if the servant shall plainly say: I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free; "
Exodus,21,6,"then his master shall bring him unto G-d, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. "
Exodus,21,7,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. "
Exodus,21,8,"If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed; to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. "
Exodus,21,9,"And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. "
Exodus,21,10,"If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish. "

Exodus,21,19,"if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. "
Exodus,21,20,"And if a man smite his bondman, or his bondwoman, with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished. "

Exodus,21,28,"And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. "
Exodus,21,29,"But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning hath been given to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. "
Exodus,21,30,"If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. "

Exodus,22,8,"For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: 'This is it,' the cause of both parties shall come before G-d; he whom G-d shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour. "
Exodus,22,9,"If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; "
Exodus,22,10,"the oath of HaShem shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. "

Exodus,22,19,"He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto HaShem only, shall be utterly destroyed. "
Exodus,22,20,"And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. "

Exodus,22,29,"Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me. "
Exodus,22,30,And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.  
Exodus,23,1,Thou shalt not utter a false report; put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
Exodus,23,2,Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert justice;

Exodus,23,9,"And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. "
Exodus,23,10,"And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in the increase thereof; "
Exodus,23,11,"but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. "
Exodus,23,12,"Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. "

Exodus,23,15,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib--for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall appear before Me empty; "
Exodus,23,16,"and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field; and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field. "
Exodus,23,17,Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the L-rd GOD. 
Exodus,23,18,Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning. 
Exodus,23,19,The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of HaShem thy G-d. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. 
Exodus,23,20,"Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. "
Exodus,23,21,"Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; be not rebellious against him; for he will not pardon your transgression; for My name is in him. "
Exodus,23,22,"But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. "
Exodus,23,23,"For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off. "
Exodus,23,24,"Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their doings; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. "

Exodus,23,26,"None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil. "
Exodus,23,27,"I will send My terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. "
Exodus,23,28,"And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. "
Exodus,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. "
Exodus,23,30,"By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. "
Exodus,23,31,"And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. "
Exodus,23,32,"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. "
Exodus,23,33,"They shall not dwell in thy land--lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods--for they will be a snare unto thee.  "
Exodus,24,1,"And unto Moses He said: 'Come up unto HaShem, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off; "
Exodus,24,2,and Moses alone shall come near unto HaShem; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.' 
Exodus,24,3,"And Moses came and told the people all the words of HaShem, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said: 'All the words which the L-rd hath spoken will we do.' "
Exodus,24,4,"And Moses wrote all the words of HaShem, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. "
Exodus,24,5,"And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto HaShem. "
Exodus,24,6,"And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he dashed against the altar. "
Exodus,24,7,"And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the hearing of the people; and they said: 'All that HaShem hath spoken will we do, and obey.' "
Exodus,24,8,"And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said: 'Behold the blood of the covenant, which HaShem hath made with you in agreement with all these words.' "
Exodus,24,9,"Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; "
Exodus,24,10,"and they saw the G-d of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness. "
Exodus,24,11,"And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand; and they beheld G-d, and did eat and drink. "
Exodus,24,12,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.' "
Exodus,24,13,"And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister; and Moses went up into the mount of G-d. "
Exodus,24,14,"And unto the elders he said: 'Tarry ye here for us, until we come back unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.' "
Exodus,24,15,"And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount. "
Exodus,24,16,"And the glory of HaShem abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. "
Exodus,24,17,And the appearance of the glory of HaShem was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
Exodus,24,18,"And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount; and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights. "
Exodus,25,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,25,2,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take My offering. "
Exodus,25,3,"And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass; "
Exodus,25,4,"and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair; "
Exodus,25,5,"and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood; "
Exodus,25,6,"oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; "
Exodus,25,7,"onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. "
Exodus,25,8,"And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. "
Exodus,25,9,"According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it. "
Exodus,25,10,"And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. "
Exodus,25,11,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. "

Exodus,25,16,And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. 
Exodus,25,17,"And thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. "
Exodus,25,18,"And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover. "
Exodus,25,19,"And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim of the two ends thereof. "
Exodus,25,20,"And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be. "
Exodus,25,21,And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 
Exodus,25,22,"And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. "
Exodus,25,23,"And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. "
Exodus,25,24,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. "
Exodus,25,25,"And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. "

Exodus,25,31,"And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it. "
Exodus,25,32,"And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candle-stick out of the other side thereof; "
Exodus,25,33,"three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the candlestick. "
Exodus,25,34,"And in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof. "
Exodus,25,35,"And a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick. "

Exodus,29,15,Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 
Exodus,29,16,"And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and dash it round about against the altar. "
Exodus,29,17,"And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head. "

"
Exodus,29,21,"And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons' garments with him. "
Exodus,29,22,"Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh; for it is a ram of consecration; "
Exodus,29,23,"and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before HaShem. "
Exodus,29,24,"And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before HaShem. "

Exodus,29,28,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of their sacrifices of peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto HaShem. "
Exodus,29,29,"And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them. "
Exodus,29,30,"Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, even he who cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. "
Exodus,29,31,"And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and seethe its flesh in a holy place. "
Exodus,29,32,"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Exodus,29,33,"And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. "
Exodus,29,34,"And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. "
Exodus,29,35,"And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou consecrate them. "
Exodus,29,36,"And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering, beside the other offerings of atonement; and thou shalt do the purification upon the altar when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. "
Exodus,29,37,"Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; thus shall the altar be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. "
Exodus,29,38,Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
Exodus,29,39,The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk. 
Exodus,29,40,And with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering. 
Exodus,29,41,"And the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Exodus,29,42,"It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before HaShem, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee. "
Exodus,29,43,And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tent shall be sanctified by My glory. 
Exodus,29,44,"And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar; Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to Me in the priest's office. "
Exodus,29,45,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their G-d. "
Exodus,29,46,"And they shall know that I am HaShem their G-d, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am HaShem their G-d. "
Exodus,30,1,And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; of acacia-wood shalt thou make it. 
Exodus,30,2,"A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. "
Exodus,30,3,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. "
Exodus,30,4,"And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it. "
Exodus,30,5,"And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold. "
Exodus,30,6,"And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the ark-cover that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. "
Exodus,30,7,"And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices; every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. "
Exodus,30,8,"And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before HaShem throughout your generations. "
Exodus,30,9,"Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon. "
Exodus,30,10,And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most holy unto HaShem.' 
Exodus,30,11,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,30,12,"'When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto HaShem, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. "
Exodus,30,13,"This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary--the shekel is twenty gerahs--half a shekel for an offering to HaShem. "
Exodus,30,14,"Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of HaShem. "
Exodus,30,15,"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of HaShem, to make atonement for your souls. "
Exodus,30,16,"And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before HaShem, to make atonement for your souls.' "
Exodus,30,17,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,30,18,"'Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. "
Exodus,30,19,And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; 
Exodus,30,20,"when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto HaShem; "
Exodus,30,21,"so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.' "
Exodus,30,22,"Moreover HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,30,23,"'Take thou also unto thee the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, "
Exodus,30,24,"and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. "
Exodus,30,25,"And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. "
Exodus,30,26,"And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, "
Exodus,30,27,"and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, "
Exodus,30,28,"and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. "
Exodus,30,29,"And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. "
Exodus,30,30,"And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest's office. "
Exodus,30,31,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations. "
Exodus,30,32,"Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof; it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. "
Exodus,30,33,"Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.' "
Exodus,30,34,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense; of each shall there be a like weight. "
Exodus,30,35,"And thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. "
Exodus,30,36,"And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy. "
Exodus,30,37,"And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves; it shall be unto thee holy for HaShem. "
Exodus,30,38,"Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.' "
Exodus,31,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,31,2,"'See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; "
Exodus,31,3,"and I have filled him with the spirit of G-d, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, "
Exodus,31,4,"to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, "
Exodus,31,5,"and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. "
Exodus,31,6,"And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: "
Exodus,31,7,"the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the ark-cover that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent; "
Exodus,31,8,"and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense; "
Exodus,31,9,"and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base; "
Exodus,31,10,"and the plaited garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office; "
Exodus,31,11,"and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.' "
Exodus,31,12,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,31,13,"'Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying: Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am HaShem who sanctify you. "
Exodus,31,14,"Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. "
Exodus,31,15,"Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to HaShem; whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. "
Exodus,31,16,"Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. "
Exodus,31,17,"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days HaShem made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.' "
Exodus,31,18,"And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of G-d. "
Exodus,32,1,"And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him: 'Up, make us a god who shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.' "
Exodus,32,2,"And Aaron said unto them: 'Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.' "
Exodus,32,3,"And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. "
Exodus,32,4,"And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said: 'This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,32,5,"And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said: 'To-morrow shall be a feast to HaShem.' "
Exodus,32,6,"And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to make merry. "
Exodus,32,7,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses: 'Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have dealt corruptly; "
Exodus,32,8,"they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said: This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.' "
Exodus,32,9,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people. "
Exodus,32,10,"Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.' "
Exodus,32,11,"And Moses besought HaShem his G-d, and said: 'HaShem, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people, that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? "
Exodus,32,12,"Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying: For evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against Thy people. "
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self, and saidst unto them: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.' "
Exodus,32,14,And HaShem repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people. 
Exodus,32,15,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. "
Exodus,32,16,"And the tables were the work of G-d, and the writing was the writing of G-d, graven upon the tables. "
Exodus,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses: 'There is a noise of war in the camp.' "
Exodus,32,18,"And he said: 'It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome, but the noise of them that sing do I hear.' "
Exodus,32,19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount. "
Exodus,32,20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. "
Exodus,32,21,"And Moses said unto Aaron: 'What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?' "
Exodus,32,22,"And Aaron said: 'Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil. "
Exodus,32,23,"So they said unto me: Make us a god, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. "
Exodus,32,24,"And I said unto them: Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off; so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.' "
Exodus,32,25,And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose--for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies-- 
Exodus,32,26,"then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whoso is on HaShem'S side, let him come unto me.' And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. "
Exodus,32,27,"And he said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' "
Exodus,32,28,And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
Exodus,32,29,"And Moses said: 'Consecrate yourselves to-day to HaShem, for every man hath been against his son and against his brother; that He may also bestow upon you a blessing this day.' "
Exodus,32,30,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: 'Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto HaShem, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.' "
Exodus,32,31,"And Moses returned unto HaShem, and said: 'Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold. "
Exodus,32,32,"Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.' "
Exodus,32,33,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. "
Exodus,32,34,"And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.' "
Exodus,32,35,"And HaShem smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. "
Exodus,33,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses: 'Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying: Unto thy seed will I give it-- "
Exodus,33,2,"and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite-- "
Exodus,33,3,unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee in the way.' 
Exodus,33,4,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man did put on him his ornaments. "
Exodus,33,5,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.' "
Exodus,33,6,And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward. 
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought HaShem went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp. "
Exodus,33,8,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. "
Exodus,33,9,"And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent; and HaShem spoke with Moses. "
Exodus,33,10,"And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. "
Exodus,33,11,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent. "
Exodus,33,12,"And Moses said unto HaShem: 'See, Thou sayest unto me: Bring up this people; and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in My sight. "
Exodus,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee, to the end that I may find grace in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people.' "
Exodus,33,14,"And He said: 'My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.' "
Exodus,33,15,"And he said unto Him: 'If Thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. "
Exodus,33,16,"For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in Thy sight, I and Thy people? is it not in that Thou goest with us, so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?' "
Exodus,33,17,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee by name.' "
Exodus,33,18,"And he said: 'Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory.' "
Exodus,33,19,"And He said: 'I will make all My goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of HaShem before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.' "
Exodus,33,20,"And He said: 'Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.' "
Exodus,33,21,"And HaShem said: 'Behold, there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock. "
Exodus,33,22,"And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by. "
Exodus,33,23,"And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen.' "
Exodus,34,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break. "
Exodus,34,2,"And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount. "
Exodus,34,3,"And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.' "
Exodus,34,4,"And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as HaShem had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. "
Exodus,34,5,"And HaShem descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of HaShem. "
Exodus,34,6,"And HaShem passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The HaShem, HaShem, G-d, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; "
Exodus,34,7,"keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.' "
Exodus,34,8,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. "
Exodus,34,9,"And he said: 'If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O L-rd, let the L-rd, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance.' "
Exodus,34,10,"And He said: 'Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of HaShem that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous. "
Exodus,34,11,"Observe thou that which I am commanding thee this day; behold, I am driving out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. "
Exodus,34,12,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. "
Exodus,34,13,"But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim. "
Exodus,34,14,"For thou shalt bow down to no other god; for HaShem, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous G-d; "
Exodus,34,15,"lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and they call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice; "
Exodus,34,16,"and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. "
Exodus,34,17,Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
Exodus,34,18,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. "
Exodus,34,19,"All that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males, the firstlings of ox and sheep. "
Exodus,34,20,"And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty. "
Exodus,34,21,"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. "
Exodus,34,22,"And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year. "
Exodus,34,23,"Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the L-rd GOD, the G-d of Israel. "
Exodus,34,24,"For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders; neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before HaShem thy G-d three times in the year. "
Exodus,34,25,Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
Exodus,34,26,The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of HaShem thy G-d. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.' 
Exodus,34,27,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.' "
Exodus,34,28,"And he was there with HaShem forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. "
Exodus,34,29,"And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth beams while He talked with him. "
Exodus,34,30,"And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face sent forth beams; and they were afraid to come nigh him. "
Exodus,34,31,And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him; and Moses spoke to them. 
Exodus,34,32,"And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandment all that HaShem had spoken with him in mount Sinai. "
Exodus,34,33,"And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. "
Exodus,34,34,"But when Moses went in before HaShem that He might speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out; and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. "
Exodus,34,35,"And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face sent forth beams; and Moses put the veil back upon his face, until he went in to speak with Him.  "
Exodus,35,1,"And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them: 'These are the words which HaShem hath commanded, that ye should do them. "
Exodus,35,2,"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to HaShem; whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death. "
Exodus,35,3,Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.' 
Exodus,35,4,"And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: 'This is the thing which HaShem commanded, saying: "
Exodus,35,5,"Take ye from among you an offering unto HaShem, whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, HaShem'S offering: gold, and silver, and brass; "
Exodus,35,6,"and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair; "
Exodus,35,7,"and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood; "
Exodus,35,8,"and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; "
Exodus,35,9,"and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. "
Exodus,35,10,"And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that HaShem hath commanded: "
Exodus,35,11,"the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; "
Exodus,35,12,"the ark, and the staves thereof, the ark-cover, and the veil of the screen; "
Exodus,35,13,"the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread; "
Exodus,35,14,"the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; "
Exodus,35,15,"and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; "
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; "
Exodus,35,17,"the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; "
Exodus,35,18,"the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; "
Exodus,35,19,"the plaited garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.' "
Exodus,35,20,And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
Exodus,35,21,"And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and brought HaShem'S offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments. "
Exodus,35,22,"And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought nose-rings, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and girdles, all jewels of gold; even every man that brought an offering of gold unto HaShem. "
Exodus,35,23,"And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them. "
Exodus,35,24,"Every one that did set apart an offering of silver and brass brought HaShem'S offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia-wood for any work of the service, brought it. "
Exodus,35,25,"And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. "
Exodus,35,26,And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair. 
Exodus,35,27,"And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; "
Exodus,35,28,"and the spice, and the oil, for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. "
Exodus,35,29,"The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto HaShem; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which HaShem had commanded by the hand of Moses to be made. "
Exodus,35,30,"And Moses said unto the children of Israel: 'See, HaShem hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. "
Exodus,35,31,"And He hath filled him with the spirit of G-d, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship. "
Exodus,35,32,"And to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, "
Exodus,35,33,"and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship. "
Exodus,35,34,"And He hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. "
Exodus,35,35,"Them hath He filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the craftsman, and of the skilful workman, and of the weaver in colours, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works. "
Exodus,36,1,"And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom HaShem hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that HaShem hath commanded.' "
Exodus,36,2,"And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart HaShem had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it. "
Exodus,36,3,"And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning. "
Exodus,36,4,"And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought. "
Exodus,36,5,"And they spoke unto Moses, saying: 'The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which HaShem commanded to make.' "
Exodus,36,6,"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying: 'Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.' So the people were restrained from bringing. "
Exodus,36,7,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. "
Exodus,36,8,"And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains: of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman made he them. "
Exodus,36,9,"The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had one measure. "
Exodus,36,10,And he coupled five curtains one to another; and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 
Exodus,36,11,And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain that was outmost in the first set; likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second set. 
Exodus,36,12,"Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one to another. "
Exodus,36,13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps; so the tabernacle was one. "
Exodus,36,14,And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he made them. 
Exodus,36,15,"The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain; the eleven curtains had one measure. "
Exodus,36,16,"And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. "
Exodus,36,17,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the first set, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second set. "
Exodus,36,18,"And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. "
Exodus,36,19,"And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above. "
Exodus,36,20,"And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia-wood, standing up. "
Exodus,36,21,"Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. "
Exodus,36,22,"Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. Thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. "
Exodus,36,23,And he made the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward. 
Exodus,36,24,"And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. "
Exodus,36,25,"And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, "
Exodus,36,26,"and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. "
Exodus,36,27,And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
Exodus,36,28,And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part; 
Exodus,36,29,"that they might be double beneath, and in like manner they should be complete unto the top thereof unto the first ring. Thus he did to both of them in the two corners. "
Exodus,36,30,"And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets: under every board two sockets. "
Exodus,36,31,"And he made bars of acacia-wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, "
Exodus,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. "
Exodus,36,33,And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other. 
Exodus,36,34,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. "
Exodus,36,35,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with the cherubim the work of the skilful workman made he it. "
Exodus,36,36,"And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks being of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. "
Exodus,36,37,"And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours; "
Exodus,36,38,and the five pillars of it with their hooks; and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass. 
Exodus,37,1,"And Bezalel made the ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it. "
Exodus,37,2,"And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. "
Exodus,37,3,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof: even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. "
Exodus,37,4,"And he made staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold. "
Exodus,37,5,"And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. "
Exodus,37,6,"And he made an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. "
Exodus,37,7,"And he made two cherubim of gold: of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the ark-cover: "
Exodus,37,8,"one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof. "
Exodus,37,9,"And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover were the faces of the cherubim. "
Exodus,37,10,"And he made the table of acacia-wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. "
Exodus,37,11,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about. "
Exodus,37,12,"And he made unto it a border of a hand-breadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about. "
Exodus,37,13,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof. "
Exodus,37,14,"Close by the border were the rings, the holders for the staves to bear the table. "
Exodus,37,15,"And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. "
Exodus,37,16,"And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the jars thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold. "
Exodus,37,17,"And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it. "
Exodus,37,18,"And there were six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof; "
Exodus,37,19,"three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower. So for the six branches going out of the candlestick. "
Exodus,37,20,"And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof; "
Exodus,37,21,"and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it. "
Exodus,37,22,Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 
Exodus,37,23,"And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold. "
Exodus,37,24,"Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. "
Exodus,37,25,"And he made the altar of incense of acacia-wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, four-square; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it. "
Exodus,37,26,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it; and he made unto it a crown of gold round about. "
Exodus,37,27,"And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for holders for staves wherewith to bear it. "
Exodus,37,28,"And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold. "
Exodus,37,29,"And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer. "
Exodus,38,1,"And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia-wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, four-square, and three cubits the height thereof. "
Exodus,38,2,And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it; and he overlaid it with brass. 
Exodus,38,3,"And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass. "
Exodus,38,4,"And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up. "
Exodus,38,5,"And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be holders for the staves. "
Exodus,38,6,"And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with brass. "
Exodus,38,7,"And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks. "
Exodus,38,8,"And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Exodus,38,9,"And he made the court; for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits. "
Exodus,38,10,"Their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. "
Exodus,38,11,"And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. "
Exodus,38,12,"And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. "
Exodus,38,13,And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
Exodus,38,14,"The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. "
Exodus,38,15,"And so for the other side; on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. "
Exodus,38,16,All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 
Exodus,38,17,And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
Exodus,38,18,"And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the weaver in colours, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. "
Exodus,38,19,"And their pillars were four, and their sockets four of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver. "
Exodus,38,20,"And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass. "
Exodus,38,21,"These are the accounts of the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were rendered according to the commandment of Moses, through the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.-- "
Exodus,38,22,"And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,38,23,"And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman, and a skilful workman, and a weaver in colours, in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.-- "
Exodus,38,24,"All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
Exodus,38,25,"And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three-score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: "
Exodus,38,26,"a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men. "
Exodus,38,27,"And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil: a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. "
Exodus,38,28,"And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. "
Exodus,38,29,And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 
Exodus,38,30,"And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar, "
Exodus,38,31,"and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about. "
Exodus,39,1,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made plaited garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,2,"And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. "
Exodus,39,3,"And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into threads, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman. "
Exodus,39,4,"They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together. "
Exodus,39,5,"And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece and like the work thereof: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,6,"And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel. "
Exodus,39,7,"And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,8,"And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. "
Exodus,39,9,"It was four-square; they made the breastplate double; a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double. "
Exodus,39,10,"And they set in it four rows of stones: a row of carnelian, topaz, and smaragd was the first row. "
Exodus,39,11,"And the second row, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and an emerald. "
Exodus,39,12,"And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst. "
Exodus,39,13,"And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were inclosed in fittings of gold in their settings. "
Exodus,39,14,"And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes. "
Exodus,39,15,"And they made upon the breastplate plaited chains, of wreathen work of pure gold. "
Exodus,39,16,"And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. "
Exodus,39,17,And they put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
Exodus,39,18,"And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof. "
Exodus,39,19,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward. "
Exodus,39,20,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. "
Exodus,39,21,"And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,22,"And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; "
Exodus,39,23,"and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent. "
Exodus,39,24,"And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. "
Exodus,39,25,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates: "
Exodus,39,26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,27,"And they made the tunics of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, "
Exodus,39,28,"and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, "
Exodus,39,29,"and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the weaver in colours; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,30,"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: HOLY TO THE HaShem. "
Exodus,39,31,"And they tied unto it a thread of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,39,32,"Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting; and the children of Israel did according to all that HaShem commanded Moses, so did they. "
Exodus,39,33,"And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets; "
Exodus,39,34,"and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen; "
Exodus,39,35,"the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the ark-cover; "
Exodus,39,36,"the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread; "
Exodus,39,37,"the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light; "
Exodus,39,38,"and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent; "
Exodus,39,39,"the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; "
Exodus,39,40,"the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting; "
Exodus,39,41,"the plaited garments for ministering in the holy place; the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. "
Exodus,39,42,"According to all that HaShem commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. "
Exodus,39,43,"And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as HaShem had commanded, even so had they done it. And Moses blessed them. "
Exodus,40,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Exodus,40,2,'On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
Exodus,40,3,"And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil. "
Exodus,40,4,"And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the bread that is upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. "
Exodus,40,5,"And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. "
Exodus,40,6,And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
Exodus,40,7,"And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein. "
Exodus,40,8,"And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. "
Exodus,40,9,"And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof; and it shall be holy. "
Exodus,40,10,"And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar; and the altar shall be most holy. "
Exodus,40,11,"And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it. "
Exodus,40,12,"And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. "
Exodus,40,13,"And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto Me in the priest's office. "
Exodus,40,14,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and put tunics upon them. "
Exodus,40,15,"And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto Me in the priest's office; and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.' "
Exodus,40,16,"Thus did Moses; according to all that HaShem commanded him, so did he. "
Exodus,40,17,"And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. "
Exodus,40,18,"And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars. "
Exodus,40,19,"And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,40,20,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the ark-cover above upon the ark. "
Exodus,40,21,"And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,40,22,"And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. "
Exodus,40,23,And he set a row of bread in order upon it before HaShem; as HaShem commanded Moses. 
Exodus,40,24,"And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. "
Exodus,40,25,And he lighted the lamps before HaShem; as HaShem commanded Moses. 
Exodus,40,26,And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil; 
Exodus,40,27,and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as HaShem commanded Moses. 
Exodus,40,28,And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
Exodus,40,29,"And the altar of burnt-offering he set at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,40,30,"And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash; "
Exodus,40,31,that Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and their feet thereat; 
Exodus,40,32,"when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they should wash; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Exodus,40,33,"And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work. "
Exodus,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of HaShem filled the tabernacle. "
Exodus,40,35,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of HaShem filled the tabernacle.-- "
Exodus,40,36,"And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys. "
Exodus,40,37,"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. "
Exodus,40,38,"For the cloud of HaShem was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.--  "
Leviticus,1,1,"THE HaShem called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying: "
Leviticus,1,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When any man of you bringeth an offering unto HaShem, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock. "
Leviticus,1,3,"If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before HaShem. "
Leviticus,1,4,And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
Leviticus,1,5,"And he shall kill the bullock before HaShem; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,1,6,"And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. "
Leviticus,1,7,"And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire. "
Leviticus,1,8,"And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; "
Leviticus,1,9,"but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,1,10,"And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish. "
Leviticus,1,11,"And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before HaShem; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,1,12,"And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. "
Leviticus,1,13,"But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,1,14,"And if his offering to HaShem be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. "
Leviticus,1,15,"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar. "
Leviticus,1,16,"And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes. "
Leviticus,1,17,"And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,2,1,"And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto HaShem, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon. "
Leviticus,2,2,"And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,2,3,But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of HaShem made by fire. 
Leviticus,2,4,"And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil. "
Leviticus,2,5,"And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. "
Leviticus,2,6,"Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering. "
Leviticus,2,7,"And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. "
Leviticus,2,8,"And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto HaShem; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. "
Leviticus,2,9,"And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar--an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,2,10,But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of HaShem made by fire. 
Leviticus,2,11,"No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto HaShem, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,2,12,As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto HaShem; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar. 
Leviticus,2,13,And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy G-d to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt. 
Leviticus,2,14,"And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto HaShem, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear. "
Leviticus,2,15,"And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering. "
Leviticus,2,16,"And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,3,1,"And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before HaShem. "
Leviticus,3,2,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,3,3,"And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto HaShem: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
Leviticus,3,4,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away hard by the kidneys. "
Leviticus,3,5,"And Aaron's sons shall make it smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,3,6,"And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto HaShem be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. "
Leviticus,3,7,"If he bring a lamb for his offering, then shall he present it before HaShem. "
Leviticus,3,8,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,3,9,"And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto HaShem: the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which he shall take away hard by the rump-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
Leviticus,3,10,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. "
Leviticus,3,11,And the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire unto HaShem. 
Leviticus,3,12,"And if his offering be a goat, then he shall present it before HaShem. "
Leviticus,3,13,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,3,14,"And he shall present thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto HaShem: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
Leviticus,3,15,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. "
Leviticus,3,16,"And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is HaShem'S. "
Leviticus,3,17,"It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood. "
Leviticus,4,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,4,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any one shall sin through error, in any of the things which HaShem hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them: "
Leviticus,4,3,"if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto HaShem for a sin-offering. "
Leviticus,4,4,"And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before HaShem; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before HaShem. "
Leviticus,4,5,"And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,4,6,"And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before HaShem, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. "
Leviticus,4,7,"And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before HaShem, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the remaining blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,4,8,"And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
Leviticus,4,9,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by kidneys, "
Leviticus,4,10,as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar of burnt-offering. 
Leviticus,4,11,"But the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, "
Leviticus,4,12,"even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt. "
Leviticus,4,13,"And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err, the thing being hid from the eyes of the assembly, and do any of the things which HaShem hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty: "
Leviticus,4,14,"when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,4,15,And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before HaShem; and the bullock shall be killed before HaShem. 
Leviticus,4,16,And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting. 
Leviticus,4,17,"And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before HaShem, in front of the veil. "
Leviticus,4,18,"And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before HaShem, that is in the tent of meeting, and all the remaining blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,4,19,"And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and make it smoke upon the altar. "
Leviticus,4,20,"Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,4,21,"And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin-offering for the assembly. "
Leviticus,4,22,"When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things which HaShem his G-d hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: "
Leviticus,4,23,"if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish. "
Leviticus,4,24,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before HaShem; it is a sin-offering. "
Leviticus,4,25,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,4,26,"And all the fat thereof shall he make smoke upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,4,27,"And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which HaShem hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty: "
Leviticus,4,28,"if his sin, which he hath sinned, be known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. "
Leviticus,4,29,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,4,30,"And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. "
Leviticus,4,31,"And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto HaShem; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,4,32,"And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. "
Leviticus,4,33,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,4,34,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. "
Leviticus,4,35,"And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of HaShem made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,5,1,"And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity; "
Leviticus,5,2,"or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from him that he is unclean; "
Leviticus,5,3,"or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty; "
Leviticus,5,4,"or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty in one of these things; "
Leviticus,5,5,"and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned; "
Leviticus,5,6,"and he shall bring his forfeit unto HaShem for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin. "
Leviticus,5,7,"And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his forfeit for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto HaShem: one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,5,8,"And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder. "
Leviticus,5,9,And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering. 
Leviticus,5,10,"And he shall prepare the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,5,11,"But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. "
Leviticus,5,12,"And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of HaShem made by fire; it is a sin-offering. "
Leviticus,5,13,"And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven; and the remnant shall be the priest's, as the meal-offering. "
Leviticus,5,14,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,5,15,"If any one commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the holy things of HaShem, then he shall bring his forfeit unto HaShem, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-offering. "
Leviticus,5,16,"And he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,5,17,"And if any one sin, and do any of the things which HaShem hath commanded not to be done, though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. "
Leviticus,5,18,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed, though he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven. "
Leviticus,5,19,It is a guilt-offering--he is certainly guilty before HaShem. 
Leviticus,5,20,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,5,21,"If any one sin, and commit a trespass against HaShem, and deal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbour; "
Leviticus,5,22,"or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein; "
Leviticus,5,23,"then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, "
Leviticus,5,24,"or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty. "
Leviticus,5,25,"And he shall bring his forfeit unto HaShem, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest. "
Leviticus,5,26,"And the priest shall make atonement for him before HaShem, and he shall be forgiven, concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby. "
Leviticus,6,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,6,2,"Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby. "
Leviticus,6,3,"And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. "
Leviticus,6,4,"And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. "
Leviticus,6,5,"And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. "
Leviticus,6,6,Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out. 
Leviticus,6,7,"And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before HaShem, in front of the altar. "
Leviticus,6,8,"And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,6,9,And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. 
Leviticus,6,10,"It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering. "
Leviticus,6,11,"Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of HaShem made by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. "
Leviticus,6,12,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,6,13,"This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto HaShem in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. "
Leviticus,6,14,"On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,6,15,"And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,6,16,And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten. 
Leviticus,6,17,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,6,18,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before HaShem; it is most holy. "
Leviticus,6,19,"The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,6,20,"Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. "
Leviticus,6,21,"But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. 22 Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy. "
Leviticus,6,22,
Leviticus,6,23,"And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. "
Leviticus,7,1,And this is the law of the guilt-offering: it is most holy. 
Leviticus,7,2,In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the guilt-offering: and the blood thereof shall be dashed against the altar round about. 
Leviticus,7,3,"And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, "
Leviticus,7,4,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. "
Leviticus,7,5,And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto HaShem; it is a guilt-offering. 
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 
Leviticus,7,7,"As is the sin-offering, so is the guilt-offering; there is one law for them; the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it. "
Leviticus,7,8,"And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered. "
Leviticus,7,9,"And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that offereth it. "
Leviticus,7,10,"And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another. "
Leviticus,7,11,"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one may offer unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,7,12,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. "
Leviticus,7,13,With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving. 
Leviticus,7,14,And of it he shall present one out of each offering for a gift unto HaShem; it shall be the priest's that dasheth the blood of the peace-offerings against the altar. 
Leviticus,7,15,And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it may be eaten. "
Leviticus,7,17,But that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 
Leviticus,7,18,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it; it shall be an abhorred thing, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. "
Leviticus,7,19,"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat thereof. "
Leviticus,7,20,"But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto HaShem, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,7,21,"And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, whether it be the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean detestable thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto HaShem, that soul shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,7,22,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,7,23,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. "
Leviticus,7,24,"And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. "
Leviticus,7,25,"For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering made by fire unto HaShem, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,7,26,"And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. "
Leviticus,7,27,"Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,7,28,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,7,29,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: He that offereth his sacrifice of peace-offerings unto HaShem shall bring his offering unto HaShem out of his sacrifice of peace-offerings. "
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands shall bring the offerings of HaShem made by fire: the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before HaShem. "
Leviticus,7,31,And the priest shall make the fat smoke upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 
Leviticus,7,32,And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of your sacrifices of peace-offerings. 
Leviticus,7,33,"He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. "
Leviticus,7,34,"For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving have I taken of the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel. "
Leviticus,7,35,"This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the offerings of HaShem made by fire, in the day when they were presented to minister unto HaShem in the priest's office; "
Leviticus,7,36,"which HaShem commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that they were anointed. It is a due for ever throughout their generations. "
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; "
Leviticus,7,38,"which HaShem commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto HaShem, in the wilderness of Sinai. "
Leviticus,8,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,8,2,"'Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; "
Leviticus,8,3,and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.' 
Leviticus,8,4,And Moses did as HaShem commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. 
Leviticus,8,5,And Moses said unto the congregation: 'This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded to be done.' 
Leviticus,8,6,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. "
Leviticus,8,7,"And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. "
Leviticus,8,8,And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. 
Leviticus,8,9,"And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,8,10,"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. "
Leviticus,8,11,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them. "
Leviticus,8,12,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. "
Leviticus,8,13,"And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,8,14,And the bullock of the sin-offering was brought; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering. 
Leviticus,8,15,"And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. "
Leviticus,8,16,"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it smoke upon the altar. "
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,8,18,And the ram of the burnt-offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
Leviticus,8,19,"And when it was killed, Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,8,20,"And when the ram was cut into its pieces, Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke. "
Leviticus,8,21,"And when the inwards and the legs were washed with water, Moses made the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto HaShem; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,8,22,"And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. "
Leviticus,8,23,"And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. "
Leviticus,8,24,"And Aaron's sons were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,8,25,"And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh. "
Leviticus,8,26,"And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before HaShem, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh. "
Leviticus,8,27,"And he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before HaShem. "
Leviticus,8,28,"And Moses took them from off their hands, and made them smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,8,29,"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before HaShem; it was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,8,30,"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. "
Leviticus,8,31,"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: 'Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it. "
Leviticus,8,32,And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 
Leviticus,8,33,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days. "
Leviticus,8,34,"As hath been done this day, so HaShem hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you. "
Leviticus,8,35,"And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of HaShem, that ye die not; for so I am commanded. "
Leviticus,8,36,And Aaron and his sons did all the things which HaShem commanded by the hand of Moses. 
Leviticus,9,1,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; "
Leviticus,9,2,"and he said unto Aaron: 'Take thee a bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before HaShem. "
Leviticus,9,3,"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; "
Leviticus,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before HaShem; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day HaShem appeareth unto you.' "
Leviticus,9,5,And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before HaShem. 
Leviticus,9,6,And Moses said: 'This is the thing which HaShem commanded that ye should do; that the glory of HaShem may appear unto you.' 
Leviticus,9,7,"And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as HaShem commanded.' "
Leviticus,9,8,"So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. "
Leviticus,9,9,"And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. "
Leviticus,9,10,"But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,9,11,And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp. 
Leviticus,9,12,"And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about. "
Leviticus,9,13,"And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar. "
Leviticus,9,14,"And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar. "
Leviticus,9,15,"And the people's offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. "
Leviticus,9,16,And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance. 
Leviticus,9,17,"And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning. "
Leviticus,9,18,"He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about, "
Leviticus,9,19,"and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver. "
Leviticus,9,20,"And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar. "
Leviticus,9,21,And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before HaShem; as Moses commanded. 
Leviticus,9,22,"And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings. "
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of HaShem appeared unto all the people. "
Leviticus,9,24,"And there came forth fire from before HaShem, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. "
Leviticus,10,1,"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before HaShem, which He had not commanded them. "
Leviticus,10,2,"And there came forth fire from before HaShem, and devoured them, and they died before HaShem. "
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said unto Aaron: 'This is it that HaShem spoke, saying: Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.' And Aaron held his peace. "
Leviticus,10,4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them: 'Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.' "
Leviticus,10,5,"So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said. "
Leviticus,10,6,"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons: 'Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tend your clothes, that ye die not, and that He be not wroth with all the congregation; but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which HaShem hath kindled. "
Leviticus,10,7,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of HaShem is upon you.' And they did according to the word of Moses. "
Leviticus,10,8,"And HaShem spoke unto Aaron, saying: "
Leviticus,10,9,"'Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. "
Leviticus,10,10,"And that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; "
Leviticus,10,11,and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which HaShem hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.' 
Leviticus,10,12,"And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: 'Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of HaShem made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy. "
Leviticus,10,13,"And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the offerings of HaShem made by fire; for so I am commanded. "
Leviticus,10,14,"And the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for they are given as thy due, and thy sons' due, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel. "
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave-offering before HaShem; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, as a due for ever; as HaShem hath commanded.' "
Leviticus,10,16,"And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt; and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying: "
Leviticus,10,17,"'Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and He hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before HaShem? "
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within; ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.' "
Leviticus,10,19,"And Aaron spoke unto Moses: 'Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before HaShem, and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of HaShem? "
Leviticus,10,20,"And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight. "
Leviticus,11,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them: "
Leviticus,11,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. "
Leviticus,11,3,"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat. "
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,5,"And the rock-badger, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,6,"And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you "
Leviticus,11,7,"And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,8,"Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,9,"These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat. "
Leviticus,11,10,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are a detestable thing unto you, "
Leviticus,11,11,"and they shall be a detestable thing unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in detestation. "
Leviticus,11,12,"Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing unto you. "
Leviticus,11,13,"And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are a detestable thing: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the ospray; "
Leviticus,11,14,"and the kite, and the falcon after its kinds; "
Leviticus,11,15,every raven after its kinds; 
Leviticus,11,16,"and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds; "
Leviticus,11,17,"and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl; "
Leviticus,11,18,"and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the carrion-vulture; "
Leviticus,11,19,"and the stork, and the heron after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat. "
Leviticus,11,20,All winged swarming things that go upon all fours are a detestable thing unto you. 
Leviticus,11,21,"Yet these may ye eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, which have jointed legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth; "
Leviticus,11,22,"even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kinds, and the bald locust after its kinds, and the cricket after its kinds, and the grasshopper after its kinds. "
Leviticus,11,23,"But all winged swarming things, which have four feet, are a detestable thing unto you. "
Leviticus,11,24,And by these ye shall become unclean; whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until even. 
Leviticus,11,25,"And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,11,26,"Every beast which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven footed, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you; every one that to toucheth them shall be unclean. "
Leviticus,11,27,"And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you; whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,11,28,"And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; they are unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,29,"And these are they which are unclean unto you among the swarming things that swarm upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds, "
Leviticus,11,30,"and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. "
Leviticus,11,31,"These are they which are unclean to you among all that swarm; whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,11,32,"And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean. "
Leviticus,11,33,"And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break. "
Leviticus,11,34,"All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink in every such vessel that may be drunk shall be unclean. "
Leviticus,11,35,"And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,36,Nevertheless a fountain or a cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean; but he who toucheth their carcass shall be unclean. 
Leviticus,11,37,"And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean. "
Leviticus,11,38,"But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you. "
Leviticus,11,39,"And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die, he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,11,40,"And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,11,41,And every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten. 
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all swarming things that swarm upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are a detestable thing. "
Leviticus,11,43,"Ye shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarmeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. "
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am HaShem your G-d; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy; neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of swarming thing that moveth upon the earth. "
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am HaShem that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your G-d; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. "
Leviticus,11,46,"This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that swarmeth upon the earth; "
Leviticus,11,47,"to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten. "
Leviticus,12,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,12,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. "
Leviticus,12,3,And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
Leviticus,12,4,"And she shall continue in the blood of purification three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled. "
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of purification threescore and six days. "
Leviticus,12,6,"And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest. "
Leviticus,12,7,"And he shall offer it before HaShem, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female. "
Leviticus,12,8,"And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean. "
Leviticus,13,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Leviticus,13,2,"When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests. "
Leviticus,13,3,"And the priest shall look upon the plague in the skin of the flesh; and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. "
Leviticus,13,4,"And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days. "
Leviticus,13,5,"And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague stay in its appearance, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more. "
Leviticus,13,6,"And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. "
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. "
Leviticus,13,8,"And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy. "
Leviticus,13,9,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest. "
Leviticus,13,10,"And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising, "
Leviticus,13,11,"it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up; for he is unclean. "
Leviticus,13,12,"And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest; "
Leviticus,13,13,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague; it is all turned white: he is clean. "
Leviticus,13,14,"But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. "
Leviticus,13,15,"And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy. "
Leviticus,13,16,"But if the raw flesh again be turned into white, then he shall come unto the priest; "
Leviticus,13,17,"and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean. "
Leviticus,13,18,"And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed, "
Leviticus,13,19,"and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest. "
Leviticus,13,20,"And the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil. "
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days. "
Leviticus,13,22,"And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. "
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. "
Leviticus,13,24,"Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white; "
Leviticus,13,25,"then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. "
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days. "
Leviticus,13,27,"And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day; if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. "
Leviticus,13,28,"And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim, it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burning. "
Leviticus,13,29,"And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard, "
Leviticus,13,30,"then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. "
Leviticus,13,31,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days. "
Leviticus,13,32,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin, "
Leviticus,13,33,"then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more. "
Leviticus,13,34,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. "
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing, "
Leviticus,13,36,"then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair: he is unclean. "
Leviticus,13,37,"But if the scall stay in its appearance, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. "
Leviticus,13,38,"And if a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; "
Leviticus,13,39,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin: he is clean. "
Leviticus,13,40,"And if a man's hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. "
Leviticus,13,41,"And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead-bald; yet is he clean. "
Leviticus,13,42,"But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. "
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, "
Leviticus,13,44,"he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean: his plague is in his head. "
Leviticus,13,45,"And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry: 'Unclean, unclean.' "
Leviticus,13,46,All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be. 
Leviticus,13,47,"And when the plague of leprosy is in a garment, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment; "
Leviticus,13,48,"or in the warp, or in the woof, whether they be of linen, or of wool; or in a skin, or in any thing made of skin. "
Leviticus,13,49,"If the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown unto the priest. "
Leviticus,13,50,"And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days. "
Leviticus,13,51,"And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for, the plague is a malignant leprosy: it is unclean. "
Leviticus,13,52,"And he shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, whether it be of wool or of linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is; for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. "
Leviticus,13,53,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; "
Leviticus,13,54,"then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more. "
Leviticus,13,55,"And the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its colour, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without. "
Leviticus,13,56,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof. "
Leviticus,13,57,"And if it appear still in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, it is breaking out, thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. "
Leviticus,13,58,"And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. "
Leviticus,13,59,"This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. "
Leviticus,14,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,14,2,This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest. 
Leviticus,14,3,"And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; "
Leviticus,14,4,"then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. "
Leviticus,14,5,And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. "
Leviticus,14,7,"And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field. "
Leviticus,14,8,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he may come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. "
Leviticus,14,9,"And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. "
Leviticus,14,10,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. "
Leviticus,14,11,"And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before HaShem, at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,14,12,"And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,13,"And he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the guilt-offering; it is most holy. "
Leviticus,14,14,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. "
Leviticus,14,15,"And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. "
Leviticus,14,16,"And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,17,"And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt-offering. "
Leviticus,14,18,And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed; and the priest shall make atonement for him before HaShem. 
Leviticus,14,19,"And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,14,20,"And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean. "
Leviticus,14,21,"And if he be poor, and his means suffice not, then he shall take one he-lamb for a guilt-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil; "
Leviticus,14,22,"and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,14,23,"And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,24,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,25,"And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. "
Leviticus,14,26,And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand. 
Leviticus,14,27,And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before HaShem. 
Leviticus,14,28,"And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering. "
Leviticus,14,29,"And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,30,"And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; "
Leviticus,14,31,"even such as his means suffice for, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before HaShem. "
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means suffice not for that which pertaineth to his cleansing. "
Leviticus,14,33,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Leviticus,14,34,"When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; "
Leviticus,14,35,"then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying: 'There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.' "
Leviticus,14,36,"And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house. "
Leviticus,14,37,"And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall; "
Leviticus,14,38,"then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. "
Leviticus,14,39,"And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; "
Leviticus,14,40,"then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city. "
Leviticus,14,41,"And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place. "
Leviticus,14,42,"And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. "
Leviticus,14,43,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that the stones have been taken out, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it is plastered; "
Leviticus,14,44,"then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house: it is unclean. "
Leviticus,14,45,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. "
Leviticus,14,46,Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 
Leviticus,14,47,And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
Leviticus,14,48,"And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. "
Leviticus,14,49,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. "
Leviticus,14,50,And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
Leviticus,14,51,"And he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. "
Leviticus,14,52,"And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar-wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet. "
Leviticus,14,53,But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field; so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean. 
Leviticus,14,54,"This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall; "
Leviticus,14,55,"and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house; "
Leviticus,14,56,"and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot; "
Leviticus,14,57,"to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean; this is the law of leprosy. "
Leviticus,15,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying: "
Leviticus,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, his issue is unclean. "
Leviticus,15,3,"And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. "
Leviticus,15,4,Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and every thing whereon he sitteth shall be unclean. 
Leviticus,15,5,"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,6,"And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,7,"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,8,"And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,9,And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean. 
Leviticus,15,10,"And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even; and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,11,"And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,12,"And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. "
Leviticus,15,13,"And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. "
Leviticus,15,14,"And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before HaShem unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest. "
Leviticus,15,15,"And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before HaShem for his issue. "
Leviticus,15,16,"And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,17,"And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the flow of seed, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,18,"The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,19,"And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days; and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,20,And every thing that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean; every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 
Leviticus,15,21,"And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,22,"And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,23,"And if he be on the bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,24,"And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. "
Leviticus,15,25,"And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean. "
Leviticus,15,26,"Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity; and every thing whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity. "
Leviticus,15,27,"And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
Leviticus,15,28,"But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. "
Leviticus,15,29,"And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,15,30,"And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before HaShem for the issue of her uncleanness. "
Leviticus,15,31,"Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My tabernacle that is in the midst of them. "
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him from whom the flow of seed goeth out, so that he is unclean thereby; "
Leviticus,15,33,"and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of them that have an issue, whether it be a man, or a woman; and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. "
Leviticus,16,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before HaShem, and died; "
Leviticus,16,2,"and HaShem said unto Moses: 'Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the ark-cover which is upon the ark; that he die not; for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover. "
Leviticus,16,3,"Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,16,4,"He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired; they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on. "
Leviticus,16,5,"And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering. "
Leviticus,16,6,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house. "
Leviticus,16,7,"And he shall take the two goats, and set them before HaShem at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Leviticus,16,8,"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for HaShem, and the other lot for Azazel. "
Leviticus,16,9,"And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for HaShem, and offer him for a sin-offering. "
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before HaShem, to make atonement over him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness. "
Leviticus,16,11,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself. "
Leviticus,16,12,"And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before HaShem, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil. "
Leviticus,16,13,"And he shall put the incense upon the fire before HaShem, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not. "
Leviticus,16,14,"And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the ark-cover on the east; and before the ark-cover shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. "
Leviticus,16,15,"Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the ark-cover, and before the ark-cover. "
Leviticus,16,16,"And he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. "
Leviticus,16,17,"And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. "
Leviticus,16,18,"And he shall go out unto the altar that is before HaShem, and make atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. "
Leviticus,16,19,"And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel. "
Leviticus,16,20,"And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat. "
Leviticus,16,21,"And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of an appointed man into the wilderness. "
Leviticus,16,22,And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land which is cut off; and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 
Leviticus,16,23,"And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there. "
Leviticus,16,24,"And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place and put on his other vestments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. "
Leviticus,16,25,And the fat of the sin-offering shall he make smoke upon the altar. 
Leviticus,16,26,"And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. "
Leviticus,16,27,"And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. "
Leviticus,16,28,"And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. "
Leviticus,16,29,"And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you. "
Leviticus,16,30,"For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before HaShem. "
Leviticus,16,31,"It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever. "
Leviticus,16,32,"And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments. "
Leviticus,16,33,"And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. "
Leviticus,16,34,"And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year.' And he did as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,17,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,17,2,"Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded, saying: "
Leviticus,17,3,"What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, "
Leviticus,17,4,"and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to present it as an offering unto HaShem before the tabernacle of HaShem, blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people. "
Leviticus,17,5,"To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto HaShem, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,17,6,"And the priest shall dash the blood against the altar of HaShem at the door of the tent of meeting, and make the fat smoke for a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,17,7,"And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. "
Leviticus,17,8,"And thou shalt say unto them: Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice, "
Leviticus,17,9,"and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto HaShem, even that man shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,17,10,"And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. "
Leviticus,17,11,For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. 
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I said unto the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. "
Leviticus,17,13,"And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that taketh in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. "
Leviticus,17,14,"For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof; therefore I said unto the children of Israel: Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. "
Leviticus,17,15,"And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even; then shall he be clean. "
Leviticus,17,16,"But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity. "
Leviticus,18,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,18,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,18,3,"After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes. "
Leviticus,18,4,"Mine ordinances shall ye do, and My statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,18,5,"Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,18,6,"None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness. I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,18,7,"The nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. "
Leviticus,18,8,The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. 
Leviticus,18,9,"The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. "
Leviticus,18,10,"The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness. "
Leviticus,18,11,"The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. "
Leviticus,18,12,Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. 
Leviticus,18,13,Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister; for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. 
Leviticus,18,14,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. "
Leviticus,18,15,Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son' wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
Leviticus,18,16,Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. 
Leviticus,18,17,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they are near kinswomen; it is lewdness. "
Leviticus,18,18,"And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her lifetime. "
Leviticus,18,19,"And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. "
Leviticus,18,20,"And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. "
Leviticus,18,21,"And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy G-d: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,18,22,"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination. "
Leviticus,18,23,"And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion. "
Leviticus,18,24,"Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you. "
Leviticus,18,25,"And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomited out her inhabitants. "
Leviticus,18,26,"Ye therefore shall keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you-- "
Leviticus,18,27,"for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled-- "
Leviticus,18,28,"that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. "
Leviticus,18,29,"For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. "
Leviticus,18,30,"Therefore shall ye keep My charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,19,2,"Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: Ye shall be holy; for I HaShem your G-d am holy. "
Leviticus,19,3,"Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep My sabbaths: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,4,"Turn ye not unto the idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,5,"And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto HaShem, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted. "
Leviticus,19,6,"It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. "
Leviticus,19,7,"And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it shall not be accepted. "
Leviticus,19,8,"But every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of HaShem; and that soul shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,19,9,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. "
Leviticus,19,10,"And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,11,"Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. "
Leviticus,19,12,"And ye shall not swear by My name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy G-d: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,13,"Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. "
Leviticus,19,14,"Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy G-d: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,15,"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor favour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. "
Leviticus,19,16,Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am HaShem. 
Leviticus,19,17,"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. "
Leviticus,19,18,"Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,19,Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed; neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. 
Leviticus,19,20,"And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. "
Leviticus,19,21,"And he shall bring his forfeit unto HaShem, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt-offering. "
Leviticus,19,22,And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before HaShem for his sin which he hath sinned; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned. 
Leviticus,19,23,"And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be eaten. "
Leviticus,19,24,"And in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,25,"But in the fifth year may ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,26,Ye shall not eat with the blood; neither shall ye practise divination nor soothsaying. 
Leviticus,19,27,"Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. "
Leviticus,19,28,"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,29,"Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness. "
Leviticus,19,30,"Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,31,"Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,32,"Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy G-d: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,19,33,"And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. "
Leviticus,19,34,"The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,19,35,"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. "
Leviticus,19,36,"Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. "
Leviticus,19,37,"And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,20,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,20,2,"Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel: Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. "
Leviticus,20,3,"I also will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile My sanctuary, and to profane My holy name. "
Leviticus,20,4,"And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death; "
Leviticus,20,5,"then I will set My face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech, from among their people. "
Leviticus,20,6,"And the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits, to go astray after them, I will even set My face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. "
Leviticus,20,7,"Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,20,8,"And keep ye My statutes, and do them: I am HaShem who sanctify you. "
Leviticus,20,9,For whatsoever man there be that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. 
Leviticus,20,10,"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. "
Leviticus,20,11,And the man that lieth with his father's wife--he hath uncovered his father's nakedness--both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
Leviticus,20,12,"And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have wrought corruption; their blood shall be upon them. "
Leviticus,20,13,"And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. "
Leviticus,20,14,"And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. "
Leviticus,20,15,"And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast. "
Leviticus,20,16,"And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. "
Leviticus,20,17,"And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness: it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. "
Leviticus,20,18,"And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness--he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood--both of them shall be cut off from among their people. "
Leviticus,20,19,"And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister; for he hath made naked his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity. "
Leviticus,20,20,And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife--he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness--they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
Leviticus,20,21,"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. "
Leviticus,20,22,"Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. "
Leviticus,20,23,"And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. "
Leviticus,20,24,"But I have said unto you: 'Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am HaShem your G-d, who have set you apart from the peoples. "
Leviticus,20,25,"Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and ye shall not make your souls detestable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean. "
Leviticus,20,26,"And ye shall be holy unto Me; for I HaShem am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine. "
Leviticus,20,27,"A man also or a woman that divineth by a ghost or a familiar spirit, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them. "
Leviticus,21,1,"And HaShem said unto Moses: Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them: There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people; "
Leviticus,21,2,"except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother; "
Leviticus,21,3,"and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself. "
Leviticus,21,4,"He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. "
Leviticus,21,5,"They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. "
Leviticus,21,6,"They shall be holy unto their G-d, and not profane the name of their G-d; for the offerings of HaShem made by fire, the bread of their G-d, they do offer; therefore they shall be holy. "
Leviticus,21,7,"They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his G-d. "
Leviticus,21,8,"Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy G-d; he shall be holy unto thee; for I HaShem, who sanctify you, am holy. "
Leviticus,21,9,"And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. "
Leviticus,21,10,"And the priest that is highest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; "
Leviticus,21,11,"neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; "
Leviticus,21,12,"neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his G-d; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his G-d is upon him: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,21,13,And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
Leviticus,21,14,"A widow, or one divorced, or a profaned woman, or a harlot, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. "
Leviticus,21,15,And he shall not profane his seed among his people; for I am HaShem who sanctify him. 
Leviticus,21,16,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,21,17,"Speak unto Aaron, saying: Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his G-d. "
Leviticus,21,18,"For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath any thing maimed, or anything too long, "
Leviticus,21,19,"or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, "
Leviticus,21,20,"or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath his eye overspread, or is scabbed, or scurvy, or hath his stones crushed; "
Leviticus,21,21,"no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of HaShem made by fire; he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his G-d. "
Leviticus,21,22,"He may eat the bread of his G-d, both of the most holy, and of the holy. "
Leviticus,21,23,"Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not My holy places; for I am HaShem who sanctify them. "
Leviticus,21,24,"So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. "
Leviticus,22,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,22,2,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto Me, and that they profane not My holy name: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,3,"Say unto them: Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto HaShem, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,4,"What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue, he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any one that is unclean by the dead; or from whomsoever the flow of seed goeth out; "
Leviticus,22,5,"or whosoever toucheth any swarming thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; "
Leviticus,22,6,"the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. "
Leviticus,22,7,"And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. "
Leviticus,22,8,"That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,9,"They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am HaShem who sanctify them. "
Leviticus,22,10,"There shall no common man eat of the holy thing; a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. "
Leviticus,22,11,"But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they may eat of his bread. "
Leviticus,22,12,"And if a priest's daughter be married unto a common man, she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things. "
Leviticus,22,13,"But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's bread; but there shall no common man eat thereof. "
Leviticus,22,14,"And if a man eat of the holy thing through error, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. "
Leviticus,22,15,"And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto HaShem; "
Leviticus,22,16,"and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things; for I am HaShem who sanctify them. "
Leviticus,22,17,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,22,18,"Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that bringeth his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will-offerings, which are brought unto HaShem for a burnt-offering; "
Leviticus,22,19,"that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. "
Leviticus,22,20,"But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not bring; for it shall not be acceptable for you. "
Leviticus,22,21,"And whosoever bringeth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto HaShem in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. "
Leviticus,22,22,"Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scabbed, or scurvy, ye shall not offer these unto HaShem, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,23,"Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing too long or too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. "
Leviticus,22,24,"That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, ye shall not offer unto HaShem; neither shall ye do thus in your land. "
Leviticus,22,25,"Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your G-d of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you. "
Leviticus,22,26,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,22,27,"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; but from the eighth day and thenceforth it may be accepted for an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,28,"And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. "
Leviticus,22,29,"And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto HaShem, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. "
Leviticus,22,30,On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am HaShem. 
Leviticus,22,31,"And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,22,32,"And ye shall not profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am HaShem who hallow you, "
Leviticus,22,33,"that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your G-d: I am HaShem.  "
Leviticus,23,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,23,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The appointed seasons of HaShem, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons. "
Leviticus,23,3,"Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto HaShem in all your dwellings. "
Leviticus,23,4,"These are the appointed seasons of HaShem, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. "
Leviticus,23,5,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is HaShem'S passover. "
Leviticus,23,6,And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto HaShem; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. 
Leviticus,23,7,In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 
Leviticus,23,8,And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 
Leviticus,23,9,And HaShem spoke unto Moses saying: 
Leviticus,23,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. "
Leviticus,23,11,"And he shall wave the sheaf before HaShem, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. "
Leviticus,23,12,"And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,13,"And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto HaShem for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. "
Leviticus,23,14,"And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your G-d; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. "
Leviticus,23,15,"And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete; "
Leviticus,23,16,even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto HaShem. 
Leviticus,23,17,"Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,18,"And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto HaShem, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,19,"And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings. "
Leviticus,23,20,"And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before HaShem, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to HaShem for the priest. "
Leviticus,23,21,And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 
Leviticus,23,22,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,23,23,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,23,24,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation. "
Leviticus,23,25,Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem. 
Leviticus,23,26,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,23,27,"Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,28,"And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,23,29,"For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. "
Leviticus,23,30,"And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. "
Leviticus,23,31,Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
Leviticus,23,32,"It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. "
Leviticus,23,33,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,23,34,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 
Leviticus,23,36,Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 
Leviticus,23,37,"These are the appointed seasons of HaShem, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto HaShem, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; "
Leviticus,23,38,"beside the sabbaths of HaShem, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,23,39,"Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of HaShem seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. "
Leviticus,23,40,"And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before HaShem your G-d seven days. "
Leviticus,23,41,And ye shall keep it a feast unto HaShem seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month. 
Leviticus,23,42,Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; 
Leviticus,23,43,"that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,23,44,And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of HaShem.  
Leviticus,24,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,24,2,"'Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. "
Leviticus,24,3,"Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning before HaShem continually; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. "
Leviticus,24,4,He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before HaShem continually. 
Leviticus,24,5,"And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake. "
Leviticus,24,6,"And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before HaShem. "
Leviticus,24,7,"And thou shalt put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial-part, even an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,24,8,"Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before HaShem continually; it is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. "
Leviticus,24,9,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of HaShem made by fire, a perpetual due.' "
Leviticus,24,10,"And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. "
Leviticus,24,11,"And the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. "
Leviticus,24,12,"And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of HaShem. "
Leviticus,24,13,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,24,14,"'Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. "
Leviticus,24,15,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: Whosoever curseth his G-d shall bear his sin. "
Leviticus,24,16,"And he that blasphemeth the name of HaShem, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death. "
Leviticus,24,17,And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death. 
Leviticus,24,18,And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life. 
Leviticus,24,19,"And if a man maim his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: "
Leviticus,24,20,"breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. "
Leviticus,24,21,And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. 
Leviticus,24,22,"Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the home-born; for I am HaShem your G-d.' "
Leviticus,24,23,"And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Leviticus,25,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying: "
Leviticus,25,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the produce thereof. "
Leviticus,25,4,"But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto HaShem; thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. "
Leviticus,25,5,"That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather; it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. "
Leviticus,25,6,"And the sabbath-produce of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for the settler by thy side that sojourn with thee; "
Leviticus,25,7,"and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food. "
Leviticus,25,8,"And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. "
Leviticus,25,9,Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye make proclamation with the horn throughout all your land. 
Leviticus,25,10,"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. "
Leviticus,25,11,"A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines. "
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. 
Leviticus,25,13,In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. 
Leviticus,25,14,"And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not wrong one another. "
Leviticus,25,15,"According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee. "
Leviticus,25,16,"According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of crops doth he sell unto thee. "
Leviticus,25,17,And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy G-d; for I am HaShem your G-d. 
Leviticus,25,18,"Wherefore ye shall do My statutes, and keep Mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. "
Leviticus,25,19,"And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye have enough, and dwell therein in safety. "
Leviticus,25,20,"And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; "
Leviticus,25,21,"then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. "
Leviticus,25,22,"And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store. "
Leviticus,25,23,And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and settlers with Me. 
Leviticus,25,24,And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 
Leviticus,25,25,"If thy brother be waxen poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. "
Leviticus,25,26,"And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find sufficient means to redeem it; "
Leviticus,25,27,"then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession. "
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he have not sufficient means to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. "
Leviticus,25,29,"And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. "
Leviticus,25,30,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee. "
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee. "
Leviticus,25,32,"But as for the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption. "
Leviticus,25,33,"And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. "
Leviticus,25,34,But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold; for that is their perpetual possession. 
Leviticus,25,35,"And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his means fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a settler shall he live with thee. "
Leviticus,25,36,Take thou no interest of him or increase; but fear thy G-d; that thy brother may live with thee. 
Leviticus,25,37,"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase. "
Leviticus,25,38,"I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d. "
Leviticus,25,39,"And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee, thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant. "
Leviticus,25,40,"As a hired servant, and as a settler, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee. "
Leviticus,25,41,"Then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. "
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondmen. "
Leviticus,25,43,Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy G-d. 
Leviticus,25,44,"And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou mayest have: of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. "
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they may be your possession. "
Leviticus,25,46,"And ye may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession: of them may ye take your bondmen for ever; but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour. "
Leviticus,25,47,"And if a stranger who is a settler with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger who is a settler with thee, or to the offshoot of a stranger's family, "
Leviticus,25,48,after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him; 
Leviticus,25,49,"or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself. "
Leviticus,25,50,And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. 
Leviticus,25,51,"If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. "
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. "
Leviticus,25,53,As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him; he shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he be not redeemed by any of these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. "
Leviticus,25,55,For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am HaShem your G-d. 
Leviticus,26,1,"Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am HaShem your G-d. "
Leviticus,26,2,"Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,26,3,"If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them; "
Leviticus,26,4,"then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. "
Leviticus,26,5,"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough, and dwell in your land safely. "
Leviticus,26,6,"And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. "
Leviticus,26,7,"And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. "
Leviticus,26,8,"And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. "
Leviticus,26,9,"And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish My covenant with you. "
Leviticus,26,10,"And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new. "
Leviticus,26,11,"And I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you. "
Leviticus,26,12,"And I will walk among you, and will be your G-d, and ye shall be My people. "
Leviticus,26,13,"I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright. "
Leviticus,26,14,"But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments; "
Leviticus,26,15,"and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant; "
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail, and the soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. "
Leviticus,26,17,"And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies; they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. "
Leviticus,26,18,"And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. "
Leviticus,26,19,"And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass. "
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her produce, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. "
Leviticus,26,21,"And if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will not hearken unto Me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. "
Leviticus,26,22,"And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. "
Leviticus,26,23,"And if in spite of these things ye will not be corrected unto Me, but will walk contrary unto Me; "
Leviticus,26,24,"then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. "
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. "
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. "
Leviticus,26,27,"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me; "
Leviticus,26,28,then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
Leviticus,26,29,"And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. "
Leviticus,26,30,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you. "
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. "
Leviticus,26,32,And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 
Leviticus,26,33,"And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. "
Leviticus,26,34,"Then shall the land be paid her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and repay her sabbaths. "
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. "
Leviticus,26,36,"And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. "
Leviticus,26,37,"And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. "
Leviticus,26,38,"And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. "
Leviticus,26,39,And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 
Leviticus,26,40,"And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their treachery which they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary unto Me. "
Leviticus,26,41,"I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity; "
Leviticus,26,42,"then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. "
Leviticus,26,43,"For the land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected Mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes. "
Leviticus,26,44,"And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am HaShem their G-d. "
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their G-d: I am HaShem. "
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which HaShem made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. "
Leviticus,27,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Leviticus,27,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons unto HaShem, according to thy valuation, "
Leviticus,27,3,"then thy valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
Leviticus,27,4,"And if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels. "
Leviticus,27,5,"And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. "
Leviticus,27,6,"And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver. "
Leviticus,27,7,"And if it be from sixty years old and upward: if it be a male, then thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. "
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he be too poor for thy valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him that vowed shall the priest value him. "
Leviticus,27,9,"And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto HaShem, all that any man giveth of such unto HaShem shall be holy. "
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. "
Leviticus,27,11,"And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto HaShem, then he shall set the beast before the priest. "
Leviticus,27,12,"And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be. "
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy valuation. "
Leviticus,27,14,"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto HaShem, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand. "
Leviticus,27,15,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his. "
Leviticus,27,16,"And if a man shall sanctify unto HaShem part of the field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing thereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. "
Leviticus,27,17,"If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand. "
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy valuation. "
Leviticus,27,19,"And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. "
Leviticus,27,20,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. "
Leviticus,27,21,"But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto HaShem, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. "
Leviticus,27,22,"And if he sanctify unto HaShem a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession; "
Leviticus,27,23,"then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. "
Leviticus,27,25,And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 
Leviticus,27,26,"Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a firstling to HaShem, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is HaShem'S. "
Leviticus,27,27,"And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation. "
Leviticus,27,28,"Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto HaShem of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,27,29,"None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. "
Leviticus,27,30,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is HaShem'S; it is holy unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,27,31,"And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. "
Leviticus,27,32,"And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto HaShem. "
Leviticus,27,33,"He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. "
Leviticus,27,34,"These are the commandments, which HaShem commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.  "
Numbers,1,1,"AND THE HaShem spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after the were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: "
Numbers,1,2,"'Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, by their polls; "
Numbers,1,3,"from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: ye shall number them by their hosts, even thou and Aaron. "
Numbers,1,4,"And with you there shall be a man of every tribe, every one head of his fathers' house. "
Numbers,1,5,"And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur. "

Numbers,1,16,"These were the elect of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel. "
Numbers,1,17,And Moses and Aaron took these men that are pointed out by name. 
Numbers,1,18,"And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. "
Numbers,1,19,"As HaShem commanded Moses, so did he number them in the wilderness of Sinai. "
Numbers,1,20,"And the children of Reuben, Israel's first-born, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; "
Numbers,1,21,"those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. "

Numbers,1,44,"These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men; they were each one for his fathers' house. "
Numbers,1,45,"And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; "
Numbers,1,46,even all those that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
Numbers,1,47,But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. 
Numbers,1,48,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,1,49,"'Howbeit the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel; "
Numbers,1,50,"but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it; they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. "
Numbers,1,51,"And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death. "
Numbers,1,52,"And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man with his own camp, and every man with his own standard, according to their hosts. "
Numbers,1,53,"But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.' "
Numbers,1,54,"Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that HaShem commanded Moses, so did they. "
Numbers,2,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,2,2,"'The children of Israel shall pitch by their fathers' houses; every man with his own standard, according to the ensigns; a good way off shall they pitch round about the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,2,3,"Now those that pitch on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Judah being Nahshon the son of Amminadab, "
Numbers,2,4,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred; "
Numbers,2,5,"and those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar; the prince of the children of Issachar being Nethanel the son of Zuar, "
Numbers,2,6,"and his host, even those that were numbered thereof, fifty and four thousand and four hundred; "
Numbers,2,7,"and the tribe of Zebulun; the prince of the children of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon, "
Numbers,2,8,"and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, fifty and seven thousand and four hundred; "
Numbers,2,9,"all that were numbered of the camp of Judah being a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts; they shall set forth first. "
Numbers,2,10,"On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Reuben being Elizur the son of Shedeur, "
Numbers,2,11,"and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, forty and six thousand and five hundred; "
Numbers,2,12,"and those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon; the prince of the children of Simeon being Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, "
Numbers,2,13,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and nine thousand and three hundred; "
Numbers,2,14,"and the tribe of Gad; the prince of the children of Gad being Eliasaph the son of Reuel, "
Numbers,2,15,"and his host, even those that were numbered of them, forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty; "
Numbers,2,16,"all that were numbered of the camp of Reuben being a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts; and they shall set forth second. "
Numbers,2,17,"Then the tent of meeting, with the camp of the Levites, shall set forward in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards. "
Numbers,2,18,"On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud, "
Numbers,2,19,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred; "
Numbers,2,20,"and next unto him shall be the tribe of Manasseh; the prince of the children of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, "
Numbers,2,21,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and two hundred; "
Numbers,2,22,"and the tribe of Benjamin; the prince of the children of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni, "
Numbers,2,23,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and five thousand and four hundred; "
Numbers,2,24,"all that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim being a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to their hosts; and they shall set forth third. "
Numbers,2,25,"On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, "
Numbers,2,26,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, threescore and two thousand and seven hundred; "
Numbers,2,27,"and those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Asher; the prince of the children of Asher being Pagiel the son of Ochran, "
Numbers,2,28,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, forty and one thousand and five hundred; "

Numbers,2,30,"and his host, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and three thousand and four hundred; "
Numbers,2,31,all that were numbered of the camp of Dan being a hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred; they shall set forth hindmost by their standards.' 
Numbers,2,32,These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses; all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
Numbers,2,33,But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as HaShem commanded Moses. 
Numbers,2,34,"Thus did the children of Israel: according to all that HaShem commanded Moses, so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, each one according to its families, and according to its fathers' houses. "
Numbers,3,1,Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that HaShem spoke with Moses in mount Sinai. 
Numbers,3,2,"And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. "
Numbers,3,3,"These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. "
Numbers,3,4,"And Nadab and Abihu died before HaShem, when they offered strange fire before HaShem, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the presence of Aaron their father. "
Numbers,3,5,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,3,6,"'Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. "
Numbers,3,7,"And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. "
Numbers,3,8,"And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. "
Numbers,3,9,And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto him from the children of Israel. 
Numbers,3,10,"And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, that they may keep their priesthood; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.' "
Numbers,3,11,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,3,12,"'And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine; "
Numbers,3,13,"for all the first-born are Mine: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast, Mine they shall be: I am HaShem.' "
Numbers,3,14,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying: "
Numbers,3,15,"'Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families; every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.' "
Numbers,3,16,"And Moses numbered them according to the word of HaShem, as he was commanded. "
Numbers,3,17,"And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. "
Numbers,3,18,And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. 
Numbers,3,19,"And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. "
Numbers,3,20,And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' houses. 
Numbers,3,21,"Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites; these are the families of the Gershonites. "
Numbers,3,22,"Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. "

Numbers,3,38,"And those that were to pitch before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising, were Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary, even the charge for the children of Israel; and the common man that drew nigh was to be put to death. "
Numbers,3,39,"All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of HaShem, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. "
Numbers,3,40,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. "
Numbers,3,41,"And thou shalt take the Levites for Me, even HaShem, instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.' "
Numbers,3,42,"And Moses numbered, as HaShem commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel. "
Numbers,3,43,"And all the first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. "
Numbers,3,44,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,3,45,"'Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine, even HaShem'S. "
Numbers,3,46,"And as for the redemption of the two hundred and three score and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above the number of the Levites, "
Numbers,3,47,thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them--the shekel is twenty gerahs. 
Numbers,3,48,And thou shalt give the money wherewith they that remain over of them are redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons.' 
Numbers,3,49,And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites; 
Numbers,3,50,"from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money: a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
Numbers,3,51,"And Moses gave the redemption-money unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of HaShem, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,4,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,4,2,"'Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' houses, "
Numbers,4,3,"from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do work in the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,4,4,"This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, about the most holy things: "
Numbers,4,5,"when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; "
Numbers,4,6,"and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall set the staves thereof. "
Numbers,4,7,"And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the pans, and the bowls, and the jars wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall remain thereon. "
Numbers,4,8,"And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall set the staves thereof. "
Numbers,4,9,"And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its tongs, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it. "
Numbers,4,10,"And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it upon a bar. "
Numbers,4,11,"And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall set the staves thereof. "
Numbers,4,12,"And they shall take all the vessels of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put them on a bar. "
Numbers,4,13,"And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon. "
Numbers,4,14,"And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, the fire-pans, the flesh-hooks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of sealskin, and set the staves thereof. "
Numbers,4,15,"And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the holy furniture, and all the holy vessels, as the camp is to set forward--after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,4,16,"And the charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the continual meal-offering, and the anointing oil: he shall have the charge of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, whether it be the sanctuary, or the furniture thereof.' "
Numbers,4,17,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,4,18,'Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites; 
Numbers,4,19,"but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden; "
Numbers,4,20,"but they shall not go in to see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die.' "
Numbers,4,21,And HaShem spoke unto Moses saying: 
Numbers,4,22,"'Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' houses, by their families; "
Numbers,4,23,"from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them: all that enter in to wait upon the service, to do service in the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,4,24,"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens: "
Numbers,4,25,"they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting; "
Numbers,4,26,"and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever there may be to do with them, therein shall they serve. "
Numbers,4,27,"At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden. "
Numbers,4,28,This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting; and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
Numbers,4,29,"As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers' houses; "
Numbers,4,30,"from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,4,31,"And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof; "
Numbers,4,32,"and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, even all their appurtenance, and all that pertaineth to their service; and by name ye shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden. "
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.' "
Numbers,4,34,"And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers' houses, "
Numbers,4,35,"from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for service in the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,4,36,And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
Numbers,4,37,"These are they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, of all that did serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of HaShem by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,4,38,"And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families, and by their fathers' houses, "

Numbers,4,45,"These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of HaShem by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,4,46,"All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families, and by their fathers' houses, "
Numbers,4,47,"from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered in to do the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting, "
Numbers,4,48,"even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. "
Numbers,4,49,"According to the commandment of HaShem they were appointed by the hand of Moses, every one to his service, and to his burden; they were also numbered, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,5,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,5,2,"'Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead; "
Numbers,5,3,"both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.' "
Numbers,5,4,"And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as HaShem spoke unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. "
Numbers,5,5,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,5,6,"Speak unto the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against HaShem, and that soul be guilty; "
Numbers,5,7,"then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty. "
Numbers,5,8,"But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made shall be HaShem'S, even the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him. "
Numbers,5,9,"And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his. "
Numbers,5,10,"And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his. "
Numbers,5,11,"and HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,5,12,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: If any man's wife go aside, and act unfaithfully against him, "
Numbers,5,13,"and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, she being defiled secretly, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken in the act; "
Numbers,5,14,"and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled; "
Numbers,5,15,"then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. "
Numbers,5,16,"And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before HaShem. "
Numbers,5,17,"And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water. "
Numbers,5,18,"And the priest shall set the woman before HaShem, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy; and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse. "
Numbers,5,19,"And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman: 'If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse; "
Numbers,5,20,"but if thou hast gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband-- "
Numbers,5,21,"then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman--the HaShem make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when HaShem doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell; "
Numbers,5,22,"and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away'; and the woman shall say: 'Amen, Amen.' "
Numbers,5,23,"And the priest shall write these curses in a scroll, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness. "
Numbers,5,24,And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter. 
Numbers,5,25,"And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before HaShem, and bring it unto the altar. "
Numbers,5,26,"And the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. "
Numbers,5,27,"And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have acted unfaithfully against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away; and the woman shall be a curse among her people. "
Numbers,5,28,"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed. "
Numbers,5,29,"This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled; "
Numbers,5,30,"or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he be jealous over his wife; then shall he set the woman before HaShem, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. "
Numbers,5,31,"And the man shall be clear from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity. "
Numbers,6,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,6,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to consecrate himself unto HaShem, "
Numbers,6,3,"he shall abstain from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. "
Numbers,6,4,"All the days of his Naziriteship shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the pressed grapes even to the grapestone. "
Numbers,6,5,"All the days of his vow of Naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, in which he consecrateth himself unto HaShem, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. "
Numbers,6,6,All the days that he consecrateth himself unto HaShem he shall not come near to a dead body. 
Numbers,6,7,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his consecration unto G-d is upon his head. "
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his Naziriteship he is holy unto HaShem. 
Numbers,6,9,"And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. "
Numbers,6,10,"And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,6,11,"And the priest shall prepare one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead; and he shall hallow his head that same day. "
Numbers,6,12,"And he shall consecrate unto HaShem the days of his Naziriteship, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year for a guilt-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his consecration was defiled. "
Numbers,6,13,"And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall bring it unto the door of the tent of meeting; "
Numbers,6,14,"and he shall present his offering unto HaShem, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings, "
Numbers,6,15,"and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings. "
Numbers,6,16,"And the priest shall bring them before HaShem, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering. "
Numbers,6,17,"And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto HaShem, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,6,18,"And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings. "
Numbers,6,19,"And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is sodden, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven his consecrated head. "
Numbers,6,20,"And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before HaShem; this is holy for the priest, together with the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving; and after that the Nazirite may drink wine. "
Numbers,6,21,"This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his offering unto HaShem for his Naziriteship, beside that for which his means suffice; according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his Naziriteship. "
Numbers,6,22,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,6,23,"'Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them: "
Numbers,6,24,"HaShem bless thee, and keep thee; "
Numbers,6,25,"HaShem make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; "
Numbers,6,26,"HaShem lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. "
Numbers,6,27,"So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.'  "
Numbers,7,1,"And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them; "
Numbers,7,2,"that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered--these were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered. "
Numbers,7,3,"And they brought their offering before HaShem, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen: a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle. "
Numbers,7,4,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,7,5,"'Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.' "
Numbers,7,6,"And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. "
Numbers,7,7,"Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service. "
Numbers,7,8,"And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. "
Numbers,7,9,"But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the holy things belonged unto them: they bore them upon their shoulders. "
Numbers,7,10,"And the princes brought the dedication-offering of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes brought their offering before the altar. "
Numbers,7,11,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'They shall present their offering each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.' "
Numbers,7,12,"And he that presented his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah; "

Numbers,7,89,"And when Moses went into the tent of meeting that He might speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the ark-cover that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and He spoke unto him. "
Numbers,8,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,8,2,"'Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him: When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.' "
Numbers,8,3,"And Aaron did so: he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,8,4,"And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work; according unto the pattern which HaShem had shown Moses, so he made the candlestick. "
Numbers,8,5,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,8,6,"'Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. "
Numbers,8,7,"And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. "
Numbers,8,8,"Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. "
Numbers,8,9,And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting; and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. 
Numbers,8,10,And thou shalt present the Levites before HaShem; and the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites. 
Numbers,8,11,"And Aaron shall offer the Levites before HaShem for a wave-offering from the children of Israel, that they may be to do the service of HaShem. "
Numbers,8,12,"And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks; and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto HaShem, to make atonement for the Levites. "
Numbers,8,13,"And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto HaShem. "
Numbers,8,14,Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine. 
Numbers,8,15,"And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering. "
Numbers,8,16,"For they are wholly given unto Me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto Me. "
Numbers,8,17,"For all the first-born among the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself. "
Numbers,8,18,And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel. 
Numbers,8,19,"And I have given the Levites--they are given to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel, through the children of Israel coming nigh unto the sanctuary.' "
Numbers,8,20,"Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites; according unto all that HaShem commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. "
Numbers,8,21,"And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a sacred gift before HaShem; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. "
Numbers,8,22,"And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons; as HaShem had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. "
Numbers,8,23,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,8,24,'This is that which pertaineth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the tent of meeting; 
Numbers,8,25,"and from the age of fifty years they shall return from the service of the work, and shall serve no more; "
Numbers,8,26,"but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall do no manner of service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.' "
Numbers,9,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: "
Numbers,9,2,'Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. 
Numbers,9,3,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.' "
Numbers,9,4,"And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. "
Numbers,9,5,"And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that HaShem commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. "
Numbers,9,6,"But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. "
Numbers,9,7,"And those men said unto him: 'We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of HaShem in its appointed season among the children of Israel?' "
Numbers,9,8,"And Moses said unto them: 'Stay ye, that I may hear what HaShem will command concerning you.' "
Numbers,9,9,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,9,10,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto HaShem; "
Numbers,9,11,in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; 
Numbers,9,12,"they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. "
Numbers,9,13,"But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of HaShem in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. "
Numbers,9,14,"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto HaShem: according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.' "
Numbers,9,15,"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. "
Numbers,9,16,"So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. "
Numbers,9,17,"And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. "
Numbers,9,18,"At the commandment of HaShem the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of HaShem they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. "
Numbers,9,19,"And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of HaShem, and journeyed not. "
Numbers,9,20,"And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of HaShem they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of HaShem they journeyed. "
Numbers,9,21,"And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. "
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. "
Numbers,9,23,"At the commandment of HaShem they encamped, and at the commandment of HaShem they journeyed; they kept the charge of HaShem, at the commandment of HaShem by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,10,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,10,2,"'Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to set forward. "
Numbers,10,3,"And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,10,4,"And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. "
Numbers,10,5,"And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey. "
Numbers,10,6,"And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. "
Numbers,10,7,"But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. "
Numbers,10,8,"And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations. "
Numbers,10,9,"And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before HaShem your G-d, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. "
Numbers,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d: I am HaShem your G-d.' "
Numbers,10,11,"And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. "
Numbers,10,12,And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.-- 
Numbers,10,13,"And they took their first journey, according to the commandment of HaShem by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,10,14,And in the first place the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 
Numbers,10,15,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
Numbers,10,16,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 
Numbers,10,17,"And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, set forward. "
Numbers,10,18,And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
Numbers,10,19,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
Numbers,10,20,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 
Numbers,10,21,"And the Kohathites the bearers of the sanctuary set forward, that the tabernacle might be set up against their coming. "
Numbers,10,22,And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. 
Numbers,10,23,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
Numbers,10,24,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
Numbers,10,25,"And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. "
Numbers,10,26,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 
Numbers,10,27,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 
Numbers,10,28,Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts. --And they set forward. 
Numbers,10,29,"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law: 'We are journeying unto the place of which HaShem said: I will give it you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for HaShem hath spoken good concerning Israel.' "
Numbers,10,30,"And he said unto him: 'I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.' "
Numbers,10,31,"And he said: 'Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. "
Numbers,10,32,"And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever HaShem shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.' "
Numbers,10,33,"And they set forward from the mount of HaShem three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of HaShem went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them. "
Numbers,10,34,"And the cloud of HaShem was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. "
Numbers,10,35,"And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: 'Rise up, O HaShem, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee.' "
Numbers,10,36,"And when it rested, he said: 'Return, O HaShem, unto the ten thousands of the families of Israel.' "
Numbers,11,1,"And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of HaShem; and when HaShem heard it, His anger was kindled; and the fire of HaShem burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. "
Numbers,11,2,"And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto HaShem, and the fire abated. "
Numbers,11,3,"And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of HaShem burnt among them. "
Numbers,11,4,"And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: 'Would that we were given flesh to eat! "
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish, which we were wont to eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; "
Numbers,11,6,but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all; we have nought save this manna to look to.'-- 
Numbers,11,7,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. "
Numbers,11,8,"The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with oil. "
Numbers,11,9,"And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.-- "
Numbers,11,10,"And Moses heard the people weeping, family by family, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of HaShem was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. "
Numbers,11,11,"And Moses said unto HaShem: 'Wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with Thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? "
Numbers,11,12,"Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that Thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou didst swear unto their fathers? "
Numbers,11,13,"Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they trouble me with their weeping, saying: Give us flesh, that we may eat. "
Numbers,11,14,"I am not able to bear all this people myself alone, because it is too heavy for me. "
Numbers,11,15,"And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in Thy sight; and let me not look upon my wretchedness.' "
Numbers,11,16,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. "
Numbers,11,17,"And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. "
Numbers,11,18,"And say thou unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of HaShem, saying: Would that we were given flesh to eat! for it was well with us in Egypt; therefore HaShem will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. "
Numbers,11,19,"Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; "
Numbers,11,20,"but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected HaShem who is among you, and have troubled Him with weeping, saying: Why, now, came we forth out of Egypt?' "
Numbers,11,21,"And Moses said: 'The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and yet Thou hast said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month! "
Numbers,11,22,"If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them? or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, will they suffice them?' "
Numbers,11,23,And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Is HaShem'S hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not.' 
Numbers,11,24,"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of HaShem; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. "
Numbers,11,25,"And HaShem came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders; and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. "
Numbers,11,26,"But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were recorded, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. "
Numbers,11,27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said: 'Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.' "
Numbers,11,28,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: 'My lord Moses, shut them in.' "
Numbers,11,29,"And Moses said unto him: 'Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all HaShem'S people were prophets, that HaShem would put His spirit upon them!' "
Numbers,11,30,"And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. "
Numbers,11,31,"And there went forth a wind from HaShem, and brought across quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. "
Numbers,11,32,"And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps; and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. "
Numbers,11,33,"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of HaShem was kindled against the people, and HaShem smote the people with a very great plague. "
Numbers,11,34,"And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted. "
Numbers,11,35,From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.  
Numbers,12,1,And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. 
Numbers,12,2,And they said: 'Hath HaShem indeed spoken only with Moses? hath He not spoken also with us?' And HaShem heard it.-- 
Numbers,12,3,"Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.-- "
Numbers,12,4,"And HaShem spoke suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam: 'Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting.' And they three came out. "
Numbers,12,5,"And HaShem came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth. "
Numbers,12,6,"And He said: 'Hear now My words: if there be a prophet among you, I HaShem do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream. "
Numbers,12,7,My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house; 
Numbers,12,8,"with him do I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of HaShem doth he behold; wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?' "
Numbers,12,9,And the anger of HaShem was kindled against them; and He departed. 
Numbers,12,10,"And when the cloud was removed from over the Tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam; and, behold, she was leprous. "
Numbers,12,11,"And Aaron said unto Moses: 'Oh my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned. "
Numbers,12,12,"Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.' "
Numbers,12,13,"And Moses cried unto HaShem, saying: 'Heal her now, O G-d, I beseech Thee.' "
Numbers,12,14,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.' "
Numbers,12,15,And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. 
Numbers,12,16,"And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran. "
Numbers,13,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,13,2,"'Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.' "
Numbers,13,3,And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of HaShem; all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel. 
Numbers,13,4,"And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. "
Numbers,13,5,"Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. "
Numbers,13,6,"Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. "

Numbers,13,12,"Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. "
Numbers,13,13,"Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. "
Numbers,13,14,"Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. "
Numbers,13,15,"Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. "
Numbers,13,16,These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. 
Numbers,13,17,"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them: 'Get you up here into the South, and go up into the mountains; "
Numbers,13,18,"and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; "
Numbers,13,19,"and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; "
Numbers,13,20,"and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land.' --Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.-- "
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, at the entrance to Hamath. "
Numbers,13,22,"And they went up into the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. --Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.-- "
Numbers,13,23,"And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a pole between two; they took also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.-- "
Numbers,13,24,"That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.-- "
Numbers,13,25,And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 
Numbers,13,26,"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. "
Numbers,13,27,"And they told him, and said: 'We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. "
Numbers,13,28,"Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified, and very great; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. "
Numbers,13,29,"Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South; and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.' "
Numbers,13,30,"And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and said: 'We should go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.' "
Numbers,13,31,But the men that went up with him said: 'We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.' 
Numbers,13,32,"And they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying: 'The land, through which we have passed to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. "
Numbers,13,33,"And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.'  "
Numbers,14,1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. "
Numbers,14,2,And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them: 'Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! 
Numbers,14,3,"And wherefore doth HaShem bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey; were it not better for us to return into Egypt?' "
Numbers,14,4,"And they said one to another: 'Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.' "
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes. "
Numbers,14,7,"And they spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: 'The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. "
Numbers,14,8,"If HaShem delight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it unto us--a land which floweth with milk and honey. "
Numbers,14,9,"Only rebel not against HaShem, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us; their defence is removed from over them, and HaShem is with us; fear them not.' "
Numbers,14,10,"But all the congregation bade stone them with stones, when the glory of HaShem appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel. "
Numbers,14,11,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'How long will this people despise Me? and how long will they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them? "
Numbers,14,12,"I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.' "
Numbers,14,13,And Moses said unto HaShem: 'When the Egyptians shall hear--for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy might from among them-- 
Numbers,14,14,"they will say to the inhabitants of this land, who have heard that Thou HaShem art in the midst of this people; inasmuch as Thou HaShem art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them, and Thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night; "
Numbers,14,15,"now if Thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of Thee will speak, saying: "
Numbers,14,16,"Because HaShem was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore unto them, therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness. "
Numbers,14,17,"And now, I pray Thee, let the power of the L-rd be great, according as Thou hast spoken, saying: "
Numbers,14,18,"HaShem is slow to anger, and plenteous in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. "
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of Thy lovingkindness, and according as Thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.' "
Numbers,14,20,And HaShem said: 'I have pardoned according to thy word' 
Numbers,14,21,"But in very deed, as I live--and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of HaShem-- "
Numbers,14,22,"surely all those men that have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to proof these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice; "
Numbers,14,23,"surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised Me see it. "
Numbers,14,24,"But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. "
Numbers,14,25,"Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the Vale; tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.' "
Numbers,14,26,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,14,27,"'How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that keep murmuring against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they keep murmuring against Me. "
Numbers,14,28,"Say unto them: As I live, saith HaShem, surely as ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to you: "
Numbers,14,29,"your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, ye that have murmured against Me; "
Numbers,14,30,"surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. "
Numbers,14,31,"But your little ones, that ye said would be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected. "
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. "
Numbers,14,33,"And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your strayings, until your carcasses be consumed in the wilderness. "
Numbers,14,34,"After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know My displeasure. "
Numbers,14,35,"I HaShem have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against Me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.' "
Numbers,14,36,"And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who, when they returned, made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, "
Numbers,14,37,"even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before HaShem. "
Numbers,14,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land. "
Numbers,14,39,And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel; and the people mourned greatly. 
Numbers,14,40,"And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up to the top of the mountain, saying: 'Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which HaShem hath promised; for we have sinned.' "
Numbers,14,41,"And Moses said: 'Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of HaShem, seeing it shall not prosper? "
Numbers,14,42,"Go not up, for HaShem is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies. "
Numbers,14,43,"For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; forasmuch as ye are turned back from following HaShem, and HaShem will not be with you.' "
Numbers,14,44,"But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain; nevertheless the ark of the covenant of HaShem, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. "
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekite and the Canaanite, who dwelt in that hill-country, came down, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah. "
Numbers,15,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, "
Numbers,15,3,"and will make an offering by fire unto HaShem, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a freewill-offering, or in your appointed seasons, to make a sweet savour unto HaShem, of the herd, or of the flock; "
Numbers,15,4,then shall he that bringeth his offering present unto HaShem a meal-offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil; 
Numbers,15,5,"and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. "
Numbers,15,6,"Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil; "
Numbers,15,7,"and for the drink-offering thou shalt present the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Numbers,15,8,"And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for peace-offerings unto HaShem; "
Numbers,15,9,then shall there be presented with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil. 
Numbers,15,10,"And thou shalt present for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Numbers,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids. "
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that ye may prepare, so shall ye do for every one according to their number. "
Numbers,15,13,"All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Numbers,15,14,"And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you, throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem; as ye do, so he shall do. "
Numbers,15,15,"As for the congregation, there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before HaShem. "
Numbers,15,16,"One law and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. "
Numbers,15,17,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,15,18,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land whither I bring you, "
Numbers,15,19,"then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto HaShem. "
Numbers,15,20,"Of the first of your dough ye shall set apart a cake for a gift; as that which is set apart of the threshing-floor, so shall ye set it apart. "
Numbers,15,21,Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto HaShem a portion for a gift throughout your generations. 
Numbers,15,22,"And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which HaShem hath spoken unto Moses, "
Numbers,15,23,"even all that HaShem hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that HaShem gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; "
Numbers,15,24,"then it shall be, if it be done in error by the congregation, it being hid from their eyes, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savour unto HaShem--with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance--and one he-goat for a sin-offering. "
Numbers,15,25,"And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire unto HaShem, and their sin-offering before HaShem, for their error. "
Numbers,15,26,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done in error. "
Numbers,15,27,"And if one person sin through error, then he shall offer a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering. "
Numbers,15,28,"And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth through error, before HaShem, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven, "
Numbers,15,29,"both he that is home-born among the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them: ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught in error. "
Numbers,15,30,"But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth HaShem; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. "
Numbers,15,31,"Because he hath despised the word of HaShem, and hath broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him. "
Numbers,15,32,"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. "
Numbers,15,33,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. "
Numbers,15,34,"And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. "
Numbers,15,35,And HaShem said unto Moses: 'The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.' 
Numbers,15,36,"And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,15,37,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,15,38,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments, and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue. "
Numbers,15,39,"And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of HaShem, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; "
Numbers,15,40,"that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your G-d. "
Numbers,15,41,"I am HaShem your G-d, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your G-d: I am HaShem your G-d.' "
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men; "
Numbers,16,2,"and they rose up in face of Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty men; they were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown; "
Numbers,16,3,"and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them: 'Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and HaShem is among them; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of HaShem?' "
Numbers,16,4,"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. "
Numbers,16,5,"And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: 'In the morning HaShem will show who are His, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He may choose will He cause to come near unto Him. "
Numbers,16,6,"This do: take you censors, Korah, and all his company; "
Numbers,16,7,"and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before HaShem to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom HaShem doth choose, he shall be holy; ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.' "
Numbers,16,8,"And Moses said unto Korah: 'Hear now, ye sons of Levi: "
Numbers,16,9,"is it but a small thing unto you, that the G-d of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of HaShem, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them; "
Numbers,16,10,"and that He hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and will ye seek the priesthood also? "
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together against HaShem--; and as to Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?' "
Numbers,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said: 'We will not come up; "
Numbers,16,13,"is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us? "
Numbers,16,14,"Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards; wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.' "
Numbers,16,15,"And Moses was very wroth, and said unto HaShem: 'Respect not thou their offering; I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.' "
Numbers,16,16,"And Moses said unto Korah: 'Be thou and all thy congregation before HaShem, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow; "
Numbers,16,17,"and take ye every man his fire-pan, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before HaShem every man his fire-pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; thou also, and Aaron, each his fire-pan.' "
Numbers,16,18,"And they took every man his fire-pan, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron. "
Numbers,16,19,And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting; and the glory of HaShem appeared unto all the congregation. 
Numbers,16,20,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,16,21,"'Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.' "
Numbers,16,22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said: 'O G-d, the G-d of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?' "
Numbers,16,23,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,16,24,"'Speak unto the congregation, saying: Get you up from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.' "
Numbers,16,25,And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
Numbers,16,26,"And he spoke unto the congregation, saying: 'Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be swept away in all their sins.' "
Numbers,16,27,"So they got them up from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. "
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses said: 'Hereby ye shall know that HaShem hath sent me to do all these works, and that I have not done them of mine own mind. "
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die the common death of all men, and be visited after the visitation of all men, then HaShem hath not sent Me. "
Numbers,16,30,"But if HaShem make a new thing, and the ground open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have despised HaShem.' "
Numbers,16,31,"And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them. "
Numbers,16,32,"And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. "
Numbers,16,33,"So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit; and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly. "
Numbers,16,34,And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said: 'Lest the earth swallow us up.' 
Numbers,16,35,"And fire came forth from HaShem, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense. "
Numbers,17,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,17,2,"'Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are become holy; "
Numbers,17,3,"even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar--for they are become holy, because they were offered before HaShem--that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.' "
Numbers,17,4,"And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, "
Numbers,17,5,"to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn incense before HaShem; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; as HaShem spoke unto him by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,17,6,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: 'Ye have killed the people of HaShem.' "
Numbers,17,7,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting; and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of HaShem appeared. "
Numbers,17,8,And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. 
Numbers,17,9,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,17,10,"'Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.' And they fell upon their faces. "
Numbers,17,11,"And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Take thy fire-pan, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from HaShem: the plague is begun.' "
Numbers,17,12,"And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. "
Numbers,17,13,And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
Numbers,17,14,"Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. "
Numbers,17,15,"And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stayed. "
Numbers,17,16,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,17,17,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man's name upon his rod. "
Numbers,17,18,"And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers' houses. "
Numbers,17,19,"And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. "
Numbers,17,20,"And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.' "
Numbers,17,21,"And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. "
Numbers,17,22,And Moses laid up the rods before HaShem in the tent of the testimony. 
Numbers,17,23,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. "
Numbers,17,24,"And Moses brought out all the rods from before HaShem unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod. "
Numbers,17,25,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.' "
Numbers,17,26,"Thus did Moses; as HaShem commanded him, so did he. "
Numbers,17,27,"And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: 'Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. "
Numbers,17,28,"Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of HaShem, is to die; shall we wholly perish?' "
Numbers,18,1,And HaShem said unto Aaron: 'Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
Numbers,18,2,"And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee, thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony. "
Numbers,18,3,"And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent; only they shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye. "
Numbers,18,4,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, whatsoever the service of the Tent may be; but a common man shall not draw nigh unto you. "
Numbers,18,5,"And ye shall keep the charge of the holy things, and the charge of the altar, that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. "
Numbers,18,6,"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; for you they are given as a gift unto HaShem, to do the service of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,18,7,"And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar, and to that within the veil; and ye shall serve; I give you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.' "
Numbers,18,8,"And HaShem spoke unto Aaron: 'And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of My heave-offerings; even of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel unto thee have I given them for a consecrated portion, and to thy sons, as a due for ever. "
Numbers,18,9,"This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every guilt-offering of theirs, which they may render unto Me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. "
Numbers,18,10,In a most holy place shalt thou eat thereof; every male may eat thereof; it shall be holy unto thee. 
Numbers,18,11,"And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. "
Numbers,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the corn, the first part of them which they give unto HaShem, to thee have I given them. "
Numbers,18,13,"The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto HaShem, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. "
Numbers,18,14,Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
Numbers,18,15,"Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto HaShem, both of man and beast, shall be thine; howbeit the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. "
Numbers,18,16,"And their redemption-money--from a month old shalt thou redeem them--shall be, according to thy valuation, five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary--the same is twenty gerahs. "
Numbers,18,17,"But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt dash their blood against the altar, and shalt make their fat smoke for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Numbers,18,18,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine. "
Numbers,18,19,"All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto HaShem, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; it is an everlasting covenant of salt before HaShem unto thee and to thy seed with thee.' "
Numbers,18,20,"And HaShem said unto Aaron: 'Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them; I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. "
Numbers,18,21,"And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,18,22,"And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. "
Numbers,18,23,"But the Levites alone shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. "
Numbers,18,24,"For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they set apart as a gift unto HaShem, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said unto them: Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.' "
Numbers,18,25,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,18,26,"'Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them: When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall set apart of it a gift for HaShem, even a tithe of the tithe. "
Numbers,18,27,"And the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the wine-press. "
Numbers,18,28,"Thus ye also shall set apart a gift unto HaShem of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto HaShem to Aaron the priest. "
Numbers,18,29,"Out of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto HaShem, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. "
Numbers,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them: When ye set apart the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press. "
Numbers,18,31,"And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,18,32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that ye have set apart from it the best thereof; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.' "
Numbers,19,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: "
Numbers,19,2,"This is the statute of the law which HaShem hath commanded, saying: Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer, faultless, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke. "
Numbers,19,3,"And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and she shall be brought forth without the camp, and she shall be slain before his face. "
Numbers,19,4,"And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. "
Numbers,19,5,"And the heifer shall be burnt in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt. "
Numbers,19,6,"And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. "
Numbers,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. "
Numbers,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. "
Numbers,19,9,"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling; it is a purification from sin. "
Numbers,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. "
Numbers,19,11,"He that toucheth the dead, even any man's dead body, shall be unclean seven days; "
Numbers,19,12,"the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day and the seventh day, he shall not be clean. "
Numbers,19,13,"Whosoever toucheth the dead, even the body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself--he hath defiled the tabernacle of HaShem--that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. "
Numbers,19,14,"This is the law: when a man dieth in a tent, every one that cometh into the tent, and every thing that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. "
Numbers,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering close-bound upon it, is unclean. "
Numbers,19,16,"And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or one that dieth of himself, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. "
Numbers,19,17,"And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the purification from sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel. "
Numbers,19,18,"And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave. "
Numbers,19,19,"And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. "
Numbers,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of HaShem; the water of sprinkling hath not been dashed against him: he is unclean. "
Numbers,19,21,And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them; and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until even. 
Numbers,19,22,And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth him shall be unclean until even. 
Numbers,20,1,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. "
Numbers,20,2,And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
Numbers,20,3,"And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying: 'Would that we had perished when our brethren perished before HaShem! "
Numbers,20,4,"And why have ye brought the assembly of HaShem into this wilderness, to die there, we and our cattle? "
Numbers,20,5,"And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.' "
Numbers,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces; and the glory of HaShem appeared unto them. "
Numbers,20,7,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,20,8,"'Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.' "
Numbers,20,9,"And Moses took the rod from before HaShem, as He commanded him. "
Numbers,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them: 'Hear now, ye rebels; are we to bring you forth water out of this rock?' "
Numbers,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. "
Numbers,20,12,"And HaShem said unto Moses and Aaron: 'Because ye believed not in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.' "
Numbers,20,13,"These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel strove with HaShem, and He was sanctified in them. "
Numbers,20,14,And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: 'Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us; 
Numbers,20,15,"how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers; "
Numbers,20,16,"and when we cried unto HaShem, He heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. "
Numbers,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land; we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king's highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.' "
Numbers,20,18,"And Edom said unto him: 'Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.' "
Numbers,20,19,"And the children of Israel said unto him: 'We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof; let me only pass through on my feet; there is no hurt.' "
Numbers,20,20,"And he said: 'Thou shalt not pass through.' And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. "
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; wherefore Israel turned away from him. 
Numbers,20,22,"And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. "
Numbers,20,23,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying: "
Numbers,20,24,"'Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against My word at the waters of Meribah. "
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor. "
Numbers,20,26,"And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.' "
Numbers,20,27,And Moses did as HaShem commanded; and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
Numbers,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. "
Numbers,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.  "
Numbers,21,1,"And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. "
Numbers,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow unto HaShem, and said: 'If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.' "
Numbers,21,3,"And HaShem hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the name of the place was called Hormah."
Numbers,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way. "
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spoke against G-d, and against Moses: 'Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.' "
Numbers,21,6,"And HaShem sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. "
Numbers,21,7,"And the people came to Moses, and said: 'We have sinned, because we have spoken against HaShem, and against thee; pray unto HaShem, that He take away the serpents from us.' And Moses prayed for the people. "
Numbers,21,8,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.' "
Numbers,21,9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the pole; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived. "
Numbers,21,10,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth. "
Numbers,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is in front of Moab, toward the sun-rising. "
Numbers,21,12,"From thence they journeyed, and pitched in the valley of Zered. "
Numbers,21,13,"From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites. --For Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites; "
Numbers,21,14,"wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of HaShem: Vaheb in Suphah, and the valleys of Arnon, "
Numbers,21,15,"And the slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the seat of Ar, and leaneth upon the border of Moab.-- "
Numbers,21,16,"And from thence to Beer; that is the well whereof HaShem said unto Moses: 'Gather the people together, and I will give them water.' "
Numbers,21,17,"Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well--sing ye unto it-- "
Numbers,21,18,"The well, which the princes digged, which the nobles of the people delved, with the sceptre, and with their staves. And from the wilderness to Mattanah; "
Numbers,21,19,and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
Numbers,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert. "
Numbers,21,21,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: "
Numbers,21,22,"'Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells; we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border.' "
Numbers,21,23,"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. "
Numbers,21,24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. "
Numbers,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. "
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon. "
Numbers,21,27,Wherefore they that speak in parables say: Come ye to Heshbon! let the city of Sihon be built and established! 
Numbers,21,28,"For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it hath devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon. "
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh; he hath given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, unto Sihon king of the Amorites. "
Numbers,21,30,"We have shot at them--Heshbon is perished--even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. "
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
Numbers,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. "
Numbers,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. "
Numbers,21,34,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Fear him not; for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.' "
Numbers,21,35,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining; and they possessed his land.  "
Numbers,22,1,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. "
Numbers,22,2,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
Numbers,22,3,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel. "
Numbers,22,4,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: 'Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.' --And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.-- "
Numbers,22,5,"And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying: 'Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me. "
Numbers,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.' "
Numbers,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. "
Numbers,22,8,"And he said unto them: 'Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as HaShem may speak unto me'; and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. "
Numbers,22,9,"And G-d came unto Balaam, and said: 'What men are these with thee?' "
Numbers,22,10,"And Balaam said unto G-d: 'Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me saying: "
Numbers,22,11,"Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.' "
Numbers,22,12,And G-d said unto Balaam: 'Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.' 
Numbers,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: 'Get you into your land; for HaShem refuseth to give me leave to go with you.' "
Numbers,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: 'Balaam refuseth to come with us.' "
Numbers,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. "
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him: 'Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me; "
Numbers,22,17,"for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.' "
Numbers,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of HaShem my G-d, to do any thing, small or great. "
Numbers,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what HaShem will speak unto me more.' "
Numbers,22,20,"And G-d came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: 'If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.' "
Numbers,22,21,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. "
Numbers,22,22,"And G-d's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of HaShem placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. --Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.-- "
Numbers,22,23,"And the ass saw the angel of HaShem standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. "
Numbers,22,24,"Then the angel of HaShem stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side. "
Numbers,22,25,"And the ass saw the angel of HaShem, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again. "
Numbers,22,26,"And the angel of HaShem went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. "
Numbers,22,27,"And the ass saw the angel of HaShem, and she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. "
Numbers,22,28,"And HaShem opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: 'What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?' "
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam said unto the ass: 'Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.' "
Numbers,22,30,"And the ass said unto Balaam: 'Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?' And he said: 'Nay.' "
Numbers,22,31,"Then HaShem opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of HaShem standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. "
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of HaShem said unto him: 'Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me; "
Numbers,22,33,"and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.' "
Numbers,22,34,"And Balaam said unto the angel of HaShem: 'I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back.' "
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel of HaShem said unto Balaam: 'Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.' So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. "
Numbers,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. "
Numbers,22,37,And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?' 
Numbers,22,38,"And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that G-d putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.' "
Numbers,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. "
Numbers,22,40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. "
Numbers,22,41,"And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people. "
Numbers,23,1,"And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.' "
Numbers,23,2,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 
Numbers,23,3,"And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure HaShem will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.' And he went to a bare height. "
Numbers,23,4,"And G-d met Balaam; and he said unto Him: 'I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.' "
Numbers,23,5,"And HaShem put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said: 'Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.' "
Numbers,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. "
Numbers,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said: From Aram Balak bringeth me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East: 'Come, curse me Jacob, and come, execrate Israel.' "
Numbers,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom G-d hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom HaShem hath not execrated? "
Numbers,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. "
Numbers,23,10,"Who hath counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let mine end be like his! "
Numbers,23,11,"And Balak said unto Balaam: 'What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.' "
Numbers,23,12,And he answered and said: 'Must I not take heed to speak that which HaShem putteth in my mouth?' 
Numbers,23,13,"And Balak said unto him: 'Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.' "
Numbers,23,14,"And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. "
Numbers,23,15,"And he said unto Balak: 'Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.' "
Numbers,23,16,"And HaShem met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: 'Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.' "
Numbers,23,17,"And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: 'What hath HaShem spoken?' "
Numbers,23,18,"And he took up his parable, and said: Arise, Balak, and hear; give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor: "
Numbers,23,19,"G-d is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent: when He hath said, will He not do it? or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good? "
Numbers,23,20,"Behold, I am bidden to bless; and when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back. "
Numbers,23,21,"None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel; HaShem his G-d is with him, and the shouting for the King is among them. "
Numbers,23,22,G-d who brought them forth out of Egypt is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox. 
Numbers,23,23,"For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel; now is it said of Jacob and of Israel: 'What hath G-d wrought!' "
Numbers,23,24,"Behold a people that riseth up as a lioness, and as a lion doth he lift himself up; he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. "
Numbers,23,25,"And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.' "
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: 'Told not I thee, saying: All that HaShem speaketh, that I must do?' "
Numbers,23,27,"And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please G-d that thou mayest curse me them from thence.' "
Numbers,23,28,"And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. "
Numbers,23,29,"And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.' "
Numbers,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. "
Numbers,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased HaShem to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. "
Numbers,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of G-d came upon him. "
Numbers,24,3,"And he took up his parable, and said: The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eye is opened; "
Numbers,24,4,"The saying of him who heareth the words of G-d, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, fallen down, yet with opened eyes: "
Numbers,24,5,"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwellings, O Israel! "
Numbers,24,6,"As valleys stretched out, as gardens by the river-side; as aloes planted of HaShem, as cedars beside the waters; "
Numbers,24,7,"Water shall flow from his branches, and his seed shall be in many waters; and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. "
Numbers,24,8,"G-d who brought him forth out of Egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wild-ox; he shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them through with his arrows. "
Numbers,24,9,"He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, and cursed be every one that curseth thee. "
Numbers,24,10,"And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam: 'I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. "
Numbers,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy place; I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, HaShem hath kept thee back from honour.' "
Numbers,24,12,"And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Spoke I not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me, saying: "
Numbers,24,13,"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of HaShem, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what HaShem speaketh, that will I speak? "
Numbers,24,14,"And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days.' "
Numbers,24,15,"And he took up his parable, and said: The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eye is opened; "
Numbers,24,16,"The saying of him who heareth the words of G-d, and knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, fallen down, yet with opened eyes: "
Numbers,24,17,"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh; there shall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Seth. "
Numbers,24,18,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also, even his enemies, shall be a possession; while Israel doeth valiantly. "
Numbers,24,19,"And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city. "
Numbers,24,20,"And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said: Amalek was the first of the nations; but his end shall come to destruction. "
Numbers,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said: Though firm be thy dwelling-place, and though thy nest be set in the rock; "
Numbers,24,22,Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted; How long? Asshur shall carry thee away captive. 
Numbers,24,23,"And he took up his parable, and said: Alas, who shall live after G-d hath appointed him? "
Numbers,24,24,"But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall come to destruction. "
Numbers,24,25,"And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way. "
Numbers,25,1,"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab. "
Numbers,25,2,"And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. "
Numbers,25,3,And Israel joined himself unto the Baal of Peor; and the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel. 
Numbers,25,4,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto HaShem in face of the sun, that the fierce anger of HaShem may turn away from Israel.' "
Numbers,25,5,And Moses said unto the judges of Israel: 'Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the Baal of Peor.' 
Numbers,25,6,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting. "
Numbers,25,7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. "
Numbers,25,8,"And he went after the man of Israel into the chamber, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. "
Numbers,25,9,And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
Numbers,25,10,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,25,11,"'Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned My wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was very jealous for My sake among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in My jealousy. "
Numbers,25,12,"Wherefore say: Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace; "
Numbers,25,13,"and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his G-d, and made atonement for the children of Israel.' "
Numbers,25,14,"Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites. "
Numbers,25,15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian. "
Numbers,25,16,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,25,17,"'Harass the Midianites, and smite them; "
Numbers,25,18,"for they harass you, by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.' "
Numbers,25,19,"And it came to pass after the plague, "
Numbers,26,1,"that HaShem spoke unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying: "
Numbers,26,2,"'Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.' "
Numbers,26,3,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: "
Numbers,26,4,"'Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward, as HaShem commanded Moses and the children of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt.' "
Numbers,26,5,"Reuben, the first-born of Israel: the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites; "

Numbers,26,10,"and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign. "

Numbers,26,54,"To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; to each one according to those that were numbered of it shall its inheritance be given. "
Numbers,26,55,Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot; according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit. 
Numbers,26,56,According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.'

Numbers,26,61,"And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before HaShem. "
Numbers,26,62,"And they that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel. "
Numbers,26,63,"These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. "
Numbers,26,64,"But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. "
Numbers,26,65,"For HaShem had said of them: 'They shall surely die in the wilderness.' And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. "
Numbers,27,1,"Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. "
Numbers,27,2,"And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying: "
Numbers,27,3,"'Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against HaShem in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons. "
Numbers,27,4,"Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.' "
Numbers,27,5,And Moses brought their cause before HaShem. 
Numbers,27,6,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,27,7,'The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 
Numbers,27,8,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. "
Numbers,27,9,"And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. "
Numbers,27,10,"And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. "
Numbers,27,11,"And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as HaShem commanded Moses.' "
Numbers,27,12,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. "
Numbers,27,13,"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered; "
Numbers,27,14,"because ye rebelled against My commandment in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes.' --These are the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.-- "
Numbers,27,15,"And Moses spoke unto HaShem, saying: "
Numbers,27,16,"'Let HaShem, the G-d of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, "
Numbers,27,17,"who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of HaShem be not as sheep which have no shepherd.' "
Numbers,27,18,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit, and lay thy hand upon him; "
Numbers,27,19,"and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. "
Numbers,27,20,"And thou shalt put of thy honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken. "
Numbers,27,21,"And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before HaShem; at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.' "
Numbers,27,22,"And Moses did as HaShem commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation. "
Numbers,27,23,"And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as HaShem spoke by the hand of Moses. "
Numbers,28,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,28,2,"Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Me, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in its due season. "
Numbers,28,3,"And thou shalt say unto them: This is the offering made by fire which ye shall bring unto HaShem: he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering. "
Numbers,28,4,"The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at dusk; "
Numbers,28,5,"and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. "
Numbers,28,6,"It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Numbers,28,7,And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto HaShem. 
Numbers,28,8,"And the other lamb shalt thou present at dusk; as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt present it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem. "
Numbers,28,9,"And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,28,10,"This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,28,11,"And in your new moons ye shall present a burnt-offering unto HaShem: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; "
Numbers,28,12,"and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; "
Numbers,28,13,"and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto HaShem. "
Numbers,28,14,"And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year. "
Numbers,28,15,"And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto HaShem; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,28,16,"And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is HaShem'S passover. "
Numbers,28,17,And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. 
Numbers,28,18,In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work;

Numbers,29,31,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offerings thereof. "
Numbers,29,32,"And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish; "
Numbers,29,33,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance; "
Numbers,29,34,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,29,35,On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no manner of servile work; 
Numbers,29,36,"but ye shall present a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto HaShem: one bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; "
Numbers,29,37,"their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the ordinance; "
Numbers,29,38,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. "
Numbers,29,39,"These ye shall offer unto HaShem in your appointed seasons, beside your vows, and your freewill-offerings, whether they be your burnt-offerings, or your meal-offerings, or your drink-offerings, or your peace-offerings. "
Numbers,30,1,And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that HaShem commanded Moses. 
Numbers,30,2,"And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded. "
Numbers,30,3,"When a man voweth a vow unto HaShem, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. "
Numbers,30,4,"Also when a woman voweth a vow unto HaShem, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, "
Numbers,30,5,"and her father heareth her vow, or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. "
Numbers,30,6,"But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and HaShem will forgive her, because her father disallowed her. "
Numbers,30,7,"And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; "
Numbers,30,8,"and her husband hear it, whatsoever day it be that he heareth it, and hold his peace at her; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. "
Numbers,30,9,"But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; and HaShem will forgive her. "
Numbers,30,10,"But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her. "
Numbers,30,11,"And if a woman vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, "
Numbers,30,12,"and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. "
Numbers,30,13,"But if her husband make them null and void in the day that he heareth them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips, whether it were her vows, or the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and HaShem will forgive her. "
Numbers,30,14,"Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void. "
Numbers,30,15,"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he causeth all her vows to stand, or all her bonds, which are upon her; he hath let them stand, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. "
Numbers,30,16,"But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. "
Numbers,30,17,"These are the statutes, which HaShem commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house. "
Numbers,31,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,31,2,'Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites; afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.' 
Numbers,31,3,"And Moses spoke unto the people, saying: 'Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute HaShem'S vengeance on Midian. "
Numbers,31,4,"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.' "
Numbers,31,5,"So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. "
Numbers,31,6,"And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. "
Numbers,31,7,"And they warred against Midian, as HaShem commanded Moses; and they slew every male. "
Numbers,31,8,"And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian; Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. "
Numbers,31,9,"And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. "
Numbers,31,10,"And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. "
Numbers,31,11,"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast. "
Numbers,31,12,"And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp, unto the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. "
Numbers,31,13,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. "
Numbers,31,14,"And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. "
Numbers,31,15,And Moses said unto them: 'Have ye saved all the women alive? 
Numbers,31,16,"Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to revolt so as to break faith with HaShem in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of HaShem. "
Numbers,31,17,"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. "
Numbers,31,18,"But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. "
Numbers,31,19,"And encamp ye without the camp seven days; whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives. "
Numbers,31,20,"And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify.' "
Numbers,31,21,And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: 'This is the statute of the law which HaShem hath commanded Moses: 
Numbers,31,22,"Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, "
Numbers,31,23,"every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling; and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water. "
Numbers,31,24,"And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye may come into the camp.' "
Numbers,31,25,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,31,26,"'Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation; "
Numbers,31,27,"and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation; "
Numbers,31,28,"and levy a tribute unto HaShem of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the flocks; "
Numbers,31,29,"take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, as a portion set apart for HaShem. "
Numbers,31,30,"And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of HaShem.' "
Numbers,31,31,And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as HaShem commanded Moses. 
Numbers,31,32,"Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, "
Numbers,31,33,"and threescore and twelve thousand beeves, "
Numbers,31,34,"and threescore and one thousand asses, "
Numbers,31,35,"and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him. "
Numbers,31,36,"And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep. "
Numbers,31,37,And HaShem'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. 
Numbers,31,38,"And the beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which HaShem'S tribute was threescore and twelve. "
Numbers,31,39,"And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which HaShem'S tribute was threescore and one. "
Numbers,31,40,"And the persons were sixteen thousand, of whom HaShem'S tribute was thirty and two persons. "
Numbers,31,41,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was set apart for HaShem, unto Eleazar the priest, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,31,42,"And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred-- "
Numbers,31,43,"now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, "
Numbers,31,44,"and thirty and six thousand beeves, "
Numbers,31,45,"and thirty thousand and five hundred asses, "
Numbers,31,46,and sixteen thousand persons-- 
Numbers,31,47,"even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of HaShem; as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Numbers,31,48,"And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses; "
Numbers,31,49,"and they said unto Moses: 'Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. "
Numbers,31,50,"And we have brought HaShem'S offering, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before HaShem.' "
Numbers,31,51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. "
Numbers,31,52,"And all the gold of the gift that they set apart for HaShem, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.-- "
Numbers,31,53,"For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.-- "
Numbers,31,54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before HaShem. "
Numbers,32,1,"Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle, "
Numbers,32,2,"the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying: "
Numbers,32,3,"'Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, "
Numbers,32,4,"the land which HaShem smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.' "
Numbers,32,5,"And they said: 'If we have found favour in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.' "
Numbers,32,6,"And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: 'Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here? "
Numbers,32,7,And wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which HaShem hath given them? 
Numbers,32,8,"Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. "
Numbers,32,9,"For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they turned away the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which HaShem had given them. "
Numbers,32,10,"And HaShem'S anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying: "
Numbers,32,11,"Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed Me; "
Numbers,32,12,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed HaShem. "
Numbers,32,13,"And HaShem'S anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of HaShem, was consumed. "
Numbers,32,14,"And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, a brood of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of HaShem toward Israel. "
Numbers,32,15,"For if ye turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and so ye will destroy all this people.' "
Numbers,32,16,"And they came near unto him, and said: 'We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones; "
Numbers,32,17,"but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. "
Numbers,32,18,"We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. "
Numbers,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.' "
Numbers,32,20,"And Moses said unto them: 'If ye will do this thing: if ye will arm yourselves to go before HaShem to the war, "
Numbers,32,21,"and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before HaShem, until He hath driven out His enemies from before Him, "
Numbers,32,22,"and the land be subdued before HaShem, and ye return afterward; then ye shall be clear before HaShem, and before Israel, and this land shall be unto you for a possession before HaShem. "
Numbers,32,23,"But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against HaShem; and know ye your sin which will find you. "
Numbers,32,24,"Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.' "
Numbers,32,25,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying: 'Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. "
Numbers,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; "
Numbers,32,27,"but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before HaShem to battle, as my lord saith.' "
Numbers,32,28,"So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel. "
Numbers,32,29,"And Moses said unto them: 'If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before HaShem, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; "
Numbers,32,30,"but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.' "
Numbers,32,31,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: 'As HaShem hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. "
Numbers,32,32,"We will pass over armed before HaShem into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.' "
Numbers,32,33,"And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with their borders, even the cities of the land round about. "
Numbers,32,34,"And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer; "
Numbers,32,35,"and Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah; "
Numbers,32,36,"and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran; fortified cities, and folds for sheep. "
Numbers,32,37,"And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim; "
Numbers,32,38,"and Nebo, and Baal-meon--their names being changed--and Sibmah; and gave their names unto the cities which they builded. "
Numbers,32,39,"And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein. "
Numbers,32,40,And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 
Numbers,32,41,"And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the villages thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair."
Numbers,32,42,"And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name. "
Numbers,33,1,"These are the stages of the children of Israel, by which they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron. "
Numbers,33,2,"And Moses wrote their goings forth, stage by stage, by the commandment of HaShem; and these are their stages at their goings forth. "
Numbers,33,3,"And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, "
Numbers,33,4,"while the Egyptians were burying them that HaShem had smitten among them, even all their first-born; upon their gods also HaShem executed judgments. "
Numbers,33,5,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. "
Numbers,33,6,"And they journeyed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness. "
Numbers,33,7,"And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon; and they pitched before Migdol. "
Numbers,33,8,"And they journeyed from Penehahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah. "
Numbers,33,9,"And they journeyed from Marah, and came unto Elim; and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they pitched there. "
Numbers,33,10,"And they journeyed from Elim, and pitched by the Red Sea. "
Numbers,33,11,"And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and pitched in the wilderness of Sin. "
Numbers,33,12,"And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and pitched in Dophkah. "
Numbers,33,13,"And they journeyed from Dophkah, and pitched in Alush. "
Numbers,33,14,"And they journeyed from Alush, and pitched in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink. "
Numbers,33,15,"And they journeyed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai. "
Numbers,33,16,"And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and pitched in Kibroth-hattaavah. "
Numbers,33,17,"And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and pitched in Hazeroth. "
Numbers,33,18,"And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. "
Numbers,33,19,"And they journeyed from Rithmah, and pitched in Rimmon-perez. "
Numbers,33,20,"And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and pitched in Libnah. "
Numbers,33,21,"And they journeyed from Libnah, and pitched in Rissah. "
Numbers,33,22,"And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelah. "
Numbers,33,23,"And they journeyed from Kehelah, and pitched in mount Shepher. "
Numbers,33,24,"And they journeyed from mount Shepher, and pitched in Haradah. "
Numbers,33,25,"And they journeyed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. "
Numbers,33,26,"And they journeyed from Makheloth, and pitched in Tahath. "
Numbers,33,27,"And they journeyed from Tahath, and pitched in Terah. "
Numbers,33,28,"And they journeyed from Terah, and pitched in Mithkah. "
Numbers,33,29,"And they journeyed from Mithkah, and pitched in Hashmonah. "
Numbers,33,30,"And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and pitched in Moseroth. "
Numbers,33,31,"And they journeyed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan. "
Numbers,33,32,"And they journeyed from Bene-jaakan, and pitched in Hor-haggidgad. "
Numbers,33,33,"And they journeyed from Hor-haggidgad, and pitched in Jotbah. "
Numbers,33,34,"And they journeyed from Jotbah, and pitched in Abronah. "
Numbers,33,35,"And they journeyed from Abronah, and pitched in Ezion-geber. "
Numbers,33,36,"And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin--the same is Kadesh. "
Numbers,33,37,"And they journeyed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.-- "
Numbers,33,38,"And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of HaShem, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. "
Numbers,33,39,And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. 
Numbers,33,40,"And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.-- "
Numbers,33,41,"And they journeyed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. "
Numbers,33,42,"And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. "
Numbers,33,43,"And they journeyed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. "
Numbers,33,44,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab. "
Numbers,33,45,"And they journeyed from Ijim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. "
Numbers,33,46,"And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and pitched in Almon-diblathaim. "
Numbers,33,47,"And they journeyed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, in front of Nebo. "
Numbers,33,48,"And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. "
Numbers,33,49,"And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab. "
Numbers,33,50,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: "
Numbers,33,51,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, "
Numbers,33,52,"then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places. "
Numbers,33,53,"And ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it. "
Numbers,33,54,"And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families--to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit. "
Numbers,33,55,"But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell. "
Numbers,33,56,"And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you. "
Numbers,34,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,34,2,"'Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof. "
Numbers,34,3,"Thus your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin close by the side of Edom, and your south border shall begin at the end of the Salt Sea eastward; "
Numbers,34,4,"and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon; "
Numbers,34,5,"and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Sea. "
Numbers,34,6,"And for the western border, ye shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your west border. "
Numbers,34,7,And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall mark out your line unto mount Hor; 
Numbers,34,8,from mount Hor ye shall mark out a line unto the entrance to Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; 
Numbers,34,9,"and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your north border. "
Numbers,34,10,And ye shall mark out your line for the east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham; 
Numbers,34,11,"and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall strike upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; "
Numbers,34,12,"and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.' "
Numbers,34,13,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: 'This is the land wherein ye shall receive inheritance by lot, which HaShem hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe; "
Numbers,34,14,"for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance; "
Numbers,34,15,"the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sun-rising.' "
Numbers,34,16,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,34,17,"'These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. "
Numbers,34,18,"And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to take possession of the land. "
Numbers,34,19,"And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. "
Numbers,34,20,"And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. "
Numbers,34,21,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. "
Numbers,34,22,"And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli. "
Numbers,34,23,"Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod; "
Numbers,34,24,"and of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. "
Numbers,34,25,"And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Eli-zaphan the son of Parnach. "
Numbers,34,26,"And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan. "
Numbers,34,27,"And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. "
Numbers,34,28,"And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. "
Numbers,34,29,These are they whom HaShem commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.' 
Numbers,35,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: "
Numbers,35,2,"'Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and open land round about the cities shall ye give unto the Levites. "
Numbers,35,3,"And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their open land shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts. "
Numbers,35,4,"And the open land about the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. "
Numbers,35,5,"And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the open land about the cities. "
Numbers,35,6,"And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither; and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities. "
Numbers,35,7,All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with the open land about them. 
Numbers,35,8,"And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many, and from the few ye shall take few; each tribe according to its inheritance which it inheriteth shall give of its cities unto the Levites.' "
Numbers,35,9,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses, saying: "
Numbers,35,10,"'Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, "
Numbers,35,11,"then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person through error may flee thither. "
Numbers,35,12,"And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment. "
Numbers,35,13,"And as to the cities which ye shall give, there shall be for you six cities of refuge. "
Numbers,35,14,"Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. "
Numbers,35,15,"For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the settler among them, shall these six cities be for refuge, that every one that killeth any person through error may flee thither. "
Numbers,35,16,"But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. "
Numbers,35,17,"And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. "
Numbers,35,18,"Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. "
Numbers,35,19,"The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death. "
Numbers,35,20,"And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him any thing, lying in wait, so that he died; "
Numbers,35,21,"or in enmity smote him with his hand, that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death: he is a murderer; the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meeteth him. "
Numbers,35,22,"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait, "
Numbers,35,23,"or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; "
Numbers,35,24,then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 
Numbers,35,25,"and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled; and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. "
Numbers,35,26,"But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth; "
Numbers,35,27,"and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him; "
Numbers,35,28,because he must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return into the land of his possession. 
Numbers,35,29,And these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
Numbers,35,30,"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die. "
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death. "
Numbers,35,32,"And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. "
Numbers,35,33,"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. "
Numbers,35,34,"And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I HaShem dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.' "
Numbers,36,1,"And the heads of the fathers' houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel; "
Numbers,36,2,and they said: 'The HaShem commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my lord was commanded by HaShem to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 
Numbers,36,3,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. "
Numbers,36,4,"And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.' "
Numbers,36,5,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of HaShem, saying: 'The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. "
Numbers,36,6,"This is the thing which HaShem hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. "
Numbers,36,7,So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
Numbers,36,8,"And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. "
Numbers,36,9,So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' 
Numbers,36,10,"Even as HaShem commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. "
Numbers,36,11,"For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons. "
Numbers,36,12,"They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. "
Numbers,36,13,"These are the commandments and the ordinances, which HaShem commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.  "
Deuteronomy,1,1,"THESE ARE the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. "
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is eleven days journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea by the way of mount Seir. 
Deuteronomy,1,3,"And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that HaShem had given him in commandment unto them; "
Deuteronomy,1,4,"after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei; "
Deuteronomy,1,5,"beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, took Moses upon him to expound this law, saying: "
Deuteronomy,1,6,"HaShem our G-d spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: 'Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain; "
Deuteronomy,1,7,"turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore; the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. "
Deuteronomy,1,8,"Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which HaShem swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.' "
Deuteronomy,1,9,"And I spoke unto you at that time, saying: 'I am not able to bear you myself alone; "
Deuteronomy,1,10,"HaShem your G-d hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.-- "
Deuteronomy,1,11,"HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as He hath promised you!-- "
Deuteronomy,1,12,"How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? "
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over you.' "
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And ye answered me, and said: 'The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.' "
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe. "
Deuteronomy,1,16,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying: 'Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. "
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is G-d's; and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.' "
Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. 
Deuteronomy,1,19,"And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as HaShem our G-d commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. "
Deuteronomy,1,20,"And I said unto you: 'Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which HaShem our G-d giveth unto us. "
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Behold, HaShem thy G-d hath set the land before thee; go up, take possession, as HaShem, the G-d of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.' "
Deuteronomy,1,22,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said: 'Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.' "
Deuteronomy,1,23,"And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe; "
Deuteronomy,1,24,"and they turned and went up into the mountains, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. "
Deuteronomy,1,25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: 'Good is the land which HaShem our G-d giveth unto us.' "
Deuteronomy,1,26,"Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of HaShem your G-d; "
Deuteronomy,1,27,"and ye murmured in your tents, and said: 'Because HaShem hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. "
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.' "
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said unto you: 'Dread not, neither be afraid of them. "
Deuteronomy,1,30,"HaShem your G-d who goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes; "
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that HaShem thy G-d bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place. "
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet in this thing ye do not believe HaShem your G-d, "
Deuteronomy,1,33,"Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.' "
Deuteronomy,1,34,"And HaShem heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying: "
Deuteronomy,1,35,"'Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers, "
Deuteronomy,1,36,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children; because he hath wholly followed HaShem.' "
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Also HaShem was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither; "
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither; encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. "
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. "
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.' "
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then ye answered and said unto me: 'We have sinned against HaShem, we will go up and fight, according to all that HaShem our G-d commanded us.' And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country. "
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.' "
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of HaShem, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. "
Deuteronomy,1,44,"And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah. "
Deuteronomy,1,45,"And ye returned and wept before HaShem; but HaShem hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you. "
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there. "
Deuteronomy,2,1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as HaShem spoke unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days. "
Deuteronomy,2,2,"And HaShem spoke unto me, saying: "
Deuteronomy,2,3,'Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; turn you northward. 
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command thou the people, saying: Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; "
Deuteronomy,2,5,"contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. "
Deuteronomy,2,6,"Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. "
Deuteronomy,2,7,For HaShem thy G-d hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years HaShem thy G-d hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.' 
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. "
Deuteronomy,2,9,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.-- "
Deuteronomy,2,10,"The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; "
Deuteronomy,2,11,"these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. "
Deuteronomy,2,12,"And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which HaShem gave unto them.-- "
Deuteronomy,2,13,"Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.' And we went over the brook Zered. "
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation, even the men of war, were consumed from the midst of the camp, as HaShem swore unto them. "
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Moreover the hand of HaShem was against them, to discomfit them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed. "
Deuteronomy,2,16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, "
Deuteronomy,2,17,that HaShem spoke unto me saying: 
Deuteronomy,2,18,"'Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; "
Deuteronomy,2,19,"and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, harass them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.-- "
Deuteronomy,2,20,"That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, "
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but HaShem destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead; "
Deuteronomy,2,22,"as He did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day; "
Deuteronomy,2,23,"and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.-- "
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon; behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. "
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who, when they hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.' "
Deuteronomy,2,26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying: "
Deuteronomy,2,27,"'Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. "
Deuteronomy,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on my feet; "
Deuteronomy,2,29,"as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which HaShem our G-d giveth us.' "
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for HaShem thy G-d hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. "
Deuteronomy,2,31,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee; begin to possess his land.' "
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. "
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And HaShem our G-d delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. "
Deuteronomy,2,34,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones; we left none remaining; "
Deuteronomy,2,35,"only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. "
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: HaShem our G-d delivered up all before us. "
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever HaShem our G-d forbade us. "
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei. "
Deuteronomy,3,2,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.' "
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So HaShem our G-d delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. "
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. "
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many. "
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones. "
Deuteronomy,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves. "
Deuteronomy,3,8,"And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon-- "
Deuteronomy,3,9,"which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir-- "
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.-- "
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.-- "
Deuteronomy,3,12,"And this land we took in possession at that time; from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites; "
Deuteronomy,3,13,"and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob--all that Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. "
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.-- "
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley for a border; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; "
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the Arabah also, the Jordan being the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward. "
Deuteronomy,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying: 'The HaShem your G-d hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valour. "
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle--I know that ye have much cattle--shall abide in your cities which I have given you; "
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until HaShem give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which HaShem your G-d giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. "
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying: 'Thine eyes have seen all that HaShem your G-d hath done unto these two kings; so shall HaShem do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. "
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Ye shall not fear them; for HaShem your G-d, He it is that fighteth for you.' "
Deuteronomy,3,23,"And I besought HaShem at that time, saying: "
Deuteronomy,3,24,"'O L-rd GOD, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy mighty acts? "
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.' "
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But HaShem was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and HaShem said unto me: 'Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto Me of this matter. "
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. "
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.' "
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. 
Deuteronomy,4,1,"And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, giveth you. "
Deuteronomy,4,2,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of HaShem your G-d which I command you. "
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what HaShem did in Baal-peor; for all the men that followed the Baal of Peor, HaShem thy G-d hath destroyed them from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,4,4,But ye that did cleave unto HaShem your G-d are alive every one of you this day. 
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as HaShem my G-d commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it. "
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Observe therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that, when they hear all these statutes, shall say: 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.' "
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For what great nation is there, that hath G-d so nigh unto them, as HaShem our G-d is whensoever we call upon Him? "
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? "
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children; "
Deuteronomy,4,10,"the day that thou stoodest before HaShem thy G-d in Horeb, when HaShem said unto me: 'Assemble Me the people, and I will make them hear My words that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.' "
Deuteronomy,4,11,"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. "
Deuteronomy,4,12,"And HaShem spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only a voice. "
Deuteronomy,4,13,"And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the ten words; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone. "
Deuteronomy,4,14,"And HaShem commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. "
Deuteronomy,4,15,Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves--for ye saw no manner of form on the day that HaShem spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire-- 
Deuteronomy,4,16,"lest ye deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, even the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, "
Deuteronomy,4,17,"the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven, "
Deuteronomy,4,18,"the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; "
Deuteronomy,4,19,"and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which HaShem thy G-d hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven. "
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But you hath HaShem taken and brought forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto Him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. "
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Now HaShem was angered with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance; "
Deuteronomy,4,22,"but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye are to go over, and possess that good land. "
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of HaShem your G-d, which He made with you, and make you a graven image, even the likeness of any thing which HaShem thy G-d hath forbidden thee. "
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For HaShem thy G-d is a devouring fire, a jealous G-d. "
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a graven image, even the form of any thing, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of HaShem thy G-d, to provoke Him; "
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. "
Deuteronomy,4,27,"And HaShem shall scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither HaShem shall lead you away. "
Deuteronomy,4,28,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. "
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But from thence ye will seek HaShem thy G-d; and thou shalt find Him, if thou search after Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. "
Deuteronomy,4,30,"In thy distress, when all these things are come upon thee, in the end of days, thou wilt return to HaShem thy G-d, and hearken unto His voice; "
Deuteronomy,4,31,"for HaShem thy G-d is a merciful G-d; He will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which He swore unto them. "
Deuteronomy,4,32,"For ask now of the days past, which were before thee, since the day that G-d created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? "
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? "
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or hath G-d assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that HaShem your G-d did for you in Egypt before thine eyes? "
Deuteronomy,4,35,"Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightiest know that HaShem, He is G-d; there is none else beside Him. "
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee; and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire; and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire. "
Deuteronomy,4,37,"And because He loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with His presence, with His great power, out of Egypt, "
Deuteronomy,4,38,"to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day; "
Deuteronomy,4,39,"know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that HaShem, He is G-d in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else. "
Deuteronomy,4,40,"And thou shalt keep His statutes, and His commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee, for ever. "
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses separated three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; 
Deuteronomy,4,42,"that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: "
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness, in the table-land, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. "
Deuteronomy,4,44,And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel; 
Deuteronomy,4,45,"these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt; "
Deuteronomy,4,46,"beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt; "
Deuteronomy,4,47,"and they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; "
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even unto mount Sion--the same is Hermon-- "
Deuteronomy,4,49,"and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah. "
Deuteronomy,5,1,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them. "
Deuteronomy,5,2,HaShem our G-d made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
Deuteronomy,5,3,"HaShem made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. "
Deuteronomy,5,4,HaShem spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire-- 
Deuteronomy,5,5,"I stood between HaShem and you at that time, to declare unto you the word of HaShem; for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount--saying: "
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am HaShem thy G-d, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. "
Deuteronomy,5,7,Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. 
Deuteronomy,5,8,"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, even any manner of likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. "
Deuteronomy,5,9,"Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I HaShem thy G-d am a jealous G-d, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate Me, "
Deuteronomy,5,10,and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments. 
Deuteronomy,5,11,Thou shalt not take the name of HaShem thy G-d in vain; for HaShem will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. 
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as HaShem thy G-d commanded thee. "
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; "
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a sabbath unto HaShem thy G-d, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou. "
Deuteronomy,5,15,"And thou shalt remember that thou was a servant in the land of Egypt, and HaShem thy G-d brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore HaShem thy G-d commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. "
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honour thy father and thy mother, as HaShem thy G-d commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, upon the land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee. "
Deuteronomy,5,17,Thou shalt not murder. Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither shalt thou steal. Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
Deuteronomy,5,18,"Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. "
Deuteronomy,5,19,"These words HaShem spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice, and it went on no more. And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me. "
Deuteronomy,5,20,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; "
Deuteronomy,5,21,"and ye said: 'Behold, HaShem our G-d hath shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire; we have seen this day that G-d doth speak with man, and he liveth. "
Deuteronomy,5,22,"Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of HaShem our G-d any more, then we shall die. "
Deuteronomy,5,23,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? "
Deuteronomy,5,24,"Go thou near, and hear all that HaShem our G-d may say; and thou shalt speak unto us all that HaShem our G-d may speak unto thee; and we will hear it and do it.' "
Deuteronomy,5,25,"And HaShem heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me; and HaShem said unto me: 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee; they have well said all that they have spoken. "
Deuteronomy,5,26,"Oh that they had such a heart as this alway, to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! "
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go say to them: Return ye to your tents. 
Deuteronomy,5,28,"But as for thee, stand thou here by Me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.' "
Deuteronomy,5,29,Ye shall observe to do therefore as HaShem your G-d hath commanded you; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
Deuteronomy,5,30,"Ye shall walk in all the way which HaShem your G-d hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. "
Deuteronomy,5,31,
Deuteronomy,5,32,
Deuteronomy,5,33,
Deuteronomy,6,1,"Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which HaShem your G-d commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it-- "
Deuteronomy,6,2,"that thou mightest fear HaShem thy G-d, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. "
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as HaShem, the G-d of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee--a land flowing with milk and honey. "
Deuteronomy,6,4,"HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE HaShem OUR GOD, THE HaShem IS ONE. "
Deuteronomy,6,5,"And thou shalt love HaShem thy G-d with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. "
Deuteronomy,6,6,"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; "
Deuteronomy,6,7,"and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. "
Deuteronomy,6,8,"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. "
Deuteronomy,6,9,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates. "
Deuteronomy,6,10,"And it shall be, when HaShem thy G-d shall bring thee into the land which He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee--great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build, "
Deuteronomy,6,11,"and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which thou the didst not hew, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied-- "
Deuteronomy,6,12,"then beware lest thou forget HaShem, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. "
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Thou shalt fear HaShem thy G-d; and Him shalt thou serve, and by His name shalt thou swear. "
Deuteronomy,6,14,"Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you; "
Deuteronomy,6,15,"for a jealous G-d, even HaShem thy G-d, is in the midst of thee; lest the anger of HaShem thy G-d be kindled against thee, and He destroy thee from off the face of the earth. "
Deuteronomy,6,16,"Ye shall not try HaShem your G-d, as ye tried Him in Massah. "
Deuteronomy,6,17,"Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of HaShem your G-d, and His testimonies, and His statutes, which He hath commanded thee. "
Deuteronomy,6,18,"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of HaShem; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which HaShem swore unto thy fathers, "
Deuteronomy,6,19,"to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as HaShem hath spoken. "
Deuteronomy,6,20,"When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: 'What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which HaShem our G-d hath commanded you? "
Deuteronomy,6,21,then thou shalt say unto thy son: 'We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and HaShem brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
Deuteronomy,6,22,"And HaShem showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes. "
Deuteronomy,6,23,"And He brought us out from thence, that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore unto our fathers. "
Deuteronomy,6,24,"And HaShem commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear HaShem our G-d, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. "
Deuteronomy,6,25,"And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before HaShem our G-d, as He hath commanded us.' "
Deuteronomy,7,1,"When HaShem thy G-d shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; "
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when HaShem thy G-d shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them; "
Deuteronomy,7,3,"neither shalt thou make marriages with them: thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. "
Deuteronomy,7,4,"For he will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of HaShem be kindled against you, and He will destroy thee quickly. "
Deuteronomy,7,5,"But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. "
Deuteronomy,7,6,"For thou art a holy people unto HaShem thy G-d: HaShem thy G-d hath chosen thee to be His own treasure, out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. "
Deuteronomy,7,7,"HaShem did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people--for ye were the fewest of all peoples-- "
Deuteronomy,7,8,"but because HaShem loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore unto your fathers, hath HaShem brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. "
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that HaShem thy G-d, He is G-d; the faithful G-d, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations; "
Deuteronomy,7,10,"and repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them; He will not be slack to him that hateth Him, He will repay him to his face. "
Deuteronomy,7,11,"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them. "
Deuteronomy,7,12,"And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep, and do them, that HaShem thy G-d shall keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto thy fathers, "
Deuteronomy,7,13,"and He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; He will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine and the young of thy flock, in the land which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee. "
Deuteronomy,7,14,"Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. "
Deuteronomy,7,15,"And HaShem will take away from thee all sickness; and He will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. "
Deuteronomy,7,16,And thou shalt consume all the peoples that HaShem thy G-d shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. 
Deuteronomy,7,17,If thou shalt say in thy heart: 'These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?' 
Deuteronomy,7,18,"thou shalt not be afraid of them; thou shalt well remember what HaShem thy G-d did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt: "
Deuteronomy,7,19,"the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby HaShem thy G-d brought thee out; so shall HaShem thy G-d do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid. "
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover HaShem thy G-d will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and they that hide themselves, perish from before thee. "
Deuteronomy,7,21,"Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for HaShem thy G-d is in the midst of thee, a G-d great and awful. "
Deuteronomy,7,22,"And HaShem thy G-d will cast out those nations before thee by little and little; thou mayest not consume them quickly, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. "
Deuteronomy,7,23,"But HaShem thy G-d shall deliver them up before thee, and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed. "
Deuteronomy,7,24,"And He shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven; there shall no man be able to stand against thee, until thou have destroyed them. "
Deuteronomy,7,25,"The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to HaShem thy G-d. "
Deuteronomy,7,26,"And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and be accursed like unto it; thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing. "
Deuteronomy,8,1,"All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which HaShem swore unto your fathers. "
Deuteronomy,8,2,"And thou shalt remember all the way which HaShem thy G-d hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or no. "
Deuteronomy,8,3,"And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of HaShem doth man live. "
Deuteronomy,8,4,"Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. "
Deuteronomy,8,5,"And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so HaShem thy G-d chasteneth thee. "
Deuteronomy,8,6,"And thou shalt keep the commandments of HaShem thy G-d, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him. "
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For HaShem thy G-d bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills; "
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey; "
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. "
Deuteronomy,8,10,"And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless HaShem thy G-d for the good land which He hath given thee. "
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Beware lest thou forget HaShem thy G-d, in not keeping His commandments, and His ordinances, and His statutes, which I command thee this day; "
Deuteronomy,8,12,"lest when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; "
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; "
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget HaShem thy G-d, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; "
Deuteronomy,8,15,"who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; "
Deuteronomy,8,16,"who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that He might afflict thee, and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; "
Deuteronomy,8,17,and thou say in thy heart: 'My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.' 
Deuteronomy,8,18,"But thou shalt remember HaShem thy G-d, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day. "
Deuteronomy,8,19,"And it shall be, if thou shalt forget HaShem thy G-d, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I forewarn you this day that ye shall surely perish. "
Deuteronomy,8,20,"As the nations that HaShem maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of HaShem your G-d. "
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, "
Deuteronomy,9,2,"a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say: 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?' "
Deuteronomy,9,3,"Know therefore this day, that HaShem thy G-d is He who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as HaShem hath spoken unto thee. "
Deuteronomy,9,4,"Speak not thou in thy heart, after that HaShem thy G-d hath thrust them out from before thee, saying: 'For my righteousness HaShem hath brought me in to possess this land'; whereas for the wickedness of these nations HaShem doth drive them out from before thee. "
Deuteronomy,9,5,"Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations HaShem thy G-d doth drive them out from before thee, and that He may establish the word which HaShem swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. "
Deuteronomy,9,6,Know therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that HaShem thy G-d giveth thee this good land to possess it; for thou art a stiffnecked people. 
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make HaShem thy G-d wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against HaShem. "
Deuteronomy,9,8,"Also in Horeb ye made HaShem wroth, and HaShem was angered with you to have destroyed you. "
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which HaShem made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water. "
Deuteronomy,9,10,"And HaShem delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of G-d; and on them was written according to all the words, which HaShem spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. "
Deuteronomy,9,11,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that HaShem gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. "
Deuteronomy,9,12,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have dealt corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.' "
Deuteronomy,9,13,"Furthermore HaShem spoke unto me, saying: 'I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people; "
Deuteronomy,9,14,"let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.' "
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. "
Deuteronomy,9,16,"And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against HaShem your G-d; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which HaShem had commanded you. "
Deuteronomy,9,17,"And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. "
Deuteronomy,9,18,"And I fell down before HaShem, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him. "
Deuteronomy,9,19,"For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith HaShem was wroth against you to destroy you. But HaShem hearkened unto me that time also. "
Deuteronomy,9,20,Moreover HaShem was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
Deuteronomy,9,21,"And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.-- "
Deuteronomy,9,22,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made HaShem wroth. "
Deuteronomy,9,23,"And when HaShem sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and possess the land which I have given you'; then ye rebelled against the commandment of HaShem your G-d, and ye believed Him not, nor hearkened to His voice. "
Deuteronomy,9,24,Ye have been rebellious against HaShem from the day that I knew you.-- 
Deuteronomy,9,25,So I fell down before HaShem the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because HaShem had said He would destroy you. 
Deuteronomy,9,26,"And I prayed unto HaShem, and said: 'O L-rd GOD, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, that Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. "
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin; "
Deuteronomy,9,28,"lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say: Because HaShem was not able to bring them into the land which He promised unto them, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. "
Deuteronomy,9,29,"Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm.' "
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time HaShem said unto me: 'Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount; and make thee an ark of wood. "
Deuteronomy,10,2,"And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.' "
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand. "
Deuteronomy,10,4,"And He wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten words, which HaShem spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and HaShem gave them unto me. "
Deuteronomy,10,5,"And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as HaShem commanded me.-- "
Deuteronomy,10,6,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-benejaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. "
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod; and from Gudgod to Jotbah, a land of brooks of water.-- "
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time HaShem separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of HaShem, to stand before HaShem to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day. "
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; HaShem is his inheritance, according as HaShem thy G-d spoke unto him.-- "
Deuteronomy,10,10,"Now I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and HaShem hearkened unto me that time also; HaShem would not destroy thee. "
Deuteronomy,10,11,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Arise, go before the people, causing them to set forward, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.' "
Deuteronomy,10,12,"And now, Israel, what doth HaShem thy G-d require of thee, but to fear HaShem thy G-d, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve HaShem thy G-d with all thy heart and with all thy soul; "
Deuteronomy,10,13,"to keep for thy good the commandments of HaShem, and His statutes, which I command thee this day? "
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Behold, unto HaShem thy G-d belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that therein is. "
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Only HaShem had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you, above all peoples, as it is this day. "
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. "
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For HaShem your G-d, He is G-d of gods, and L-rd of lords, the great G-d, the mighty, and the awful, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward. "
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. "
Deuteronomy,10,19,Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
Deuteronomy,10,20,"Thou shalt fear HaShem thy G-d; Him shalt thou serve; and to Him shalt thou cleave, and by His name shalt thou swear. "
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is thy glory, and He is thy G-d, that hath done for thee these great and tremendous things, which thine eyes have seen. "
Deuteronomy,10,22,Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now HaShem thy G-d hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
Deuteronomy,11,1,"Therefore thou shalt love HaShem thy G-d, and keep His charge, and His statutes, and His ordinances, and His commandments, alway. "
Deuteronomy,11,2,"And know ye this day; for I speak not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of HaShem your G-d, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm, "
Deuteronomy,11,3,"and His signs, and His works, which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; "
Deuteronomy,11,4,"and what He did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how HaShem hath destroyed them unto this day; "
Deuteronomy,11,5,"and what He did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place; "
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living substance that followed them, in the midst of all Israel; "
Deuteronomy,11,7,but your eyes have seen all the great work of HaShem which He did. 
Deuteronomy,11,8,"Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it; "
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which HaShem swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey. "
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and didst water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs; "
Deuteronomy,11,11,"but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down; "
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land which HaShem thy G-d careth for; the eyes of HaShem thy G-d are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. "
Deuteronomy,11,13,"And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you this day, to love HaShem your G-d, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, "
Deuteronomy,11,14,"that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. "
Deuteronomy,11,15,"And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. "
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; "
Deuteronomy,11,17,"and the anger of HaShem be kindled against you, and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain, and the ground shall not yield her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which HaShem giveth you. "
Deuteronomy,11,18,"Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. "
Deuteronomy,11,19,"And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. "
Deuteronomy,11,20,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates; "
Deuteronomy,11,21,"that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which HaShem swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. "
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love HaShem your G-d, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him, "
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then will HaShem drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. "
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border. "
Deuteronomy,11,25,"There shall no man be able to stand against you: HaShem your G-d shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as He hath spoken unto you. "
Deuteronomy,11,26,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: "
Deuteronomy,11,27,"the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of HaShem your G-d, which I command you this day; "
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of HaShem your G-d, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. "
Deuteronomy,11,29,"And it shall come to pass, when HaShem thy G-d shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. "
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the terebinths of Moreh? "
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which HaShem your G-d giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. "
Deuteronomy,11,32,And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day. 
Deuteronomy,12,1,"These are the statutes and the ordinances, which ye shall observe to do in the land which HaShem, the G-d of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. "
Deuteronomy,12,2,"Ye shall surely destroy all the places, wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree. "
Deuteronomy,12,3,"And ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. "
Deuteronomy,12,4,Ye shall not do so unto HaShem your G-d. 
Deuteronomy,12,5,"But unto the place which HaShem your G-d shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come; "
Deuteronomy,12,6,"and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock; "
Deuteronomy,12,7,"and there ye shall eat before HaShem your G-d, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein HaShem thy G-d hath blessed thee. "
Deuteronomy,12,8,"Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes; "
Deuteronomy,12,9,"for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which HaShem your G-d giveth thee. "
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which HaShem your G-d causeth you to inherit, and He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; "
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then it shall come to pass that the place which HaShem your G-d shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto HaShem. "
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And ye shall rejoice before HaShem your G-d, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you. "
Deuteronomy,12,13,Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; 
Deuteronomy,12,14,"but in the place which HaShem shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee. "
Deuteronomy,12,15,"Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of HaShem thy G-d which He hath given thee; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. "
Deuteronomy,12,16,Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 
Deuteronomy,12,17,"Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the offering of thy hand; "
Deuteronomy,12,18,"but thou shalt eat them before HaShem thy G-d in the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before HaShem thy G-d in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. "
Deuteronomy,12,19,Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land. 
Deuteronomy,12,20,"When HaShem thy G-d shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee, and thou shalt say: 'I will eat flesh', because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul. "
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose to put His name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which HaShem hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul. "
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Howbeit as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike. "
Deuteronomy,12,23,Only be stedfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh. 
Deuteronomy,12,24,Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 
Deuteronomy,12,25,"Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of HaShem. "
Deuteronomy,12,26,"Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which HaShem shall choose; "
Deuteronomy,12,27,"and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of HaShem thy G-d; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out against the altar of HaShem thy G-d, and thou shalt eat the flesh. "
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of HaShem thy G-d. "
Deuteronomy,12,29,"When HaShem thy G-d shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land; "
Deuteronomy,12,30,"take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying: 'How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.' "
Deuteronomy,12,31,"Thou shalt not do so unto HaShem thy G-d; for every abomination to HaShem, which He hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods. "
Deuteronomy,13,1,"All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it. "
Deuteronomy,13,2,"If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams--and he give thee a sign or a wonder, "
Deuteronomy,13,3,"and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee--saying: 'Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them'; "
Deuteronomy,13,4,"thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams; for HaShem your G-d putteth you to proof, to know whether ye do love HaShem your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul. "
Deuteronomy,13,5,"After HaShem your G-d shall ye walk, and Him shall ye fear, and His commandments shall ye keep, and unto His voice shall ye hearken, and Him shall ye serve, and unto Him shall ye cleave. "
Deuteronomy,13,6,"And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken perversion against HaShem your G-d, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which HaShem thy G-d commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,13,7,"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying: 'Let us go and serve other gods,' which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; "
Deuteronomy,13,8,"of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; "
Deuteronomy,13,9,"thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him; "
Deuteronomy,13,10,"but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. "
Deuteronomy,13,11,"And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to draw thee away from HaShem thy G-d, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. "
Deuteronomy,13,12,"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,13,13,"If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee to dwell there, saying: "
Deuteronomy,13,14,"'Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying: Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known'; "
Deuteronomy,13,15,"then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee; "
Deuteronomy,13,16,"thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. "
Deuteronomy,13,17,"And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto HaShem thy G-d; and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again. "
Deuteronomy,13,18,"And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand, that HaShem may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers; "
Deuteronomy,13,19,"when thou shalt hearken to the voice of HaShem thy G-d, to keep all His commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of HaShem thy G-d. "
Deuteronomy,14,1,"Ye are the children of HaShem your G-d: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. "
Deuteronomy,14,2,"For thou art a holy people unto HaShem thy G-d, and HaShem hath chosen thee to be His own treasure out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. "
Deuteronomy,14,3,Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, "
Deuteronomy,14,5,"the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the mountain-sheep. "
Deuteronomy,14,6,"And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof wholly cloven in two, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that ye may eat. "
Deuteronomy,14,7,"Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rock-badger, because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you; "
Deuteronomy,14,8,"and the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you; of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch. "
Deuteronomy,14,9,These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat; 
Deuteronomy,14,10,and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you. 
Deuteronomy,14,11,Of all clean birds ye may eat. 
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the ospray; "
Deuteronomy,14,13,"and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kinds; "
Deuteronomy,14,14,and every raven after its kinds; 
Deuteronomy,14,15,"and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds; "
Deuteronomy,14,16,"the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl; "
Deuteronomy,14,17,"and the pelican, and the carrion-vulture, and the cormorant; "
Deuteronomy,14,18,"and the stork, and the heron after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat. "
Deuteronomy,14,19,And all winged swarming things are unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten. 
Deuteronomy,14,20,Of all clean winged things ye may eat. 
Deuteronomy,14,21,"Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself; thou mayest give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner; for thou art a holy people unto HaShem thy G-d. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. "
Deuteronomy,14,22,"Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which is brought forth in the field year by year. "
Deuteronomy,14,23,"And thou shalt eat before HaShem thy G-d, in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear HaShem thy G-d always. "
Deuteronomy,14,24,"And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which HaShem thy G-d shall choose to set His name there, when HaShem thy G-d shall bless thee; "
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose. "
Deuteronomy,14,26,"And thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before HaShem thy G-d, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household. "
Deuteronomy,14,27,"And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee. "
Deuteronomy,14,28,"At the end of every three years, even in the same year, thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase, and shall lay it up within thy gates. "
Deuteronomy,14,29,"And the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that HaShem thy G-d may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest. "
Deuteronomy,15,1,At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. 
Deuteronomy,15,2,And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbour; he shall not exact it of his neighbour and his brother; because HaShem'S release hath been proclaimed. 
Deuteronomy,15,3,Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it; but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release. 
Deuteronomy,15,4,Howbeit there shall be no needy among you--for HaShem will surely bless thee in the land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it-- 
Deuteronomy,15,5,"if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of HaShem thy G-d, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day. "
Deuteronomy,15,6,"For HaShem thy G-d will bless thee, as He promised thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee. "
Deuteronomy,15,7,"If there be among you a needy man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates, in thy land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother; "
Deuteronomy,15,8,"but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth. "
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying: 'The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand'; and thine eye be evil against thy needy brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto HaShem against thee, and it be sin in thee. "
Deuteronomy,15,10,"Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing HaShem thy G-d will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. "
Deuteronomy,15,11,"For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying: 'Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy poor and needy brother, in thy land.' "
Deuteronomy,15,12,"If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. "
Deuteronomy,15,13,"And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; "
Deuteronomy,15,14,"thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith HaShem thy G-d hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. "
Deuteronomy,15,15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and HaShem thy G-d redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing to-day. "
Deuteronomy,15,16,"And it shall be, if he say unto thee: 'I will not go out from thee'; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he fareth well with thee; "
Deuteronomy,15,17,"then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear and into the door, and he shall be thy bondman for ever. And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise. "
Deuteronomy,15,18,"It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years; and HaShem thy G-d will bless thee in all that thou doest. "
Deuteronomy,15,19,"All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto HaShem thy G-d; thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock. "
Deuteronomy,15,20,"Thou shalt eat it before HaShem thy G-d year by year in the place which HaShem shall choose, thou and thy household. "
Deuteronomy,15,21,"And if there be any blemish therein, lameness, or blindness, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto HaShem thy G-d. "
Deuteronomy,15,22,"Thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the unclean and the clean may eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart. "
Deuteronomy,15,23,Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water. 
Deuteronomy,16,1,"Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto HaShem thy G-d; for in the month of Abib HaShem thy G-d brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. "
Deuteronomy,16,2,"And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto HaShem thy G-d, of the flock and the herd, in the place which HaShem shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. "
Deuteronomy,16,3,"Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou come forth out of the land of Egypt; that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. "
Deuteronomy,16,4,"And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all they borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. "
Deuteronomy,16,5,"Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover-offering within any of thy gates, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee; "
Deuteronomy,16,6,"but at the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose to cause His name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. "
Deuteronomy,16,7,"And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. "
Deuteronomy,16,8,Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to HaShem thy G-d; thou shalt do no work therein. 
Deuteronomy,16,9,Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn shalt thou begin to number seven weeks. 
Deuteronomy,16,10,"And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto HaShem thy G-d after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as HaShem thy G-d blesseth thee. "
Deuteronomy,16,11,"And thou shalt rejoice before HaShem thy G-d, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within they gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. "
Deuteronomy,16,12,And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. 
Deuteronomy,16,13,"Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress. "

Deuteronomy,16,17,"every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of HaShem thy G-d which He hath given thee. "
Deuteronomy,16,18,"Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. "

Deuteronomy,16,21,"Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of HaShem thy G-d, which thou shalt make thee. "

Deuteronomy,17,3,"and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have commanded not; "
Deuteronomy,17,4,"and it be told thee, and thou hear it, then shalt thou inquire diligently, and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel; "
Deuteronomy,17,5,"then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them with stones, that they die. "
Deuteronomy,17,6,"At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. "
Deuteronomy,17,7,"The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,17,8,"If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, even matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which HaShem thy G-d shall choose. "
Deuteronomy,17,9,"And thou shall come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days; and thou shalt inquire; and they shall declare unto thee the sentence of judgment. "

Deuteronomy,17,14,"When thou art come unto the land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein; and shalt say: 'I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me'; "
Deuteronomy,17,15,"thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom HaShem thy G-d shall choose; one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother. "
Deuteronomy,17,16,"Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses; forasmuch as HaShem hath said unto you: 'Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.' "

Deuteronomy,17,19,"And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear HaShem his G-d, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; "
Deuteronomy,17,20,"that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,18,1,"The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of HaShem made by fire, and His inheritance. "

Deuteronomy,18,6,"And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which HaShem shall choose; "

Deuteronomy,18,17,And HaShem said unto me: 'They have well said that which they have spoken. 
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. "

Deuteronomy,18,21,And if thou say in thy heart: 'How shall we know the word which HaShem hath not spoken?' 
Deuteronomy,18,22,"When a prophet speaketh in the name of HaShem, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which HaShem hath not spoken; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him. "
Deuteronomy,19,1,"When HaShem thy G-d shall cut off the nations, whose land HaShem thy G-d giveth thee, and thou dost succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; "

Deuteronomy,19,3,"Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which HaShem thy G-d causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither. "
Deuteronomy,19,4,"And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; "
Deuteronomy,19,5,"as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live; "
Deuteronomy,19,6,"lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not deserving of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. "
Deuteronomy,19,7,"Wherefore I command thee, saying: 'Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.' "
Deuteronomy,19,8,"And if HaShem thy G-d enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers-- "
Deuteronomy,19,9,"if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love HaShem thy G-d, and to walk ever in His ways--then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three; "
Deuteronomy,19,10,"that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. "
Deuteronomy,19,11,"But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee into one of these cities; "

Deuteronomy,19,15,"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be establishment "
Deuteronomy,19,16,If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to bear perverted witness against him; 
Deuteronomy,19,17,"then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before HaShem, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days. "
Deuteronomy,19,18,"And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; "
Deuteronomy,19,19,"then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,19,20,"And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. "

Deuteronomy,20,1,"When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for HaShem thy G-d is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. "
Deuteronomy,20,2,"And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, "
Deuteronomy,20,3,"and shall say unto them: 'Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, neither be ye affrighted at them; "
Deuteronomy,20,4,"for HaShem your G-d is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.' "

Deuteronomy,20,9,"And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that captains of hosts shall be appointed at the head of the people. "
Deuteronomy,20,10,"When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. "
Deuteronomy,20,11,"And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee. "
Deuteronomy,20,12,"And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it. "
Deuteronomy,20,13,"And when HaShem thy G-d delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword; "
Deuteronomy,20,14,"but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which HaShem thy G-d hath given thee. "
Deuteronomy,20,15,"Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. "
Deuteronomy,20,16,"Howbeit of the cities of these peoples, that HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth, "
Deuteronomy,20,17,"but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as HaShem thy G-d hath commanded thee; "
Deuteronomy,20,18,"that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, and so ye sin against HaShem your G-d. "
Deuteronomy,20,19,"When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, but thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee? "
Deuteronomy,20,20,"Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, them thou mayest destroy and cut down, that thou mayest build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall. "
Deuteronomy,21,1,"If one be found slain in the land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; "

Deuteronomy,21,3,"And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke. "
Deuteronomy,21,4,"And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. "
Deuteronomy,21,5,"And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near--for them HaShem thy G-d hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of HaShem; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. "
Deuteronomy,21,6,"And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. "
Deuteronomy,21,7,"And they shall speak and say: 'Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. "
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Forgive, O HaShem, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.' And the blood shall be forgiven them. "
Deuteronomy,21,9,"So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of HaShem. "
Deuteronomy,21,10,"When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and HaShem thy G-d delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, "
Deuteronomy,21,11,"and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; "
Deuteronomy,21,12,"then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; "
Deuteronomy,21,13,"and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. "
Deuteronomy,21,14,"And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her. "
Deuteronomy,21,15,"If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; "
Deuteronomy,21,16,"then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born; "
Deuteronomy,21,17,"but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the right of the first-born is his. "
Deuteronomy,21,18,"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; "
Deuteronomy,21,19,"then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; "
Deuteronomy,21,20,"and they shall say unto the elders of his city: 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.' "
Deuteronomy,21,21,"And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. "
Deuteronomy,21,22,"And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; "
Deuteronomy,21,23,"his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto G-d; that thou defile not thy land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance. "
Deuteronomy,22,1,"Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep driven away, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely bring them back unto thy brother. "
Deuteronomy,22,2,"And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother require it, and thou shalt restore it to him. "
Deuteronomy,22,3,"And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found; thou mayest not hide thyself. "
Deuteronomy,22,4,"Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. "
Deuteronomy,22,5,"A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto HaShem thy G-d. "
Deuteronomy,22,6,"If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young; "
Deuteronomy,22,7,"thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. "
Deuteronomy,22,8,"When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence. "

Deuteronomy,22,14,"and lay wanton charges against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say: 'I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity'; "
Deuteronomy,22,15,"then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate. "
Deuteronomy,22,16,"And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders: 'I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; "
Deuteronomy,22,17,"and, lo, he hath laid wanton charges, saying: I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. "
Deuteronomy,22,18,And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. 
Deuteronomy,22,19,"And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. "
Deuteronomy,22,20,"But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; "
Deuteronomy,22,21,"then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die; because she hath wrought a wanton deed in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,22,22,"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel. "
Deuteronomy,22,23,"If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; "
Deuteronomy,22,24,"then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die: the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife; so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. "
Deuteronomy,22,25,"But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man take hold of her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die. "
Deuteronomy,22,26,"But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter. "
Deuteronomy,22,27,"For he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. "
Deuteronomy,22,28,"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; "

Deuteronomy,23,4,An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of HaShem; even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the assembly of HaShem for ever;

Deuteronomy,29,17,"lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from HaShem our G-d, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; "
Deuteronomy,29,18,"and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying: 'I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart--that the watered be swept away with the dry'; "
Deuteronomy,29,19,"HaShem will not be willing to pardon him, but then the anger of HaShem and His jealousy shall be kindled against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and HaShem shall blot out his name from under heaven; "
Deuteronomy,29,20,"and HaShem shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law. "
Deuteronomy,29,21,"And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith HaShem hath made it sick; "
Deuteronomy,29,22,"and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which HaShem overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath; "
Deuteronomy,29,23,even all the nations shall say 'Wherefore hath HaShem done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?' 
Deuteronomy,29,24,"then men shall say: 'Because they forsook the covenant of HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt; "
Deuteronomy,29,25,"and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that He had not allotted unto them; "
Deuteronomy,29,26,"therefore the anger of HaShem was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book; "
Deuteronomy,29,27,"and HaShem rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day'.-- "
Deuteronomy,29,28,"The secret things belong unto HaShem our G-d; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. "
Deuteronomy,30,1,"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt bethink thyself among all the nations, whither HaShem thy G-d hath driven thee, "
Deuteronomy,30,2,"and shalt return unto HaShem thy G-d, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; "
Deuteronomy,30,3,"that then HaShem thy G-d will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither HaShem thy G-d hath scattered thee. "
Deuteronomy,30,4,"If any of thine that are dispersed be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will HaShem thy G-d gather thee, and from thence will He fetch thee. "
Deuteronomy,30,5,"And HaShem thy G-d will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. "
Deuteronomy,30,6,"And HaShem thy G-d will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love HaShem thy G-d with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. "
Deuteronomy,30,7,"And HaShem thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee. "
Deuteronomy,30,8,"And thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of HaShem, and do all His commandments which I command thee this day. "
Deuteronomy,30,9,"And HaShem thy G-d will make thee over-abundant in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good; for HaShem will again rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers; "
Deuteronomy,30,10,"if thou shalt hearken to the voice of HaShem thy G-d, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto HaShem thy G-d with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. "
Deuteronomy,30,11,"For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. "
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' "
Deuteronomy,30,13,"Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' "
Deuteronomy,30,14,"But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. "
Deuteronomy,30,15,"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, "
Deuteronomy,30,16,"in that I command thee this day to love HaShem thy G-d, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live and multiply, and HaShem thy G-d shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. "
Deuteronomy,30,17,"But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; "
Deuteronomy,30,18,"I declare unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it. "
Deuteronomy,30,19,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; "
Deuteronomy,30,20,"to love HaShem thy G-d, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which HaShem swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. "
Deuteronomy,31,1,And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel. 
Deuteronomy,31,2,And he said unto them: 'I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in; and HaShem hath said unto me: Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
Deuteronomy,31,3,"HaShem thy G-d, He will go over before thee; He will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them; and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as HaShem hath spoken. "
Deuteronomy,31,4,"And HaShem will do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom He destroyed. "
Deuteronomy,31,5,"And HaShem will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you. "
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them; for HaShem thy G-d, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.' "
Deuteronomy,31,7,"And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: 'Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this people into the land which HaShem hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. "
Deuteronomy,31,8,"And HaShem, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.' "
Deuteronomy,31,9,"And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem, and unto all the elders of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,31,10,"And Moses commanded them, saying: 'At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, "
Deuteronomy,31,11,"when all Israel is come to appear before HaShem thy G-d in the place which He shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. "
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear HaShem your G-d, and observe to do all the words of this law; "
Deuteronomy,31,13,"and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear HaShem your G-d, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.' "
Deuteronomy,31,14,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Behold, thy days approach that thou must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge.' And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. "
Deuteronomy,31,15,And HaShem appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 
Deuteronomy,31,16,"And HaShem said unto Moses: 'Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I have made with them. "
Deuteronomy,31,17,"Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Are not these evils come upon us because our G-d is not among us? "
Deuteronomy,31,18,"And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. "
Deuteronomy,31,19,"Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,31,20,"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten their fill, and waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant; "
Deuteronomy,31,21,"then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination how they do even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.' "
Deuteronomy,31,22,"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,31,23,"And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said: 'Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee.' "
Deuteronomy,31,24,"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, "
Deuteronomy,31,25,"that Moses commanded the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem, saying: "
Deuteronomy,31,26,"'Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of HaShem your G-d, that it may be there for a witness against thee. "
Deuteronomy,31,27,"For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck; behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against HaShem; and how much more after my death? "
Deuteronomy,31,28,"Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. "
Deuteronomy,31,29,"For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the end of days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him through the work of your hands.' "
Deuteronomy,31,30,"And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished: "
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. "
Deuteronomy,32,2,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon the herb. "
Deuteronomy,32,3,For I will proclaim the name of HaShem; ascribe ye greatness unto our G-d. 
Deuteronomy,32,4,"The Rock, His work is perfect; for all His ways are justice; a G-d of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is He. "
Deuteronomy,32,5,Is corruption His? No; His children's is the blemish; a generation crooked and perverse. 
Deuteronomy,32,6,"Do ye thus requite HaShem, O foolish people and unwise? is not He thy father that hath gotten thee? hath He not made thee, and established thee? "
Deuteronomy,32,7,"Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee. "
Deuteronomy,32,8,"When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,32,9,"For the portion of HaShem is His people, Jacob the lot of His inheritance. "
Deuteronomy,32,10,"He found him in a desert land, and in the waste, a howling wilderness; He compassed him about, He cared for him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. "
Deuteronomy,32,11,"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions-- "
Deuteronomy,32,12,"HaShem alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with Him. "
Deuteronomy,32,13,"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and he did eat the fruitage of the field; and He made him to suck honey out of the crag, and oil out of the flinty rock; "
Deuteronomy,32,14,"Curd of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats, with the kidney-fat of wheat; and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine. "
Deuteronomy,32,15,"But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked--thou didst wax fat, thou didst grow thick, thou didst become gross--and he forsook G-d who made him, and contemned the Rock of his salvation. "
Deuteronomy,32,16,"They roused Him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations did they provoke Him. "
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They sacrificed unto demons, no-gods, gods that they knew not, new gods that came up of late, which your fathers dreaded not. "
Deuteronomy,32,18,"Of the Rock that begot thee thou wast unmindful, and didst forget G-d that bore thee. "
Deuteronomy,32,19,"And HaShem saw, and spurned, because of the provoking of His sons and His daughters. "
Deuteronomy,32,20,"And He said: 'I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faithfulness. "
Deuteronomy,32,21,They have roused Me to jealousy with a no-god; they have provoked Me with their vanities; and I will rouse them to jealousy with a no-people; I will provoke them with a vile nation. 
Deuteronomy,32,22,"For a fire is kindled in My nostril, and burneth unto the depths of the nether-world, and devoureth the earth with her produce, and setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains. "
Deuteronomy,32,23,I will heap evils upon them; I will spend Mine arrows upon them; 
Deuteronomy,32,24,"The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt, and bitter destruction; and the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust. "
Deuteronomy,32,25,"Without shall the sword bereave, and in the chambers terror; slaying both young man and virgin, the suckling with the man of gray hairs. "
Deuteronomy,32,26,"I thought I would make an end of them, I would make their memory cease from among men; "
Deuteronomy,32,27,"Were it not that I dreaded the enemy's provocation, lest their adversaries should misdeem, lest they should say: Our hand is exalted, and not HaShem hath wrought all this.' "
Deuteronomy,32,28,"For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no understanding in them. "
Deuteronomy,32,29,"If they were wise, they would understand this, they would discern their latter end. "
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had given them over and HaShem had delivered them up? "
Deuteronomy,32,31,"For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. "
Deuteronomy,32,32,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter; "
Deuteronomy,32,33,"Their wine is the venom of serpents, and the cruel poison of asps. "
Deuteronomy,32,34,"'Is not this laid up in store with Me, sealed up in My treasuries? "
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Vengeance is Mine, and recompense, against the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. "
Deuteronomy,32,36,"For HaShem will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants; when He seeth that their stay is gone, and there is none remaining, shut up or left at large. "
Deuteronomy,32,37,"And it is said: Where are their gods, the rock in whom they trusted; "
Deuteronomy,32,38,"Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offering? let him rise up and help you, let him be your protection. "
Deuteronomy,32,39,"See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no god with Me; I kill, and I make alive; I have wounded, and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of My hand. "
Deuteronomy,32,40,"For I lift up My hand to heaven, and say: As I live for ever, "
Deuteronomy,32,41,"If I whet My glittering sword, and My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to Mine adversaries, and will recompense them that hate Me. "
Deuteronomy,32,42,"I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh; with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired heads of the enemy.' "
Deuteronomy,32,43,"Sing aloud, O ye nations, of His people; for He doth avenge the blood of His servants, and doth render vengeance to His adversaries, and doth make expiation for the land of His people. "
Deuteronomy,32,44,"And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. "
Deuteronomy,32,45,"And when Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel, "
Deuteronomy,32,46,he said unto them: 'Set your heart unto all the words wherewith I testify against you this day; that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law. 
Deuteronomy,32,47,"For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.' "
Deuteronomy,32,48,"And HaShem spoke unto Moses that selfsame day, saying: "
Deuteronomy,32,49,"'Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; "
Deuteronomy,32,50,"and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people. "
Deuteronomy,32,51,"Because ye trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel. "
Deuteronomy,32,52,For thou shalt see the land afar off; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.' 
Deuteronomy,33,1,And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of G-d blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
Deuteronomy,33,2,"And he said: HaShem came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, and He came from the myriads holy, at His right hand was a fiery law unto them. "
Deuteronomy,33,3,"Yea, He loveth the peoples, all His holy ones--they are in Thy hand; and they sit down at Thy feet, receiving of Thy words. "
Deuteronomy,33,4,"Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. "
Deuteronomy,33,5,"And there was a king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together. "
Deuteronomy,33,6,"Let Reuben live, and not die in that his men become few. "
Deuteronomy,33,7,"And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, HaShem, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; his hands shall contend for him, and Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. "
Deuteronomy,33,8,"And of Levi he said: Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one, whom Thou didst prove at Massah, with whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; "
Deuteronomy,33,9,"Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him'; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew he his own children; for they have observed Thy word, and keep Thy covenant. "
Deuteronomy,33,10,"They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense before Thee, and whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar. "
Deuteronomy,33,11,"Bless, HaShem, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. "
Deuteronomy,33,12,"Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of HaShem shall dwell in safety by Him; He covereth him all the day, and He dwelleth between his shoulders. "
Deuteronomy,33,13,"And of Joseph he said: Blessed of HaShem be his land; for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, "
Deuteronomy,33,14,"And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the yield of the moons, "
Deuteronomy,33,15,"And for the tops of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills, "
Deuteronomy,33,16,"And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, and the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush; let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren. "
Deuteronomy,33,17,"His firstling bullock, majesty is his; and his horns are the horns of the wild-ox; with them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. "
Deuteronomy,33,18,"And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and, Issachar, in thy tents. "
Deuteronomy,33,19,"They shall call peoples unto the mountain; there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden treasures of the sand. "
Deuteronomy,33,20,"And of Gad he said: Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad; he dwelleth as a lioness, and teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head. "
Deuteronomy,33,21,"And he chose a first part for himself, for there a portion of a ruler was reserved; and there came the heads of the people, he executed the righteousness of HaShem, and His ordinances with Israel. "
Deuteronomy,33,22,"And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp, that leapeth forth from Bashan. "
Deuteronomy,33,23,"And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of HaShem: possess thou the sea and the south. "
Deuteronomy,33,24,"And of Asher he said: Blessed be Asher above sons; let him be the favoured of his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. "
Deuteronomy,33,25,"Iron and brass shall be thy bars; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. "
Deuteronomy,33,26,"There is none like unto G-d, O Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven as thy help, and in His excellency on the skies. "
Deuteronomy,33,27,"The eternal G-d is a dwelling-place, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and He thrust out the enemy from before thee, and said: 'Destroy.' "
Deuteronomy,33,28,"And Israel dwelleth in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of corn and wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew. "
Deuteronomy,33,29,"Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee? a people saved by HaShem, the shield of thy help, and that is the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. "
Deuteronomy,34,1,"And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And HaShem showed him all the land, even Gilead as far as Dan; "
Deuteronomy,34,2,"and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder sea; "
Deuteronomy,34,3,"and the South, and the Plain, even the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. "
Deuteronomy,34,4,"And HaShem said unto him: 'This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.' "
Deuteronomy,34,5,"So Moses the servant of HaShem died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of HaShem. "
Deuteronomy,34,6,And he was buried in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 
Deuteronomy,34,7,"And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. "
Deuteronomy,34,8,And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. 
Deuteronomy,34,9,"And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Deuteronomy,34,10,"And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom HaShem knew face to face; "
Deuteronomy,34,11,"in all the signs and the wonders, which HaShem sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; "
Deuteronomy,34,12,"and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.  "
Joshua,1,1,"NOW IT came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of HaShem, that HaShem spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying: "
Joshua,1,2,"'Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. "
Joshua,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spoke unto Moses. "
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border. "
Joshua,1,5,"There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. "
Joshua,1,6,Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I swore unto their fathers to give them. 
Joshua,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses My servant commanded thee; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. "
Joshua,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. "
Joshua,1,9,"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for HaShem thy G-d is with thee whithersoever thou goest.' "
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying: "
Joshua,1,11,"'Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying: Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which HaShem your G-d giveth you to possess it.' "
Joshua,1,12,"And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying: "
Joshua,1,13,"'Remember the word which Moses the servant of HaShem commanded, you, saying: HaShem your G-d giveth you rest, and will give you this land. "
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them; "
Joshua,1,15,"until HaShem have given your brethren rest, as unto you, and they also have possessed the land which HaShem your G-d giveth them; then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of HaShem gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.' "
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered Joshua, saying: 'All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. "
Joshua,1,17,"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only HaShem thy G-d be with thee, as He was with Moses. "
Joshua,1,18,"Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death; only be strong and of good courage.' "
Joshua,2,1,"And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two spies secretly, saying: 'Go view the land, and Jericho.' And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. "
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying: 'Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.' "
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying: 'Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.' "
Joshua,2,4,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said: 'Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were; "
Joshua,2,5,"and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.' "
Joshua,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had spread out upon the roof. "
Joshua,2,7,"And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, the gate was shut. "
Joshua,2,8,"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; "
Joshua,2,9,"and she said unto the men: 'I know that HaShem hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. "
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how HaShem dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. "
Joshua,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you; for HaShem your G-d, He is G-d in heaven above, and on earth beneath. "
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by HaShem, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house--and give me a true token-- "
Joshua,2,13,"and save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.' "
Joshua,2,14,"And the men said unto her: 'Our life for yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when HaShem giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.' "
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. "
Joshua,2,16,"And she said unto them: 'Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward may ye go your way.' "
Joshua,2,17,And the men said unto her: 'We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
Joshua,2,18,"Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household. "
Joshua,2,19,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. "
Joshua,2,20,"But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.' "
Joshua,2,21,"And she said: 'According unto your words, so be it.' And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window. "
Joshua,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. "
Joshua,2,23,"Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. "
Joshua,2,24,And they said unto Joshua: 'Truly HaShem hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.' 
Joshua,3,1,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. "
Joshua,3,2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp; "
Joshua,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying: 'When ye see the ark of the covenant of HaShem your G-d, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. "
Joshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.' "
Joshua,3,5,And Joshua said unto the people: 'Sanctify yourselves; for to-morrow HaShem will do wonders among you.' 
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying: 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people.' And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. "
Joshua,3,7,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. "
Joshua,3,8,"And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying: When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.' "
Joshua,3,9,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel: 'Come hither, and hear the words of HaShem your G-d.' "
Joshua,3,10,"And Joshua said: 'Hereby ye shall know that the living G-d is among you, and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite. "
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the L-rd of all the earth passeth on before you over the Jordan. "
Joshua,3,12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man. "
Joshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of HaShem, the L-rd of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.' "
Joshua,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bore the ark of the covenant being before the people; "
Joshua,3,15,"and when they that bore the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water--for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest-- "
Joshua,3,16,"that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over right against Jericho. "
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan. "
Joshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that HaShem spoke unto Joshua, saying: "
Joshua,4,2,"'Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, "
Joshua,4,3,"and command ye them, saying: Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood, twelve stones made ready, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.' "
Joshua,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man; "
Joshua,4,5,"and Joshua said unto them: 'Pass on before the ark of HaShem your G-d into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; "
Joshua,4,6,"that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying: What mean ye by these stones? "
Joshua,4,7,"then ye shall say unto them: Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of HaShem; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.' "
Joshua,4,8,"And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as HaShem spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. "
Joshua,4,9,"Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there unto this day. "
Joshua,4,10,"And the priests that bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that HaShem commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over. "
Joshua,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of HaShem passed on, and the priests, before the people. "
Joshua,4,12,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed on armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke unto them; "
Joshua,4,13,"about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of HaShem unto battle, to the plains of Jericho. "
Joshua,4,14,"On that day HaShem magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. "
Joshua,4,15,"And HaShem spoke unto Joshua, saying: "
Joshua,4,16,"'Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.' "
Joshua,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying: 'Come ye up out of the Jordan.' "
Joshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, as the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem came up out of the midst of the Jordan, as soon as the soles of the priests' feet were drawn up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime. "
Joshua,4,19,"And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho. "
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal. "
Joshua,4,21,"And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying: 'When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying: What mean these stones? "
Joshua,4,22,"then ye shall let your children know, saying: Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. "
Joshua,4,23,"For HaShem your G-d dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as HaShem your G-d did to the Red Sea, which He dried up from before us, until we were passed over, "
Joshua,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of HaShem, that it is mighty; that ye may fear HaShem your G-d for ever.' "
Joshua,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that HaShem had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. "
Joshua,5,2,"At that time HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.' "
Joshua,5,3,"And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at Gibeath-ha-araloth."
Joshua,5,4,"And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt. "
Joshua,5,5,"For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. "
Joshua,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of HaShem; unto whom HaShem swore that He would not let them see the land which HaShem swore unto their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. "
Joshua,5,7,"And He raised up their children in their stead; them did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way. "
Joshua,5,8,"And it came to pass, when all the nation were circumcised, every one of them, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. "
Joshua,5,9,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.' Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day. "
Joshua,5,10,And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 
Joshua,5,11,"And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day. "
Joshua,5,12,"And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. "
Joshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him: 'Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?' "
Joshua,5,14,"And he said: 'Nay, but I am captain of the host of HaShem; I am now come.' And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto him: 'What saith my lord unto his servant?' "
Joshua,5,15,And the captain of HaShem'S host said unto Joshua: 'Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.' And Joshua did so.  
Joshua,6,1,"Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.-- "
Joshua,6,2,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, even the mighty men of valour. "
Joshua,6,3,"And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. "
Joshua,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear seven rams' horns before the ark; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the horns. "
Joshua,6,5,"And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the horn, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.' "
Joshua,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them: 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven rams' horns before the ark of HaShem.' "
Joshua,6,7,"And he said unto the people: 'Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed body pass on before the ark of HaShem.' "
Joshua,6,8,"And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven rams' horns before HaShem passed on, and blew with the horns; and the ark of the covenant of HaShem followed them. "
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew the horns, and the rearward went after the ark, the priests blowing with the horns continually. "
Joshua,6,10,"And Joshua commanded the people, saying: 'Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.' "
Joshua,6,11,"So he caused the ark of HaShem to compass the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. "
Joshua,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of HaShem. "
Joshua,6,13,"And the seven priests bearing the seven rams' horns before the ark of HaShem went on continually, and blew with the horns; and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of HaShem, the priests blowing with the horns continually. "
Joshua,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp; so they did six days. "
Joshua,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times. "
Joshua,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the horns, that Joshua said unto the people: 'Shout; for HaShem hath given you the city. "
Joshua,6,17,"And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to HaShem; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. "
Joshua,6,18,"And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed by taking of the devoted thing, so should ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it. "
Joshua,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto HaShem; they shall come into the treasury of HaShem.' "
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted, and the priests blew with the horns. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. "
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. "
Joshua,6,22,"And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land: 'Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore unto her.' "
Joshua,6,23,"And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel. "
Joshua,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of HaShem. "
Joshua,6,25,"But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day; because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. "
Joshua,6,26,"And Joshua charged the people with an oath at that time, saying: 'Cursed be the man before HaShem, that riseth up and buildeth this city, even Jericho; with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.' "
Joshua,6,27,So HaShem was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land. 
Joshua,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass concerning the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing; and the anger of HaShem was kindled against the children of Israel. "
Joshua,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke unto them, saying: 'Go up and spy out the land.' And the men went up and spied out Ai. "
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him: 'Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.' "
Joshua,7,4,So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of Ai. 
Joshua,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. "
Joshua,7,6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of HaShem until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads. "
Joshua,7,7,"And Joshua said: 'Alas, O L-rd GOD, wherefore hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan! "
Joshua,7,8,"Oh, L-rd, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies! "
Joshua,7,9,"For when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear of it, they will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt Thou do for Thy great name?' "
Joshua,7,10,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Get thee up; wherefore, now, art thou fallen upon thy face? "
Joshua,7,11,"Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff. "
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. "
Joshua,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: There is a curse in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. "
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall draw near by your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which HaShem taketh shall come near by families; and the family which HaShem shall take shall come near by households; and the household which HaShem shall take shall come near man by man. "
Joshua,7,15,"And it shall be that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of HaShem, and because he hath wrought a wanton deed in Israel.' "
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken. "
Joshua,7,17,And he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites. And he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken. 
Joshua,7,18,"And he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. "
Joshua,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan: 'My son, give, I pray thee, glory to HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide nothing from me.' "
Joshua,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said: 'Of a truth I have sinned against HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. "
Joshua,7,21,"When I saw among the spoil a goodly Shinar mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.' "
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. "
Joshua,7,23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before HaShem. "
Joshua,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor. "
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua said: 'Why hast thou troubled us? HaShem shall trouble thee this day.' And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones. "
Joshua,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and HaShem turned from the fierceness of His anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called The valley of Achor, unto this day.  "
Joshua,8,1,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Fear not, neither be thou dismayed; take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land. "
Joshua,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king; only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves; set thee an ambush for the city behind it.' "
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night. "
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying: 'Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready. "
Joshua,8,5,"And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them. "
Joshua,8,6,"And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say: They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them. "
Joshua,8,7,"And ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for HaShem your G-d will deliver it into your hand. "
Joshua,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of HaShem shall ye do; see, I have commanded you.' "
Joshua,8,9,"And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people. "
Joshua,8,10,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. "
Joshua,8,11,"And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai--now there was a valley between him and Ai. "
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai. "
Joshua,8,13,"So the people set themselves in array, even all the host that was on the north of the city, their rear lying in wait on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale. "
Joshua,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hastened and rose up early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, in front of the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city. "
Joshua,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. "
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. "
Joshua,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. "
Joshua,8,18,And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand.' And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. 
Joshua,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and set the city on fire. "
Joshua,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. "
Joshua,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back, and slew the men of Ai. "
Joshua,8,22,"And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. "
Joshua,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. "
Joshua,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. "
Joshua,8,25,"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. "
Joshua,8,26,"For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. "
Joshua,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of HaShem which He commanded Joshua. "
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day. "
Joshua,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day. "
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel, in mount Ebal, "
Joshua,8,31,"as Moses the servant of HaShem commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron; and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto HaShem, and sacrificed peace-offerings. "
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote before the children of Israel. "
Joshua,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem, as well the stranger as the home-born; half of them in front of mount Gerizim and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of HaShem had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel. "
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. "
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them. "
Joshua,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and on all the shore of the Great Sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof, "
Joshua,9,2,"that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. "
Joshua,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, "
Joshua,9,4,"they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine skins, worn and rent and patched up; "
Joshua,9,5,"and worn shoes and clouted upon their feet, and worn garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become crumbs. "
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel: 'We are come from a far country; now therefore make ye a covenant with us.' "
Joshua,9,7,And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites: 'Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?' 
Joshua,9,8,And they said unto Joshua: 'We are thy servants.' And Joshua said unto them: 'Who are ye? and from whence come ye?' 
Joshua,9,9,"And they said unto him: 'From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of HaShem thy G-d; for we have heard the fame of Him, and all that He did in Egypt, "
Joshua,9,10,"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. "
Joshua,9,11,"And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying: Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them: We are your servants; and now make ye a covenant with us. "
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become crumbs. "
Joshua,9,13,"And these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent. And these our garments and our shoes are worn by reason of the very long journey.' "
Joshua,9,14,"And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of HaShem. "
Joshua,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the princes of the congregation swore unto them. "
Joshua,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. "
Joshua,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. "
Joshua,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by HaShem, the G-d of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. "
Joshua,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation: 'We have sworn unto them by HaShem, the G-d of Israel; now therefore we may not touch them. "
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.' "
Joshua,9,21,"And the princes said concerning them: 'Let them live'; so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken concerning them. "
Joshua,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying: 'Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying: We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us? "
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my G-d.' "
Joshua,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said: 'Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that HaShem thy G-d commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. "
Joshua,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.' "
Joshua,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. "
Joshua,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of HaShem, unto this day, in the place which He should choose. "
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; "
Joshua,10,2,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. "
Joshua,10,3,"Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying: "
Joshua,10,4,"'Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.' "
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it. "
Joshua,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying: 'Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.' "
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. "
Joshua,10,8,And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand against thee.' 
Joshua,10,9,Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night. 
Joshua,10,10,"And HaShem discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. "
Joshua,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that HaShem cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. "
Joshua,10,12,"Then spoke Joshua to HaShem in the day when HaShem delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel: 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.' "
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. "
Joshua,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that HaShem hearkened unto the voice of a man; for HaShem fought for Israel. "
Joshua,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. "
Joshua,10,16,"And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. "
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying: 'The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.' "
Joshua,10,18,"And Joshua said: 'Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them; "
Joshua,10,19,"but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for HaShem your G-d hath delivered them into your hand.' "
Joshua,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, "
Joshua,10,21,that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; none whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 
Joshua,10,22,"Then said Joshua: 'Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.' "
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon. "
Joshua,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him: 'Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.' And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. "
Joshua,10,25,"And Joshua said unto them: 'Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus shall HaShem do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.' "
Joshua,10,26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. "
Joshua,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day. "
Joshua,10,28,"And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof; he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho. "
Joshua,10,29,"And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah. "
Joshua,10,30,"And HaShem delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho. "
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it. "
Joshua,10,32,"And HaShem delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. "
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. "
Joshua,10,34,"And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it. "
Joshua,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. "
Joshua,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it. "
Joshua,10,37,"And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein. "
Joshua,10,38,"And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it. "
Joshua,10,39,"And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof. "
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the Lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining; but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as HaShem, the G-d of Israel, commanded. "
Joshua,10,41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. "
Joshua,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because HaShem, the G-d of Israel, fought for Israel. "
Joshua,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. "
Joshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, "
Joshua,11,2,"and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the Lowland, and in the regions of Dor on the west, "
Joshua,11,3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. "
Joshua,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. "
Joshua,11,5,"And all these kings met together, and they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel. "
Joshua,11,6,"And HaShem said unto Joshua: 'Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.' "
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them. "
Joshua,11,8,"And HaShem delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. "
Joshua,11,9,"And Joshua did unto them as HaShem bade him; he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. "
Joshua,11,10,"And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. "
Joshua,11,11,"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed; and he burnt Hazor with fire. "
Joshua,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of HaShem commanded. "
Joshua,11,13,"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only--that did Joshua burn. "
Joshua,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed. "
Joshua,11,15,"As HaShem commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua; and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that HaShem commanded Moses. "
Joshua,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the Lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the Lowland of the same; "
Joshua,11,17,"from the bare mountain, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon; and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death. "
Joshua,11,18,Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
Joshua,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in battle. "
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of HaShem to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as HaShem commanded Moses. "
Joshua,11,21,"And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. "
Joshua,11,22,"There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. "
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that HaShem spoke unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war. "
Joshua,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: "
Joshua,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon; "
Joshua,12,3,"and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah; "
Joshua,12,4,"and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, "
Joshua,12,5,"and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, even unto the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. "
Joshua,12,6,"Moses the servant of HaShem and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses the servant of HaShem gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. "
Joshua,12,7,"And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the bare mountain, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; "
Joshua,12,8,"in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: "
Joshua,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one; "
Joshua,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; "
Joshua,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; "
Joshua,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; "
Joshua,12,13,"the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; "
Joshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; "
Joshua,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; "
Joshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one; "
Joshua,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; "
Joshua,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one; the king of the Sharon, one; "
Joshua,12,19,"the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; "
Joshua,12,20,"the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; "
Joshua,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; "
Joshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; "
Joshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in the region of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in the Gilgal, one; "
Joshua,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one. All the kings thirty and one. "
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and HaShem said unto him: 'Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. "
Joshua,13,2,"This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; "
Joshua,13,3,"from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward--which is counted to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the Avvim "
Joshua,13,4,"on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Zidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; "
Joshua,13,5,"and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath; "
Joshua,13,6,"all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Zidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel; only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. "
Joshua,13,7,"Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.' "
Joshua,13,8,"With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of HaShem gave them; "
Joshua,13,9,"from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the table-land from Medeba unto Dibon; "
Joshua,13,10,"and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; "
Joshua,13,11,"and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; "
Joshua,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei--the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim-- for these did Moses smite, and drove them out. "
Joshua,13,13,"Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites; but Geshur and Maacath dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day. "
Joshua,13,14,"Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as He spoke unto him. "
Joshua,13,15,And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families. 
Joshua,13,16,"And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the table-land by Medeba; "
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the table-land; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon; "
Joshua,13,18,"and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath; "
Joshua,13,19,"and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zerethshahar in the mount of the valley; "
Joshua,13,20,"and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth; "
Joshua,13,21,"and all the cities of the table-land, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land. "
Joshua,13,22,"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain. "
Joshua,13,23,"And as for the border of the children of Reuben, the Jordan was their border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof. "
Joshua,13,24,"And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families. "
Joshua,13,25,"And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah; "
Joshua,13,26,"and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Lidbir; "
Joshua,13,27,"and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan being the border thereof, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. "
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof. "
Joshua,13,29,And Moses gave inheritance unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families. 
Joshua,13,30,"And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities; "
Joshua,13,31,"and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families. "
Joshua,13,32,"These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward. "
Joshua,13,33,"But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; HaShem, the G-d of Israel, is their inheritance, as He spoke unto them. "
Joshua,14,1,"And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them, "
Joshua,14,2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as HaShem commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.-- "
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
Joshua,14,4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the open land about them for their cattle and for their substance.-- "
Joshua,14,5,"As HaShem commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. "
Joshua,14,6,Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him: 'Thou knowest the thing that HaShem spoke unto Moses the man of G-d concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea. 
Joshua,14,7,Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of HaShem sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him back word as it was in my heart. 
Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed HaShem my G-d. 
Joshua,14,9,"And Moses swore on that day, saying: Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed HaShem my G-d. "
Joshua,14,10,"And now, behold, HaShem hath kept me alive, as He spoke, these forty and five years, from the time that HaShem spoke this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness; and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. "
Joshua,14,11,"As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me; as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in. "
Joshua,14,12,"Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof HaShem spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified; it may be that HaShem will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as HaShem spoke.' "
Joshua,14,13,And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
Joshua,14,14,"Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day; because that he wholly followed HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
Joshua,14,15,"Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.  "
Joshua,15,1,"And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south. "
Joshua,15,2,"And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked southward. "
Joshua,15,3,"And it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka. "
Joshua,15,4,"And it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the Brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea; this shall be your south border. "
Joshua,15,5,"And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. "
Joshua,15,6,"And the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. "
Joshua,15,7,"And the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the brook; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel. "
Joshua,15,8,"And the border went up by the Valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward--the same is Jerusalem--and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward. "
Joshua,15,9,"And the border was drawn from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah--the same is Kiriath-jearim. "
Joshua,15,10,"And the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north--the same is Chesalon--and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah. "
Joshua,15,11,"And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. "
Joshua,15,12,"And as for the west border, the Great Sea was the border thereof. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families. "
Joshua,15,13,"And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of HaShem to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak--the same is Hebron. "
Joshua,15,14,"And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. "
Joshua,15,15,And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir--now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. 
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said: 'He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.' "
Joshua,15,17,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. "
Joshua,15,18,"And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her: 'What wouldest thou?' "
Joshua,15,19,"And she said: 'Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the Southland, give me therefore springs of water.' And he gave her the Upper Springs and the Nether Springs. "
Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. 
Joshua,15,21,"And the cities at the uttermost part of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur; "

Joshua,15,63,"And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem, unto this day.  "
Joshua,16,1,"And the lot for the children of Joseph went out from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to the wilderness, even to Beth-el. "
Joshua,16,2,"And it went out from Beth-el-luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth. "
Joshua,16,3,"And it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. "
Joshua,16,4,"And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. "
Joshua,16,5,"And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus; even the border of their inheritance eastward was Atroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper. "
Joshua,16,6,"And the border went out westward, Mich-methath being on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah. "
Joshua,16,7,"And it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan. "
Joshua,16,8,From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families; 
Joshua,16,9,"together with the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. "
Joshua,16,10,"And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim, unto this day, and became servants to do taskwork. "
Joshua,17,1,"And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. "
Joshua,17,2,"And the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. "
Joshua,17,3,"But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. "
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying: 'The HaShem commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren'; therefore according to the commandment of HaShem he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. "
Joshua,17,5,"And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; "
Joshua,17,6,because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons; and the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 
Joshua,17,7,"And the border of Manasseh was, beginning from Asher, Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.-- "
Joshua,17,8,The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.-- 
Joshua,17,9,"And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook, by cities which belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh; but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and the goings out thereof were at the sea: "
Joshua,17,10,"southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east. "
Joshua,17,11,"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three regions. "
Joshua,17,12,Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites were resolved to dwell in that land. 
Joshua,17,13,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, but did not utterly drive them out. "
Joshua,17,14,"And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying: 'Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as HaShem hath blessed me thus?' "
Joshua,17,15,"And Joshua said unto them: 'If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.' "
Joshua,17,16,"And the children of Joseph said: 'The hill-country will not be enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.' "
Joshua,17,17,"And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying: 'Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only; "
Joshua,17,18,"but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they be strong.' "
Joshua,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. "
Joshua,18,2,"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. "
Joshua,18,3,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel: 'How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, hath given you? "
Joshua,18,4,"Appoint for you three men for each tribe; and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me. "
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north. "
Joshua,18,6,"And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring the description hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before HaShem our G-d. "
Joshua,18,7,"For the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of HaShem is their inheritance; and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of HaShem gave them.' "
Joshua,18,8,"And the men arose, and went; and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying: 'Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and I will cast lots for you here before HaShem in Shiloh.' "
Joshua,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book, and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh. "
Joshua,18,10,And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before HaShem; and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. 
Joshua,18,11,And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
Joshua,18,12,"And their border on the north side was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. "
Joshua,18,13,"And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz--the same is Beth-el--southward; and the border went down to Atroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether. "
Joshua,18,14,"And the border was drawn and turned about on the west side southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal--the same is Kiriath-jearim--a city of the children of Judah; this was the west side. "
Joshua,18,15,"And the south side was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah. "
Joshua,18,16,"And the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. "
Joshua,18,17,"And it was drawn on the north, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. "
Joshua,18,18,"And it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah. "
Joshua,18,19,"And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan; this was the south border. "
Joshua,18,20,"And the Jordan was to be the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families. "
Joshua,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz; "
Joshua,18,22,"and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el; "
Joshua,18,23,"and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah; "

Joshua,18,28,"and Zela, Eleph, and the Jebusite--the same is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. "
Joshua,19,1,"And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah. "
Joshua,19,2,"And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba with Sheba, and Moladah; "

Joshua,19,7,"Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages; "
Joshua,19,8,"and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, as far as Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. "
Joshua,19,9,"Out of the allotment of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them; therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance. "
Joshua,19,10,And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid. 
Joshua,19,11,"And their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam. "
Joshua,19,12,"And it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Dobrath, and went up to Japhia. "
Joshua,19,13,"And from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon-methoar unto Neah. "
Joshua,19,14,And the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtahel;

Joshua,19,23,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages. "

Joshua,19,34,"And the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising. "

Joshua,19,46,"and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa. "
Joshua,19,47,"And the border of the children of Dan was too strait for them; so the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. "
Joshua,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. "
Joshua,19,49,"When they had made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them; "
Joshua,19,50,"according to the commandment of HaShem they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein. "
Joshua,19,51,"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before HaShem, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land. "
Joshua,20,1,"And HaShem spoke unto Joshua, saying: "
Joshua,20,2,"'Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spoke unto you by the hand of Moses; "
Joshua,20,3,that the manslayer that killeth any person through error and unawares may flee thither; and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. 
Joshua,20,4,"And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. "
Joshua,20,5,"And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unawares, and hated him not beforetime. "
Joshua,20,6,"And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days; then may the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.' "
Joshua,20,7,"And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba--the same is Hebron--in the hill-country of Judah. "
Joshua,20,8,"And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the table-land out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. "
Joshua,20,9,"These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person through error might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation. "
Joshua,21,1,"Then came near the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel; "
Joshua,21,2,"and they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying: 'The HaShem commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the open land thereabout for our cattle.' "
Joshua,21,3,"And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of HaShem, these cities with the open land about them. "
Joshua,21,4,"And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites; and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. "
Joshua,21,5,"And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. "
Joshua,21,6,"And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities. "
Joshua,21,7,"The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. "
Joshua,21,8,"And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with the open land about them, as HaShem commanded by the hand of Moses. "
Joshua,21,9,"And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name. "
Joshua,21,10,"And they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot. "
Joshua,21,11,"And they gave them Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak--the same is Hebron--in the hill-country of Judah, with the open land round about it. "
Joshua,21,12,"But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. "
Joshua,21,13,"And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with the open land about it; "

Joshua,21,18,"Anathoth with the open land about it, and Almon with the open land about it; four cities. "
Joshua,21,19,"All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with the open land about them. "
Joshua,21,20,"And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. "
Joshua,21,21,"And they gave them Shechem with the open land about it in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,22,"and Kibzaim with the open land about it, and Beth-horon with the open land about it; four cities. "
Joshua,21,23,"And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with the open land about it, Gibbethon with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,24,"Aijalon with the open land about it, Gath-rimmon with the open land about it; four cities. "

Joshua,21,26,All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with the open land about them. 
Joshua,21,27,"And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer; and Beeshterah with the open land about it; two cities. "
Joshua,21,28,"And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with the open land about it, Dobrath with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,29,"Jarmuth with the open land about it, En-gannim with the open land about it; four cities. "

Joshua,21,31,"Helkath with the open land about it, and Rehob with the open land about it; four cities. "
Joshua,21,32,"And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with the open land about it, and Kartan with the open land about it; three cities. "
Joshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with the open land about them. 
Joshua,21,34,"And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with the open land about it, and Kartah with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,35,"Dimnah with the open land about it, Nahalal with the open land about it; four cities. "
Joshua,21,36,"And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with the open land about it, and Jahaz with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,37,"Kedemoth with the open land about it, and Mephaath with the open land about it; four cities. "
Joshua,21,38,"And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with the open land about it; "
Joshua,21,39,"Heshbon with the open land about it, Jazer with the open land about it; four cities in all. "
Joshua,21,40,"All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities. "
Joshua,21,41,"All the cities of the Levites--forty and eight cities with the open land about them--shall be in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, "
Joshua,21,42,"even these cities, every one with the open land round about it; thus it shall be with all these cities. "
Joshua,21,43,"So HaShem gave unto Israel all the land which He swore to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. "
Joshua,21,44,"And HaShem gave them rest round about, according to all that He swore unto their fathers; and there stood not a man of all their enemies against them; HaShem delivered all their enemies into their hand. "
Joshua,21,45,There failed not aught of any good thing which HaShem had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.  
Joshua,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, "
Joshua,22,2,"and said unto them: 'Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of HaShem commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you; "
Joshua,22,3,"ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of HaShem your G-d. "
Joshua,22,4,"And now HaShem your G-d hath given rest unto your brethren, as He spoke unto them; therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of HaShem gave you beyond the Jordan. "
Joshua,22,5,"Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of HaShem commanded you, to love HaShem your G-d, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and to cleave unto Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.' "
Joshua,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents. "
Joshua,22,7,"Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them, "
Joshua,22,8,"and spoke unto them, saying: 'Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.' "
Joshua,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of HaShem by the hand of Moses. "
Joshua,22,10,"And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon. "
Joshua,22,11,"And the children of Israel heard say: 'Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.' "
Joshua,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. "
Joshua,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest; "
Joshua,22,14,"and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel. "
Joshua,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying: "
Joshua,22,16,"'Thus saith the whole congregation of HaShem: What treachery is this that ye have committed against the G-d of Israel, to turn away this day from following HaShem, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against HaShem? "
Joshua,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of HaShem, "
Joshua,22,18,"that ye must turn away this day from following HaShem? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against HaShem, that to-morrow He will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. "
Joshua,22,19,"Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of HaShem, wherein HaShem'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us; but rebel not against HaShem, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of HaShem our G-d. "
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass concerning the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.' "
Joshua,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke unto the heads of the thousands of Israel: "
Joshua,22,22,"'G-d, G-d, HaShem, G-d, G-d, HaShem, He knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in treachery against HaShem--save Thou us not this day-- "
Joshua,22,23,"that we have built us an altar to turn away from following HaShem; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let HaShem Himself require it; "
Joshua,22,24,"and if we have not rather out of anxiety about a matter done this, saying: In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying: What have ye to do with HaShem, the G-d of Israel? "
Joshua,22,25,"for HaShem hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in HaShem; so might your children make our children cease from fearing HaShem. "
Joshua,22,26,"Therefore we said: Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; "
Joshua,22,27,"but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of HaShem before Him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come: Ye have no portion in HaShem. "
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore said we: It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say: Behold the pattern of the altar of HaShem, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. "
Joshua,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against HaShem, and turn away this day from following HaShem, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of HaShem our G-d that is before His tabernacle.' "
Joshua,22,30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well. "
Joshua,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh: 'This day we know that HaShem is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this treachery against HaShem; now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of HaShem.' "
Joshua,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them back word. "
Joshua,22,33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed G-d, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt. "
Joshua,22,34,And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar--: 'for it is a witness between us that HaShem is G-d.' 
Joshua,23,1,"And it came to pass after many days, when HaShem had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years; "
Joshua,23,2,"that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them: 'I am old and well stricken in years. "
Joshua,23,3,"And ye have seen all that HaShem your G-d hath done unto all these nations because of you; for HaShem your G-d, He it is that hath fought for you. "
Joshua,23,4,"Behold, I have allotted unto you for an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun. "
Joshua,23,5,"And HaShem your G-d, He shall thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as HaShem your G-d spoke unto you. "
Joshua,23,6,"Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; "
Joshua,23,7,"that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor worship them; "
Joshua,23,8,"but cleave unto HaShem your G-d, as ye have done unto this day; "
Joshua,23,9,"wherefore HaShem hath driven out from before you great nations and mighty; but as for you, no man hath stood against you unto this day. "
Joshua,23,10,"One man of you hath chased a thousand; for HaShem your G-d, He it is that fought for you, as He spoke unto you. "
Joshua,23,11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love HaShem your G-d. "
Joshua,23,12,"Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you; "
Joshua,23,13,"know for a certainty that HaShem your G-d will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and pricks in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which HaShem your G-d hath given you. "
Joshua,23,14,"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; consider ye therefore in all your heart and in all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which HaShem your G-d spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof. "
Joshua,23,15,"And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which HaShem your G-d spoke unto you, so shall HaShem bring upon you all the evil things, until He have destroyed you from off this good land which HaShem your G-d hath given you. "
Joshua,23,16,"When ye transgress the covenant of HaShem your G-d, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them; then shall the anger of HaShem be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which He hath given unto you.' "
Joshua,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before G-d. "
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua said unto all the people: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods. "
Joshua,24,3,"And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. "
Joshua,24,4,"And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. "
Joshua,24,5,"And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof; and afterward I brought you out. "
Joshua,24,6,And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea. 
Joshua,24,7,"And when they cried out unto HaShem, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days. "
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan; and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you. "
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. "
Joshua,24,10,But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he even blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand. 
Joshua,24,11,"And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. "
Joshua,24,12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. "
Joshua,24,13,"And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not laboured, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat. "
Joshua,24,14,"Now therefore fear HaShem, and serve Him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye HaShem. "
Joshua,24,15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve HaShem, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve HaShem.' "
Joshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said: 'Far be it from us that we should forsake HaShem, to serve other gods; "
Joshua,24,17,"for HaShem our G-d, He it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed; "
Joshua,24,18,"and HaShem drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land; therefore we also will serve HaShem; for He is our G-d.' "
Joshua,24,19,And Joshua said unto the people: 'Ye cannot serve HaShem; for He is a holy G-d; He is a jealous G-d; He will not forgive your transgression nor your sins. 
Joshua,24,20,"If ye forsake HaShem, and serve strange gods, then He will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that He hath done you good.' "
Joshua,24,21,And the people said unto Joshua: 'Nay; but we will serve HaShem.' 
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua said unto the people: 'Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you HaShem, to serve Him. --And they said: 'We are witnesses.'-- "
Joshua,24,23,"Now therefore put away the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel.' "
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said unto Joshua: 'The HaShem our G-d will we serve, and unto His voice will we hearken.' "
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. "
Joshua,24,26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of G-d; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of HaShem. "
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua said unto all the people: 'Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of HaShem which He spoke unto us; it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your G-d.' "
Joshua,24,28,"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance. "
Joshua,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of HaShem, died, being a hundred and ten years old. "
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. "
Joshua,24,31,"And Israel served HaShem all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of HaShem, that He had wrought for Israel. "
Joshua,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. "
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the Hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.  "
Judges,1,1,"AND IT came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked HaShem, saying: 'Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?' "
Judges,1,2,"And HaShem said: 'Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.' "
Judges,1,3,"And Judah said unto Simeon his brother: 'Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot.' So Simeon went with him. "
Judges,1,4,And Judah went up; and HaShem delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 
Judges,1,5,"And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. "
Judges,1,6,"But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. "
Judges,1,7,"And Adoni-bezek said: 'Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my table; as I have done, so G-d hath requited me.' And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. "
Judges,1,8,"And the children of Judah fought Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. "
Judges,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the Lowland. "
Judges,1,10,"And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron--now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba--and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. "
Judges,1,11,And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir--now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. 
Judges,1,12,"And Caleb said: 'He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.' "
Judges,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. "
Judges,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her: 'What wouldest thou?' "
Judges,1,15,"And she said unto him: 'Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the Southland, give me therefore springs of water.' And Caleb gave her the Upper Springs and the Nether Springs. "
Judges,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. "
Judges,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. "
Judges,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof. "
Judges,1,19,"And HaShem was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. "
Judges,1,20,"And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak. "
Judges,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem, unto this day. "
Judges,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and HaShem was with them. "
Judges,1,23,And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el--now the name of the city beforetime was Luz. 
Judges,1,24,"And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him: 'Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.' "
Judges,1,25,"And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. "
Judges,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day. "
Judges,1,27,"And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites were resolved to dwell in that land. "
Judges,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to task-work, but did in no wise drive them out. "
Judges,1,29,And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. 
Judges,1,30,"Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the: inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributary. "
Judges,1,31,"Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; "
Judges,1,32,"but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out. "
Judges,1,33,"Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them. "
Judges,1,34,And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley. 
Judges,1,35,"But the Amorites were resolved to dwell in Harheres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary. "
Judges,1,36,"And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward. "
Judges,2,1,"And the angel of HaShem came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said: '...I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said: I will never break My covenant with you; "
Judges,2,2,and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars; but ye have not hearkened unto My voice; what is this ye have done? 
Judges,2,3,"Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be unto you as snares, and their gods shall be a trap unto you.' "
Judges,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of HaShem spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. "
Judges,2,5,And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto HaShem. 
Judges,2,6,"Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. "
Judges,2,7,"And the people served HaShem all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of HaShem, that He had wrought for Israel. "
Judges,2,8,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of HaShem, died, being a hundred and ten years old. "
Judges,2,9,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. "
Judges,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, that knew not HaShem, nor yet the work which He had wrought for Israel. "
Judges,2,11,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and served the Baalim. "
Judges,2,12,"And they forsook HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and worshipped them; and they provoked HaShem. "
Judges,2,13,"And they forsook HaShem, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. "
Judges,2,14,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and He gave them over into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. "
Judges,2,15,"Whithersoever they went out, the hand of HaShem was against them for evil, as HaShem had spoken, and as HaShem had sworn unto them; and they were sore distressed. "
Judges,2,16,"And HaShem raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. "
Judges,2,17,"And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went astray after other gods, and worshipped them; they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of HaShem; they did not so. "
Judges,2,18,"And when HaShem raised them up judges, then HaShem was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented HaShem because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them. "
Judges,2,19,"But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to worship them; they left nothing undone of their practices, nor of their stubborn way. "
Judges,2,20,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel; and He said: 'Because this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto My voice; "
Judges,2,21,I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died; 
Judges,2,22,"that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of HaShem to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.' "
Judges,2,23,"So HaShem left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered He them into the hand of Joshua.  "
Judges,3,1,"Now these are the nations which HaShem left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; "
Judges,3,2,"only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof; "
Judges,3,3,"namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath. "
Judges,3,4,"And they were there, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of HaShem, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. "
Judges,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites; "
Judges,3,6,"and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. "
Judges,3,7,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and forgot HaShem their G-d, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. "
Judges,3,8,"Therefore the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim; and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. "
Judges,3,9,"And when the children of Israel cried unto HaShem, HaShem raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. "
Judges,3,10,"And the spirit of HaShem came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and HaShem delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim. "
Judges,3,11,And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
Judges,3,12,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; and HaShem strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of HaShem. "
Judges,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees. "
Judges,3,14,And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 
Judges,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried unto HaShem, HaShem raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed; and the children of Israel sent a present by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. "
Judges,3,16,"And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. "
Judges,3,17,And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab--now Eglon was a very fat man. 
Judges,3,18,"And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bore the present. "
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said: 'I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.' And he said: 'Keep silence.' And all that stood by him went out from him. "
Judges,3,20,And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said: 'I have a message from G-d unto thee.' And he arose out of his seat. 
Judges,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. "
Judges,3,22,"And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and it came out behind. "
Judges,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and locked them. "
Judges,3,24,"Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they, said: 'Surely he is covering his feet in the cabinet of the cool chamber.' "
Judges,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; therefore they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. "
Judges,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they lingered, having passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. "
Judges,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a horn in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. "
Judges,3,28,"And he said unto them: 'Follow after me; for HaShem hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.' And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. "
Judges,3,29,"And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not a man. "
Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. 
Judges,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also saved Israel. "
Judges,4,1,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, when Ehud was dead. "
Judges,4,2,"And HaShem gave them over into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-goiim. "
Judges,4,3,And the children of Israel cried unto HaShem; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. 
Judges,4,4,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. "
Judges,4,5,And she sat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
Judges,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him: 'Hath not HaShem, the G-d of Israel, commanded, saying: Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? "
Judges,4,7,"And I will draw unto thee to the brook Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand. "
Judges,4,8,"And Barak said unto her: 'If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.' "
Judges,4,9,"And she said: 'I will surely go with thee; notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for HaShem will give Sisera over into the hand of a woman.' And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. "
Judges,4,10,And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him. 
Judges,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh. "
Judges,4,12,And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 
Judges,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, unto the brook Kishon. "
Judges,4,14,"And Deborah said unto Barak: 'Up; for this is the day in which HaShem hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not HaShem gone out before thee?' So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. "
Judges,4,15,"And HaShem discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. "
Judges,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth-goiim; and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left. "
Judges,4,17,Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
Judges,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: 'Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.' And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. "
Judges,4,19,"And he said unto her: 'Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.' And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. "
Judges,4,20,"And he said unto her: 'Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say: Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.' "
Judges,4,21,"Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. "
Judges,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: 'Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.' And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples. "
Judges,4,23,So G-d subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
Judges,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. "
Judges,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying: "
Judges,5,2,"When men let grow their hair in Israel, when the people offer themselves willingly, bless ye HaShem. "
Judges,5,3,"Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, unto HaShem will I sing; I will sing praise to HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
Judges,5,4,"HaShem, when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, when Thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped water. "
Judges,5,5,"The mountains quaked at the presence of HaShem, even yon Sinai at the presence of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
Judges,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways ceased, and the travellers walked through byways. "
Judges,5,7,"The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that thou didst arise, Deborah, that thou didst arise a mother in Israel. "
Judges,5,8,They chose new gods; then was war in the gates; was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 
Judges,5,9,"My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye HaShem. "
Judges,5,10,"Ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit on rich cloths, and ye that walk by the way, tell of it; "
Judges,5,11,"Louder than the voice of archers, by the watering-troughs! there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of HaShem, even the righteous acts of His rulers in Israel. Then the people of HaShem went down to the gates. "
Judges,5,12,"Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song; arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. "
Judges,5,13,Then made He a remnant to have dominion over the nobles and the people; HaShem made me have dominion over the mighty. 
Judges,5,14,"Out of Ephraim came they whose root is in Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff. "
Judges,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak; into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart. "
Judges,5,16,"Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. "
Judges,5,17,"Gilead abode beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why doth he sojourn by the ships? Asher dwelt at the shore of the sea, and abideth by its bays. "
Judges,5,18,"Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, and Naphtali, upon the high places of the field. "
Judges,5,19,"The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money. "
Judges,5,20,"They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. "
Judges,5,21,"The brook Kishon swept them away, that ancient brook, the brook Kishon. O my soul, tread them down with strength. "
Judges,5,22,"Then did the horsehoofs stamp by reason of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones. "
Judges,5,23,"'Curse ye Meroz', said the angel of HaShem, 'Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of HaShem, to the help of HaShem against the mighty.' "
Judges,5,24,"Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the Kenite, above women in the tent shall she be blessed. "
Judges,5,25,"Water he asked, milk she gave him; in a lordly bowl she brought him curd. "
Judges,5,26,"Her hand she put to the tent-pin, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head, yea, she pierced and struck through his temples. "
Judges,5,27,"At her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay; at her feet he sunk, he fell; where he sunk, there he fell down dead. "
Judges,5,28,"Through the window she looked forth, and peered, the mother of Sisera, through the lattice: 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots? "
Judges,5,29,"The wisest of her princesses answer her, yea, she returneth answer to herself: "
Judges,5,30,"'Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil? A damsel, two damsels to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, a spoil of dyed garments of embroidery, two dyed garments of broidery for the neck of every spoiler?' "
Judges,5,31,"So perish all Thine enemies, O HaShem; but they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years. "
Judges,6,1,And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; and HaShem delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 
Judges,6,2,"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds. "
Judges,6,3,"And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them; "
Judges,6,4,"and they encamped against them, and destroyed the produce of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. "
Judges,6,5,"For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it. "
Judges,6,6,And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto HaShem. 
Judges,6,7,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto HaShem because of Midian, "
Judges,6,8,"that HaShem sent a prophet unto the children of Israel; and he said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; "
Judges,6,9,"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. "
Judges,6,10,"And I said unto you: I am HaShem your G-d; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not hearkened unto My voice.' "
Judges,6,11,"And the angel of HaShem came, and sat under the terebinth which was in Ophrah, that belonged unto Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. "
Judges,6,12,"And the angel of HaShem appeared unto him, and said unto him: 'The HaShem is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.' "
Judges,6,13,"And Gideon said unto him: 'Oh, my lord, if HaShem be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all His wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying: Did not HaShem bring us up from Egypt? but now HaShem hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.' "
Judges,6,14,"And HaShem turned towards him, and said: 'Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian; have not I sent thee?' "
Judges,6,15,"And he said unto him: 'Oh, my lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.' "
Judges,6,16,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.' "
Judges,6,17,"And he said unto him: 'If now I have found favour in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me. "
Judges,6,18,"Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee.' And he said: 'I will tarry until thou come back.' "
Judges,6,19,"And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the terebinth, and presented it. "
Judges,6,20,"And the angel of G-d said unto him: 'Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.' And he did so. "
Judges,6,21,"Then the angel of HaShem put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of HaShem departed out of his sight. "
Judges,6,22,"And Gideon saw that he was the angel of HaShem; and Gideon said: 'Alas, O L-rd GOD! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of HaShem face to face.' "
Judges,6,23,And HaShem said unto him: 'Peace be unto thee; fear not; thou shalt not die.' 
Judges,6,24,"Then Gideon built an altar there unto HaShem, and called it 'Adonai-shalom'; unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
Judges,6,25,"And it came to pass the same night, that HaShem said unto him: 'Take thy father's bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; "
Judges,6,26,"and build an altar unto HaShem thy G-d upon the top of this stronghold, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.' "
Judges,6,27,"Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as HaShem had spoken unto him; and it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. "
Judges,6,28,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. "
Judges,6,29,"And they said one to another: 'Who hath done this thing?' And when they inquired and asked, they said: 'Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.' "
Judges,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash: 'Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.' "
Judges,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him: 'Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death before morning; if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.' "
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaal, saying: 'Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.' "
Judges,6,33,"Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. "
Judges,6,34,But the spirit of HaShem clothed Gideon; and he blew a horn; and Abiezer was gathered together after him. 
Judges,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him; and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. "
Judges,6,36,"And Gideon said unto G-d: 'If Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken, "
Judges,6,37,"behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken.' "
Judges,6,38,"And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. "
Judges,6,39,"And Gideon said unto G-d: 'Let not Thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray Thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.' "
Judges,6,40,"And G-d did so that night; for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.  "
Judges,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley. "
Judges,7,2,"And HaShem said unto Gideon: 'The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying: mine own hand hath saved me. "
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.' And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. "
Judges,7,4,"And HaShem said unto Gideon: 'The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.' "
Judges,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water; and HaShem said unto Gideon: 'Everyone that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.' "
Judges,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. "
Judges,7,7,"And HaShem said unto Gideon: 'By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.' "
Judges,7,8,"So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley. "
Judges,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that HaShem said unto him: 'Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand. "
Judges,7,10,"But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp. "
Judges,7,11,And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.' Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. 
Judges,7,12,"Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude. "
Judges,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his follow, and saying: 'Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.' "
Judges,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said: 'This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand G-d hath delivered Midian, and all the host.' "
Judges,7,15,"And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said: 'Arise; for HaShem hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.' "
Judges,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. "
Judges,7,17,"And he said unto them: 'Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. "
Judges,7,18,"When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For HaShem and for Gideon!' "
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. "
Judges,7,20,"And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: 'The sword for HaShem and for Gideon!' "
Judges,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled. "
Judges,7,22,"And they blew the three hundred horns, and HaShem set every man's sword a against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. "
Judges,7,23,"And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian. "
Judges,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: 'Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.' So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. "
Judges,7,25,"And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan. "
Judges,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him: 'Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?' And they did chide with him sharply. "
Judges,8,2,And he said unto them: 'What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
Judges,8,3,"G-d hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. "
Judges,8,4,"And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing. "
Judges,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Succoth: 'Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.' "
Judges,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said: 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine army?' "
Judges,8,7,"And Gideon said: 'Therefore when HaShem hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.' "
Judges,8,8,"And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. "
Judges,8,9,"And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: 'When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower.' "
Judges,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. "
Judges,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure. "
Judges,8,12,"And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. "
Judges,8,13,And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. 
Judges,8,14,"And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men. "
Judges,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: 'Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?' "
Judges,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. "
Judges,8,17,"And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. "
Judges,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: 'Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?' And they answered: 'As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.' "
Judges,8,19,"And he said: 'They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as HaShem liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.' "
Judges,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his first-born: 'Up, and slay them.' But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth. "
Judges,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: 'Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.' And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks. "
Judges,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: 'Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.' "
Judges,8,23,"And Gideon said unto them: 'I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; HaShem shall rule over you.' "
Judges,8,24,"And Gideon said unto them: 'I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.' --For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites. "
Judges,8,25,"And they answered: 'We will willingly give them.' And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil. "
Judges,8,26,"And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. "
Judges,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. "
Judges,8,28,"So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon. "
Judges,8,29,And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
Judges,8,30,And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives. 
Judges,8,31,"And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. "
Judges,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
Judges,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. "
Judges,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not HaShem their G-d, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side; "
Judges,8,35,"neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel. "
Judges,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying: "
Judges,9,2,"'Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem: Which is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.' "
Judges,9,3,And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said: 'He is our brother.' 
Judges,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him. "
Judges,9,5,"And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself. "
Judges,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all Beth-millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem. "
Judges,9,7,"And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them: 'Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that G-d may hearken unto you. "
Judges,9,8,The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree: Reign thou over us. 
Judges,9,9,"But the olive-tree said unto them: Should I leave my fatness, seeing that by me they honour G-d and man, and go to hold sway over the trees? "
Judges,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig-tree: Come thou, and reign over us. "
Judges,9,11,"But the fig-tree said unto them: Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruitage, and go to hold sway over the trees? "
Judges,9,12,"And the trees said unto the vine: Come thou, and reign over us. "
Judges,9,13,"And the vine said unto them: Should I leave my wine, which cheereth G-d and man, and go to hold sway over the trees? "
Judges,9,14,"Then said all the trees unto the bramble: Come thou, and reign over us. "
Judges,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees: If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. "
Judges,9,16,"Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands-- "
Judges,9,17,"for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian; "
Judges,9,18,"and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother-- "
Judges,9,19,"if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. "
Judges,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.' "
Judges,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. "
Judges,9,22,And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. 
Judges,9,23,And G-d sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech; 
Judges,9,24,"that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren. "
Judges,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them; and it was told Abimelech. "
Judges,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went on to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. "
Judges,9,27,"And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. "
Judges,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said: 'Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? "
Judges,9,29,"And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.' And he said to Abimelech: 'Increase thine army, and come out.' "
Judges,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. "
Judges,9,31,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech in Tormah, saying: 'Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they will incite the city against thee. "
Judges,9,32,"Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field. "
Judges,9,33,"And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt be able.' "
Judges,9,34,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. "
Judges,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment. "
Judges,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: 'Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.' And Zebul said unto him: 'Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.' "
Judges,9,37,"And Gaal spoke again and said: 'See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of Elon-meonenim.' "
Judges,9,38,"Then said Zebul unto him: 'Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst: Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.' "
Judges,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. "
Judges,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate. "
Judges,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. "
Judges,9,42,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and it was told Abimelech. "
Judges,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people were coming forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. "
Judges,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them. "
Judges,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein; and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. "
Judges,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of El-berith. "
Judges,9,47,And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
Judges,9,48,"And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder; and he said unto the people that were with him: 'What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.' "
Judges,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. "
Judges,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. "
Judges,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, even all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower. "
Judges,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went close unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. "
Judges,9,53,"And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull. "
Judges,9,54,"Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour-bearer, and said unto him: 'Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me: A woman slew him.' And his young man thrust him through, and he died. "
Judges,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. "
Judges,9,56,"Thus G-d requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren; "
Judges,9,57,and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did G-d requite upon their heads; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. 
Judges,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim. "
Judges,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. "
Judges,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years. "
Judges,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. "
Judges,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon. "
Judges,10,6,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook HaShem, and served Him not. "
Judges,10,7,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon. "
Judges,10,8,"And they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel that year; eighteen years oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. "
Judges,10,9,"And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was sore distressed. "
Judges,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried unto HaShem, saying: 'We have sinned against Thee, in that we have forsaken our G-d, and have served the Baalim.' "
Judges,10,11,"And HaShem said unto the children of Israel: 'Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? "
Judges,10,12,"The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto Me, and I saved you out of their hand. "
Judges,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken Me, and served other gods; wherefore I will save you no more. "
Judges,10,14,Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.' 
Judges,10,15,"And the children of Israel said unto HaShem: 'We have sinned; do Thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto Thee; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.' "
Judges,10,16,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served HaShem; and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. "
Judges,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah. "
Judges,10,18,"And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another: 'What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.'  "
Judges,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah. "
Judges,11,2,"And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him: 'Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of another woman.' "
Judges,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him. "
Judges,11,4,"And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. "
Judges,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob. "
Judges,11,6,"And they said unto Jephthah: 'Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.' "
Judges,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: 'Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?' "
Judges,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah: 'Therefore are we returned to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon, and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.' "
Judges,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: 'If ye bring me back home to fight with the children of Ammon, and HaShem deliver them before me, I will be your head.' "
Judges,11,10,And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah: 'The HaShem shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.' 
Judges,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before HaShem in Mizpah. "
Judges,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying: 'What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?' "
Judges,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah: 'Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan; now therefore restore those cities peaceably.' "
Judges,11,14,And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon; 
Judges,11,15,"and he said unto him: 'Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon. "
Judges,11,16,"But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; "
Judges,11,17,"then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh. "
Judges,11,18,"Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. "
Judges,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him: Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place. "
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. "
Judges,11,21,"And HaShem, the G-d of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. "
Judges,11,22,"And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan. "
Judges,11,23,"So now HaShem, the G-d of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them? "
Judges,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever HaShem our G-d hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. "
Judges,11,25,"And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? "
Judges,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time? "
Judges,11,27,"I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me; HaShem, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.' "
Judges,11,28,Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him. 
Judges,11,29,"Then the spirit of HaShem came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. "
Judges,11,30,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto HaShem, and said: 'If Thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, "
Judges,11,31,"then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be HaShem'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.' "
Judges,11,32,So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and HaShem delivered them into his hand. 
Judges,11,33,"And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abel-cheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. "
Judges,11,34,"And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. "
Judges,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said: 'Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art become my troubler; for I have opened my mouth unto HaShem, and I cannot go back.' "
Judges,11,36,"And she said unto him: 'My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto HaShem; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as HaShem hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.' "
Judges,11,37,"And she said unto her father: 'Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.' "
Judges,11,38,"And he said: 'Go.' And he sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. "
Judges,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed; and she had not known man. And it was a custom in Israel, "
Judges,11,40,that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. 
Judges,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed to Zaphon; and they said unto Jephthah: 'Wherefore didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.' "
Judges,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them: 'I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand. "
Judges,12,3,"And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and HaShem delivered them into my hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?' "
Judges,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said: 'Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.' "
Judges,12,5,"And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said: 'Let me go over,' the men of Gilead said unto him: 'Art thou an Ephraimite?' If he said: 'Nay'; "
Judges,12,6,"then said they unto him: 'Say now Shibboleth'; and he said 'Sibboleth'; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand. "
Judges,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. "
Judges,12,8,And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel. 
Judges,12,9,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. "
Judges,12,10,"and Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem. "
Judges,12,11,And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
Judges,12,12,"And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. "
Judges,12,13,And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
Judges,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts; and he judged Israel eight years. "
Judges,12,15,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites. "
Judges,13,1,And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; and HaShem delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 
Judges,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not. "
Judges,13,3,"And the angel of HaShem appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: 'Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. "
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. "
Judges,13,5,"For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto G-d from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.' "
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying: 'A man of G-d came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of G-d, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name; "
Judges,13,7,"but he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto G-d from the womb to the day of his death.' "
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah entreated HaShem, and said: 'Oh, HaShem, I pray Thee, let the man of G-d whom Thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.' "
Judges,13,9,And G-d hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of G-d came again unto the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
Judges,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him: 'Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me that day.' "
Judges,13,11,"And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him: 'Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman?' And he said: 'I am.' "
Judges,13,12,"And Manoah said: 'Now when thy word cometh to pass, what shall be the rule for the child, and what shall be done with him?' "
Judges,13,13,And the angel of HaShem said unto Manoah: 'Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. 
Judges,13,14,"She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grapevine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.' "
Judges,13,15,"And Manoah said unto the angel of HaShem: 'I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.' "
Judges,13,16,"And the angel of HaShem said unto Manoah: 'Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto HaShem.' For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of HaShem. "
Judges,13,17,"And Manoah said unto the angel of HaShem: 'What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?' "
Judges,13,18,"And the angel of HaShem said unto him: 'Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?' "
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto HaShem; and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. "
Judges,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of HaShem ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. "
Judges,13,21,But the angel of HaShem did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of HaShem. 
Judges,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife: 'We shall surely die, because we have seen G-d.' "
Judges,13,23,"But his wife said unto him: 'If HaShem were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would He have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.' "
Judges,13,24,"And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and HaShem blessed him. "
Judges,13,25,"And the spirit of HaShem began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. "
Judges,14,1,"And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. "
Judges,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said: 'I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore get her for me to wife.' "
Judges,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him: 'Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?' And Samson said unto his father: 'Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.' "
Judges,14,4,But his father and his mother knew not that it was of HaShem; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel. 
Judges,14,5,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and, behold, a young lion roared against him. "
Judges,14,6,"And the spirit of HaShem came mightily upon him, and he rent him as one would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. "
Judges,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. "
Judges,14,8,"And after a while he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. "
Judges,14,9,"And he scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion. "
Judges,14,10,And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 
Judges,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. "
Judges,14,12,"And Samson said unto them: 'Let me now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment; "
Judges,14,13,"but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment.' And they said unto him: 'Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.' "
Judges,14,14,"And he said unto them: Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle. "
Judges,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife: 'Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire; have ye called us hither to impoverish us?' "
Judges,14,16,"And Samson's wife wept before him, and said: 'Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and wilt thou not tell it me?' And he said unto her: 'Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?' "
Judges,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people. "
Judges,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them: If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. "
Judges,14,19,"And the spirit of HaShem came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. "
Judges,14,20,"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had had for his friend. "
Judges,15,1,"But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said: 'I will go in to my wife into the chamber.' But her father would not suffer him to go in. "
Judges,15,2,"And her father said: 'I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion; is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.' "
Judges,15,3,"And Samson said unto them: 'This time shall I be quits with the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.' "
Judges,15,4,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails. "
Judges,15,5,"And when he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards. "
Judges,15,6,"Then the Philistines said: 'Who hath done this?' And they said: 'Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion.' And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. "
Judges,15,7,"And Samson said unto them: 'If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.' "
Judges,15,8,And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam. 
Judges,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi. "
Judges,15,10,"And the men of Judah said: 'Why are ye come up against us?' And they said: 'To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.' "
Judges,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson: 'Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?' And he said unto them: 'As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.' "
Judges,15,12,"And they said unto him: 'We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson said unto them: 'Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.' "
Judges,15,13,"And they spoke unto him, saying: 'No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.' And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. "
Judges,15,14,"When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him; and the spirit of HaShem came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands. "
Judges,15,15,"And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith. "
Judges,15,16,"And Samson said: With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men. "
Judges,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi."
Judges,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and called on HaShem, and said: 'Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of Thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?' "
Judges,15,19,"But G-d cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came back, and he revived; wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. "
Judges,15,20,And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.  
Judges,16,1,"And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her. "
Judges,16,2,"And it was told the Gazites, saying: 'Samson is come hither.' And they compassed him in, and lay in wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying: 'Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.' "
Judges,16,3,"And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron. "
Judges,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. "
Judges,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her: 'Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.' "
Judges,16,6,"And Delilah said to Samson: 'Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.' "
Judges,16,7,"And Samson said unto her: 'If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as any other man.' "
Judges,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. "
Judges,16,9,"Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And he broke the bowstrings as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. "
Judges,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson: 'Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.' "
Judges,16,11,"And he said unto her: 'If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work, hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as any other man.' "
Judges,16,12,"So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread. "
Judges,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson: 'Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.' And he said unto her: 'If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.' "
Judges,16,14,"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And he awoke out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web. "
Judges,16,15,"And she said unto him: 'How canst thou say: I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.' "
Judges,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death. "
Judges,16,17,"And he told her all his heart, and said unto her: 'There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto G-d from my mother's womb; if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.' "
Judges,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: 'Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart.' Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand. "
Judges,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and had the seven locks of his head shaven off; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. "
Judges,16,20,"And she said: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And he awoke out of his sleep, and said: 'I will go out as at other times, and shake myself.' But he knew not that HaShem was departed from him. "
Judges,16,21,"And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house. "
Judges,16,22,Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. 
Judges,16,23,"And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said: 'Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.' "
Judges,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: 'Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.' "
Judges,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: 'Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.' And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them; and they set him between the pillars. "
Judges,16,26,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand: 'Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.' "
Judges,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. "
Judges,16,28,"And Samson called unto HaShem, and said: 'O L-rd GOD, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this once, O G-d, that I may be this once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.' "
Judges,16,29,"And Samson took fast hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left. "
Judges,16,30,"And Samson said: 'Let me die with the Philistines.' And he bent with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life. "
Judges,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. "
Judges,17,1,"Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. "
Judges,17,2,"And he said unto his mother: 'The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.' And his mother said: 'Blessed be my son of HaShem.' "
Judges,17,3,"And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: 'I verily dedicate the silver unto HaShem from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.' "
Judges,17,4,"And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah. "
Judges,17,5,"And the man Micah had a house of G-d, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. "
Judges,17,6,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes. 
Judges,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah--in the family of Judah--who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. "
Judges,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. "
Judges,17,9,"And Micah said unto him: 'Whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: 'I am a Levite of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.' "
Judges,17,10,"And Micah said unto him: 'Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.' So the Levite went in. "
Judges,17,11,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
Judges,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. "
Judges,17,13,"Then said Micah: 'Now know I that HaShem will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.' "
Judges,18,1,In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day there had nothing been allotted unto them among the tribes of Israel for an inheritance. 
Judges,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them: 'Go, search the land'; and they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there. "
Judges,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him: 'Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?' "
Judges,18,4,"And he said unto them: 'Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.' "
Judges,18,5,"And they said unto him: 'Ask counsel, we pray thee, of G-d, that we may know whether our way which we are going shall be prosperous.' "
Judges,18,6,And the priest said unto them: 'Go in peace; before HaShem is your way wherein ye go.' 
Judges,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in any thing, and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no dealings with any man. "
Judges,18,8,And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren said unto them: 'What say ye?' 
Judges,18,9,"And they said: 'Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good; and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. "
Judges,18,10,"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for G-d hath given it into your hand; a place where there is no want; it hath every thing that is in the earth.' "
Judges,18,11,"And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war. "
Judges,18,12,"And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah; wherefore that place was called Mahaneh-dan unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim. "
Judges,18,13,"And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. "
Judges,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren: 'Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.' "
Judges,18,15,"And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. "
Judges,18,16,"And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. "
Judges,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war. "
Judges,18,18,"And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image of the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them: 'What do ye?' "
Judges,18,19,"And they said unto him: 'Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest; is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?' "
Judges,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. "
Judges,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. "
Judges,18,22,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. "
Judges,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah: 'What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?' "
Judges,18,24,"And he said: 'Ye have taken away my god which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me: What aileth thee?' "
Judges,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him: 'Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.' "
Judges,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house. "
Judges,18,27,"And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire. "
Judges,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein. "
Judges,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel; howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. "
Judges,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. "
Judges,18,31,"So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of G-d was in Shiloh.  "
Judges,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah. "
Judges,19,2,"And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months. "
Judges,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her back, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. "
Judges,19,4,"And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. "
Judges,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law: 'Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.' "
Judges,19,6,"So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel's father said unto the man: 'Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.' "
Judges,19,7,"And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. "
Judges,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said: 'Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth'; and they did eat, both of them. "
Judges,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him: 'Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.' "
Judges,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus--the same is Jerusalem; and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. "
Judges,19,11,"When they were by Jebus--the day was far spent--the servant said unto his master: 'Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.' "
Judges,19,12,"And his master said unto him: 'We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.' "
Judges,19,13,"And he said unto his servant: 'Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.' "
Judges,19,14,"So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. "
Judges,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge. "
Judges,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites. "
Judges,19,17,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the broad place of the city; and the old man said: 'Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?' "
Judges,19,18,"And he said unto him: 'We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of HaShem; and there is no man that taketh me into his house. "
Judges,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.' "
Judges,19,20,And the old man said: 'Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.' 
Judges,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. "
Judges,19,22,"As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: 'Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.' "
Judges,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: 'Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed. "
Judges,19,24,"Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so wanton a thing.' "
Judges,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him; so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go. "
Judges,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. "
Judges,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. "
Judges,19,28,"And he said unto her. 'Up, and let us be going'; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and got him unto his place. "
Judges,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. "
Judges,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said: 'Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.' "
Judges,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto HaShem at Mizpah. "
Judges,20,2,"And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of G-d, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.-- "
Judges,20,3,"Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah. --And the children of Israel said: 'Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?' "
Judges,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said: 'I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. "
Judges,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead. "
Judges,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and wantonness in Israel "
Judges,20,7,"Behold, ye are all here, children of Israel, give here your advice and council.' "
Judges,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying: 'We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house. "
Judges,20,9,But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot; 
Judges,20,10,"and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the wantonness that they have wrought in Israel.' "
Judges,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. "
Judges,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying: 'What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you? "
Judges,20,13,"Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.' But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. "
Judges,20,14,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of their cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. "
Judges,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred chosen men. "
Judges,20,16,"All this people, even seven hundred chosen men, were left-handed; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss. "
Judges,20,17,"And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these were men of war. "
Judges,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of G-d; and they said: 'Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?' And HaShem said: 'Judah first.' "
Judges,20,19,"And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. "
Judges,20,20,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. 
Judges,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men. "
Judges,20,22,"And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. "
Judges,20,23,"And the children of Israel went up and wept before HaShem until even; and they asked of HaShem, saying: 'Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?' And HaShem said: 'Go up against him.' "
Judges,20,24,And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
Judges,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. "
Judges,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before HaShem, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before HaShem. "
Judges,20,27,"And the children of Israel asked of HaShem--for the ark of the covenant of G-d was there in those days, "
Judges,20,28,"and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days--saying: 'Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?' And HaShem said: 'Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand.' "
Judges,20,29,And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about. 
Judges,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. "
Judges,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the field, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, about thirty men of Israel. "
Judges,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said: 'They are smitten down before us, as at the first.' But the children of Israel said: 'Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.' "
Judges,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar; and the liers-in-wait of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. "
Judges,20,34,"And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them. "
Judges,20,35,And HaShem smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men; all these drew the sword. 
Judges,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.-- "
Judges,20,37,"And the liers-in-wait hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew forth, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. "
Judges,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait, that they should make a great beacon of smoke rise up out of the city.-- "
Judges,20,39,"And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said: 'Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.' "
Judges,20,40,"But when the beacon began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. "
Judges,20,41,"And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil was come upon them. "
Judges,20,42,Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the city destroyed them in the midst of the men of Israel. 
Judges,20,43,"They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and overtook them at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. "
Judges,20,44,And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. 
Judges,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men. "
Judges,20,46,So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. 
Judges,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months. "
Judges,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned back upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found; moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.  "
Judges,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying: 'There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.' "
Judges,21,2,"And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before G-d, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore. "
Judges,21,3,"And they said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?' "
Judges,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. "
Judges,21,5,"And the children of Israel said: 'Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto HaShem?' For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto HaShem to Mizpah, saying: 'He shall surely be put to death.' "
Judges,21,6,"And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said: 'There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. "
Judges,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by HaShem that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?' "
Judges,21,8,"And they said: 'What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto HaShem to Mizpah?' And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. "
Judges,21,9,"For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. "
Judges,21,10,"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying: 'Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. "
Judges,21,11,"And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.' "
Judges,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. "
Judges,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them. "
Judges,21,14,And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; and yet so they sufficed them not. 
Judges,21,15,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that HaShem had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. "
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said: 'How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?' "
Judges,21,17,"And they said: 'They that are escaped must be as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel. "
Judges,21,18,"Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters.' For the children of Israel had sworn, saying: 'Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.' "
Judges,21,19,"And they said: 'Behold, there is the feast of HaShem from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.' "
Judges,21,20,"And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying: 'Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; "
Judges,21,21,"and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. "
Judges,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to strive with us, that we will say unto them: Grant them graciously unto us; because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle; neither did ye give them unto them, that ye should now be guilty.' "
Judges,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them. "
Judges,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. "
Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.  
I Samuel,1,1,"NOW THERE was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. "
I Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. "
I Samuel,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto HaShem of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto HaShem. "
I Samuel,1,4,"And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions; "
I Samuel,1,5,"but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but HaShem had shut up her womb. "
I Samuel,1,6,"And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because HaShem had shut up her womb. "
I Samuel,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of HaShem, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat. "
I Samuel,1,8,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her: 'Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?' "
I Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk--now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of HaShem; "
I Samuel,1,10,"and she was in bitterness of soul--and prayed unto HaShem, and wept sore. "
I Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said: 'O HaShem of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto HaShem all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.' "
I Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she prayed long before HaShem, that Eli watched her mouth. "
I Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken. "
I Samuel,1,14,And Eli said unto her: 'How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.' 
I Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said: 'No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before HaShem. "
I Samuel,1,16,Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.' 
I Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said: 'Go in peace, and the G-d of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.' "
I Samuel,1,18,"And she said: 'Let thy servant find favour in thy sight.' So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. "
I Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before HaShem, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and HaShem remembered her. "
I Samuel,1,20,"And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel: 'because I have asked him of HaShem.' "
I Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto HaShem the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. "
I Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: 'Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear before HaShem, and there abide for ever.' "
I Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her: 'Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only HaShem establish His word.' So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him. "
I Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of HaShem in Shiloh; and the child was young. "
I Samuel,1,25,"And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli. "
I Samuel,1,26,"And she said: 'Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto HaShem. "
I Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and HaShem hath granted me my petition which I asked of Him; 
I Samuel,1,28,therefore I also have lent him to HaShem; as long as he liveth he is lent to HaShem.' And he worshipped HaShem there. 
I Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: my heart exulteth in HaShem, my horn is exalted in HaShem; my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in Thy salvation. "
I Samuel,2,2,"There is none holy as HaShem, for there is none beside Thee; neither is there any rock like our G-d. "
I Samuel,2,3,"Multiply not exceeding proud talk; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; for HaShem is a G-d of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed. "
I Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. "
I Samuel,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased; while the barren hath borne seven, she that had many children hath languished. "
I Samuel,2,6,"HaShem killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. "
I Samuel,2,7,"HaShem maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up. "
I Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are HaShem'S, and He hath set the world upon them. "
I Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of His holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail. "
I Samuel,2,10,"They that strive with HaShem shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven; HaShem will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength unto His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed. "
I Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto HaShem before Eli the priest. 
I Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not HaShem. 
I Samuel,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band; "
I Samuel,2,14,"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh. "
I Samuel,2,15,"Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: 'Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.' "
I Samuel,2,16,"And if the man said unto him: 'Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: 'Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.' "
I Samuel,2,17,And the sin of the young men was very great before HaShem; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of HaShem. 
I Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before HaShem, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. "
I Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. "
I Samuel,2,20,"And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: 'The HaShem give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to HaShem.' And they would go unto their own home. "
I Samuel,2,21,"So HaShem remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before HaShem. "
I Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. "
I Samuel,2,23,And he said unto them: 'Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people. 
I Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear HaShem'S people do spread abroad. "
I Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, G-d shall judge him; but if a man sin against HaShem, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because HaShem would slay them. "
I Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with HaShem, and also with men. "
I Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of G-d unto Eli, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house? "
I Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? "
I Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people? "
I Samuel,2,30,"Therefore HaShem, the G-d of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now HaShem saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. "
I Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. "
I Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. "
I Samuel,2,33,"Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men. "
I Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them. "
I Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever. "
I Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.' "
I Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto HaShem before Eli. And the word of HaShem was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. 
I Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place--now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see-- "
I Samuel,3,3,"and the lamp of G-d was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of HaShem, where the ark of G-d was, "
I Samuel,3,4,that HaShem called Samuel; and he said: 'Here am I.' 
I Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said: 'Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And he said: 'I called not; lie down again.' And he went and lay down. "
I Samuel,3,6,"And HaShem called yet again Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: 'Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And he answered: 'I called not, my son; lie down again.' "
I Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know HaShem, neither was the word of HaShem yet revealed unto him. "
I Samuel,3,8,"And HaShem called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: 'Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And Eli perceived that HaShem was calling the child. "
I Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: 'Go, lie down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak, HaShem; for Thy servant heareth.' So Samuel went and lay down in his place. "
I Samuel,3,10,"And HaShem came, and stood, and called as at other times: 'Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel said: 'Speak; for Thy servant heareth.' "
I Samuel,3,11,"And HaShem said to Samuel: 'Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. "
I Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. "
I Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he rebuked them not. "
I Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.' "
I Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of HaShem. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision. "
I Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said: 'Samuel, my son.' And he said: `Here am I.' "
I Samuel,3,17,"And he said: 'What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me, G-d do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.' "
I Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said: 'It is HaShem; let Him do what seemeth Him good.' "
I Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and HaShem was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. "
I Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of HaShem. 
I Samuel,3,21,And HaShem appeared again in Shiloh; for HaShem revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of HaShem. 
I Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. "
I Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when the battle was spread, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. "
I Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said: 'Wherefore hath HaShem smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of HaShem out of Shiloh unto us, that He may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.' "
I Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of HaShem of hosts, who sitteth upon the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of G-d. "
I Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of HaShem came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang. "
I Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said: 'What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' And they knew that the ark of HaShem was come into the camp. "
I Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said: 'G-d is come into the camp.' And they said: 'Woe unto us! for there was not such a thing yesterday and the day before. "
I Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues and in the wilderness. 
I Samuel,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.' "
I Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. "
I Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of G-d was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. "
I Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. "
I Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of G-d. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. "
I Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said: 'What meaneth the noise of this tumult?' And the man made haste, and came and told Eli. "
I Samuel,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. "
I Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli: 'I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army.' And he said: 'How went the matter, my son?' "
I Samuel,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said: 'Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of G-d is taken.' "
I Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of G-d, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. "
I Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of G-d was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came suddenly upon her. "
I Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her: 'Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son.' But she answered not, neither did she regard it. "
I Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying: 'The glory is departed from Israel'; because the ark of G-d was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. "
I Samuel,4,22,And she said: 'The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of G-d is taken.'  
I Samuel,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of G-d, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. "
I Samuel,5,2,"And the Philistines took the ark of G-d, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. "
I Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of HaShem. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. "
I Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of HaShem; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. "
I Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. "
I Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of HaShem was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the borders thereof. "
I Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said: 'The ark of the G-d of Israel shall not abide with us; for His hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.' "
I Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said: 'What shall we do with the ark of the G-d of Israel?' And they answered: 'Let the ark of the G-d of Israel be carried about unto Gath.' And they carried the ark of the G-d of Israel about thither. "
I Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of HaShem was against the city with a very great discomfiture; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and emerods broke out upon them. "
I Samuel,5,10,"So they sent the ark of G-d to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of G-d came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying: 'They have brought about the ark of the G-d of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.' "
I Samuel,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said: 'Send away the ark of the G-d of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people'; for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of G-d was very heavy there. "
I Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven. 
I Samuel,6,1,And the ark of HaShem was in the country of the Philistines seven months. 
I Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: 'What shall we do with the ark of HaShem? declare unto us wherewith we shall send it to its place.' "
I Samuel,6,3,"And they said: 'If ye send away the ark of the G-d of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return Him a guilt-offering; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.' "
I Samuel,6,4,"Then said they: 'What shall be the guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?' And they said: 'Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. "
I Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the G-d of Israel; peradventure He will lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. "
I Samuel,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when He had wrought among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? "
I Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them. "
I Samuel,6,8,"And take the ark of HaShem, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a guilt-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. "
I Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then He hath done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.' "
I Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. "
I Samuel,6,11,"And they put the ark of HaShem upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. "
I Samuel,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. "
I Samuel,6,13,"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. "
I Samuel,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone; and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto HaShem. "
I Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of HaShem, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto HaShem. "
I Samuel,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. "
I Samuel,6,17,"And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a guilt-offering unto HaShem: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; "
I Samuel,6,18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto Abel by the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of HaShem, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite. "
I Samuel,6,19,"And He smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark of HaShem, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because HaShem had smitten the people with a great slaughter. "
I Samuel,6,20,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said: 'Who is able to stand before HaShem, this holy G-d? and to whom shall it go up from us?' "
I Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying: 'The Philistines have brought back the ark of HaShem; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.'  "
I Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of HaShem, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of HaShem. "
I Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel yearned after HaShem. "
I Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying: 'If ye do return unto HaShem with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto HaShem, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.' "
I Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served HaShem only. "
I Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said: 'Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto HaShem.' "
I Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before HaShem, and fasted on that day, and said there: 'We have sinned against HaShem.' And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah. "
I Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. "
I Samuel,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel: 'Cease not to cry unto HaShem our G-d for us, that He save us out of the hand of the Philistines.' "
I Samuel,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto HaShem; and Samuel cried unto HaShem for Israel; and HaShem answered him. "
I Samuel,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but HaShem thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel. "
I Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car. "
I Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying: 'Hitherto hath HaShem helped us.' "
I Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel; and the hand of HaShem was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. "
I Samuel,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. "
I Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
I Samuel,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places. "
I Samuel,7,17,"And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar unto HaShem.  "
I Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. "
I Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba. "
I Samuel,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice. "
I Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah. "
I Samuel,8,5,"And they said unto him: 'Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.' "
I Samuel,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said: 'Give us a king to judge us.' And Samuel prayed unto HaShem. "
I Samuel,8,7,"And HaShem said unto Samuel: 'Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them. "
I Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken Me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. "
I Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit thou shalt earnestly forewarn them, and shalt declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.' "
I Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of HaShem unto the people that asked of him a king. 
I Samuel,8,11,"And he said: 'This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots. "
I Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. "
I Samuel,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. "
I Samuel,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. "
I Samuel,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. "
I Samuel,8,16,"And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. "
I Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants. 
I Samuel,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and HaShem will not answer you in that day.' 
I Samuel,8,19,But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said: 'Nay; but there shall be a king over us; 
I Samuel,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.' "
I Samuel,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them in the ears of HaShem. "
I Samuel,8,22,"And HaShem said to Samuel: 'Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.' And Samuel said unto the men of Israel: 'Go ye every man unto his city.' "
I Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour. "
I Samuel,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, young and goodly, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. "
I Samuel,9,3,"Now the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son: 'Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.' "
I Samuel,9,4,"And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not; then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. "
I Samuel,9,5,"When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him: 'Come and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and become anxious concerning us.' "
I Samuel,9,6,"And he said unto him: 'Behold now, there is in this city a man of G-d, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.' "
I Samuel,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant: 'But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of G-d; what have we?' "
I Samuel,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said: 'Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver, that will I give to the man of G-d, to tell us our way.'-- "
I Samuel,9,9,"Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of G-d, thus he said: 'Come and let us go to the seer'; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer.-- "
I Samuel,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant: 'Well said; come, let us go.' So they went unto the city where the man of G-d was. "
I Samuel,9,11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them: 'Is the seer here?' "
I Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them, and said: 'He is; behold, he is before thee; make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place. "
I Samuel,9,13,"As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.' "
I Samuel,9,14,"And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place. "
I Samuel,9,15,"Now HaShem had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying: "
I Samuel,9,16,"'To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over My people Israel, and he shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry is come unto Me.' "
I Samuel,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, HaShem spoke unto him: 'Behold the man of whom I said unto thee: This same shall have authority over My people.' "
I Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.' "
I Samuel,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said: 'I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day; and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart. "
I Samuel,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?' "
I Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answered and said: 'Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?' "
I Samuel,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons. "
I Samuel,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook: 'Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee: Set it by thee.' "
I Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: 'Behold that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said: I have invited the people.' So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. "
I Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the housetop. "
I Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early; and it came to pass about the break of day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: 'Up, that I may send thee away.' And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. "
I Samuel,9,27,"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: 'Bid the servant pass on before us--and he passed on--but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of G-d.' "
I Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: 'Is it not that HaShem hath anointed thee to be prince over His inheritance? "
I Samuel,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by the tomb of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee: The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious concerning you, saying: What shall I do for my son? "
I Samuel,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the terebinth of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there three men going up to G-d to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine. "
I Samuel,10,4,"And they will salute thee, and give thee two cakes of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hand. "
I Samuel,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of G-d, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying. "
I Samuel,10,6,"And the spirit of HaShem will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. "
I Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as thy hand shall find; for G-d is with thee. "
I Samuel,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and tell thee what thou shalt do.' "
I Samuel,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, G-d gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. "
I Samuel,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of G-d came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them. "
I Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another: 'What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?' "
I Samuel,10,12,And one of the same place answered and said: 'And who is their father?' Therefore it became a proverb: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?' 
I Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. "
I Samuel,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant: 'Whither went ye?' And he said: 'To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.' "
I Samuel,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.' "
I Samuel,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle: 'He told us plainly that the asses were found.' But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not. "
I Samuel,10,17,And Samuel called the people together unto HaShem to Mizpah. 
I Samuel,10,18,"And he said unto the children of Israel: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. "
I Samuel,10,19,"But ye have this day rejected your G-d, who Himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto Him: Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before HaShem by your tribes, and by your thousands.' "
I Samuel,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. "
I Samuel,10,21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him, he could not be found. "
I Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they asked of HaShem further: 'Is there yet a man come hither?' And HaShem answered: 'Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.' "
I Samuel,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. "
I Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people: 'See ye him whom HaShem hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?' And all the people shouted, and said: 'Long live the king.' "
I Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before HaShem. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. "
I Samuel,10,26,"And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the men of valour, whose hearts G-d had touched. "
I Samuel,10,27,"But certain base fellows said: 'How shall this man save us?' And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he was as one that held his peace. "
I Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash: `Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.' "
I Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them: 'On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.' "
I Samuel,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him: 'Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to deliver us, we will come out to thee.' "
I Samuel,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeath-shaul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept. "
I Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said: 'What aileth the people that they weep?' And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. "
I Samuel,11,6,"And the spirit of G-d came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly. "
I Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying: 'Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.' And the dread of HaShem fell on the people, and they came out as one man. "
I Samuel,11,8,"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. "
I Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came: 'Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead: To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance.' And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. "
I Samuel,11,10,"And the men of Jabesh said: 'To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.' "
I Samuel,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. "
I Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel: 'Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.' "
I Samuel,11,13,And Saul said: 'There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day HaShem hath wrought deliverance in Israel.' 
I Samuel,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people: 'Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.' "
I Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before HaShem in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before HaShem; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. 
I Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel: 'Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. "
I Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day. "
I Samuel,12,3,"Here I am; witness against me before HaShem, and before His anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? or whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.' "
I Samuel,12,4,"And they said: 'Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.' "
I Samuel,12,5,"And he said unto them: 'The HaShem is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand.' And they said: 'He is witness.' "
I Samuel,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people: 'It is HaShem that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. "
I Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before HaShem concerning all the righteous acts of HaShem, which He did to you and to your fathers. "
I Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, then your fathers cried unto HaShem, and HaShem sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and they were made to dwell in this place. "
I Samuel,12,9,"But they forgot HaShem their G-d, and He gave them over into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. "
I Samuel,12,10,"And they cried unto HaShem, and said: We have sinned, because we have forsaken HaShem, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve Thee. "
I Samuel,12,11,"And HaShem sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety. "
I Samuel,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me: Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when HaShem your G-d was your king. "
I Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for; and, behold, HaShem hath set a king over you. "
I Samuel,12,14,"If ye will fear HaShem, and serve Him, and hearken unto His voice, and not rebel against the commandment of HaShem, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of HaShem your G-d--; "
I Samuel,12,15,"but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of HaShem, but rebel against the commandment of HaShem, then shall the hand of HaShem be against you, and against your fathers. "
I Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which HaShem will do before your eyes. "
I Samuel,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto HaShem, that He may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of HaShem, in asking you a king.' "
I Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto HaShem; and HaShem sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared HaShem and Samuel. 
I Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel: 'Pray for thy servants unto HaShem thy G-d, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.' "
I Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people: 'Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following HaShem, but serve HaShem with all your heart; "
I Samuel,12,21,"and turn ye not aside; for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain. "
I Samuel,12,22,For HaShem will not forsake His people for His great name's sake; because it hath pleased HaShem to make you a people unto Himself. 
I Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against HaShem in ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. "
I Samuel,12,24,"Only fear HaShem, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things He hath done for you. "
I Samuel,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be swept away, both ye and your king.' "
I Samuel,13,1,Saul was---- years old when he began to reign; and two years he reigned over Israel. 
I Samuel,13,2,"And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmas and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeath-benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. "
I Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the horn throughout all the land, saying: 'Let the Hebrews hear.' "
I Samuel,13,4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also had made himself odious with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal. "
I Samuel,13,5,"And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude; and they came up, and pitched in Michmas, eastward of Beth-aven. "
I Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait--for the people were distressed--then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in holds, and in pits. "
I Samuel,13,7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. "
I Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. "
I Samuel,13,9,And Saul said: 'Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.' And he offered the burnt-offering. 
I Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. "
I Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said: 'What hast thou done?' And Saul said: 'Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together against Michmas; "
I Samuel,13,12,"therefore said I: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favour of HaShem; I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.' "
I Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul: 'Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of HaShem thy G-d, which He commanded thee; for now would HaShem have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. "
I Samuel,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue; HaShem hath sought him a man after His own heart, and HaShem hath appointed him to be prince over His people, because thou hast not kept that which HaShem commanded thee.' "
I Samuel,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeath-benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. "
I Samuel,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeath-benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmas. "
I Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual; "
I Samuel,13,18,and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 
I Samuel,13,19,Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said: 'Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears'; 
I Samuel,13,20,"but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. "
I Samuel,13,21,"And the price of the filing was a pim for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks with three teeth, and for the axes; and to set the goads. "
I Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. "
I Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmas.  
I Samuel,14,1,"Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armour: 'Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father. "
I Samuel,14,2,"And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men, "
I Samuel,14,3,"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of HaShem in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. "
I Samuel,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. "
I Samuel,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmas, and the other on the south in front of Geba. "
I Samuel,14,6,And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: 'Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that HaShem will work for us; for there is no restraint to HaShem to save by many or by few.' 
I Samuel,14,7,"And his armour-bearer said unto him: 'Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy heart.' "
I Samuel,14,8,"Then said Jonathan: 'Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them. "
I Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. "
I Samuel,14,10,But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for HaShem hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us.' 
I Samuel,14,11,And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said: 'Behold Hebrews coming forth out of the holes where they hid themselves.' 
I Samuel,14,12,"And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said: 'Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.' And Jonathan said unto his armour-bearer: 'Come up after me; for HaShem hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.' "
I Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour-bearer slew them after him. "
I Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land. "
I Samuel,14,15,"And there was a trembling in the camp in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked; so it grew into a terror from G-d. "
I Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeath-benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither. "
I Samuel,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him: 'Number now, and see who is gone from us.' And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there. "
I Samuel,14,18,And Saul said unto Ahijah: 'Bring hither the ark of G-d.' For the ark of G-d was there at that time with the children of Israel. 
I Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said unto the priest: 'Withdraw thy hand.' "
I Samuel,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. "
I Samuel,14,21,"Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp round about; even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. "
I Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. "
I Samuel,14,23,So HaShem saved Israel that day; and the battle passed on as far as Beth-aven. 
I Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day; but Saul adjured the people, saying: 'Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies.' So none of the people tasted food. "
I Samuel,14,25,And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground. 
I Samuel,14,26,"And when the people were come unto the forest, behold a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath. "
I Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. "
I Samuel,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said: 'Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.' "
I Samuel,14,29,"Then said Jonathan: 'My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, how mine eyes are brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. "
I Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? had there not been then a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?' "
I Samuel,14,31,And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmas to Aijalon; and the people were very faint. 
I Samuel,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood. "
I Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying: 'Behold, the people sin against HaShem, in that they eat with the blood.' And he said: 'Ye have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone unto me this day.' "
I Samuel,14,34,"And Saul said: 'Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them: Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against HaShem in eating with the blood.' And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. "
I Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto HaShem; the same was the first altar that he built unto HaShem. 
I Samuel,14,36,"And Saul said: 'Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.' And they said: 'Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.' Then said the priest: 'Let us draw near hither unto G-d.' "
I Samuel,14,37,And Saul asked counsel of G-d: 'Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?' But He answered him not that day. 
I Samuel,14,38,"And Saul said: 'Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. "
I Samuel,14,39,"For, as HaShem liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.' But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. "
I Samuel,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel: 'Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.' And the people said unto Saul: 'Do what seemeth good unto thee.' "
I Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel: 'Declare the right.' And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped. "
I Samuel,14,42,And Saul said: 'Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.' And Jonathan was taken. 
I Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan: 'Tell me what thou hast done.' And Jonathan told him, and said: 'I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; here am I: I will die.' "
I Samuel,14,44,"And Saul said: 'G-d do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.' "
I Samuel,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul: 'Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it; as HaShem liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with G-d this day.' So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. "
I Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place. 
I Samuel,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he put them to the worse. "
I Samuel,14,48,"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. "
I Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal; "
I Samuel,14,50,"and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. "
I Samuel,14,51,"And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. "
I Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.  "
I Samuel,15,1,"And Samuel said unto Saul: 'The HaShem sent me to anoint thee to be king over His people, over Israel; now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of HaShem. "
I Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. "
I Samuel,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.' "
I Samuel,15,4,"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. "
I Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley. "
I Samuel,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites: 'Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.' So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. "
I Samuel,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is in front of Egypt. "
I Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. "
I Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, even the young of the second birth, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was of no account and feeble, that they destroyed utterly. "
I Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of HaShem unto Samuel, saying: "
I Samuel,15,11,"'It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My commandments.' And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto HaShem all night. "
I Samuel,15,12,"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying: 'Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he is setting him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.' "
I Samuel,15,13,And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him: 'Blessed be thou of HaShem; I have performed the commandment of HaShem.' 
I Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel said: 'What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?' "
I Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said: 'They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto HaShem thy G-d; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.' "
I Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul: 'Stay, and I will tell thee what HaShem hath said to me this night.' And he said unto him: 'Say on.' "
I Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said: 'Though thou be little in thine own sight, art thou not head of the tribes of Israel? And HaShem anointed thee king over Israel; "
I Samuel,15,18,"and HaShem sent thee on a journey, and said: Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. "
I Samuel,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not hearken to the voice of HaShem, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of HaShem?' "
I Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel: 'Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of HaShem, and have gone the way which HaShem sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. "
I Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto HaShem thy G-d in Gilgal.' "
I Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said: 'Hath HaShem as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in hearkening to the voice of HaShem? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. "
I Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of HaShem, He hath also rejected thee from being king.' "
I Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel: 'I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of HaShem, and thy words; because I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice. "
I Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship HaShem.' "
I Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul: 'I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of HaShem, and HaShem hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.' "
I Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent. "
I Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him: 'The HaShem hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. "
I Samuel,15,29,"And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.' "
I Samuel,15,30,"Then he said: 'I have sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship HaShem thy G-d.' "
I Samuel,15,31,So Samuel returned after Saul; and Saul worshipped HaShem. 
I Samuel,15,32,Then said Samuel: 'Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.' And Agag came unto him in chains. And Agag said: 'Surely the bitterness of death is at hand.' 
I Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before HaShem in Gilgal. "
I Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeath-shaul. 
I Samuel,15,35,And Samuel never beheld Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul; and HaShem repented that He had made Saul king over Israel. 
I Samuel,16,1,"And HaShem said unto Samuel: 'How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.' "
I Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said: 'How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.' And HaShem said: 'Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to HaShem. "
I Samuel,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee.' "
I Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel did that which HaShem spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: 'Comest thou peaceably?' "
I Samuel,16,5,"And he said: 'Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto HaShem; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.' And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. "
I Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: 'Surely HaShem'S anointed is before Him.' "
I Samuel,16,7,"But HaShem said unto Samuel: 'Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but HaShem looketh on the heart.' "
I Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: 'Neither hath HaShem chosen this.' "
I Samuel,16,9,Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: 'Neither hath HaShem chosen this.' 
I Samuel,16,10,And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'The HaShem hath not chosen these.' 
I Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'Are here all thy children?' And he said: 'There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.' And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.' "
I Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. And HaShem said: 'Arise, anoint him; for this is he.' "
I Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of HaShem came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. "
I Samuel,16,14,"Now the spirit of HaShem had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from HaShem terrified him. "
I Samuel,16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him: 'Behold now, an evil spirit from G-d terrifieth thee. "
I Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it shall be, when the evil spirit from G-d cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.' "
I Samuel,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants: 'Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.' "
I Samuel,16,18,"Then answered one of the young men, and said: 'Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and HaShem is with him.' "
I Samuel,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: 'Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.' "
I Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. "
I Samuel,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer. "
I Samuel,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: 'Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.' "
I Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from G-d was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him. "
I Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. "
I Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. "
I Samuel,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between them. "
I Samuel,17,4,"And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. "
I Samuel,17,5,"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. "
I Samuel,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. "
I Samuel,17,7,And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. 
I Samuel,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them: 'Why do ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. "
I Samuel,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.' "
I Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine said: 'I do taunt the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.' "
I Samuel,17,11,"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. "
I Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men. "
I Samuel,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. "
I Samuel,17,14,And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.-- 
I Samuel,17,15,Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.-- 
I Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. "
I Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son: 'Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren. "
I Samuel,17,18,"And bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and to thy brethren shalt thou bring greetings, and take their pledge; "
I Samuel,17,19,"now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, are in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.' "
I Samuel,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the barricade, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. "
I Samuel,17,21,"And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. "
I Samuel,17,22,"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brethren. "
I Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words; and David heard them. "
I Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. "
I Samuel,17,25,"And the men of Israel said: 'Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to taunt Israel is he come up; and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.' "
I Samuel,17,26,"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: 'What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the taunt from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should have taunted the armies of the living G-d?' "
I Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying: 'So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.' "
I Samuel,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said: 'Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy presumptuousness, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.' "
I Samuel,17,29,And David said: 'What have I now done? Was it not but a word?' 
I Samuel,17,30,"And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him after the former manner. "
I Samuel,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he was taken to him. "
I Samuel,17,32,And David said to Saul: 'Let no man's heart fail within him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.' 
I Samuel,17,33,"And Saul said to David: 'Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.' "
I Samuel,17,34,"And David said unto Saul: 'Thy servant kept his father's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock, "
I Samuel,17,35,"I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. "
I Samuel,17,36,"Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath taunted the armies of the living G-d.' "
I Samuel,17,37,"And David said: 'The HaShem that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.' And Saul said unto David: 'Go, and HaShem shall be with thee.' "
I Samuel,17,38,"And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. "
I Samuel,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he essayed to go ,but could not; for he had not tried it. And David said unto Saul: 'I cannot go with these; for I have not tried them.' And David put them off him. "
I Samuel,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine. "
I Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine came nearer and nearer unto David; and the man that bore the shield went before him. 
I Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance. "
I Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David: 'Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?' And the Philistine cursed David by his god. "
I Samuel,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David: 'Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.' "
I Samuel,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine: 'Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee in the name of HaShem of hosts, the G-d of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast taunted. "
I Samuel,17,46,"This day will HaShem deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a G-d in Israel; "
I Samuel,17,47,"and that all this assembly may know that HaShem saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is HaShem'S, and He will give you into our hand.' "
I Samuel,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. "
I Samuel,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. "
I Samuel,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. "
I Samuel,17,51,"And David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their mighty man was dead, they fled. "
I Samuel,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. "
I Samuel,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their camp. "
I Samuel,17,54,"And David took the head of the philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. "
I Samuel,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host: 'Abner, whose son is this youth?' And Abner said: 'As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.' "
I Samuel,17,56,And the king said: 'Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.' 
I Samuel,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. "
I Samuel,17,58,"And Saul said to him: 'Whose son art thou, thou young man?' And David answered: 'I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.' "
I Samuel,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. "
I Samuel,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. "
I Samuel,18,3,"Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. "
I Samuel,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. "
I Samuel,18,5,"And David went out; whithersoever Saul sent him, he had good success; and Saul set him over the men of war; and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. "
I Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments. "
I Samuel,18,7,"And the women sang one to another in their play, and said: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. "
I Samuel,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said: 'They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands; and all he lacketh is the kingdom!' "
I Samuel,18,9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
I Samuel,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from G-d came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house; and David played with his hand, as he did day by day; and Saul had his spear in his hand. "
I Samuel,18,11,And Saul cast the spear; for he said: 'I will smite David even to the wall.' And David stepped aside out of his presence twice. 
I Samuel,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because HaShem was with him, and was departed from Saul. "
I Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. "
I Samuel,18,14,And David had great success in all his ways; and HaShem was with him. 
I Samuel,18,15,"And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him. "
I Samuel,18,16,But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them. 
I Samuel,18,17,"And Saul said to David: 'Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight HaShem'S battles.' For Saul said: 'Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.' "
I Samuel,18,18,"And David said unto Saul: 'Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?' "
I Samuel,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. "
I Samuel,18,20,"And Michal Saul's daughter loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. "
I Samuel,18,21,"And Saul said: 'I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.' Wherefore Saul said to David: 'Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law through the one of the twain.' "
I Samuel,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants: 'Speak with David secretly, and say: Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee; now therefore be the king's son-in-law.' "
I Samuel,18,23,"And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said: 'Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?' "
I Samuel,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying: 'On this manner spoke David.' "
I Samuel,18,25,"And Saul said: 'Thus shall ye say to David: The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.' For Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. "
I Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired; "
I Samuel,18,27,"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. "
I Samuel,18,28,And Saul saw and knew that HaShem was with David; and Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 
I Samuel,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually. 
I Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David prospered more than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by. "
I Samuel,19,1,"And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David; but Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David. "
I Samuel,19,2,"And Jonathan told David, saying: 'Saul my father seeketh to slay thee; now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself. "
I Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will speak with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.' "
I Samuel,19,4,"And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him: 'Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his work hath been very good towards thee; "
I Samuel,19,5,"for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and HaShem wrought a great victory for all Israel; thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?' "
I Samuel,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore: 'As HaShem liveth, he shall not be put to death.' "
I Samuel,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime. "
I Samuel,19,8,"And there was war again; and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. "
I Samuel,19,9,"And an evil spirit from HaShem was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand. "
I Samuel,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall; and David fled, and escaped that night. "
I Samuel,19,11,"And Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal David's wife told him, saying: 'If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain.' "
I Samuel,19,12,"So Michal let David down through the window; and he went, and fled, and escaped. "
I Samuel,19,13,"And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a quilt of goats' hair at the head thereof, and covered it with a cloth. "
I Samuel,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said: 'He is sick.' "
I Samuel,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying: 'Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.' "
I Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the quilt of goats' hair at the head thereof. "
I Samuel,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal: 'Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, that he is escaped?' And Michal answered Saul: 'He said unto me: Let me go; why should I kill thee?' "
I Samuel,19,18,"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. "
I Samuel,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying: 'Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.' "
I Samuel,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of G-d came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. "
I Samuel,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. "
I Samuel,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great cistern that is in Secu; and he asked and said: 'Where are Samuel and David?' And one said: 'Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.' "
I Samuel,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah; and the spirit of G-d came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. "
I Samuel,19,24,"And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?' "
I Samuel,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan: 'What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?' "
I Samuel,20,2,"And he said unto him: 'Far from it; thou shalt not die; behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.' "
I Samuel,20,3,"And David swore moreover, and said: 'Thy father knoweth well that I have found favour in thine eyes; and he saith: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; but truly as HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.' "
I Samuel,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David: 'What doth thy soul desire, that I should do it for thee?' "
I Samuel,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan: 'Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, when I should sit with the king to eat; so let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. "
I Samuel,20,6,"If thy father miss me at all, then say: David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. "
I Samuel,20,7,"If he say thus: It is well; thy servant shall have peace; but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him. "
I Samuel,20,8,"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of HaShem with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?' "
I Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan said: 'Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? "
I Samuel,20,10,Then said David to Jonathan: 'Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?' 
I Samuel,20,11,And Jonathan said unto David: 'Come and let us go out into the field.' And they went out both of them into the field. 
I Samuel,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David: `The HaShem, the G-d of Israel--when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee? "
I Samuel,20,13,"HaShem do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and HaShem be with thee, as He hath been with my father. "
I Samuel,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of HaShem, that I die not; "
I Samuel,20,15,"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when HaShem hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.' "
I Samuel,20,16,So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David: 'The HaShem even require it at the hand of David's enemies.' 
I Samuel,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. "
I Samuel,20,18,"And Jonathan said unto him: 'To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, thy seat will be empty. "
I Samuel,20,19,"And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. "
I Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows to the side-ward, as though I shot at a mark. "
I Samuel,20,21,"And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as HaShem liveth. "
I Samuel,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the boy: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for HaShem hath sent thee away. "
I Samuel,20,23,"And as touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, HaShem is between me and thee for ever.' "
I Samuel,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to the meal to eat. "
I Samuel,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty. "
I Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day; for he thought: 'Something hath befallen him, he is unclean; surely he is not clean.' "
I Samuel,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son: 'Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday, nor to-day?' "
I Samuel,20,28,And Jonathan answered Saul: 'David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem; 
I Samuel,20,29,"and he said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me; and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's table.' "
I Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him: 'Thou son of perverse rebellion, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's nakedness? "
I Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he deserveth to die.' "
I Samuel,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him: 'Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?' "
I Samuel,20,33,And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. 
I Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, and because his father had put him to shame. "
I Samuel,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. "
I Samuel,20,36,"And he said unto his lad: 'Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.' And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. "
I Samuel,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: `Is not the arrow beyond thee?' "
I Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad: 'Make speed, hasten, stay not.' And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. "
I Samuel,20,39,But the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
I Samuel,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him: 'Go, carry them to the city.' "
I Samuel,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. 'Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of HaShem, saying: HaShem shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever.' "
I Samuel,20,42,
I Samuel,21,1,And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city. 
I Samuel,21,2,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him: 'Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?' "
I Samuel,21,3,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest: 'The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me: Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and the young men have I appointed to such and such a place. "
I Samuel,21,4,"Now therefore what is under thy hand? five loaves of bread? give them in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.' "
I Samuel,21,5,"And the priest answered David, and said: 'There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.' "
I Samuel,21,6,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him: 'Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day, when there shall be holy bread in their vessels?' "
I Samuel,21,7,"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before HaShem, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.-- "
I Samuel,21,8,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before HaShem; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.-- "
I Samuel,21,9,"And David said unto Ahimelech: 'And is there peradventure here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.' "
I Samuel,21,10,"And the priest said: 'The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here.' And David said: 'There is none like that; give it me.' "
I Samuel,21,11,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. "
I Samuel,21,12,"And the servants of Achish said unto him: 'Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?' "
I Samuel,21,13,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. "
I Samuel,21,14,"And he changed his demeanour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. "
I Samuel,21,15,"Then said Achish unto his servants: 'Lo, when ye see a man that is mad, wherefore do ye bring him to me? "
I Samuel,21,16,"Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?' "
I Samuel,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him. "
I Samuel,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men. "
I Samuel,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said unto the king of Moab: 'Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what G-d will do for me.' "
I Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 
I Samuel,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David: 'Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.' Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth. "
I Samuel,22,6,"And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him; now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. "
I Samuel,22,7,"And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him: 'Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds; "
I Samuel,22,8,"that all of you have conspired against me, and there was none that disclosed it to me when my son made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?' "
I Samuel,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said: 'I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. "
I Samuel,22,10,"And he inquired of HaShem for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.' "
I Samuel,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob; and they came all of them to the king. "
I Samuel,22,12,"And Saul said: 'Hear now, thou son of Ahitub.' And he answered: 'Here I am, my lord.' "
I Samuel,22,13,"And Saul said unto him: 'Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of G-d for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?' "
I Samuel,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said: 'And who among all thy servants is so trusted as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and giveth heed unto thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house? "
I Samuel,22,15,"Have I to-day begun to inquire of G-d for him? be it far from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.' "
I Samuel,22,16,"And the king said: 'Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.' "
I Samuel,22,17,"And the king said unto the guard that stood about him: 'Turn, and slay the priests of HaShem; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me.' But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of HaShem. "
I Samuel,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg: 'Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.' And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. "
I Samuel,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword. "
I Samuel,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. "
I Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain HaShem'S priests. 
I Samuel,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar: 'I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul; I have brought about the death of all the persons of thy father's house. "
I Samuel,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life; for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.' "
I Samuel,23,1,"And they told David, saying: 'Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.' "
I Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of HaShem, saying: 'Shall I go and smite these Philistines?' And HaShem said unto David: 'Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.' "
I Samuel,23,3,"And David's men said unto him: 'Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?' "
I Samuel,23,4,"Then David inquired of HaShem yet again. And HaShem answered him and said: 'Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.' "
I Samuel,23,5,"And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. "
I Samuel,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. "
I Samuel,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said: 'G-d hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.' "
I Samuel,23,8,"And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. "
I Samuel,23,9,And David knew that Saul devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest: 'Bring hither the ephod.' 
I Samuel,23,10,"Then said David: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, Thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. "
I Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as Thy servant hath heard?' O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, I beseech Thee, tell Thy servant.' And HaShem said: 'He will come down.' "
I Samuel,23,12,Then said David: 'Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul?' And HaShem said: 'They will deliver thee up.' 
I Samuel,23,13,"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbore to go forth. "
I Samuel,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but G-d delivered him not into his hand. "
I Samuel,23,15,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life; and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood. 
I Samuel,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in G-d. "
I Samuel,23,17,"And he said unto him: 'Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.' "
I Samuel,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before HaShem; and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. "
I Samuel,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying: 'Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? "
I Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand.' "
I Samuel,23,21,And Saul said: 'Blessed be ye of HaShem; for ye have had compassion on me. 
I Samuel,23,22,"Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly. "
I Samuel,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye back to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.' "
I Samuel,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of Jeshimon. "
I Samuel,23,25,"And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. "
I Samuel,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. "
I Samuel,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying: 'Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.' "
I Samuel,23,28,"So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth."
I Samuel,24,1,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi. "
I Samuel,24,2,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying: 'Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.' "
I Samuel,24,3,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. "
I Samuel,24,4,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. "
I Samuel,24,5,"And the men of David said unto him: 'Behold the day in which HaShem hath said unto thee: Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.' Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. "
I Samuel,24,6,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. "
I Samuel,24,7,"And he said unto his men: 'The HaShem forbid it me, that I should do this thing unto my lord, HaShem'S anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is HaShem'S anointed.' "
I Samuel,24,8,"So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. "
I Samuel,24,9,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying: 'My lord the king.' And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself. "
I Samuel,24,10,"And David said to Saul: 'Wherefore hearkenest thou to men's words, saying: Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? "
I Samuel,24,11,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that HaShem had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said: I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is HaShem'S anointed. "
I Samuel,24,12,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou layest wait for my soul to take it. "
I Samuel,24,13,"HaShem judge between me and thee, and HaShem avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee. "
I Samuel,24,14,As saith the proverb of the ancients: Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee. 
I Samuel,24,15,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. "
I Samuel,24,16,"HaShem therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.' "
I Samuel,24,17,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said: 'Is this thy voice, my son David?' And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. "
I Samuel,24,18,"And he said to David: `Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil. "
I Samuel,24,19,"And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when HaShem had delivered me up into thy hand, thou didst not kill me. "
I Samuel,24,20,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore HaShem reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day. "
I Samuel,24,21,"And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand. "
I Samuel,24,22,"Swear now therefore unto me by HaShem, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.' "
I Samuel,24,23,And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up unto the stronghold. 
I Samuel,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. "
I Samuel,25,2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. "
I Samuel,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. "
I Samuel,25,4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
I Samuel,25,5,"And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men: 'Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name; "
I Samuel,25,6,"and thus ye shall say: All hail! and peace be both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. "
I Samuel,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. "
I Samuel,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come on a good day; give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.' "
I Samuel,25,9,"And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. "
I Samuel,25,10,"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said: 'Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master; "
I Samuel,25,11,"shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?' "
I Samuel,25,12,"So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. "
I Samuel,25,13,And David said unto his men: 'Gird ye on every man his sword.' And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage. 
I Samuel,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying: 'Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he flew upon them. "
I Samuel,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields; "
I Samuel,25,16,"they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. "
I Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a base fellow, that one cannot speak to him.' "
I Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. "
I Samuel,25,19,"And she said unto her young men: 'Go on before me; behold, I come after you.' But she told not her husband Nabal. "
I Samuel,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down towards her; and she met them.-- "
I Samuel,25,21,"Now David had said: 'Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath returned me evil for good. "
I Samuel,25,22,"G-d do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one male.'-- "
I Samuel,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed down to the ground. "
I Samuel,25,24,"And she fell at his feet, and said: 'Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid. "
I Samuel,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and churlishness is with him; but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. "
I Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing HaShem hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. "
I Samuel,25,27,"And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord. "
I Samuel,25,28,"Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid; for HaShem will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of HaShem; and evil is not found in thee all thy days. "
I Samuel,25,29,"And though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with HaShem thy G-d; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling. "
I Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when HaShem shall have done to my lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel; "
I Samuel,25,31,"that this shall be no stumbling-block unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath found redress for himself. And when HaShem shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.' "
I Samuel,25,32,"And David said to Abigail: 'Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me; "
I Samuel,25,33,"and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for myself with mine own hand. "
I Samuel,25,34,"For in very deed, as HaShem, the G-d of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one male.' "
I Samuel,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him; and he said unto her: 'Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.' "
I Samuel,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. "
I Samuel,25,37,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. "
I Samuel,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days after, that HaShem smote Nabal, so that he died. "
I Samuel,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: 'Blessed be HaShem, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back His servant from evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath HaShem returned upon his own head.' And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife. "
I Samuel,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying: 'David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.' "
I Samuel,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed down with her face to the earth, and said: 'Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.' "
I Samuel,25,42,"And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. "
I Samuel,25,43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives. 
I Samuel,25,44,"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.  "
I Samuel,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying: 'Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?' "
I Samuel,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. "
I Samuel,26,3,"And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. "
I Samuel,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty. "
I Samuel,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the barricade, and the people pitched round about him. "
I Samuel,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying: 'Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?' And Abishai said: 'I will go down with thee.' "
I Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the barricade, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him. "
I Samuel,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David: 'G-d hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.' "
I Samuel,26,9,"And David said to Abishai: 'Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against HaShem'S anointed, and be guiltless?' "
I Samuel,26,10,"And David said: 'As HaShem liveth, nay, but HaShem shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away. "
I Samuel,26,11,"HaShem forbid it me, that I should put forth my hand against HaShem'S anointed; but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water and let us go.' "
I Samuel,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from HaShem was fallen upon them. "
I Samuel,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them. "
I Samuel,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: 'Answerest thou not, Abner?' Then Abner answered and said: 'Who art thou that criest to the king?' "
I Samuel,26,15,And David said to Abner: 'Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. 
I Samuel,26,16,"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As HaShem liveth, ye deserve to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, HaShem'S anointed. And now, see, where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.' "
I Samuel,26,17,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said: 'Is this thy voice, my son David?' And David said: 'It is my voice, my lord, O king.' "
I Samuel,26,18,And he said: 'Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand? 
I Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be HaShem that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before HaShem; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of HaShem, saying: Go, serve other gods. "
I Samuel,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of HaShem; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.' "
I Samuel,26,21,"Then said Saul: 'I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.' "
I Samuel,26,22,And David answered and said: 'Behold the king's spear! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
I Samuel,26,23,"And HaShem will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as HaShem delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against HaShem'S anointed. "
I Samuel,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of HaShem, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.' "
I Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul said to David: 'Blessed be thou, my son David; thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail.' So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. "
I Samuel,27,1,"And David said in his heart: 'I shall now be swept away one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel; so shall I escape out of his hand.' "
I Samuel,27,2,"And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. "
I Samuel,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. "
I Samuel,27,4,And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath; and he sought no more again for him. 
I Samuel,27,5,"And David said unto Achish: 'If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?' "
I Samuel,27,6,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day; wherefore Ziklag belongeth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 
I Samuel,27,7,And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. 
I Samuel,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. "
I Samuel,27,9,"And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel. And he returned, and came to Achish. "
I Samuel,27,10,"And Achish said: 'Whither have ye made a raid to-day?' And David said: 'Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.' "
I Samuel,27,11,"And David left neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying: 'Lest they should tell on us, saying: So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.' "
I Samuel,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying: 'He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.' "
I Samuel,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David: 'Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.' "
I Samuel,28,2,And David said to Achish: 'Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do.' And Achish said to David: 'Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.' 
I Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land. "
I Samuel,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. "
I Samuel,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. "
I Samuel,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of HaShem, HaShem answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. "
I Samuel,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants: 'Seek me a woman that divineth by a ghost, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.' And his servants said to him: 'Behold, there is a woman that divineth by a ghost at En-dor.' "
I Samuel,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said: 'Divine unto me, I pray thee, by a ghost, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.' "
I Samuel,28,9,"And the woman said unto him: 'Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that divine by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?' "
I Samuel,28,10,"And Saul swore to her by HaShem, saying: 'As HaShem liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.' "
I Samuel,28,11,Then said the woman: 'Whom shall I bring up unto thee?' And he said: 'Bring me up Samuel.' 
I Samuel,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying: 'Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.' "
I Samuel,28,13,And the king said unto her: 'Be not afraid; for what seest thou?' And the woman said unto Saul: 'I see a godlike being coming up out of the earth.' 
I Samuel,28,14,"And he said unto her: 'What form is he of?' And she said: 'An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe.' And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself. "
I Samuel,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul: 'Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?' And Saul answered: 'I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and G-d is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.' "
I Samuel,28,16,"And Samuel said: `Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing HaShem is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary? "
I Samuel,28,17,"And HaShem hath wrought for Himself; as He spoke by me; and HaShem hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David. "
I Samuel,28,18,"Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of HaShem, and didst not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath HaShem done this thing unto thee this day. "
I Samuel,28,19,Moreover HaShem will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; HaShem will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.' 
I Samuel,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. "
I Samuel,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore affrighted, and said unto him: 'Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me. "
I Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.' "
I Samuel,28,23,"But he refused, and said: 'I will not eat.' But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. "
I Samuel,28,24,"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she made haste, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof; "
I Samuel,28,25,"and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. "
I Samuel,29,1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel. 
I Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. "
I Samuel,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines: 'What do these Hebrews here?' And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines: 'Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?' "
I Samuel,29,4,"But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him: 'Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us; for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men? "
I Samuel,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?' "
I Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him: 'As HaShem liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; nevertheless the lords favour thee not. "
I Samuel,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.' "
I Samuel,29,8,"And David said unto Achish: 'But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?' "
I Samuel,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David: 'I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of G-d; notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle. "
I Samuel,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.' "
I Samuel,29,11,"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. "
I Samuel,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; "
I Samuel,30,2,"and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great; they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way. "
I Samuel,30,3,"And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. "
I Samuel,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. "
I Samuel,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. "
I Samuel,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in HaShem his G-d. "
I Samuel,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech: 'I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.' And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. "
I Samuel,30,8,"And David inquired of HaShem, saying: 'Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them?' And He answered him: 'Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.' "
I Samuel,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. "
I Samuel,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. "
I Samuel,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink; "
I Samuel,30,12,"and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came back to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. "
I Samuel,30,13,"And David said unto him: 'To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?' And he said: 'I am a young Egyptian, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick. "
I Samuel,30,14,"We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.' "
I Samuel,30,15,"And David said to him: 'Wilt thou bring me down to this troop?' And he said: 'Swear unto me by G-d, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.' "
I Samuel,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. "
I Samuel,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled. "
I Samuel,30,18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. 
I Samuel,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them; David brought back all. "
I Samuel,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said: 'This is David's spoil.' "
I Samuel,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. "
I Samuel,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said: 'Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.' "
I Samuel,30,23,"Then said David: `Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which HaShem hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand. "
I Samuel,30,24,"And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike.' "
I Samuel,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. "
I Samuel,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying: 'Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of HaShem'; "
I Samuel,30,27,"to them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir; "
I Samuel,30,28,"and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa; "
I Samuel,30,29,"and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites; "
I Samuel,30,30,"and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach; "
I Samuel,30,31,"and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. "
I Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. "
I Samuel,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. "
I Samuel,31,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, an the archers overtook him; and he was in great anguish by reason of the archers. "
I Samuel,31,4,"Then said Saul to his armour-bearer: 'Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me.' But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. "
I Samuel,31,5,"And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him. "
I Samuel,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together. "
I Samuel,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. "
I Samuel,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. "
I Samuel,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people. "
I Samuel,31,10,And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
I Samuel,31,11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul, "
I Samuel,31,12,"all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. "
I Samuel,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.  "
II Samuel,1,1,"AND IT came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; "
II Samuel,1,2,"it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself. "
II Samuel,1,3,And David said unto him: 'From whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: 'Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.' 
II Samuel,1,4,"And David said unto him: 'How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: 'The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.' "
II Samuel,1,5,And David said unto the young man that told him: 'How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?' 
II Samuel,1,6,"And the young man that told him said: 'As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him. "
II Samuel,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I. "
II Samuel,1,8,And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite. 
II Samuel,1,9,"And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me. "
II Samuel,1,10,"So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.' "
II Samuel,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him. "
II Samuel,1,12,"And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of HaShem, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. "
II Samuel,1,13,And David said unto the young man that told him: 'Whence art thou?' And he answered: 'I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.' 
II Samuel,1,14,And David said unto him: 'How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy HaShem'S anointed?' 
II Samuel,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said: 'Go near, and fall upon him.' And he smote him that he died. "
II Samuel,1,16,"And David said unto him: 'Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain HaShem'S anointed.' "
II Samuel,1,17,"And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, "
II Samuel,1,18,"and said--To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar: "
II Samuel,1,19,"Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen! "
II Samuel,1,20,"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. "
II Samuel,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil. "
II Samuel,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. "
II Samuel,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant in their lives, even in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. "
II Samuel,1,24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. "
II Samuel,1,25,How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan upon thy high places is slain! 
II Samuel,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; wonderful was thy love to me, passing the love of women. "
II Samuel,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! "
II Samuel,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of HaShem, saying: 'Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?' And HaShem said unto him: 'Go up.' And David said: 'Whither shall I go up?' And He said: 'Unto Hebron.' "
II Samuel,2,2,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. "
II Samuel,2,3,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. "
II Samuel,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and they there anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying: 'The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.' "
II Samuel,2,5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them: 'Blessed be ye of HaShem, that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. "
II Samuel,2,6,"And now HaShem show kindness and truth unto you; and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. "
II Samuel,2,7,"Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.' "
II Samuel,2,8,"Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; "
II Samuel,2,9,"and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. "
II Samuel,2,10,"Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. "
II Samuel,2,11,And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
II Samuel,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. "
II Samuel,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out; and they met together by the pool of Gibeon, and sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. "
II Samuel,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab: 'Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us.' And Joab said: 'Let them arise.' "
II Samuel,2,15,"Then they arose and passed over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. "
II Samuel,2,16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together; wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. "
II Samuel,2,17,"And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. "
II Samuel,2,18,"And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as one of the roes that are in the field. "
II Samuel,2,19,And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
II Samuel,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said: 'Is it thou, Asahel?' And he answered: 'It is I.' "
II Samuel,2,21,"And Abner said to him: 'Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.' But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. "
II Samuel,2,22,And Abner said again to Asahel: 'Turn thee aside from following me; wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?' 
II Samuel,2,23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the groin, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. "
II Samuel,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. "
II Samuel,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. "
II Samuel,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said: 'Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?' "
II Samuel,2,27,"And Joab said: 'As G-d liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then only after the morning the people had gone away, every one from following his brother.' "
II Samuel,2,28,"So Joab blew the horn, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. "
II Samuel,2,29,"And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. "
II Samuel,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. "
II Samuel,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, even of Abner's men--three hundred and threescore men died. "
II Samuel,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.  "
II Samuel,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. "
II Samuel,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron; and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; "
II Samuel,3,3,"and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; "
II Samuel,3,4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; "
II Samuel,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. "
II Samuel,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner showed himself strong in the house of Saul. "
II Samuel,3,7,"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner: 'Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?' "
II Samuel,3,8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said: 'Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. "
II Samuel,3,9,"G-d do so to Abner, and more also, if, as HaShem hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; "
II Samuel,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.' "
II Samuel,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him. "
II Samuel,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David straightway, saying: 'Whose is the land?' saying also: 'Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring over all Israel unto thee.' "
II Samuel,3,13,"And he said: 'Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee, that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.' "
II Samuel,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying: 'Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.' "
II Samuel,3,15,"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. "
II Samuel,3,16,"And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him: 'Go, return'; and he returned. "
II Samuel,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying: 'In times past ye sought for David to be king over you; "
II Samuel,3,18,"now then do it; for HaShem hath spoken of David, saying: By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.' "
II Samuel,3,19,"And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. "
II Samuel,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. "
II Samuel,3,21,"And Abner said unto David: 'I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth.' And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. "
II Samuel,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. "
II Samuel,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying: 'Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.' "
II Samuel,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said: 'What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? "
II Samuel,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.' "
II Samuel,3,26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor-sirah; but David knew it not. "
II Samuel,3,27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the groin, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. "
II Samuel,3,28,"And afterward when David heard it, he said: 'I and my kingdom are guiltless before HaShem for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner; "
II Samuel,3,29,"let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.' "
II Samuel,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. "
II Samuel,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: 'Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and wail before Abner.' And king David followed the bier. "
II Samuel,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. "
II Samuel,3,33,"And the king lamented for Abner, and said: Should Abner die as a churl dieth? "
II Samuel,3,34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters; as a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him. "
II Samuel,3,35,"And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying: 'G-d do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.' "
II Samuel,3,36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; whatsoever the king did, pleased all the people. "
II Samuel,3,37,So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
II Samuel,3,38,And the king said unto his servants: 'Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 
II Samuel,3,39,"And I am this day weak, and just anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; HaShem reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.' "
II Samuel,4,1,"And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were affrighted. "
II Samuel,4,2,"And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin; "
II Samuel,4,3,"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day. "
II Samuel,4,4,"Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. "
II Samuel,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon. "
II Samuel,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. "
II Samuel,4,7,"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. "
II Samuel,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king: 'Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and HaShem hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.' "
II Samuel,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them: 'As HaShem liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, "
II Samuel,4,10,"when one told me, saying: Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, instead of giving a reward for his tidings. "
II Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?' "
II Samuel,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron. "
II Samuel,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: 'Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. "
II Samuel,5,2,"In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and HaShem said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.' "
II Samuel,5,3,So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before HaShem; and they anointed David king over Israel. 
II Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. "
II Samuel,5,5,In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. 
II Samuel,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: 'Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither'; thinking: 'David cannot come in hither.' "
II Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 
II Samuel,5,8,"And David said on that day: 'Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and taketh away the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul--.' Wherefore they say: 'There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.' "
II Samuel,5,9,"And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. "
II Samuel,5,10,"And David waxed greater and greater; for HaShem, the G-d of hosts, was with him. "
II Samuel,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. "
II Samuel,5,12,"And David perceived that HaShem had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake. "
II Samuel,5,13,"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. "
II Samuel,5,14,"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon; "
II Samuel,5,15,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia; "
II Samuel,5,16,"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet. "
II Samuel,5,17,"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. "
II Samuel,5,18,Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
II Samuel,5,19,"And David inquired of HaShem, saying: 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And HaShem said unto David: 'Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.' "
II Samuel,5,20,"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: 'The HaShem hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.' Therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim."
II Samuel,5,21,"And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away. "
II Samuel,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. "
II Samuel,5,23,"And when David inquired of HaShem, He said: 'Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. "
II Samuel,5,24,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is HaShem gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.' "
II Samuel,5,25,"And David did so, as HaShem commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer. "
II Samuel,6,1,"And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. "
II Samuel,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of G-d, whereupon is called the Name, even the name of HaShem of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim. "
II Samuel,6,3,"And they set the ark of G-d upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. "
II Samuel,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of G-d, and Ahio went before the ark. "
II Samuel,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before HaShem with all manner of instruments made of cypress-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals. "
II Samuel,6,6,"And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of G-d, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled. "
II Samuel,6,7,And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Uzzah; and G-d smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of G-d. 
II Samuel,6,8,"And David was displeased, because HaShem had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place was called Perez-uzzah, unto this day. "
II Samuel,6,9,And David was afraid of HaShem that day; and he said: 'How shall the ark of HaShem come unto me?' 
II Samuel,6,10,So David would not remove the ark of HaShem unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
II Samuel,6,11,"And the ark of HaShem remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and HaShem blessed Obed-edom, and all his house. "
II Samuel,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying: 'The HaShem hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of G-d.' And David went and brought up the ark of G-d from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy. "
II Samuel,6,13,"And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of HaShem had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. "
II Samuel,6,14,And David danced before HaShem with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. 
II Samuel,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of HaShem with shouting, and with the sound of the horn. "
II Samuel,6,16,"And it was so, as the ark of HaShem came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before HaShem; and she despised him in her heart. "
II Samuel,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of HaShem, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before HaShem. "
II Samuel,6,18,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of HaShem of hosts. "
II Samuel,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake. So all the people departed every one to his house. "
II Samuel,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said: 'How did the king of Israel get him honour to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!' "
II Samuel,6,21,"And David said unto Michal: 'Before HaShem, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of HaShem, over Israel, before HaShem will I make merry. "
II Samuel,6,22,"And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of, with them will I get me honour.' "
II Samuel,6,23,And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.  
II Samuel,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and HaShem had given him rest from all his enemies round about, "
II Samuel,7,2,"that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: 'See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of G-d dwelleth within curtains.' "
II Samuel,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king: 'Go, do all that is in thy heart; for HaShem is with thee.' "
II Samuel,7,4,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of HaShem came unto Nathan, saying: "
II Samuel,7,5,'Go and tell My servant David: Thus saith HaShem: Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in? 
II Samuel,7,6,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. "
II Samuel,7,7,"In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? "
II Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people, over Israel. "
II Samuel,7,9,"And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. "
II Samuel,7,10,"And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, "
II Samuel,7,11,even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover HaShem telleth thee that HaShem will make thee a house. 
II Samuel,7,12,"When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom. "
II Samuel,7,13,"He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. "
II Samuel,7,14,"I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; "
II Samuel,7,15,"but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. "
II Samuel,7,16,And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.' 
II Samuel,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. "
II Samuel,7,18,"Then David the king went in, and sat before HaShem; and he said: 'Who am I, O L-rd GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? "
II Samuel,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in Thine eyes, O L-rd GOD; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant's house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of great men, O L-rd GOD. "
II Samuel,7,20,"And what can David say more unto Thee? for Thou knowest Thy servant, O L-rd GOD. "
II Samuel,7,21,"For Thy word's sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it. "
II Samuel,7,22,"Therefore Thou art great, O HaShem G-d; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any G-d beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. "
II Samuel,7,23,"And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom G-d went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, in driving out from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods? "
II Samuel,7,24,"And Thou didst establish to Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever; and Thou, HaShem, becamest their G-d. "
II Samuel,7,25,"And now, O HaShem G-d, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm Thou it for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. "
II Samuel,7,26,"And let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: HaShem of hosts is G-d over Israel; and the house of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee. "
II Samuel,7,27,"For Thou, O HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, hast revealed to Thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto Thee. "
II Samuel,7,28,"And now, O L-rd GOD, Thou alone art G-d, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; "
II Samuel,7,29,"now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O L-rd GOD, hast spoken it; and through Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever.' "
II Samuel,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines. "
II Samuel,8,2,"And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. "
II Samuel,8,3,"David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. "
II Samuel,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. "
II Samuel,8,5,"And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men. "
II Samuel,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And HaShem gave victory to David whithersoever he went. "
II Samuel,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,8,8,"And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. "
II Samuel,8,9,"And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, "
II Samuel,8,10,"then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him--because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi--and he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. "
II Samuel,8,11,"These also did king David dedicate unto HaShem, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued: "
II Samuel,8,12,"of Aram, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. "
II Samuel,8,13,"And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. "
II Samuel,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And HaShem gave victory to David whithersoever he went. "
II Samuel,8,15,And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. 
II Samuel,8,16,And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
II Samuel,8,17,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; "
II Samuel,8,18,and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers. 
II Samuel,9,1,"And David said: 'Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?' "
II Samuel,9,2,"Now there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him: 'Art thou Ziba?' And he said: 'Thy servant is he.' "
II Samuel,9,3,"And the king said: 'Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of G-d unto him?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame on his feet.' "
II Samuel,9,4,"And the king said unto him: 'Where is he?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.' "
II Samuel,9,5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. "
II Samuel,9,6,"And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself. And David said: 'Mephibosheth!' And he answered: 'Behold thy servant!' "
II Samuel,9,7,"And David said unto him: 'Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.' "
II Samuel,9,8,"And he bowed down, and said: 'What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?' "
II Samuel,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him: 'All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son. "
II Samuel,9,10,"And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread continually at my table.' Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. "
II Samuel,9,11,"Then said Ziba unto the king: 'According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the king's sons.' "
II Samuel,9,12,"Now Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. "
II Samuel,9,13,But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king's table; and he was lame on both his feet. 
II Samuel,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. "
II Samuel,10,2,"And David said: 'I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me.' So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. "
II Samuel,10,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord: 'Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?' "
II Samuel,10,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. "
II Samuel,10,5,"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said: 'Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.' "
II Samuel,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob, and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. "
II Samuel,10,7,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. "
II Samuel,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate; and the Arameans of Zobah, and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. "
II Samuel,10,9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans; "
II Samuel,10,10,"and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. "
II Samuel,10,11,"And he said: 'If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. "
II Samuel,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our G-d; and HaShem do that which seemeth Him good.' "
II Samuel,10,13,So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Arameans; and they fled before him. 
II Samuel,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,10,15,"And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together. "
II Samuel,10,16,"And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Arameans that were beyond the River; and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer at their head. "
II Samuel,10,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. "
II Samuel,10,18,"And the Arameans fled before Israel; and David slew of the Arameans seven hundred drivers of chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there. "
II Samuel,10,19,"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the children of Ammon any more.  "
II Samuel,11,1,"And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,11,2,"And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. "
II Samuel,11,3,"And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said: 'Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?' "
II Samuel,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house. "
II Samuel,11,5,"And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said: 'I am with child.' "
II Samuel,11,6,"And David sent to Joab ,saying: 'Send me Uriah the Hittite.' And Joab sent Uriah to David. "
II Samuel,11,7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. "
II Samuel,11,8,"And David said to Uriah: 'Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.' And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king. "
II Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. "
II Samuel,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying: 'Uriah went not down unto his house', David said unto Uriah: 'Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?' "
II Samuel,11,11,"And Uriah said unto David: 'The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.' "
II Samuel,11,12,"And David said to Uriah: 'Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart.' So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. "
II Samuel,11,13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk; and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. "
II Samuel,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. "
II Samuel,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying: 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.' "
II Samuel,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. "
II Samuel,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. "
II Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 
II Samuel,11,19,"and he charged the messenger, saying: 'When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, "
II Samuel,11,20,"it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee: Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? "
II Samuel,11,21,"who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say: Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.' "
II Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for. "
II Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David: 'The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate. "
II Samuel,11,24,"And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.' "
II Samuel,11,25,"Then David said unto the messenger: 'Thus shalt thou say unto Joab: Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth in one manner or another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it; and encourage thou him.' "
II Samuel,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. "
II Samuel,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased HaShem. "
II Samuel,12,1,"And HaShem sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him: 'There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor. "
II Samuel,12,2,The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; 
II Samuel,12,3,"but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared; and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. "
II Samuel,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.' "
II Samuel,12,5,"And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan: 'As HaShem liveth, the man that hath done this deserveth to die; "
II Samuel,12,6,"and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.' "
II Samuel,12,7,"And Nathan said to David: 'Thou art the man. Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; "
II Samuel,12,8,"and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that were too little, then would I add unto thee so much more. "
II Samuel,12,9,"Wherefore hast thou despised the word of HaShem, to do that which is evil in My sight? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten with the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to be thy wife, and him thou hast slain with the sword of the children of Ammon. "
II Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised Me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. "
II Samuel,12,11,"Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. "
II Samuel,12,12,"For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.' "
II Samuel,12,13,And David said unto Nathan: 'I have sinned against HaShem.' And Nathan said unto David: 'The HaShem also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 
II Samuel,12,14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast greatly blasphemed the enemies of HaShem, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.' "
II Samuel,12,15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And HaShem struck the child that Uriah's wife bore unto David, and it was very sick. "
II Samuel,12,16,"David therefore besought G-d for the child; and David fasted, and as often as he went in, he lay all night upon the earth. "
II Samuel,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. "
II Samuel,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said: 'Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice; how then shall we tell him that the child is dead, so that he do himself some harm?' "
II Samuel,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants: 'Is the child dead?' And they said: 'He is dead.' "
II Samuel,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of HaShem, and worshipped; then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. "
II Samuel,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him: 'What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.' "
II Samuel,12,22,"And he said: 'While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said: Who knoweth whether HaShem will not be gracious to me, that the child may live? "
II Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.' "
II Samuel,12,24,"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon. And HaShem loved him; "
II Samuel,12,25,"and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah, for HaShem'S sake. "
II Samuel,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. "
II Samuel,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said: 'I have fought against Rabbah, yea, I have taken the city of waters. "
II Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.' "
II Samuel,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. "
II Samuel,12,30,"And he took the crown of Malcam from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. "
II Samuel,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.  "
II Samuel,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. "
II Samuel,13,2,And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her. 
II Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. "
II Samuel,13,4,"And he said unto him: 'Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?' And Amnon said unto him: 'I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.' "
II Samuel,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him: 'Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.' "
II Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: 'Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.' "
II Samuel,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: 'Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.' "
II Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. "
II Samuel,13,9,"And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: 'Have out all men from me.' And they went out every man from him. "
II Samuel,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar: 'Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.' And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. "
II Samuel,13,11,"And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: 'Come lie with me, my sister.' "
II Samuel,13,12,"And she answered him: 'Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed. "
II Samuel,13,13,"And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.' "
II Samuel,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her. "
II Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: 'Arise, be gone.' "
II Samuel,13,16,"And she said unto him: 'Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.' But he would not hearken unto her. "
II Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: 'Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.'-- "
II Samuel,13,18,"Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. --And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. "
II Samuel,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went. "
II Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her: 'Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother, Absalom's house. "
II Samuel,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. "
II Samuel,13,22,"And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. "
II Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons. "
II Samuel,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said: 'Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.' "
II Samuel,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom: 'Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.' And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. "
II Samuel,13,26,"Then said Absalom: 'If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.' And the king said unto him: 'Why should he go with thee?' "
II Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. "
II Samuel,13,28,"And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: 'Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.' "
II Samuel,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled. "
II Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: 'Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.' "
II Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. "
II Samuel,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said: 'Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. "
II Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.' "
II Samuel,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a roundabout way by the hill-side. "
II Samuel,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king: 'Behold, the king's sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.' "
II Samuel,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. "
II Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. "
II Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. "
II Samuel,13,39,"And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.  "
II Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. 
II Samuel,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her: 'I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead; "
II Samuel,14,3,"and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.' So Joab put the words in her mouth. "
II Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, and said: 'Help, O king.' "
II Samuel,14,5,"And the king said unto her: 'What aileth thee?' And she answered: 'Of a truth I am a widow, my husband being dead. "
II Samuel,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him. "
II Samuel,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.' "
II Samuel,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman: 'Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.' "
II Samuel,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king: 'My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.' "
II Samuel,14,10,"And the king said: 'Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.' "
II Samuel,14,11,"Then said she: 'I pray thee, let the king remember HaShem thy G-d, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.' And he said: 'As HaShem liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.' "
II Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said: 'Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.' And he said: 'Say on.' "
II Samuel,14,13,"And the woman said: 'Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of G-d? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. "
II Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth G-d respect any person; but let him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him. "
II Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid said: I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. "
II Samuel,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of G-d. "
II Samuel,14,17,"Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of G-d, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and HaShem thy G-d be with thee.' "
II Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman: 'Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee.' And the woman said: 'Let my lord the king now speak.' "
II Samuel,14,19,"And the king said: 'Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?' And the woman answered and said: 'As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; "
II Samuel,14,20,"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of G-d, to know all things that are in the earth.' "
II Samuel,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab: 'Behold now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.' "
II Samuel,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said: 'To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of thy servant.' "
II Samuel,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,14,24,"And the king said: 'Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face.' So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. "
II Samuel,14,25,Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
II Samuel,14,26,"And when he polled his head--now it was at every year's end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it--he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight. "
II Samuel,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance. "
II Samuel,14,28,And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face. 
II Samuel,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. "
II Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants: 'See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.' And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. "
II Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: 'Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?' "
II Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab: 'Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still; now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.' "
II Samuel,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom. "
II Samuel,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. "
II Samuel,15,2,"And Absalom used to rise up early, and stand beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said: 'Of what city art thou?' And he said: 'Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.' "
II Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him: 'See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.' "
II Samuel,15,4,"Absalom said moreover: 'Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!' "
II Samuel,15,5,"And it was so, that when any man came nigh to prostrate himself before him, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. "
II Samuel,15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
II Samuel,15,7,"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king: 'I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto HaShem, in Hebron. "
II Samuel,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Aram, saying: If HaShem shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve HaShem.' "
II Samuel,15,9,"And the king said unto him: 'Go in peace.' So he arose, and went to Hebron. "
II Samuel,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: 'As soon as ye hear the sound of the horn, then ye shall say: Absalom is king in Hebron.' "
II Samuel,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not any thing. "
II Samuel,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. "
II Samuel,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying: 'The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.' "
II Samuel,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem: 'Arise, and let us flee; or else none of us shall escape from Absalom; make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.' "
II Samuel,15,15,"And the king's servants said unto the king: 'Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.' "
II Samuel,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house. "
II Samuel,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak. "
II Samuel,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. "
II Samuel,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite: 'Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile from thine own place. "
II Samuel,15,20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee in kindness and truth.' "
II Samuel,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said: 'As HaShem liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.' "
II Samuel,15,22,"And David said to Ittai: 'Go and pass over.' And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. "
II Samuel,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed over; and as the king passed over the brook Kidron, all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. "
II Samuel,15,24,"And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of G-d; and they set down the ark of G-d--but Abiathar went up--until all the people had done passing out of the city. "
II Samuel,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok: 'Carry back the ark of G-d into the city; if I shall find favour in the eyes of HaShem, He will bring me back, and show me both it, and His habitation; "
II Samuel,15,26,"but if He say thus: I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him.' "
II Samuel,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest: 'Seest thou? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. "
II Samuel,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the plains of the wilderness, until there come word from you to announce unto me.' "
II Samuel,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of G-d back to Jerusalem; and they abode there. 
II Samuel,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot; and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. "
II Samuel,15,31,"And one told David, saying: 'Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.' And David said: 'O HaShem, I pray Thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.' "
II Samuel,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the ascent, where G-d was wont to be worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head. "
II Samuel,15,33,"And David said unto him: 'If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto Me; "
II Samuel,15,34,"but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom: I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. "
II Samuel,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. "
II Samuel,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear.' "
II Samuel,15,37,So Hushai David's friend came into the city; and Absalom was at the point of coming into Jerusalem.  
II Samuel,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. "
II Samuel,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba: 'What meanest thou by these?' And Ziba said: 'The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.' "
II Samuel,16,3,"And the king said: 'And where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.' "
II Samuel,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba: 'Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.' And Ziba said: 'I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.' "
II Samuel,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. "
II Samuel,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. "
II Samuel,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; "
II Samuel,16,8,"HaShem hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and HaShem hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.' "
II Samuel,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' "
II Samuel,16,10,"And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because HaShem hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?' "
II Samuel,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for HaShem hath bidden him. "
II Samuel,16,12,"It may be that HaShem will look on mine eye, and that HaShem will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.' "
II Samuel,16,13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. "
II Samuel,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. "
II Samuel,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. "
II Samuel,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Long live the king, long live the king.' "
II Samuel,16,17,And Absalom said to Hushai: 'Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?' 
II Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Nay; but whom HaShem, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. "
II Samuel,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.' "
II Samuel,16,20,Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: 'Give your counsel what we shall do.' 
II Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.' "
II Samuel,16,22,So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.-- 
II Samuel,16,23,"Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of G-d; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. "
II Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night; "
II Samuel,17,2,"and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only; "
II Samuel,17,3,"and I will bring back all the people unto thee; when all shall have returned, save the man whom thou seekest, all the people will be in peace.' "
II Samuel,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. "
II Samuel,17,5,"Then said Absalom: 'Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.' "
II Samuel,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying: 'Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.' "
II Samuel,17,7,And Hushai said unto Absalom: 'The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.' 
II Samuel,17,8,"Hushai said moreover: 'Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. "
II Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some place; and it will come to pass, when they fall upon them at the first, and whosoever heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom; "
II Samuel,17,10,"then even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men. "
II Samuel,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. "
II Samuel,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one. "
II Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if he withdraw himself into a city, then shall all Israel bring up ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one small stone found there.' "
II Samuel,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said: 'The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.' --For HaShem had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that HaShem might bring evil upon Absalom. "
II Samuel,17,15,Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests: 'Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 
II Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but in any wise pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.' "
II Samuel,17,17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David; for they might not be seen to come into the city. 
II Samuel,17,18,"But a lad saw them, and told Absalom; and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither. "
II Samuel,17,19,"And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed groats thereon; and nothing was known. "
II Samuel,17,20,"And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said: 'Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' And the woman said unto them: 'They are gone over the brook of water.' And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David: 'Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.' "
II Samuel,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan. "
II Samuel,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. "
II Samuel,17,24,"When David was come to Mahanaim, Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. "
II Samuel,17,25,"And Absalom had set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Jesraelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. "
II Samuel,17,26,And Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
II Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, "
II Samuel,17,28,"brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, "
II Samuel,17,29,"and honey, and curd, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said: 'The people is hungry, and faint, and thirsty, in the wilderness.' "
II Samuel,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. "
II Samuel,18,2,"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people: 'I will surely go forth with you myself also.' "
II Samuel,18,3,"But the people said: 'Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city.' "
II Samuel,18,4,"And the king said unto them: 'What seemeth you best I will do.' And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. "
II Samuel,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying: 'Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.' And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. "
II Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. 
II Samuel,18,7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. "
II Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. 
II Samuel,18,9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on. "
II Samuel,18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said: 'Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.' "
II Samuel,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him: 'And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have had to give thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.' "
II Samuel,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab: 'Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying: Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. "
II Samuel,18,13,Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against mine own life--and there is no matter hid from the king--then thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof.' 
II Samuel,18,14,"Then said Joab: 'I may not tarry thus with thee.' And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth. "
II Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men that bore Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. "
II Samuel,18,16,"And Joab blew the horn, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people. "
II Samuel,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones; and all Israel fled every one to his tent.-- "
II Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said: 'I have no son to keep my name in remembrance'; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument unto this day. "
II Samuel,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok: 'Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that HaShem hath avenged him of his enemies.' "
II Samuel,18,20,"And Joab said unto him: 'Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, forasmuch as the king's son is dead.' "
II Samuel,18,21,"Then said Joab to the Cushite: 'Go tell the king what thou hast seen.' And the Cushite bowed down unto Joab, and ran. "
II Samuel,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab: 'But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite.' And Joab said: 'Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?' "
II Samuel,18,23,"'But come what may, said he, I will run.' And he said unto him: 'Run.' Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and overran the Cushite. "
II Samuel,18,24,"Now David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. "
II Samuel,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said: 'If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.' And he came apace, and drew near. "
II Samuel,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said: 'Behold another man running alone.' And the king said: 'He also bringeth tidings.' "
II Samuel,18,27,"And the watchman said: 'I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.' And the king said: 'He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.' "
II Samuel,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king: 'All is well.' And he bowed down before the king with his face to the earth, and said: 'Blessed be HaShem thy G-d, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.' "
II Samuel,18,29,"And the king said: 'Is it well with the young man Absalom?' And Ahimaaz answered: 'When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.' "
II Samuel,18,30,"And the king said: 'Turn aside, and stand here.' And he turned aside, and stood still. "
II Samuel,18,31,"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said: 'Tidings for my lord the king; for HaShem hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.' "
II Samuel,18,32,"And the king said unto the Cushite: 'Is it well with the young man Absalom?' And the Cushite answered: 'The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.' "
II Samuel,19,1,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said: 'O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!' "
II Samuel,19,2,"And it was told Joab: 'Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.' "
II Samuel,19,3,And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day: 'The king grieveth for his son.' 
II Samuel,19,4,"And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. "
II Samuel,19,5,"And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice: 'O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!' "
II Samuel,19,6,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said: 'Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; "
II Samuel,19,7,"in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee; for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. "
II Samuel,19,8,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants; for I swear by HaShem, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.' "
II Samuel,19,9,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying: 'Behold, the king doth sit in the gate'; and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. "
II Samuel,19,10,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: 'The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. "
II Samuel,19,11,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now, therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?' "
II Samuel,19,12,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying: 'Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying: Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? --For the speech of all Israel was come to the king, to bring him to his house.-- "
II Samuel,19,13,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; wherefore then should ye be the last to bring back the king? "
II Samuel,19,14,"And say ye to Amasa: Art thou not my bone and my flesh? G-d do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.' "
II Samuel,19,15,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king: 'Return thou, and all thy servants.' "
II Samuel,19,16,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. "
II Samuel,19,17,"And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, made haste and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. "
II Samuel,19,18,"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him. And they rushed into the Jordan before the king. "
II Samuel,19,19,"And the ferryboat passed to and fro to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he would go over the Jordan. "
II Samuel,19,20,"And he said unto the king: 'Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did iniquitously the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. "
II Samuel,19,21,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.' "
II Samuel,19,22,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said: 'Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed HaShem'S anointed?' "
II Samuel,19,23,"And David said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?' "
II Samuel,19,24,And the king said unto Shimei: 'Thou shalt not die.' And the king swore unto him. 
II Samuel,19,25,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. "
II Samuel,19,26,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him: 'Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?' "
II Samuel,19,27,"And he answered: 'My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said: I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame. "
II Samuel,19,28,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of G-d; do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 
II Samuel,19,29,For all my father's house were deserving of death at the hand of my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet? or why should I cry any more unto the king?' 
II Samuel,19,30,And the king said unto him: 'Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say: Thou and Ziba divide the land.' 
II Samuel,19,31,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king: 'Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.' "
II Samuel,19,32,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he passed on to Jordan with the king, to bring him on the way over the Jordan. "
II Samuel,19,33,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old; and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. "
II Samuel,19,34,"And the king said unto Barzillai: 'Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.' "
II Samuel,19,35,"And Barzillai said unto the king: 'How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? "
II Samuel,19,36,I am this day fourscore years old; can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
II Samuel,19,37,Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
II Samuel,19,38,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.' "
II Samuel,19,39,"And the king answered: 'Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.' "
II Samuel,19,40,"And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. "
II Samuel,19,41,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him; and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. "
II Samuel,19,42,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king: 'Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?' "
II Samuel,19,43,And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: 'Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath any gift been given us?' 
II Samuel,19,44,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said: 'We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?' And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.  "
II Samuel,20,1,"Now there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the horn, and said: 'We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel.' "
II Samuel,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah did cleave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem. "
II Samuel,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood, with their husband alive. "
II Samuel,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa: 'Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.' "
II Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. 
II Samuel,20,6,"And David said to Abishai: 'Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom; take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.' "
II Samuel,20,7,"And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. "
II Samuel,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. "
II Samuel,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa: 'Is it well with thee, my brother?' And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. "
II Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand; so he smote him therewith in the groin, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. "
II Samuel,20,11,"And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said: 'He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David let him follow Joab.' "
II Samuel,20,12,"And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. "
II Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. "
II Samuel,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together, and went in also after him. "
II Samuel,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood in the moat; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. "
II Samuel,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city: 'Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab: Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.' "
II Samuel,20,17,And he came near unto her; and the woman said: 'Art thou Joab?' And he answered: 'I am.' Then she said unto him: 'Hear the words of thy handmaid.' And he answered: 'I do hear.' 
II Samuel,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying: 'They were wont to speak in old time, saying: They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; and so they ended the matter. "
II Samuel,20,19,We are of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel; seekest thou to destroy a city and a mother in Israel? why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of HaShem?' 
II Samuel,20,20,"And Joab answered and said: 'Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. "
II Samuel,20,21,"The matter is not so; but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.' And the woman said unto Joab: 'Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.' "
II Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the horn, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. "
II Samuel,20,23,Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; 
II Samuel,20,24,and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
II Samuel,20,25,and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
II Samuel,20,26,and Ira also the Jairite was chief minister unto David. 
II Samuel,21,1,"And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of HaShem. And HaShem said: 'It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.' "
II Samuel,21,2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them--now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them; and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah-- "
II Samuel,21,3,"and David said unto the Gibeonites: 'What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of HaShem?' "
II Samuel,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said unto him: 'It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.' And he said: 'What say ye that I should do for you?' "
II Samuel,21,5,"And they said unto the king: 'The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, so that we have been destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, "
II Samuel,21,6,"let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto HaShem in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of HaShem.' And the king said: 'I will deliver them.' "
II Samuel,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of HaShem'S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. "
II Samuel,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; "
II Samuel,21,9,"and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before HaShem, and they fell all seven together; and they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest. "
II Samuel,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. "
II Samuel,21,11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. "
II Samuel,21,12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa; "
II Samuel,21,13,and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
II Samuel,21,14,"And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that G-d was entreated for the land. "
II Samuel,21,15,"And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines; and David waxed faint. "
II Samuel,21,16,"And Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with new armour, thought to have slain David. "
II Samuel,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying: 'Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.' "
II Samuel,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. "
II Samuel,21,19,"And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. "
II Samuel,21,20,"And there was again war at Gath, where was a champion, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. "
II Samuel,21,21,"And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. "
II Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. "
II Samuel,22,1,"And David spoke unto HaShem the words of this song in the day that HaShem delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul; "
II Samuel,22,2,"and he said: HaShem is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; "
II Samuel,22,3,"The G-d who is my rock, in Him I take refuge; my shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; my saviour, Thou savest me from violence. "
II Samuel,22,4,"Praised, I cry, is HaShem, and I am saved from mine enemies. "
II Samuel,22,5,For the waves of Death compassed me. The floods of Belial assailed me. 
II Samuel,22,6,The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me. 
II Samuel,22,7,"In my distress I called upon HaShem, yea, I called unto my G-d; and out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry did enter into His ears. "
II Samuel,22,8,"Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations of heaven did tremble; they were shaken, because He was wroth. "
II Samuel,22,9,"Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; coals flamed forth from Him. "
II Samuel,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet. "
II Samuel,22,11,"And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He was seen upon the wings of the wind. "
II Samuel,22,12,"And He made darkness pavilions round about Him, gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies. "
II Samuel,22,13,At the brightness before Him coals of fire flamed forth. 
II Samuel,22,14,"HaShem thundered from heaven, and the Most High gave forth His voice. "
II Samuel,22,15,"And He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. "
II Samuel,22,16,"And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of HaShem, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils. "
II Samuel,22,17,"He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters; "
II Samuel,22,18,"He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me. "
II Samuel,22,19,They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but HaShem was a stay unto me. 
II Samuel,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me. "
II Samuel,22,21,HaShem rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me. 
II Samuel,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of HaShem, and have not wickedly departed from my G-d. "
II Samuel,22,23,"For all His ordinances were before me; and as for His statutes, I did not depart from them. "
II Samuel,22,24,"And I was single-hearted toward Him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. "
II Samuel,22,25,"Therefore hath HaShem recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His eyes. "
II Samuel,22,26,"With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, with the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright, "
II Samuel,22,27,With the pure Thou dost show myself pure; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle. 
II Samuel,22,28,"And the afflicted people Thou dost save; but Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest humble them. "
II Samuel,22,29,"For Thou art my lamp, O HaShem; and HaShem doth lighten my darkness. "
II Samuel,22,30,For by Thee I run upon a troop; by my G-d do I scale a wall. 
II Samuel,22,31,"As for G-d, His way is perfect; the word of HaShem is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him. "
II Samuel,22,32,"For who is G-d, save HaShem? and who is a Rock, save our G-d? "
II Samuel,22,33,"The G-d who is my strong fortress, and who letteth my way go forth straight; "
II Samuel,22,34,"Who maketh my feet like hinds', and setteth me upon my high places; "
II Samuel,22,35,"Who traineth my hands for war, so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. "
II Samuel,22,36,Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation; and Thy condescension hath made me great. 
II Samuel,22,37,"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped. "
II Samuel,22,38,"I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed. "
II Samuel,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise; yea, they are fallen under my feet. "
II Samuel,22,40,For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
II Samuel,22,41,"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me; yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off. "
II Samuel,22,42,"They looked, but there was none to save; even unto HaShem, but He answered them not. "
II Samuel,22,43,"Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down. "
II Samuel,22,44,Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known serve me. 
II Samuel,22,45,"The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. "
II Samuel,22,46,"The sons of the stranger fade away, and come halting out of their close places. "
II Samuel,22,47,"HaShem liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the G-d, my Rock of salvation; "
II Samuel,22,48,"Even the G-d that executeth vengeance for me, and bringeth down peoples under me, "
II Samuel,22,49,"And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies; yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man. "
II Samuel,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O HaShem, among the nations, and will sing praises unto Thy name. "
II Samuel,22,51,"A tower of salvation is He to His king; and showeth mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.  "
II Samuel,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David: The saying of David the son of Jesse, and the saying of the man raised on high, the anointed of the G-d of Jacob, and the sweet singer of Israel: "
II Samuel,23,2,"The spirit of HaShem spoke by me, and His word was upon my tongue. "
II Samuel,23,3,"The G-d of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: 'Ruler over men shall be the righteous, even he that ruleth in the fear of G-d, "
II Samuel,23,4,"And as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; when through clear shining after rain, the tender grass springeth out of the earth.' "
II Samuel,23,5,"For is not my house established with G-d? for an everlasting covenant He hath made with me, ordered in all things, and sure; for all my salvation, and all my desire, will he not make it to grow? "
II Samuel,23,6,"But the ungodly, they are as thorns thrust away, all of them, for they cannot be taken with the hand; "
II Samuel,23,7,But the man that toucheth them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place. 
II Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite; he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. "
II Samuel,23,9,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they jeoparded their lives against the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away; "
II Samuel,23,10,"he stood firm, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the sword; and HaShem wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain. "
II Samuel,23,11,"And after him was Shammah the son of Age the Ararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. "
II Samuel,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and HaShem wrought a great victory. "
II Samuel,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. "
II Samuel,23,14,"And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. "
II Samuel,23,15,"And David longed, and said: 'Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!' "
II Samuel,23,16,"And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto HaShem. "
II Samuel,23,17,"And he said: 'Be it far from me, O HaShem, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?' therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. "
II Samuel,23,18,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. "
II Samuel,23,19,He was most honourable of the three; therefore he was made their captain; howbeit he attained not unto the first three. 
II Samuel,23,20,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow; "
II Samuel,23,21,"and he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. "
II Samuel,23,22,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. "
II Samuel,23,23,"He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard. "
II Samuel,23,24,Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 
II Samuel,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite; "
II Samuel,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; "
II Samuel,23,27,"Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite; "
II Samuel,23,28,"Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite; "
II Samuel,23,29,"Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin; "
II Samuel,23,30,"Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of Nahale-gaash; "
II Samuel,23,31,"Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite; "
II Samuel,23,32,"Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan; "
II Samuel,23,33,"Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite; "
II Samuel,23,34,"Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite; "
II Samuel,23,35,"Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite; "
II Samuel,23,36,"Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite; "
II Samuel,23,37,"Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armour-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah; "
II Samuel,23,38,"Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; "
II Samuel,23,39,Uriah the Hittite. Thirty and seven in all. 
II Samuel,24,1,"And again the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them, saying: 'Go, number Israel and Judah.' "
II Samuel,24,2,"And the king said to Joab the captain of the host that was with him: 'Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.' "
II Samuel,24,3,"And Joab said unto the king: 'Now HaShem thy G-d add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?' "
II Samuel,24,4,"Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. "
II Samuel,24,5,"And they passed over the Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer; "
II Samuel,24,6,"then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Zidon, "
II Samuel,24,7,"and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba. "
II Samuel,24,8,"So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. "
II Samuel,24,9,And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. 
II Samuel,24,10,"And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto HaShem: 'I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, O HaShem, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.' "
II Samuel,24,11,"And when David rose up in the morning, the word of HaShem came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying: "
II Samuel,24,12,"'Go and speak unto David: Thus saith HaShem: I lay upon thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.' "
II Samuel,24,13,"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him: 'Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent Me.' "
II Samuel,24,14,And David said unto Gad: 'I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of HaShem; for His mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.' 
II Samuel,24,15,So HaShem sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 
II Samuel,24,16,"And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, HaShem repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people: 'It is enough; now stay thy hand.' And the angel of HaShem was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. "
II Samuel,24,17,"And David spoke unto HaShem when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said: 'Lo, I have sinned, and I have done iniquitously; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, be against me, and against my father's house.' "
II Samuel,24,18,"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him: 'Go up, rear an altar unto HaShem in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.' "
II Samuel,24,19,"And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as HaShem commanded. "
II Samuel,24,20,"And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and Araunah went out, and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. "
II Samuel,24,21,"And Araunah said: 'Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?' And David said: 'To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto HaShem, that the plague may be stayed from the people.' "
II Samuel,24,22,"And Araunah said unto David: 'Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him; behold the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-instruments and the furniture of the oxen for the wood.' "
II Samuel,24,23,All this did Araunah the king give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king: 'The HaShem thy G-d accept thee.' 
II Samuel,24,24,And the king said unto Araunah: 'Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto HaShem my G-d which cost me nothing.' So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 
II Samuel,24,25,"And David built there an altar unto HaShem, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So HaShem was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.  "
I Kings,1,1,"NOW KING David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat. "
I Kings,1,2,"Wherefore his servants said unto him: 'Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and be a companion unto him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.' "
I Kings,1,3,"So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. "
I Kings,1,4,"And the damsel was very fair; and she became a companion unto the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not. "
I Kings,1,5,"Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: 'I will be king'; and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. "
I Kings,1,6,And his father had not grieved him all his life in saying: 'Why hast thou done so?' and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom. 
I Kings,1,7,"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they following Adonijah helped him. "
I Kings,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. "
I Kings,1,9,"And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants; "
I Kings,1,10,"but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. "
I Kings,1,11,"Then Nathan spoke unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying: 'Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? "
I Kings,1,12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. "
I Kings,1,13,"Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? "
I Kings,1,14,"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.' "
I Kings,1,15,And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber. --Now the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.-- 
I Kings,1,16,"And Bath-sheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king. And the king said: 'What wouldest thou?' "
I Kings,1,17,"And she said unto him: 'My lord, thou didst swear by HaShem thy G-d unto thy handmaid: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. "
I Kings,1,18,"And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not. "
I Kings,1,19,"And he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. "
I Kings,1,20,"And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. "
I Kings,1,21,"Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.' "
I Kings,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. "
I Kings,1,23,"And they told the king, saying: 'Behold Nathan the prophet.' And when he was come in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. "
I Kings,1,24,"And Nathan said: 'My lord, O king, hast thou said: Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? "
I Kings,1,25,"For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say: Long live king Adonijah. "
I Kings,1,26,"But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon hath he not called. "
I Kings,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?' "
I Kings,1,28,"Then king David answered and said: 'Call me Bath-sheba.' And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. "
I Kings,1,29,"And the king swore and said: 'As HaShem liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, "
I Kings,1,30,"verily as I swore unto thee by HaShem, the G-d of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.' "
I Kings,1,31,"Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and prostrated herself to the king, and said: 'Let my lord king David live for ever.' "
I Kings,1,32,"And king David said: 'Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.' And they came before the king. "
I Kings,1,33,"And the king said unto them: 'Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. "
I Kings,1,34,"And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the horn, and say: Long live king Solomon. "
I Kings,1,35,"Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.' "
I Kings,1,36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said: 'Amen; so say HaShem, the G-d of my lord the king. "
I Kings,1,37,"As HaShem hath been with my lord the king, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.' "
I Kings,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. "
I Kings,1,39,"And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the ram's horn; and all the people said: 'Long live king Solomon.' "
I Kings,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. "
I Kings,1,41,"And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said: 'Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?' "
I Kings,1,42,"While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said: 'Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.' "
I Kings,1,43,And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah: 'Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 
I Kings,1,44,"And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule. "
I Kings,1,45,"And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that ye have heard. "
I Kings,1,46,And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
I Kings,1,47,"And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying: G-d make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king bowed down upon the bed. "
I Kings,1,48,"And also thus said the king: Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.' "
I Kings,1,49,"And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. "
I Kings,1,50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. "
I Kings,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying: 'Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear unto me first of all that he will not slay his servant with the sword.' "
I Kings,1,52,"And Solomon said: 'If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.' "
I Kings,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him: 'Go to thy house.' "
I Kings,2,1,"Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying: "
I Kings,2,2,"'I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; "
I Kings,2,3,"and keep the charge of HaShem thy G-d, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself; "
I Kings,2,4,"that HaShem may establish His word which He spoke concerning me, saying: If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said He, a man on the throne of Israel. "
I Kings,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. "
I Kings,2,6,"Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. "
I Kings,2,7,"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they drew nigh unto me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. "
I Kings,2,8,"And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by HaShem, saying: I will not put thee to death with the sword. "
I Kings,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood.' "
I Kings,2,10,"And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. "
I Kings,2,11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. "
I Kings,2,12,And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established firmly. 
I Kings,2,13,Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said: 'Comest thou peaceably?' And he said: 'Peaceably.' 
I Kings,2,14,He said moreover: 'I have somewhat to say unto thee.' And she said: 'Say on.' 
I Kings,2,15,"And he said: 'Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's; for it was his from HaShem. "
I Kings,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.' And she said unto him: 'Say on.' "
I Kings,2,17,"And he said: 'Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king--for he will not say thee nay--that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.' "
I Kings,2,18,And Bath-sheba said: 'Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.' 
I Kings,2,19,"Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed down unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. "
I Kings,2,20,"Then she said: 'I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not.' And the king said unto her: 'Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.' "
I Kings,2,21,And she said: 'Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.' 
I Kings,2,22,"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother: 'And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.' "
I Kings,2,23,"Then king Solomon swore by HaShem, saying: 'G-d do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. "
I Kings,2,24,"Now therefore as HaShem liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.' "
I Kings,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died. "
I Kings,2,26,"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king: 'Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art deserving of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the L-rd GOD before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.' "
I Kings,2,27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto HaShem; that the word of HaShem might be fulfilled, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. "
I Kings,2,28,"And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of HaShem, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. "
I Kings,2,29,"And it was told king Solomon: 'Joab is fled unto the Tent of HaShem, and, behold, he is by the altar.' Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: 'Go, fall upon him.' "
I Kings,2,30,"And Benaiah came to the Tent of HaShem, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the king: Come forth.' And he said: 'Nay; but I will die here.' And Benaiah brought back word unto the king, saying: 'Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.' "
I Kings,2,31,"And the king said unto him: 'Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house. "
I Kings,2,32,"And HaShem will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. "
I Kings,2,33,"So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from HaShem.' "
I Kings,2,34,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. "
I Kings,2,35,And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. 
I Kings,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. "
I Kings,2,37,"For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.' "
I Kings,2,38,"And Shimei said unto the king: 'The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.' And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. "
I Kings,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying: 'Behold, thy servants are in Gath.' "
I Kings,2,40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. "
I Kings,2,41,"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come back. "
I Kings,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him: 'Did I not make thee to swear by HaShem, and forewarned thee, saying: Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me: The saying is good; I have heard it. "
I Kings,2,43,"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of HaShem, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?' "
I Kings,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei: 'Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father; therefore HaShem shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. "
I Kings,2,45,"But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before HaShem for ever.' "
I Kings,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. "
I Kings,3,1,"And Solomon became allied to Pharaoh king of Egypt by marriage, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of HaShem, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. "
I Kings,3,2,"Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of HaShem until those days. "
I Kings,3,3,"And Solomon loved HaShem, walking in the statutes of David his father; only he sacrificed and offered in the high places. "
I Kings,3,4,And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 
I Kings,3,5,In Gibeon HaShem appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and G-d said: 'Ask what I shall give thee.' 
I Kings,3,6,"And Solomon said: 'Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great kindness, according as he walked before Thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. "
I Kings,3,7,"And now, O HaShem my G-d, Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in. "
I Kings,3,8,"And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. "
I Kings,3,9,"Give Thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?' "
I Kings,3,10,"And the speech pleased HaShem, that Solomon had asked this thing. "
I Kings,3,11,"And G-d said unto him: 'Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice; "
I Kings,3,12,"behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. "
I Kings,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour--so that there hath not been any among the kings like unto thee--all thy days. "
I Kings,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.' "
I Kings,3,15,"And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of HaShem, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. "
I Kings,3,16,"Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. "
I Kings,3,17,"And the one woman said: 'Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. "
I Kings,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. "
I Kings,3,19,And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlay it. 
I Kings,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. "
I Kings,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked well at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.' "
I Kings,3,22,"And the other woman said: 'Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.' And this said: 'No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.' Thus they spoke before the king. "
I Kings,3,23,"Then said the king: `The one saith: This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith: Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.' "
I Kings,3,24,And the king said: 'Fetch me a sword.' And they brought a sword before the king. 
I Kings,3,25,"And the king said: 'Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.' "
I Kings,3,26,"Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned upon her son, and she said: 'Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.' But the other said: 'It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.' "
I Kings,3,27,"Then the king answered and said: 'Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.' "
I Kings,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of G-d was in him, to do justice. "
I Kings,4,1,And king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
I Kings,4,2,"And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; "
I Kings,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; "
I Kings,4,4,and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
I Kings,4,5,and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister and the king's friend; 
I Kings,4,6,and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy. 
I Kings,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. "
I Kings,4,8,"And these are their names: The son of Hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim; "
I Kings,4,9,"the son of Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; "
I Kings,4,10,"the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher; "
I Kings,4,11,"the son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife; "
I Kings,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; "
I Kings,4,13,"the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars; "
I Kings,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; "
I Kings,4,15,"Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife; "
I Kings,4,16,"Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; "
I Kings,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; "
I Kings,4,18,"Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; "
I Kings,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and one officer that was over all the officers in the land. "
I Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. "
I Kings,5,1,"And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. "
I Kings,5,2,"And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; "
I Kings,5,3,"ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. "
I Kings,5,4,"For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him. "
I Kings,5,5,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. "
I Kings,5,6,"And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. "
I Kings,5,7,"And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. "
I Kings,5,8,"Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge. "
I Kings,5,9,"And G-d gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. "
I Kings,5,10,"And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. "
I Kings,5,11,"For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. "
I Kings,5,12,And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. 
I Kings,5,13,"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. "
I Kings,5,14,"And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. "
I Kings,5,15,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
I Kings,5,16,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: "
I Kings,5,17,"`Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of HaShem his G-d for the wars which were about him on every side, until HaShem put them under the soles of my feet. "
I Kings,5,18,"But now HaShem my G-d hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. "
I Kings,5,19,"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of HaShem my G-d, as HaShem spoke unto David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name. "
I Kings,5,20,Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.' 
I Kings,5,21,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: 'Blessed be HaShem this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.' "
I Kings,5,22,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: 'I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress. "
I Kings,5,23,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.' "
I Kings,5,24,So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire. 
I Kings,5,25,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. "
I Kings,5,26,"And HaShem gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. "
I Kings,5,27,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
I Kings,5,28,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy. "
I Kings,5,29,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; "
I Kings,5,30,"besides Solomon's chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. "
I Kings,5,31,"And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone. "
I Kings,5,32,"And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.  "
I Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of HaShem. "
I Kings,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for HaShem, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. "
I Kings,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. "
I Kings,6,4,"And for the house he made windows broad within, and narrow without. "
I Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the sanctuary; and he made side-chambers round about; "
I Kings,6,6,"the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.-- "
I Kings,6,7,"For the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.-- "
I Kings,6,8,"The door for the lowest row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row, and out of the middle into the third. "
I Kings,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered in the house with planks of cedar over beams. "
I Kings,6,10,"And he built the stories of the side-structure against all the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. "
I Kings,6,11,"And the word of HaShem came to Solomon, saying: "
I Kings,6,12,"'As for this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute Mine ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father; "
I Kings,6,13,"in that I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.' "
I Kings,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it. "
I Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. "
I Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists; he even built them for himself within, for a Sanctuary, even for the most holy place. "
I Kings,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before the Sanctuary, was forty cubits long. "
I Kings,6,18,And the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen. 
I Kings,6,19,"And he prepared the Sanctuary in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of HaShem. "
I Kings,6,20,"And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, he set an altar, which he covered with cedar. "
I Kings,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold; and he drew chains of gold across the wall before the Sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold. 
I Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished; also the whole altar that belonged to the Sanctuary he overlaid with gold. "
I Kings,6,23,"And in the Sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high. "
I Kings,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. "
I Kings,6,25,And the other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. 
I Kings,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. "
I Kings,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. "
I Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
I Kings,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without. "
I Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. "
I Kings,6,31,"And for the entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame having five angles. "
I Kings,6,32,"And as for the two doors of olive-wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees. "
I Kings,6,33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square; "
I Kings,6,34,"and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. "
I Kings,6,35,And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. 
I Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams. "
I Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of HaShem laid, in the month Ziv. "
I Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.  "
I Kings,7,1,"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. "
I Kings,7,2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. "
I Kings,7,3,"And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row. "
I Kings,7,4,And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three ranks. 
I Kings,7,5,And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks. 
I Kings,7,6,"And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them. "
I Kings,7,7,"And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. "
I Kings,7,8,"And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch. "
I Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court. "
I Kings,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. "
I Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood. "
I Kings,7,12,"And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of HaShem, and the court of the porch of the house. "
I Kings,7,13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
I Kings,7,14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. "
I Kings,7,15,"Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about; and so the other pillar. "
I Kings,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. "
I Kings,7,17,"He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. "
I Kings,7,18,"And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital. "
I Kings,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits. "
I Kings,7,20,"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon each capital. "
I Kings,7,21,"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. "
I Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished. 
I Kings,7,23,"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. "
I Kings,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about; the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast. "
I Kings,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. "
I Kings,7,26,"And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths. "
I Kings,7,27,"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. "
I Kings,7,28,And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays; 
I Kings,7,29,"and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. "
I Kings,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each. "
I Kings,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings; and their borders were foursquare, not round. "
I Kings,7,32,And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 
I Kings,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten. "
I Kings,7,34,And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base itself. 
I Kings,7,35,And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of one piece therewith. 
I Kings,7,36,"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about. "
I Kings,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. "
I Kings,7,38,And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
I Kings,7,39,"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. "
I Kings,7,40,"And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of HaShem: "
I Kings,7,41,"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; "
I Kings,7,42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; "
I Kings,7,43,"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; "
I Kings,7,44,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; "
I Kings,7,45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of HaShem, were of burnished brass. "
I Kings,7,46,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. "
I Kings,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out. "
I Kings,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of HaShem: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold; "
I Kings,7,49,"and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; "
I Kings,7,50,"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold. "
I Kings,7,51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of HaShem was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of HaShem.  "
I Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of HaShem out of the city of David, which is Zion. "
I Kings,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. "
I Kings,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. "
I Kings,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of HaShem, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. "
I Kings,8,5,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. "
I Kings,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of HaShem unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. "
I Kings,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. "
I Kings,8,8,"And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day. "
I Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when HaShem made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt. "
I Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of HaShem, "
I Kings,8,11,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of HaShem filled the house of HaShem. 
I Kings,8,12,Then spoke Solomon: HaShem hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness. 
I Kings,8,13,"I have surely built Thee a house of habitation, a place for Thee to dwell in for ever. "
I Kings,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel stood. "
I Kings,8,15,"And he said: 'Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hand fulfilled it, saying: "
I Kings,8,16,"Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel. "
I Kings,8,17,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
I Kings,8,18,"But HaShem said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart; "
I Kings,8,19,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name. "
I Kings,8,20,"And HaShem hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as HaShem promised, and have built the house for the name of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
I Kings,8,21,"And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of HaShem, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.' "
I Kings,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of HaShem in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; "
I Kings,8,23,"and he said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, there is no G-d like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; "
I Kings,8,24,"who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day. "
I Kings,8,25,"Now therefore, O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me. "
I Kings,8,26,"Now therefore, O G-d of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou didst speak unto Thy servant David my father. "
I Kings,8,27,"But will G-d in very truth dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house that I have builded! "
I Kings,8,28,"Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O HaShem my G-d, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day; "
I Kings,8,29,"that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said: My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place. "
I Kings,8,30,"And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place; and when Thou hearest, forgive. "
I Kings,8,31,"If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; "
I Kings,8,32,"then hear Thou in heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. "
I Kings,8,33,"When Thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, when they do sin against Thee, if they turn again to Thee, and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house; "
I Kings,8,34,"then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers. "
I Kings,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they do sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; "
I Kings,8,36,"then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance. "
I Kings,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; "
I Kings,8,38,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man of all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house; "
I Kings,8,39,"then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest--for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men-- "
I Kings,8,40,that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers. 
I Kings,8,41,"Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for Thy name's sake-- "
I Kings,8,42,"for they shall hear of Thy great name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm--when he shall come and pray toward this house; "
I Kings,8,43,"hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built. "
I Kings,8,44,"If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto HaShem toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; "
I Kings,8,45,"then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. "
I Kings,8,46,"If they sin against Thee--for there is no man that sinneth not--and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; "
I Kings,8,47,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn back, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying: We have sinned, and have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly; "
I Kings,8,48,"if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto Thee toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; "
I Kings,8,49,"then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause; "
I Kings,8,50,"and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; "
I Kings,8,51,"for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron; "
I Kings,8,52,"that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto Thee. "
I Kings,8,53,"For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O L-rd GOD.' "
I Kings,8,54,"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto HaShem, he arose from before the altar of HaShem, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. "
I Kings,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: "
I Kings,8,56,"`Blessed be HaShem, that hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there hath not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant. "
I Kings,8,57,"HaShem our G-d be with us, as He was with our fathers; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us; "
I Kings,8,58,"that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His statutes, and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. "
I Kings,8,59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before HaShem, be nigh unto HaShem our G-d day and night, that He maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, as every day shall require; "
I Kings,8,60,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that HaShem, He is G-d; there is none else. "
I Kings,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be whole with HaShem our G-d, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.' "
I Kings,8,62,"And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before HaShem. "
I Kings,8,63,"And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto HaShem, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of HaShem. "
I Kings,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of HaShem; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar that was before HaShem was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings. "
I Kings,8,65,"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt, before HaShem our G-d, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. "
I Kings,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that HaShem had shown unto David His servant, and to Israel His people. "
I Kings,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of HaShem, and the king's house, and all Solomon's delight which he was pleased to do, "
I Kings,9,2,"that HaShem appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. "
I Kings,9,3,"And HaShem said unto him: 'I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before Me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. "
I Kings,9,4,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; "
I Kings,9,5,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. "
I Kings,9,6,"But if ye shall turn away from following Me, ye or your children, and not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; "
I Kings,9,7,"then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples; "
I Kings,9,8,"and this house which is so high shall become desolate, and every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and when they shall say: Why hath HaShem done thus unto this land, and to this house? "
I Kings,9,9,"they shall be answered: Because they forsook HaShem their G-d, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath HaShem brought all this evil upon them.' "
I Kings,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of HaShem and the king's house-- "
I Kings,9,11,"now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire--that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. "
I Kings,9,12,And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him: and they pleased him not. 
I Kings,9,13,"And he said: 'What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?' And they were called the land of Cabul, unto this day. "
I Kings,9,14,And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 
I Kings,9,15,"And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of HaShem, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. "
I Kings,9,16,"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife. "
I Kings,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, "
I Kings,9,18,"and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, "
I Kings,9,19,"and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. "
I Kings,9,20,"All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; "
I Kings,9,21,"even their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. "
I Kings,9,22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. "
I Kings,9,23,"These were the chief officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. "
I Kings,9,24,But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her; then did he build Millo. 
I Kings,9,25,"And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto HaShem, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before HaShem. So he finished the house. "
I Kings,9,26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. "
I Kings,9,27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. "
I Kings,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon. "
I Kings,10,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon because of the name of HaShem, she came to prove him with hard questions. "
I Kings,10,2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold very much, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. "
I Kings,10,3,And Solomon told her all her questions; there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not. 
I Kings,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, "
I Kings,10,5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his burnt-offering which he offered in the house of HaShem, there was no more spirit in her. "
I Kings,10,6,"And she said to the king: 'It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. "
I Kings,10,7,"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me; thou hast wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which I heard. "
I Kings,10,8,"Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. "
I Kings,10,9,"Blessed be HaShem thy G-d, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because HaShem loved Israel for ever, therefore made He thee king, to do justice and righteousness.' "
I Kings,10,10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones; there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. "
I Kings,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of sandal-wood and precious stones. "
I Kings,10,12,"And the king made of the sandal-wood pillars for the house of HaShem, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for the singers; there came no such sandal-wood, nor was seen, unto this day. "
I Kings,10,13,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants. "
I Kings,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, "
I Kings,10,15,"beside that which came of the merchants, and of the traffic of the traders, and of all the kings of the mingled people and of the governors of the country. "
I Kings,10,16,And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 
I Kings,10,17,And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold: three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
I Kings,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. "
I Kings,10,19,"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were arms on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. "
I Kings,10,20,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
I Kings,10,21,"And all king Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. "
I Kings,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. "
I Kings,10,23,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
I Kings,10,24,"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which G-d had put in his heart. "
I Kings,10,25,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. "
I Kings,10,26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. "
I Kings,10,27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. "
I Kings,10,28,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keveh, the king's merchants buying them of the men of Keveh at a price. "
I Kings,10,29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means. "
I Kings,11,1,"Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; "
I Kings,11,2,"of the nations concerning which HaShem said unto the children of Israel: 'Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods'; Solomon did cleave unto these in love. "
I Kings,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. "
I Kings,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not whole with HaShem his G-d, as was the heart of David his father. "
I Kings,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites. "
I Kings,11,6,"And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and went not fully after HaShem, as did David his father. "
I Kings,11,7,"Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestation of the children of Ammon. "
I Kings,11,8,"And so did he for all his foreign wives, who offered and sacrificed unto their gods. "
I Kings,11,9,"And HaShem was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from HaShem, the G-d of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, "
I Kings,11,10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he kept not that which HaShem commanded. "
I Kings,11,11,"Wherefore HaShem said unto Solomon: 'Forasmuch as this hath been in thy mind, and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. "
I Kings,11,12,"Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. "
I Kings,11,13,"Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son; for David My servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.' "
I Kings,11,14,"And HaShem raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king's seed in Edom. "
I Kings,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom-- "
I Kings,11,16,"for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom-- "
I Kings,11,17,"that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child. "
I Kings,11,18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. "
I Kings,11,19,"And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. "
I Kings,11,20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh. "
I Kings,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: 'Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.' "
I Kings,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him: `But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?' And he answered: 'Nothing; howbeit let me depart in any wise.' "
I Kings,11,23,"And G-d raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. "
I Kings,11,24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them of Zobah; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. "
I Kings,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Aram. "
I Kings,11,26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. "
I Kings,11,27,"And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father. "
I Kings,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph. "
I Kings,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. "
I Kings,11,30,"And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. "
I Kings,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee-- "
I Kings,11,32,"but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel-- "
I Kings,11,33,"because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father. "
I Kings,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David My servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My statutes; "
I Kings,11,35,"but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. "
I Kings,11,36,"And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David My servant may have a lamp alway before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen Me to put My name there. "
I Kings,11,37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. "
I Kings,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. "
I Kings,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.' "
I Kings,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. "
I Kings,11,41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? "
I Kings,11,42,And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
I Kings,11,43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.  "
I Kings,12,1,And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
I Kings,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it--for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt, "
I Kings,12,3,"and they sent and called him--that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying: "
I Kings,12,4,"'Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.' "
I Kings,12,5,"And he said unto them: 'Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.' And the people departed. "
I Kings,12,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: 'What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?' "
I Kings,12,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying: 'If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.' "
I Kings,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. "
I Kings,12,9,"And he said unto them: 'What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?' "
I Kings,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: `Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. "
I Kings,12,11,"And now whereas my father did burden you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.' "
I Kings,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: 'Come to me again the third day.' "
I Kings,12,13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him; "
I Kings,12,14,"and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: 'My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.' "
I Kings,12,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of HaShem, that He might establish His word, which HaShem spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. "
I Kings,12,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: 'What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.' So Israel departed unto their tents. "
I Kings,12,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. "
I Kings,12,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the levy; and all Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. "
I Kings,12,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day. "
I Kings,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel; there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. "
I Kings,12,21,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, be assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. "
I Kings,12,22,"But the word of G-d came unto Shemaiah the man of G-d, saying: "
I Kings,12,23,"'Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying: "
I Kings,12,24,"Thus saith HaShem: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel; return every man to his house; for this thing is of Me.' So they hearkened unto the word of HaShem, and returned and went their way, according to the word of HaShem. "
I Kings,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel. "
I Kings,12,26,And Jeroboam said in his heart: 'Now will the kingdom return to the house of David. 
I Kings,12,27,"If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of HaShem at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn back unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.' "
I Kings,12,28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them: 'Ye have gone up long enough to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.' "
I Kings,12,29,"And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. "
I Kings,12,30,"And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. "
I Kings,12,31,"And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi. "
I Kings,12,32,"And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, to sacrifice unto the calves that he had made; and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made. "
I Kings,12,33,"And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to offer. "
I Kings,13,1,"And, behold, there came a man of G-d out of Judah by the word of HaShem unto Beth-el; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer. "
I Kings,13,2,"And he cried against the altar by the word of HaShem, and said: 'O altar, altar, thus saith HaShem: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that offer upon thee, and men's bones shall they burn upon thee.' "
I Kings,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day saying: 'This is the sign which HaShem hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.' "
I Kings,13,4,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of G-d, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying: 'Lay hold on him.' And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to him. "
I Kings,13,5,"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of G-d had given by the word of HaShem. "
I Kings,13,6,"And the king answered and said unto the man of G-d: 'Entreat now the favour of HaShem thy G-d, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me.' And the man of G-d entreated HaShem, and the king's hand was restored him, and became as it was before. "
I Kings,13,7,"And the king said unto the man of G-d: 'Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.' "
I Kings,13,8,"And the man of G-d said unto the king: 'If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place. "
I Kings,13,9,"For it so was charged me by the word of HaShem, saying: Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.' "
I Kings,13,10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el. "
I Kings,13,11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of G-d had done that day in Beth-el, and the words which he had spoken unto the king, and they told them unto their father. "
I Kings,13,12,"And their father said unto them: 'What way went he?' For his sons had seen what way the man of G-d went, that came from Judah. "
I Kings,13,13,And he said unto his sons: 'Saddle me the ass.' So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon. 
I Kings,13,14,"And he went after the man of G-d, and found him sitting under a terebinth; and he said unto him: 'Art thou the man of G-d that camest from Judah?' And he said: 'I am.' "
I Kings,13,15,"Then he said unto him: 'Come home with me, and eat bread.' "
I Kings,13,16,"And he said: 'I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place. "
I Kings,13,17,"For it was said to me by the word of HaShem: Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn back to go by the way that thou camest.' "
I Kings,13,18,"And he said unto him: 'I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of HaShem, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water.' --He lied unto him.-- "
I Kings,13,19,"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. "
I Kings,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of HaShem came unto the prophet that brought him back. "
I Kings,13,21,"And he cried unto the man of G-d that came from Judah, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem: Forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the word of HaShem, and hast not kept the commandment which HaShem thy G-d commanded thee, "
I Kings,13,22,"but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to thee: Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.' "
I Kings,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, namely, for the prophet whom he had brought back. "
I Kings,13,24,"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him; and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the carcass. "
I Kings,13,25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. "
I Kings,13,26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said: 'It is the man of G-d, who rebelled against the word of HaShem; therefore HaShem hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke unto him.' "
I Kings,13,27,"And he spoke to his sons, saying: 'Saddle me the ass.' And they saddled it. "
I Kings,13,28,"And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass; the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass. "
I Kings,13,29,"And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of G-d, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to lament, and to bury him. "
I Kings,13,30,"And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they made lamentation for him: 'Alas, my brother!' "
I Kings,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying: 'When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of G-d is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. "
I Kings,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of HaShem against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.' "
I Kings,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places; whosoever would, he consecrated him, that he might be one of the priests of the high places. "
I Kings,13,34,"And by this thing there was sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth. "
I Kings,14,1,At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
I Kings,14,2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife: 'Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh; behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people. "
I Kings,14,3,"And take with thee ten loaves, and biscuits, and a cruse of honey, and go to him; he will tell thee what shall become of the child.' "
I Kings,14,4,"And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. "
I Kings,14,5,"Now HaShem had said unto Ahijah: 'Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick; thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.' "
I Kings,14,6,"And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said: 'Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. "
I Kings,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over My people Israel, "
I Kings,14,8,"and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments, and who followed Me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in Mine eyes; "
I Kings,14,9,"but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke Me, and hast cast Me behind thy back; "
I Kings,14,10,"therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone. "
I Kings,14,11,Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat; for HaShem hath spoken it. 
I Kings,14,12,"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house; and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. "
I Kings,14,13,"And all Israel shall make lamentation for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave; because in him there is found some good thing toward HaShem, the G-d of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. "
I Kings,14,14,"Moreover HaShem will raise Him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what is it even then? "
I Kings,14,15,"for HaShem will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will root up Israel out of this good land, which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River; because they have made their Asherim, provoking HaShem. "
I Kings,14,16,"And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.' "
I Kings,14,17,"And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah; and as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. "
I Kings,14,18,"And all Israel buried him, and made lamentation for him; according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet. "
I Kings,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. "
I Kings,14,20,"And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,14,21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which HaShem had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there; and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. "
I Kings,14,22,"And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; and they moved Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. "
I Kings,14,23,"For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every leafy tree; "
I Kings,14,24,and there were also sodomites in the land; they did according to all the abominations of the nations which HaShem drove out before the children of Israel. 
I Kings,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; "
I Kings,14,26,"and he took away the treasures of the house of HaShem, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. "
I Kings,14,27,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house. "
I Kings,14,28,"And it was so, that as oft as the king went into the house of HaShem, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber. "
I Kings,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
I Kings,14,30,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
I Kings,14,31,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,15,1,Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah. 
I Kings,15,2,Three years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
I Kings,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not whole with HaShem his G-d, as the heart of David his father. "
I Kings,15,4,"Nevertheless for David's sake did HaShem his G-d give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem; "
I Kings,15,5,"because David did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, and turned not aside from any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. "
I Kings,15,6,Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
I Kings,15,7,"And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. "
I Kings,15,8,And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 
I Kings,15,9,And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. 
I Kings,15,10,And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
I Kings,15,11,"And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, as did David his father. "
I Kings,15,12,"And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. "
I Kings,15,13,"And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. "
I Kings,15,14,But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole with HaShem all his days. 
I Kings,15,15,"And he brought into the house of HaShem the things that his father had hallowed, and the things that himself had hallowed, silver, and gold, and vessels. "
I Kings,15,16,And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days. 
I Kings,15,17,"And Baasa king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. "
I Kings,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of HaShem, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, that dwelt at Damascus, saying: "
I Kings,15,19,"'There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.' "
I Kings,15,20,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. "
I Kings,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Baasa heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. "
I Kings,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. "
I Kings,15,23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. "
I Kings,15,24,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,15,25,"And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. "
I Kings,15,26,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
I Kings,15,27,"And Baasa the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasa smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. "
I Kings,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasa slay him, and reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,15,29,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of HaShem, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the Shilonite; "
I Kings,15,30,"for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin; because of his provocation wherewith he provoked HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
I Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,15,32,And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days. 
I Kings,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasa the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty and four years. "
I Kings,15,34,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
I Kings,16,1,"And the word of HaShem came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasa, saying: "
I Kings,16,2,"`Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over My people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made My people Israel to sin, to provoke Me with their sins; "
I Kings,16,3,"behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasa and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. "
I Kings,16,4,Him that dieth of Baasa in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.' 
I Kings,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasa, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,16,6,"And Baasa slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,16,7,"And moreover by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of HaShem against Baasa, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him. "
I Kings,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasa to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years. "
I Kings,16,9,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him; now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah; "
I Kings,16,10,"and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasa; he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. "
I Kings,16,12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasa, according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke against Baasa by Jehu the prophet, "
I Kings,16,13,"for all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke HaShem, the G-d of Israel, with their vanities. "
I Kings,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. "
I Kings,16,16,"And the people that were encamped heard say: 'Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king'; wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. "
I Kings,16,17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. "
I Kings,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died; "
I Kings,16,19,"for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. "
I Kings,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. "
I Kings,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. "
I Kings,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years; six years reigned he in Tirzah. "
I Kings,16,24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria. "
I Kings,16,25,"And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him. "
I Kings,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke HaShem, the G-d of Israel, with their vanities. "
I Kings,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,16,28,"And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,16,29,And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
I Kings,16,30,And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem above all that were before him. 
I Kings,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. "
I Kings,16,32,"And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. "
I Kings,16,33,"And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke HaShem, the G-d of Israel, than all the kings of Israel that were before him. "
I Kings,16,34,"In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho; with Abiram his first-born he laid the foundation thereof, and with his youngest son Segub he set up the gates thereof; according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. "
I Kings,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said unto Ahab: 'As HaShem, the G-d of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.' "
I Kings,17,2,"And the word of HaShem came unto him, saying: "
I Kings,17,3,"'Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. "
I Kings,17,4,"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.' "
I Kings,17,5,"So he went and did according unto the word of HaShem; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. "
I Kings,17,6,"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. "
I Kings,17,7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land. "
I Kings,17,8,"And the word of HaShem came unto him, saying: "
I Kings,17,9,"'Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.' "
I Kings,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.' "
I Kings,17,11,"And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said: 'Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.' "
I Kings,17,12,"And she said: 'As HaShem thy G-d liveth, I have not a cake, only a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.' "
I Kings,17,13,"And Elijah said unto her: 'Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. "
I Kings,17,14,"For thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: The jar of meal shall not be spent, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that HaShem sendeth rain upon the land.' "
I Kings,17,15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. "
I Kings,17,16,"The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke by Elijah. "
I Kings,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. "
I Kings,17,18,"And she said unto Elijah: 'What have I to do with thee, O thou man of G-d? art thou come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?' "
I Kings,17,19,"And he said unto her: 'Give me thy son.' And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. "
I Kings,17,20,"And he cried unto HaShem, and said: 'O HaShem my G-d, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?' "
I Kings,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto HaShem, and said: 'O HaShem my G-d, I pray thee, let this child's soul come back into him.' "
I Kings,17,22,"And HaShem hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived. "
I Kings,17,23,"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said: 'See, thy son liveth.' "
I Kings,17,24,"And the woman said to Elijah: 'Now I know that thou art a man of G-d, and that the word of HaShem in thy mouth is truth.' "
I Kings,18,1,"And it came to pass after many days, that the word of HaShem came to Elijah, in the third year, saying: 'Go, show thyself unto Ahab, and I will send rain upon the land.' "
I Kings,18,2,And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria. 
I Kings,18,3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. --Now Obadiah feared HaShem greatly; "
I Kings,18,4,"for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of HaShem, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.-- "
I Kings,18,5,"And Ahab said unto Obadiah: 'Go through the land, unto all the springs of water, and unto all the brooks; peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.' "
I Kings,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. "
I Kings,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him; and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said: 'Is it thou, my lord Elijah?' "
I Kings,18,8,"And he answered him: 'It is I; go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here.' "
I Kings,18,9,"And he said: 'Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? "
I Kings,18,10,"As HaShem thy G-d liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said: He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. "
I Kings,18,11,"And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here. "
I Kings,18,12,"And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the spirit of HaShem will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me; but I thy servant fear HaShem from my youth. "
I Kings,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of HaShem, how I hid a hundred men of HaShem'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? "
I Kings,18,14,"And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.' "
I Kings,18,15,"And Elijah said: 'As HaShem of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.' "
I Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. "
I Kings,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him: 'Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?' "
I Kings,18,18,"And be answered: 'I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of HaShem, and thou hast followed the Baalim. "
I Kings,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel's table.' "
I Kings,18,20,"And Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. "
I Kings,18,21,"And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said: 'How long halt ye between two opinions? if HaShem be G-d, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.' And the people answered him not a word. "
I Kings,18,22,"Then said Elijah unto the people: 'I, even I only, am left a prophet of HaShem; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. "
I Kings,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. "
I Kings,18,24,"And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of HaShem; and the G-d that answereth by fire, let him be G-d.' And all the people answered and said: 'It is well spoken.' "
I Kings,18,25,"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal: 'Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.' "
I Kings,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying: 'O Baal, answer us.' But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they danced in halting wise about the altar which was made. "
I Kings,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said: 'Cry aloud; for he is a god; either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.' "
I Kings,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with swords and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. "
I Kings,18,29,"And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening offering; but their was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. "
I Kings,18,30,And Elijah said unto all the people: 'Come near unto me'; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of HaShem that was thrown down. 
I Kings,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of HaShem came, saying: 'Israel shall be thy name.' "
I Kings,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of HaShem; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. "
I Kings,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. "
I Kings,18,34,"And he said: 'Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.' And he said: 'Do it the second time'; and they did it the second time. And he said: 'Do it the third time'; and they did it the third time. "
I Kings,18,35,And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. 
I Kings,18,36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that Thou art G-d in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that I have done all these things at Thy word. "
I Kings,18,37,"Hear me, O HaShem, hear me, that this people may know that Thou, HaShem, art G-d, for Thou didst turn their heart backward.' "
I Kings,18,38,"Then the fire of HaShem fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. "
I Kings,18,39,"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said: 'The HaShem, He is G-d; HaShem, He is G-d.' "
I Kings,18,40,"And Elijah said unto them: 'Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.' And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. "
I Kings,18,41,"And Elijah said unto Ahab: 'Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.' "
I Kings,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees. "
I Kings,18,43,"And he said to his servant: 'Go up now, look toward the sea.' And he went up, and looked, and said: 'There is nothing.' And he said: 'Go again seven times.' "
I Kings,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said: 'Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man's hand.' And he said: 'Go up, say unto Ahab: Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.' "
I Kings,18,45,"And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. "
I Kings,18,46,"And the hand of HaShem was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. "
I Kings,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. "
I Kings,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying: 'So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.' "
I Kings,19,3,"And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. "
I Kings,19,4,"But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom-tree; and he requested for himself that he might die; and said: 'It is enough; now, O HaShem, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.' "
I Kings,19,5,"And he lay down and slept under a broom-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him: 'Arise and eat.' "
I Kings,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. "
I Kings,19,7,"And the angel of HaShem came again the second time, and touched him, and said: 'Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.' "
I Kings,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of G-d. "
I Kings,19,9,"And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of HaShem came to him, and He said unto him: 'What doest thou here, Elijah?' "
I Kings,19,10,"And he said: 'I have been very jealous for HaShem, the G-d of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.' "
I Kings,19,11,"And He said: 'Go forth, and stand upon the mount before HaShem.' And, behold, HaShem passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before HaShem; but HaShem was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but HaShem was not in the earthquake; "
I Kings,19,12,and after the earthquake a fire; but HaShem was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice. 
I Kings,19,13,"And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said: 'What doest thou here, Elijah?' "
I Kings,19,14,"And he said: 'I have been very jealous for HaShem, the G-d of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.' "
I Kings,19,15,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Aram; "
I Kings,19,16,and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. 
I Kings,19,17,"And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. "
I Kings,19,18,"Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.' "
I Kings,19,19,"So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him. "
I Kings,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said: 'Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.' And he said unto him: 'Go back; for what have I done to thee?' "
I Kings,19,21,"And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. "
I Kings,20,1,"And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. "
I Kings,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, "
I Kings,20,3,"and said unto him: 'Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.' "
I Kings,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said: 'It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.' "
I Kings,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said: 'Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; "
I Kings,20,6,"but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.' "
I Kings,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: 'Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.' "
I Kings,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him: 'Hearken thou not, neither consent.' "
I Kings,20,9,"Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: 'Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.' And the messengers departed, and brought him back word. "
I Kings,20,10,"And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: 'The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.' "
I Kings,20,11,And the king of Israel answered and said: 'Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off.' 
I Kings,20,12,"And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said unto his servants: 'Set yourselves in array.' And they set themselves in array against the city. "
I Kings,20,13,"And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith HaShem: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am HaShem.' "
I Kings,20,14,And Ahab said: 'By whom?' And he said: 'Thus saith HaShem: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.' Then he said: 'Who shall begin the battle?' And he answered: 'Thou.' 
I Kings,20,15,"Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. "
I Kings,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. "
I Kings,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: 'There are men come out from Samaria.' "
I Kings,20,18,"And he said: 'Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.' "
I Kings,20,19,"So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. "
I Kings,20,20,"And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. "
I Kings,20,21,"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter. "
I Kings,20,22,"And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: 'Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.' "
I Kings,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: 'Their G-d is a G-d of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. "
I Kings,20,24,"And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room: "
I Kings,20,25,"and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.' And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. "
I Kings,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. "
I Kings,20,27,"And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country. "
I Kings,20,28,"And a man of G-d came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith HaShem: Because the Arameans have said: HaShem is a G-d of the hills, but he is not a G-d of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am HaShem.' "
I Kings,20,29,"And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day. "
I Kings,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. "
I Kings,20,31,"And his servants said unto him: 'Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.' "
I Kings,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: 'Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.' And he said: 'Is he yet alive? he is my brother.' "
I Kings,20,33,"Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from him; and they said: 'Thy brother Ben-hadad.' Then he said: 'Go ye, bring him.' Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot. "
I Kings,20,34,"And Ben-hadad said unto him: 'The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.' 'And I ,said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant.' So he made a covenant with him, and let him go. "
I Kings,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of HaShem: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man refused to smite him. "
I Kings,20,36,"Then said he unto him: 'Because thou hast not heartened to the voice of HaShem, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.' And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew him. "
I Kings,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him. "
I Kings,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. "
I Kings,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: 'Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. "
I Kings,20,40,"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.' And the king of Israel said unto him: 'So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.' "
I Kings,20,41,"And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. "
I Kings,20,42,"And he said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.' "
I Kings,20,43,"And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria. "
I Kings,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria. "
I Kings,21,2,"And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying: 'Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.' "
I Kings,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab: 'The HaShem forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.' "
I Kings,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said: 'I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.' And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. "
I Kings,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him: 'Why is thy spirit so sullen, that thou eatest no bread?' "
I Kings,21,6,"And he said unto her: 'Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him: Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it; and he answered: I will not give thee my vineyard.' "
I Kings,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him: 'Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.' "
I Kings,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth. "
I Kings,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying: 'Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people; "
I Kings,21,10,"and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying: Thou didst curse G-d and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he die.' "
I Kings,21,11,"And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. "
I Kings,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. "
I Kings,21,13,"And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him; and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying: 'Naboth did curse G-d and the king.' Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. "
I Kings,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth is stoned, and is dead.' "
I Kings,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab: 'Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.' "
I Kings,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. "
I Kings,21,17,"And the word of HaShem came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "
I Kings,21,18,"'Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it. "
I Kings,21,19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith HaShem: Hast thou killed, and also taken possessions? and thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith HaShem: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.' "
I Kings,21,20,"And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?' And he answered: 'I have found thee; because thou hast given thyself over to do that which is evil in the sight of HaShem. "
I Kings,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. "
I Kings,21,22,"And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked Me, and hast made Israel to sin. "
I Kings,21,23,"And of Jezebel also spoke HaShem, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the moat of Jezreel. "
I Kings,21,24,Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.' 
I Kings,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ahab, who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. "
I Kings,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom HaShem cast out before the children of Israel. "
I Kings,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softy. "
I Kings,21,28,"And the word of HaShem came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "
I Kings,21,29,"'Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me? because he humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.' "
I Kings,22,1,And they continued three years without war between Aram and Israel. 
I Kings,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. "
I Kings,22,3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants: 'Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Aram?' "
I Kings,22,4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat: 'Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?' And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: 'I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.' "
I Kings,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: 'Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of HaShem today.' "
I Kings,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them: 'Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And they said: 'Go up; for HaShem will deliver it into the hand of the king.' "
I Kings,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here besides a prophet of HaShem, that we might inquire of him?' "
I Kings,22,8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of HaShem, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.' And Jehoshaphat said: 'Let not the king say so.' "
I Kings,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: 'Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.' "
I Kings,22,10,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing-floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. "
I Kings,22,11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: 'Thus saith HaShem: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.' "
I Kings,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: 'Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for HaShem will deliver it into the hand of the king.' "
I Kings,22,13,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying: 'Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth, let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.' "
I Kings,22,14,"And Micaiah said: 'As HaShem liveth, what HaShem saith unto me, that will I speak.' "
I Kings,22,15,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: 'Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?' And he answered him: 'Go up, and prosper; and HaShem will deliver it into the hand of the king.' "
I Kings,22,16,And the king said unto him: 'How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of HaShem?' 
I Kings,22,17,"And he said: 'I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and HaShem said: These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.' "
I Kings,22,18,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: 'Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?' "
I Kings,22,19,"And he said: 'Therefore hear thou the word of HaShem. I saw HaShem sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left. "
I Kings,22,20,"And HaShem said: Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead. And one said: On this manner; and another said: On that manner. "
I Kings,22,21,"And there came forth the spirit, and stood before HaShem, and said: I will entice him. "
I Kings,22,22,"And HaShem said unto him: Wherewith? And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so. "
I Kings,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, HaShem hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and HaShem hath spoken evil concerning thee.' "
I Kings,22,24,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the check, and said: 'Which way went the spirit of HaShem from me to speak unto thee?' "
I Kings,22,25,"And Micaiah said: 'Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.' "
I Kings,22,26,"And the king of Israel said: 'Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; "
I Kings,22,27,"and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I come in peace.' "
I Kings,22,28,"And Micaiah said: 'If thou return at all in peace, HaShem hath not spoken by me.' And he said: 'Hear, ye peoples, all of you.' "
I Kings,22,29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
I Kings,22,30,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.' And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. "
I Kings,22,31,"Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying: 'Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.' "
I Kings,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: 'Surely it is the king of Israel'; and they turned aside to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out. "
I Kings,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. "
I Kings,22,34,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot: 'Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.' "
I Kings,22,35,"And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Arameans, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. "
I Kings,22,36,"And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying: 'Every man to his city, and every man to his country.' "
I Kings,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. "
I Kings,22,38,And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; the harlots also washed themselves there; according unto the word of HaShem which He spoke. 
I Kings,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
I Kings,22,40,So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
I Kings,22,41,And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
I Kings,22,42,Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
I Kings,22,43,
I Kings,22,44,howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 
I Kings,22,45,And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
I Kings,22,46,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
I Kings,22,47,"And the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. "
I Kings,22,48,And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 
I Kings,22,49,Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
I Kings,22,50,Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat: 'Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.' But Jehoshaphat would not. 
I Kings,22,51,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. "
I Kings,22,52,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. "
I Kings,22,53,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin. "
I Kings,22,54,"And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked HaShem, the G-d of Israel, according to all that his father had done.  "
II Kings,1,1,AND MOAB rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
II Kings,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them: 'Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this sickness.' "
II Kings,1,3,"But an angel of HaShem said to Elijah the Tishbite: 'Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them: Is it because there is no G-d in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? "
II Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith HaShem: Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.' And Elijah departed. "
II Kings,1,5,"And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them: 'Why is it that ye are returned?' "
II Kings,1,6,"And they said unto him: 'There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us: Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him: Thus saith HaShem: Is it because there is no G-d in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.' "
II Kings,1,7,"And he said unto them: 'What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?' "
II Kings,1,8,"And they answered him: 'He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.' And he said: 'It is Elijah the Tishbite.' "
II Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him; and, behold, he sat on the top of the hill. And he spoke unto him: `O man of G-d, the king hath said: Come down.' "
II Kings,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty: 'If I be a man of G-d, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.' And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. "
II Kings,1,11,"And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him: 'O man of G-d, thus hath the king said: Come down quickly.' "
II Kings,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them: 'If I be a man of G-d, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.' And the fire of G-d came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. "
II Kings,1,13,"And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him: 'O man of G-d, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. "
II Kings,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight' "
II Kings,1,15,"And the angel of HaShem said unto Elijah: 'Go down with him; be not afraid of him.' And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. "
II Kings,1,16,"And he said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no G-d in Israel to inquire of His word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whether thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.' "
II Kings,1,17,So he died according to the word of HaShem which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 
II Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,2,1,"And it came to pass, when HaShem would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. "
II Kings,2,2,"And Elijah said unto Elisha: 'Tarry here, I pray thee; for HaShem hath sent me as far as Beth-el.' And Elisha said: 'As HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they went down to Beth-el.-- "
II Kings,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that HaShem will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he said: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'-- "
II Kings,2,4,"And Elijah said unto him: 'Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for HaShem hath sent me to Jericho.' And he said: 'As HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they came to Jericho.-- "
II Kings,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that HaShem will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he answered: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'-- "
II Kings,2,6,"And Elijah said unto him: 'Tarry here, I pray thee; for HaShem hath sent me to the Jordan.' And he said: 'As HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And they two went on. "
II Kings,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan. "
II Kings,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. "
II Kings,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: 'Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee.' And Elisha said: 'I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.' "
II Kings,2,10,"And he said: 'Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.' "
II Kings,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both assunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. "
II Kings,2,12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cried: 'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!' And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. "
II Kings,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. "
II Kings,2,14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said: 'Where is HaShem, the G-d of Elijah?' and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over. "
II Kings,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho some way off saw him, they said: 'The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.' And they came to meet him, and bowed down to the ground before him. "
II Kings,2,16,"And they said unto him: 'Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of HaShem hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.' And he said: 'Ye shall not send.' "
II Kings,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said: 'Send.' They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. "
II Kings,2,18,"And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them: 'Did I not say unto you: Go not?' "
II Kings,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha: 'Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth. "
II Kings,2,20,"And he said: 'Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.' And they brought it to him. "
II Kings,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said: 'Thus saith HaShem: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.' "
II Kings,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. "
II Kings,2,23,"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him: 'Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.' "
II Kings,2,24,"And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of HaShem. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them. "
II Kings,2,25,"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. "
II Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. "
II Kings,3,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made. "
II Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. "
II Kings,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams. "
II Kings,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. "
II Kings,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. "
II Kings,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying: `The king of Moab hath rebelled against me; wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?' And he said: 'I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.' "
II Kings,3,8,And he said: 'Which way shall we go up?' And he answered: 'The way of the wilderness of Edom.' 
II Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey; and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them. "
II Kings,3,10,And the king of Israel said: 'Alas! for HaShem hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.' 
II Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here a prophet of HaShem, that we may inquire of HaShem by him?' And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said: 'Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.' "
II Kings,3,12,And Jehoshaphat said: 'The word of HaShem is with him.' So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. 
II Kings,3,13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel: 'What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.' And the king of Israel said unto him: 'Nay; for HaShem hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.' "
II Kings,3,14,"And Elisha said: 'As HaShem of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. "
II Kings,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel.' And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of HaShem came upon him. "
II Kings,3,16,And he said: 'Thus saith HaShem: Make this valley full of trenches. 
II Kings,3,17,"For thus saith HaShem: Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water; and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts. "
II Kings,3,18,And this is but a light thing in the sight of HaShem; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. 
II Kings,3,19,"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.' "
II Kings,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of making the offering, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. "
II Kings,3,21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood on the border. "
II Kings,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water some way off as red as blood; "
II Kings,3,23,"and they said: 'This is blood: the kings have surely fought together, and they have smitten each man his fellow; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.' "
II Kings,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them. And they smote the land, even Moab, mightily. "
II Kings,3,25,"And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees; until there was left only Kir-hareseth with the stones of the wall thereof; so the slingers encompassed it, and smote it. "
II Kings,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not. "
II Kings,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land. "
II Kings,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying: 'Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear HaShem; and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.' "
II Kings,4,2,"And Elisha said unto her: `What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house?' And she said: 'Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.' "
II Kings,4,3,"Then he said: 'Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. "
II Kings,4,4,"And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.' "
II Kings,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out. "
II Kings,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son: 'Bring me yet a vessel.' And he said unto her: 'There is not a vessel more.' And the oil stayed. "
II Kings,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of G-d. And he said: 'Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.' "
II Kings,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. "
II Kings,4,9,"And she said unto her husband: 'Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of G-d, that passeth by us continually. "
II Kings,4,10,"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the roof; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick; and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.' "
II Kings,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber and lay there. "
II Kings,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant: 'Call this Shunammite.' And when he had called her, she stood before him. "
II Kings,4,13,"And he said unto him: `Say now unto her: Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?' And she answered: 'I dwell among mine own people.' "
II Kings,4,14,"And he said: 'What then is to be done for her?' And Gehazi answered: 'Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.' "
II Kings,4,15,"And he said: 'Call her.' And when he had called her, she stood in the door. "
II Kings,4,16,"And he said: 'At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son.' And she said: 'Nay, my lord, thou man of G-d, do not lie unto thy handmaid.' "
II Kings,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her. "
II Kings,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. "
II Kings,4,19,"And he said unto his father: 'My head, my head.' And he said to his servant: 'Carry him to his mother.' "
II Kings,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. "
II Kings,4,21,"And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of G-d, and shut the door upon him, and went out. "
II Kings,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said: 'Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of G-d, and come back.' "
II Kings,4,23,And he said: Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? it is neither new moon nor sabbath.' And she said: 'It shall be well.' 
II Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant: 'Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.' "
II Kings,4,25,"So she went, and came unto the man of G-d to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of G-d saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant: 'Behold, yonder is that Shunammite. "
II Kings,4,26,"Run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her: Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child?' And she answered: 'It is well.' "
II Kings,4,27,"And when she came to the man of G-d to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of G-d said: 'Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her; and HaShem hath hid it from me, and hath not told Me.' "
II Kings,4,28,Then she said: 'Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?' 
II Kings,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi: 'Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way; if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.' "
II Kings,4,30,"And the mother of the child said: 'As HaShem liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And he arose, and followed her. "
II Kings,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: 'The child is not awaked.' "
II Kings,4,32,"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. "
II Kings,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto HaShem. "
II Kings,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. "
II Kings,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. "
II Kings,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said: 'Call this Shunammite.' So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said: 'Take up thy son.' "
II Kings,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed down to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out. "
II Kings,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant: 'Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.' "
II Kings,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not. "
II Kings,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said: 'O man of G-d, there is death in the pot.' And they could not eat thereof. "
II Kings,4,41,"But he said: 'Then bring meal.' And he cast it into the pot; and he said: 'Pour out for the people, that they may eat.' And there was no harm in the pot. "
II Kings,4,42,"And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of G-d bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said: 'Give unto the people, that they may eat.' "
II Kings,4,43,"And his servant said: 'How should I set this before a hundred men?' But he said: 'Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith HaShem: They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.' "
II Kings,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of HaShem. "
II Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and held in esteem, because by him HaShem had given victory unto Aram; he was also a mighty man of valour, but he was a leper. "
II Kings,5,2,"And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. "
II Kings,5,3,And she said unto her mistress: 'Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.' 
II Kings,5,4,"And he went in, and told his lord, saying: `Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.' "
II Kings,5,5,"And the king of Aram said: 'Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.' And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. "
II Kings,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying: 'And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.' "
II Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said: 'Am I G-d, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh an occasion against me.' "
II Kings,5,8,"And it was so, when Elisha the man of G-d heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying: 'Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.' "
II Kings,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. "
II Kings,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying: 'Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come back to thee, and thou shalt be clean.' "
II Kings,5,11,"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said: 'Behold, I thought: He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of HaShem his G-d, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper. "
II Kings,5,12,"Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?' So he turned, and went away in a rage. "
II Kings,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said: 'My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee: Wash, and be clean?' "
II Kings,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of G-d; and his flesh came back like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. "
II Kings,5,15,"And he returned to the man of G-d, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said: 'Behold now, I know that there is no G-d in all the earth, but in Israel; now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.' "
II Kings,5,16,"But he said: 'As HaShem liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.' And he urged him to take it; but he refused. "
II Kings,5,17,"And Naaman said: 'If not, yet I pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto HaShem. "
II Kings,5,18,"In this thing HaShem pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, HaShem pardon thy servant in this thing.' "
II Kings,5,19,And he said unto him: 'Go in peace.' So he departed from him some way. 
II Kings,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of G-d, said: 'Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; as HaShem liveth, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.' "
II Kings,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said: 'Is all well?' "
II Kings,5,22,"And he said: 'All is well. My master hath sent me, saying: Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.' "
II Kings,5,23,"And Naaman said: 'Be content, take two talents.' And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him. "
II Kings,5,24,"And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed. "
II Kings,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him: 'Whence comest thou, Gehazi?' And he said: 'Thy servant went no whither.' "
II Kings,5,26,"And he said unto him: 'Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants? "
II Kings,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.' And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. "
II Kings,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha: 'Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us. "
II Kings,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.' And he answered: 'Go ye.' "
II Kings,6,3,"And one said: 'Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.' And he answered: 'I will go.' "
II Kings,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood. "
II Kings,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said: 'Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.' "
II Kings,6,6,"And the man of G-d said: 'Where fell it?' And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim. "
II Kings,6,7,"And he said: 'Take it up to thee.' So he put out his hand, and took it. "
II Kings,6,8,"Now the king of Aram warred against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying: `In such and such a place shall be my camp.' "
II Kings,6,9,"And the man of G-d sent unto the king of Israel, saying: 'Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Arameans are coming down.' "
II Kings,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of G-d told him and warned him of; and he guarded himself there, not once nor twice. "
II Kings,6,11,"And the heart of the king of Aram was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them: 'Will ye not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?' "
II Kings,6,12,"And one of his servants said: 'Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.' "
II Kings,6,13,"And he said: 'Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him.' And it was told him, saying: 'Behold, he is in Dothan.' "
II Kings,6,14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host; and they came by night, and compassed the city about. "
II Kings,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of G-d was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him: 'Alas, my master! how shall we do?' "
II Kings,6,16,And he answered: 'Fear not: for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.' 
II Kings,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said: `HaShem, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may see.' And HaShem opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw; and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. "
II Kings,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto HaShem, and said: 'Smite this people, I pray Thee, with blindness.' And He smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. "
II Kings,6,19,"And Elisha said unto them: 'This is not the way, neither is this the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek.' And he led them to Samaria. "
II Kings,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said: 'HaShem, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.' And HaShem opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. "
II Kings,6,21,"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them: 'My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?' "
II Kings,6,22,"And he answered: 'Thou shalt not smite them; hast thou taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow those whom thou wouldest smite? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.' "
II Kings,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Aram came no more into the land of Israel. "
II Kings,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. "
II Kings,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria; and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. "
II Kings,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying: 'Help, my lord, O king.' "
II Kings,6,27,"And he said: 'If HaShem do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshingfloor, or out of the winepress?' "
II Kings,6,28,"And the king said unto her: 'What aileth thee?' And she answered: 'This woman said unto me: Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow. "
II Kings,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him; and I said unto her on the next day: Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.' "
II Kings,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes--now he was passing by upon the wall--and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. "
II Kings,6,31,"Then he said: 'G-d do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.' "
II Kings,6,32,"But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him; but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders: 'See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him; is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?' "
II Kings,6,33,"And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him; and the king said: 'Behold, this evil is of HaShem; why should I wait for HaShem any longer?' "
II Kings,7,1,"And Elisha said: 'Hear ye the word of HaShem; thus saith HaShem: To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.' "
II Kings,7,2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of G-d, and said: 'Behold, if HaShem should make windows in heaven, might this thing be?' And he said: 'Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.' "
II Kings,7,3,Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said one to another: 'Why sit we here until we die? 
II Kings,7,4,"If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.' "
II Kings,7,5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Arameans; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no man there. "
II Kings,7,6,"For the L-rd had made the host of the Arameans to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host; and they said one to another: 'Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.' "
II Kings,7,7,"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. "
II Kings,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. "
II Kings,7,9,"Then they said one to another: 'We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace; if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.' "
II Kings,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porters of the city; and they told them, saying. 'We came to the camp of the Arameans, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.' "
II Kings,7,11,"And the porters called, and they told it to the king's household within. "
II Kings,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants: 'I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying: When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.' "
II Kings,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said: 'Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city-- behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed--and let us send and see.' "
II Kings,7,14,"They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Arameans, saying: 'Go and see.' "
II Kings,7,15,"And they went after them unto the Jordan; and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Arameans had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. "
II Kings,7,16,"And the people went out, and spoiled the camp of the Arameans. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of HaShem. "
II Kings,7,17,"And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of G-d had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. "
II Kings,7,18,"And it came to pass, as the man of G-d had spoken to the king, saying: 'Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria'; "
II Kings,7,19,"and that captain answered the man of G-d, and said: 'Now, behold, if HaShem should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?' and he said: `Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof'; "
II Kings,7,20,"it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died. "
II Kings,8,1,"Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying: 'Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for HaShem hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.' "
II Kings,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of G-d; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. "
II Kings,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines; and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. "
II Kings,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of G-d, saying: 'Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.' "
II Kings,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said: 'My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.' "
II Kings,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying: 'Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.' "
II Kings,8,7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram was sick; and it was told him, saying. 'The man of G-d is come hither.' "
II Kings,8,8,"And the king said unto Hazael: 'Take a present in thy hand, and go meet the man of G-d, and inquire of HaShem by him, saying: Shall I recover of this sickness?' "
II Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said: 'Thy son Ben-hadad king of Aram hath sent me to thee, saying: Shall I recover of this sickness?' "
II Kings,8,10,"And Elisha said unto him: 'Go, say unto him: Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit HaShem hath shown me that he shall surely die.' "
II Kings,8,11,"And he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him, until he was ashamed; and the man of G-d wept. "
II Kings,8,12,"And Hazael said: 'Why weepeth my lord?' And he answered: 'Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.' "
II Kings,8,13,"And Hazael said: 'But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?' And Elisha answered: 'The HaShem hath shown me that thou shalt be king over Aram.' "
II Kings,8,14,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him: 'What said Elisha to thee?' And he answered: 'He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.' "
II Kings,8,15,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. "
II Kings,8,17,Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
II Kings,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem. "
II Kings,8,19,"Howbeit HaShem would not destroy Judah, for David His servant's sake, as He promised him to give unto him a lamp and to his children alway. "
II Kings,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. "
II Kings,8,21,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents. "
II Kings,8,22,"Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time. "
II Kings,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,8,24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,8,25,In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 
II Kings,8,26,Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 
II Kings,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. "
II Kings,8,28,And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. 
II Kings,8,29,"And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. "
II Kings,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him: 'Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. "
II Kings,9,2,"And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber. "
II Kings,9,3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say: Thus saith HaShem: I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.' "
II Kings,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. "
II Kings,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said: 'I have an errand to thee, O captain.' And Jehu said: 'Unto which of us all?' And he said: 'To thee, O captain.' "
II Kings,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I have anointed thee king over the people of HaShem, even over Israel. "
II Kings,9,7,"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of HaShem, at the hand of Jezebel. "
II Kings,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. "
II Kings,9,9,"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah. "
II Kings,9,10,"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.' And he opened the door, and fled. "
II Kings,9,11,Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord; and one said unto him: 'Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?' And he said unto them: 'Ye know the man and what his talk was.' 
II Kings,9,12,"And they said: 'It is false; tell us now.' And he said: `Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying: Thus saith HaShem: I have anointed thee king over Israel.' "
II Kings,9,13,"Then they hastened, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the horn, saying: 'Jehu is king.' "
II Kings,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. --Now Joram had been guarding Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Aram; "
II Kings,9,15,"but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. --And Jehu said: 'If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.' "
II Kings,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. "
II Kings,9,17,"Now the watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said: 'I see a company.' And Joram said: 'Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say: Is it peace?' "
II Kings,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said: 'Thus saith the king: Is it peace?' And Jehu said: 'What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.' And the watchman told, saying: 'The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.' "
II Kings,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said: 'Thus saith the king: Is it peace?' And Jehu answered: `What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.' "
II Kings,9,20,"And the watchman told, saying: 'He came even unto them, and cometh not back; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.' "
II Kings,9,21,"And Joram said: 'Make ready.' And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. "
II Kings,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said: 'Is it peace, Jehu?' And he answered: 'What peace, so long as the harlotries of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?' "
II Kings,9,23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah: `There is treachery, O Ahaziah.' "
II Kings,9,24,"And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. "
II Kings,9,25,"Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain: 'Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, HaShem pronounced this burden against him: "
II Kings,9,26,"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith HaShem; and I will requite thee in this plot, saith HaShem. Now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground, according to the word of HaShem.' "
II Kings,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said: 'Smite him also in the chariot'; and they smote him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. "
II Kings,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. "
II Kings,9,29,And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. 
II Kings,9,30,"And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window. "
II Kings,9,31,"And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said: 'Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master's murderer?' "
II Kings,9,32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said: 'Who is on my side? who?' And there looked out to him two or three officers. "
II Kings,9,33,"And he said: 'Throw her down.' So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and she was trodden under foot. "
II Kings,9,34,"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said: 'Look now after this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.' "
II Kings,9,35,"And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. "
II Kings,9,36,"Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said: 'This is the word of HaShem, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel; "
II Kings,9,37,and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say: This is Jezebel.'  
II Kings,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up the sons of Ahab, saying: "
II Kings,10,2,"'And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and armour; "
II Kings,10,3,"look ye out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.' "
II Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: 'Behold, the two kings stood not before him; how then shall we stand?' "
II Kings,10,5,"And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying: 'We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king; do thou that which is good in thine eyes.' "
II Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying: 'If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time.' Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up. "
II Kings,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel. "
II Kings,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying: `They have brought the heads of the king's sons.' And he said: 'Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.' "
II Kings,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people: 'Ye are righteous; behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these? "
II Kings,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of HaShem, which HaShem spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for HaShem hath done that which He spoke by His servant Elijah.' "
II Kings,10,11,"So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until there was left him none remaining. "
II Kings,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way, "
II Kings,10,13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said: 'Who are ye?' And they answered: 'We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.' "
II Kings,10,14,"And he said: 'Take them alive.' And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them. "
II Kings,10,15,"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him: 'Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?' And Jehonadab answered: 'It is.' 'If it be, said Jehu, give me thy hand.' And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. "
II Kings,10,16,"And he said: 'Come with me, and see my zeal for HaShem.' So they made him ride in his chariot. "
II Kings,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke to Elijah. "
II Kings,10,18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them: 'Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. "
II Kings,10,19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests, let none be wanting; for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.' But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. "
II Kings,10,20,And Jehu said: 'Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.' And they proclaimed it. 
II Kings,10,21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another. "
II Kings,10,22,And he said unto him that was over the vestry: 'Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.' And he brought them forth vestments. 
II Kings,10,23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal: 'Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of HaShem, but the worshippers of Baal only.' "
II Kings,10,24,"And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said: 'If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, his life shall be for the life of him.' "
II Kings,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains: 'Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.' And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. "
II Kings,10,26,"And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them. "
II Kings,10,27,"And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day. "
II Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 
II Kings,10,29,"Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan. "
II Kings,10,30,"And HaShem said unto Jehu: 'Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in Mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in My heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.' "
II Kings,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, with all his heart; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,10,32,In those days HaShem began to cut Israel short; and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel: 
II Kings,10,33,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. "
II Kings,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,10,35,And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,10,36,And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years. 
II Kings,11,1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. "
II Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bed-chamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. "
II Kings,11,3,And he was with her hid in the house of HaShem six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land. 
II Kings,11,4,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds, of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of HaShem; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of HaShem, and showed them the king's son. "
II Kings,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying: 'This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, and that keep the watch of the king's house-- "
II Kings,11,6,"now another third part was at the gate Sur, and another third part at the gate behind the guard--shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier. "
II Kings,11,7,"And the other two parts of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of HaShem about the king. "
II Kings,11,8,"And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain; and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.' "
II Kings,11,9,"And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. "
II Kings,11,10,"And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spear and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. "
II Kings,11,12,"Then he brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown and the insignia; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said: 'Long live the king.' "
II Kings,11,13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,11,14,"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood on the platform, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried: 'Treason, treason.' "
II Kings,11,15,"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them: 'Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword'; for the priest said: `Let her not be slain in the house of HaShem.' "
II Kings,11,16,So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house; and there was she slain. 
II Kings,11,17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between HaShem and the king and the people, that they should be HaShem'S people; between the king also and the people. "
II Kings,11,18,"And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,11,19,"And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of HaShem, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. "
II Kings,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; and they slew Athaliah with the sword at the king's house. "
II Kings,12,1,Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. 
II Kings,12,2,In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
II Kings,12,3,And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
II Kings,12,4,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 
II Kings,12,5,"And Jehoash said to the priests: 'All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of HaShem, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of HaShem, "
II Kings,12,6,"let the priests take it to them, every man from him that bestoweth it upon him; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.' "
II Kings,12,7,"But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. "
II Kings,12,8,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them: 'Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no longer money from them that bestow it upon you, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.' "
II Kings,12,9,"And the priests consented that they should take no longer money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house. "
II Kings,12,10,"And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of HaShem; and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,12,11,"And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,12,12,"And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of HaShem; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of HaShem, "
II Kings,12,13,"and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of HaShem, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. "
II Kings,12,14,"But there were not made for the house of HaShem cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of HaShem; "
II Kings,12,15,"for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,12,16,"Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully. "
II Kings,12,17,"The forfeit money, and the sin money, was not brought into the house of HaShem; it was the priests. "
II Kings,12,18,"Then Hazael king of Aram went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. "
II Kings,12,19,"And Jehoash king Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of HaShem, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem. "
II Kings,12,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,12,21,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at Beth-millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla. "
II Kings,12,22,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,13,1,"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. "
II Kings,13,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. "
II Kings,13,3,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, continually. "
II Kings,13,4,"And Jehoahaz besought HaShem, and HaShem hearkened unto him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Aram oppressed them.-- "
II Kings,13,5,"And HaShem gave Israel a deliverer, so that they went out from under the hand of the Arameans; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime. "
II Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein; and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.-- "
II Kings,13,7,"For there was not left to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Aram destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. "
II Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,13,9,And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,13,10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. "
II Kings,13,11,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein. "
II Kings,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,13,13,And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
II Kings,13,14,"Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he was to die; and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said: 'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!' "
II Kings,13,15,And Elisha said unto him: 'Take bow and arrows'; and he took unto him bow and arrows. 
II Kings,13,16,And he said to the king of Israel: 'Put thy hand upon the bow'; and he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king's hands. 
II Kings,13,17,"And he said: 'Open the window eastward'; and he opened it. Then Elisha said: 'Shoot'; and he shot. And he said: 'The HaShem'S arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory against Aram; for thou shalt smite the Arameans in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.' "
II Kings,13,18,"And he said: 'Take the arrows'; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel: 'Smite upon the ground'; and he smote thrice, and stayed. "
II Kings,13,19,"And the man of G-d was wroth with him, and said: 'Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Aram till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Aram but thrice.' "
II Kings,13,20,"And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites used to invade the land at the coming in of the year. "
II Kings,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. "
II Kings,13,22,And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
II Kings,13,23,"But HaShem was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither hath He cast them from His presence until now. "
II Kings,13,24,And Hazael king of Aram died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,13,25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel. "
II Kings,14,1,In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign. 
II Kings,14,2,He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
II Kings,14,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done. "
II Kings,14,4,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 
II Kings,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father; "
II Kings,14,6,"but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as HaShem commanded saying: 'The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.' "
II Kings,14,7,"He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day. "
II Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: 'Come, let us look one another in the face.' "
II Kings,14,9,"And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying: 'The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there passed by the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle. "
II Kings,14,10,"Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and will thy heart lift thee up? glory therein, and remain at home; for why shouldest thou meddle with evil, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? "
II Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. "
II Kings,14,12,And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 
II Kings,14,13,"And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. "
II Kings,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of HaShem, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. "
II Kings,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,14,16,"And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,14,17,And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
II Kings,14,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,14,19,"And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. "
II Kings,14,20,And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
II Kings,14,21,"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. "
II Kings,14,22,"He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. "
II Kings,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years. "
II Kings,14,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,14,25,"He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher. "
II Kings,14,26,"For HaShem saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel. "
II Kings,14,27,And HaShem said not that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 
II Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, for Judah in Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,14,29,"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,15,1,In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. 
II Kings,15,2,Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
II Kings,15,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. "
II Kings,15,4,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 
II Kings,15,5,"And HaShem smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart. And Jotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land. "
II Kings,15,6,"Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,15,7,And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,15,8,In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 
II Kings,15,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, as his fathers had done; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,15,10,"And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,15,11,"Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. "
II Kings,15,12,"This was the word of HaShem which He spoke unto Jehu, saying: 'Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.' And so it came to pass. "
II Kings,15,13,Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria. 
II Kings,15,14,"And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,15,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. "
II Kings,15,16,"Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah; because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. "
II Kings,15,17,"In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. "
II Kings,15,18,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,15,19,"There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. "
II Kings,15,20,"And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land. "
II Kings,15,21,"Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? "
II Kings,15,22,And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,15,23,"In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. "
II Kings,15,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,15,25,"And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the king's house, by Argob and by Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites; and he slew him, and reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,15,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. "
II Kings,15,27,"In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. "
II Kings,15,28,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. "
II Kings,15,29,"In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. "
II Kings,15,30,"And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. "
II Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. "
II Kings,15,32,In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. 
II Kings,15,33,Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 
II Kings,15,34,And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 
II Kings,15,35,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of HaShem. 
II Kings,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,15,37,"In those days HaShem began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. "
II Kings,15,38,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.  "
II Kings,16,1,In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 
II Kings,16,2,"Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of HaShem his G-d, like David his father. "
II Kings,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom HaShem cast out from before the children of Israel. "
II Kings,16,4,"And he sacrificed and offered in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. "
II Kings,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war; and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. "
II Kings,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath to Aram, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Edomites came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day. "
II Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying: 'I am thy servant and thy son; come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.' "
II Kings,16,8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of HaShem, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,16,9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin. "
II Kings,16,10,"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. "
II Kings,16,11,"And Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus. "
II Kings,16,12,"And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon. "
II Kings,16,13,"And he offered his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and dashed the blood of his peace-offerings against the altar. "
II Kings,16,14,"And the brazen altar, which was before HaShem, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of HaShem, and put it on the north side of his altar. "
II Kings,16,15,"And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying: 'Upon the great altar offer the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king's burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and dash against it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the brazen altar shall be for me to look to.' "
II Kings,16,16,"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. "
II Kings,16,17,"And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone. "
II Kings,16,18,"And the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he unto the house of HaShem, because of the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,16,20,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.  "
II Kings,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years. "
II Kings,17,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him. "
II Kings,17,3,"Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him presents. "
II Kings,17,4,"And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. "
II Kings,17,5,"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. "
II Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. "
II Kings,17,7,"And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against HaShem their G-d, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, "
II Kings,17,8,"and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom HaShem cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they practised; "
II Kings,17,9,"and the children of Israel did impute things that were not right unto HaShem their G-d, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city; "
II Kings,17,10,"and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every leafy tree; "
II Kings,17,11,"and there they offered in all the high places, as did the nations whom HaShem carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke HaShem; "
II Kings,17,12,"and they served idols, whereof HaShem had said unto them: 'Ye shall not do this thing'; "
II Kings,17,13,"yet HaShem forewarned Israel, and Judah, by the hand of every prophet, and of every seer, saying: 'Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by the hand of My servants the prophets'; "
II Kings,17,14,"notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in HaShem their G-d; "
II Kings,17,15,"and they rejected His statutes, and His covenant that He made with their fathers, and His testimonies wherewith He testified against them; and they went after things of nought, and became nought, and after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom HaShem had charged them that they should not do like them; "
II Kings,17,16,"and they forsook all the commandments of HaShem their G-d, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal; "
II Kings,17,17,"and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and gave themselves over to do that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him; "
II Kings,17,18,"that HaShem was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. "
II Kings,17,19,"Also Judah kept not the commandments of HaShem their G-d, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they practised. "
II Kings,17,20,"And HaShem rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight. "
II Kings,17,21,"For He rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drew Israel away from following HaShem, and made them sin a great sin. "
II Kings,17,22,And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; 
II Kings,17,23,"until HaShem removed Israel out of His sight, as He spoke by the hand of all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day. "
II Kings,17,24,"And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. "
II Kings,17,25,"And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not HaShem; therefore HaShem sent lions among them, which killed some of them. "
II Kings,17,26,"Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying: 'The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the G-d of the land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the land.' "
II Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying: 'Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the G-d of the land.' "
II Kings,17,28,"So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear HaShem. "
II Kings,17,29,"Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. "
II Kings,17,30,"And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, "
II Kings,17,31,"and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. "
II Kings,17,32,"So they feared HaShem, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. "
II Kings,17,33,"They feared HaShem, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away. "
II Kings,17,34,"Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not HaShem, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which HaShem commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel; "
II Kings,17,35,"with whom HaShem had made a covenant, and charged them, saying: 'Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them; "
II Kings,17,36,"but HaShem, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him shall ye fear, and Him shall ye worship, and to Him shall ye sacrifice; "
II Kings,17,37,"and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which He wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods; "
II Kings,17,38,and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods; 
II Kings,17,39,but HaShem your G-d shall ye fear; and He will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.' 
II Kings,17,40,"Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. "
II Kings,17,41,"So these nations feared HaShem, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children's children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day. "
II Kings,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. "
II Kings,18,2,Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
II Kings,18,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, according to all that David his father had done. "
II Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah; and he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did offer to it; and it was called Nehushtan."
II Kings,18,5,"He trusted in HaShem, the G-d of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him. "
II Kings,18,6,"For he cleaved to HaShem, he departed not from following Him, but kept His commandments, which HaShem commanded Moses. "
II Kings,18,7,"And HaShem was with him: whithersoever he went forth he prospered; and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. "
II Kings,18,8,"He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. "
II Kings,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. "
II Kings,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it; even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. "
II Kings,18,11,"And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes; "
II Kings,18,12,"because they hearkened not to the voice of HaShem their G-d, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of HaShem commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it. "
II Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. "
II Kings,18,14,"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying: 'I have offended; return from me; that which thou puttest on me will I bear.' And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. "
II Kings,18,15,"And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of HaShem, and in the treasures of the king's house. "
II Kings,18,16,"At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of HaShem, and from the door-posts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,18,17,"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fullers' field. "
II Kings,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. "
II Kings,18,19,"And Rab-shakeh said unto them: 'Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? "
II Kings,18,20,"Sayest thou that a mere word of the lips is counsel and strength for the war? Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me? "
II Kings,18,21,"Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. "
II Kings,18,22,"But if ye say unto me: We trust in HaShem our G-d; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? "
II Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. "
II Kings,18,24,"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my masters servants? and yet thou puttest thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! "
II Kings,18,25,"Am I now come up without HaShem against this place to destroy it? HaShem said unto me: Go up against this land, destroy it.' "
II Kings,18,26,"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh: 'Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language; for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.' "
II Kings,18,27,"But Rab-shakeh said unto them: 'Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?' "
II Kings,18,28,"Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying: 'Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,18,29,Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand; 
II Kings,18,30,"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in HaShem, saying: HaShem will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,18,31,"Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; "
II Kings,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die; and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying: HaShem will deliver us. "
II Kings,18,33,Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
II Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? "
II Kings,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that HaShem should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?' "
II Kings,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying: 'Answer him not.' "
II Kings,18,37,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.  "
II Kings,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,19,2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. "
II Kings,19,3,"And they said unto him: 'Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. "
II Kings,19,4,"It may be HaShem thy G-d will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living G-d, and will rebuke the words which HaShem thy G-d hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.' "
II Kings,19,5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
II Kings,19,6,"And Isaiah said unto them: 'Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith HaShem: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. "
II Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.' "
II Kings,19,8,"So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. "
II Kings,19,9,"And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: 'Behold, he is come out to fight against thee'; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying: "
II Kings,19,10,"'Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy G-d in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
II Kings,19,11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? "
II Kings,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? "
II Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?' "
II Kings,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of HaShem, and spread it before HaShem. "
II Kings,19,15,"And Hezekiah prayed before HaShem, and said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the G-d, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. "
II Kings,19,16,"Incline Thine ear, O HaShem, and hear; open Thine eyes, O HaShem, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to taunt the living G-d. "
II Kings,19,17,"Of a truth, HaShem, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, "
II Kings,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. "
II Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, O HaShem our G-d, save Thou us, I beseech Thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art HaShem G-d, even Thou only.' "
II Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee. "
II Kings,19,21,This is the word that HaShem hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
II Kings,19,22,"Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel! "
II Kings,19,23,"By the messengers thou hast taunted the L-rd, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypresses thereof; and I have entered into his farthest lodge, the forest of his fruitful field. "
II Kings,19,24,"I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt. "
II Kings,19,25,"Hast thou not heard? long ago I made it, in ancient times I fashioned it; now have I brought it to pass, yea, it is done; that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps. "
II Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up. "
II Kings,19,27,"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against Me. "
II Kings,19,28,"Because of thy raging against Me, and for that thy tumult is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. "
II Kings,19,29,"And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. "
II Kings,19,30,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. "
II Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of HaShem of hosts shall perform this. "
II Kings,19,32,"Therefore thus saith HaShem concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it. "
II Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith HaShem. "
II Kings,19,34,"For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.' "
II Kings,19,35,"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of HaShem went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. "
II Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. "
II Kings,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,20,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.' "
II Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto HaShem, saying: "
II Kings,20,3,"`Remember now, O HaShem, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore. "
II Kings,20,4,"And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out of the inner court of the city, that the word of HaShem came to him, saying: "
II Kings,20,5,"'Return, and say to Hezekiah the prince of My people: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,20,6,"And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.' "
II Kings,20,7,"And Isaiah said: 'Take a cake of figs.' And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. "
II Kings,20,8,"And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah: 'What shall be the sign that HaShem will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of HaShem the third day?' "
II Kings,20,9,"And Isaiah said: 'This shall be the sign unto thee from HaShem, that HaShem will do the thing that He hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? "
II Kings,20,10,"And Hezekiah answered: `It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.' "
II Kings,20,11,"And Isaiah the prophet cried unto HaShem; and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz. "
II Kings,20,12,"At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. "
II Kings,20,13,"And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. "
II Kings,20,14,"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him: 'What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?' And Hezekiah said: `They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.' "
II Kings,20,15,And he said: 'What have they seen in thy house?' And Hezekiah answered: 'All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.' 
II Kings,20,16,And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah: 'Hear the word of HaShem. 
II Kings,20,17,"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith HaShem. "
II Kings,20,18,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.' "
II Kings,20,19,"Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: 'Good is the word of HaShem which thou hast spoken.' He said moreover: 'Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?' "
II Kings,20,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,20,21,And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,21,1,Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzi-bah. 
II Kings,21,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, after the abominations of the nations, whom HaShem cast out before the children of Israel. "
II Kings,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. "
II Kings,21,4,"And he built altars in the house of HaShem, whereof HaShem said: 'In Jerusalem will I put My name.' "
II Kings,21,5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of HaShem. 
II Kings,21,6,"And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit: he wrought much evil in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him. "
II Kings,21,7,"And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which HaShem said to David and to Solomon his son: 'In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name for ever; "
II Kings,21,8,"neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.' "
II Kings,21,9,"But they hearkened not; and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations, whom HaShem destroyed before the children of Israel. "
II Kings,21,10,"And HaShem spoke by His servants the prophets, saying: "
II Kings,21,11,"'Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols; "
II Kings,21,12,"therefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. "
II Kings,21,13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. "
II Kings,21,14,"And I will cast off the remnant of Mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; "
II Kings,21,15,"because they have done that which is evil in My sight, and have provoked Me, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.' "
II Kings,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of HaShem. "
II Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,21,18,"And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead. "
II Kings,21,19,Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
II Kings,21,20,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, as did Manasseh his father. "
II Kings,21,21,"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them. "
II Kings,21,22,"And he forsook HaShem, the G-d of his fathers, and walked not in the way of HaShem. "
II Kings,21,23,"And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house. "
II Kings,21,24,But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
II Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,21,26,And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,22,1,Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 
II Kings,22,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. "
II Kings,22,3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of HaShem, saying. "
II Kings,22,4,"'Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of HaShem, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people; "
II Kings,22,5,"and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of HaShem; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of HaShem, to repair the breaches of the house; "
II Kings,22,6,"unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons; and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.'-- "
II Kings,22,7,Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully. 
II Kings,22,8,"And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe: 'I have found the book of the Law in the house of HaShem.' And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it. "
II Kings,22,9,"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought back word unto the king, and said: `Thy servants have poured out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of HaShem.' "
II Kings,22,10,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying: 'Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.' And Shaphan read it before the king. "
II Kings,22,11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the Law, that he rent his clothes. "
II Kings,22,12,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying: "
II Kings,22,13,"'Go ye, inquire of HaShem for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of HaShem that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.' "
II Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe--now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter--and they spoke with her. "
II Kings,22,15,"And she said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me: "
II Kings,22,16,"Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read; "
II Kings,22,17,"because they have forsaken Me, and have offered unto other gods, that they might provoke Me with all the work of their hands; therefore My wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched. "
II Kings,22,18,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of HaShem, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard, "
II Kings,22,19,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before HaShem, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become an astonishment and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me, I also have heard thee, saith HaShem. "
II Kings,22,20,"Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.' And they brought back word unto the king. "
II Kings,23,1,"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. "
II Kings,23,2,"And the king went up to the house of HaShem, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,23,3,"And the king stood on the platform, and made a covenant before HaShem, to walk after HaShem, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people stood to the covenant. "
II Kings,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of HaShem all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el. "
II Kings,23,5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to offer in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that offered unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. "
II Kings,23,6,"And he brought out the Asherah from the house of HaShem, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the common people. "
II Kings,23,7,"And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of HaShem, where the women wove coverings for the Asherah. "
II Kings,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand as he entered the gate of the city. "
II Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of HaShem in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren. "
II Kings,23,10,"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. "
II Kings,23,11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of HaShem, by the chamber of Nethan-melech the officer, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. "
II Kings,23,12,"And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of HaShem, did the king break down, and beat them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. "
II Kings,23,13,"And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the detestation of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. "
II Kings,23,14,"And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men. "
II Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and stamped it small to powder, and burned the Asherah. "
II Kings,23,16,"And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of HaShem which the man of G-d proclaimed, who proclaimed these things. "
II Kings,23,17,"Then he said: 'What monument is that which I see' And the men of the city told him: 'It is the sepulchre of the man of G-d, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.' "
II Kings,23,18,"And he said: 'Let him be; let no man move his bones.' So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. "
II Kings,23,19,"And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke HaShem, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el. "
II Kings,23,20,"And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem. "
II Kings,23,21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying: 'Keep the passover unto HaShem your G-d, as it is written in this book of the covenant.' "
II Kings,23,22,"For there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; "
II Kings,23,23,but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to HaShem in Jerusalem. 
II Kings,23,24,"Moreover them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the detestable things that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of HaShem. "
II Kings,23,25,"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to HaShem with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. "
II Kings,23,26,"Notwithstanding HaShem turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked Him. "
II Kings,23,27,"And HaShem said: 'I will remove Judah also out of My sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said: My name shall be there.' "
II Kings,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. "
II Kings,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead. "
II Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
II Kings,23,32,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, according to all that his fathers had done. "
II Kings,23,33,"And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a fine of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. "
II Kings,23,34,"And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there. "
II Kings,23,35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh. "
II Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
II Kings,23,37,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, according to all that his fathers had done. "
II Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. "
II Kings,24,2,"And HaShem sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Arameans, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of HaShem, which He spoke by the hand of His servants the prophets. "
II Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of HaShem came this upon Judah, to remove them out of His sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did; "
II Kings,24,4,and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and HaShem would not pardon. 
II Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? "
II Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
II Kings,24,7,"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the Brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt. "
II Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months; and his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
II Kings,24,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, according to all that his father had done. "
II Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. "
II Kings,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it. "
II Kings,24,12,"And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. "
II Kings,24,13,"And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of HaShem, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of HaShem, as HaShem had said. "
II Kings,24,14,"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. "
II Kings,24,15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. "
II Kings,24,16,"And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. "
II Kings,24,17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. "
II Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
II Kings,24,19,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. "
II Kings,24,20,"For through the anger of HaShem did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. "
II Kings,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. "
II Kings,25,2,So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
II Kings,25,3,"On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. "
II Kings,25,4,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden--now the Chaldeans were against the city round about--and the king went by the way of the Arabah. "
II Kings,25,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. "
II Kings,25,6,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. "
II Kings,25,7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon. "
II Kings,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem. "
II Kings,25,9,"And he burnt the house of HaShem, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great man's house, burnt he with fire. "
II Kings,25,10,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about. "
II Kings,25,11,"And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive. "
II Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. 
II Kings,25,13,"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of HaShem, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of HaShem, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. "
II Kings,25,14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the pans, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. "
II Kings,25,15,"And the fire-pans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. "
II Kings,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of HaShem; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. "
II Kings,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits; with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass; and like unto these had the second pillar with network. "
II Kings,25,18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door; "
II Kings,25,19,"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city. "
II Kings,25,20,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. "
II Kings,25,21,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. "
II Kings,25,22,"And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor. "
II Kings,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. "
II Kings,25,24,"And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said unto them: 'Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.' "
II Kings,25,25,"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah. "
II Kings,25,26,"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. "
II Kings,25,27,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison. "
II Kings,25,28,"And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon. "
II Kings,25,29,"And he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life. "
II Kings,25,30,"And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.  "
Isaiah,1,1,"THE VISION of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. "

Isaiah,1,11,"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith HaShem; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. "
Isaiah,1,12,"When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts? "

Isaiah,3,16,"Moreover HaShem said: because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet; "

Isaiah,3,24,"And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle rags; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty. "
Isaiah,3,25,"Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. "
Isaiah,3,26,And her gates shall lament and mourn; and utterly bereft she shall sit upon the ground. 
Isaiah,4,1,"And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying: 'We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.' "
Isaiah,4,2,"In that day shall the growth of HaShem be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. "
Isaiah,4,3,"And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem; "
Isaiah,4,4,"when the L-rd shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction. "
Isaiah,4,5,"And HaShem will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy. "
Isaiah,4,6,"And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain. "
Isaiah,5,1,"Let me sing of my well-beloved, a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. my well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill; "
Isaiah,5,2,"And he digged it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a vat therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. "
Isaiah,5,3,"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. "
Isaiah,5,4,"What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? "
Isaiah,5,5,"And now come, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the fence thereof, and it shall be trodden down; "
Isaiah,5,6,"And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. "
Isaiah,5,7,"For the vineyard of HaShem of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of His delight; and He looked for justice, but behold violence; for righteousness, but behold a cry. "
Isaiah,5,8,"Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land! "
Isaiah,5,9,"In mine ears said HaShem of hosts: of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. "
Isaiah,5,10,"For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah. "
Isaiah,5,11,"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them! "
Isaiah,5,12,"And the harp and the psaltery, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of HaShem, neither have they considered the operation of His hands. "
Isaiah,5,13,"Therefore My people are gone into captivity, for want of knowledge; and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst. "
Isaiah,5,14,"Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure; and down goeth their glory, and their tumult, and their uproar, and he that rejoiceth among them. "
Isaiah,5,15,"And man is bowed down, and man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled; "
Isaiah,5,16,"But HaShem of hosts is exalted through justice, and G-d the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness. "
Isaiah,5,17,"Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat. "
Isaiah,5,18,"Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope, "
Isaiah,5,19,"That say: 'Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!' "
Isaiah,5,20,"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that change darkness into light, and light into darkness; that change bitter into sweet, and sweet into bitter! "
Isaiah,5,21,"Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! "
Isaiah,5,22,"Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink; "
Isaiah,5,23,"That justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! "
Isaiah,5,24,"Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the chaff is consumed in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of HaShem of hosts, and contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel. "
Isaiah,5,25,"Therefore is the anger of HaShem kindled against His people, and He hath stretched forth His hand against them, and hath smitten them, and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. "
Isaiah,5,26,"And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly; "
Isaiah,5,27,"None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken; "
Isaiah,5,28,"Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind; "
Isaiah,5,29,"Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions, yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver. "
Isaiah,5,30,"And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea; and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and distress, and the light is darkened in the skies thereof. "
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the L-rd sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. "
Isaiah,6,2,"Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. "
Isaiah,6,3,"And one called unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is HaShem of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory. "
Isaiah,6,4,"And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke. "
Isaiah,6,5,"Then said I: Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, HaShem of hosts. "
Isaiah,6,6,"Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; "
Isaiah,6,7,"and he touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated. "
Isaiah,6,8,"And I heard the voice of the L-rd, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: 'Here am I; send me.' "
Isaiah,6,9,"And He said: 'Go, and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. "
Isaiah,6,10,"Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.' "
Isaiah,6,11,"Then said I: 'L-rd, how long?' And He answered: 'Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, "
Isaiah,6,12,"And HaShem have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. "
Isaiah,6,13,"And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.' "
Isaiah,7,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it; but could not prevail against it. "
Isaiah,7,2,"And it was told the house of David, saying: 'Aram is confederate with Ephraim.' And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind. "
Isaiah,7,3,"Then said HaShem unto Isaiah: 'Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers' field; "
Isaiah,7,4,"and say unto him: Keep calm, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah. "
Isaiah,7,5,"Because Aram hath counselled evil against thee, Ephraim also, and the son of Remaliah, saying: "
Isaiah,7,6,"Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel; "
Isaiah,7,7,"thus saith the L-rd GOD: it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. "
Isaiah,7,8,"For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people; "
Isaiah,7,9,"And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not have faith, surely ye shall not be established.' "
Isaiah,7,10,"And HaShem spoke again unto Ahaz, saying: "
Isaiah,7,11,"'Ask thee a sign of HaShem thy G-d: ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.' "
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said: 'I will not ask, neither will I try HaShem.' "
Isaiah,7,13,"And he said: 'Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my G-d also? "
Isaiah,7,14,"Therefore the L-rd Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. "
Isaiah,7,15,"Curd and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good. "
Isaiah,7,16,"Yea, before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou hast a horror of shall be forsaken. "
Isaiah,7,17,"HaShem shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.' "
Isaiah,7,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that HaShem shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. "
Isaiah,7,19,"And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the rugged valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all brambles. "
Isaiah,7,20,"In that day shall the L-rd shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard. "
Isaiah,7,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep; "
Isaiah,7,22,"and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat curd; for curd and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land. "
Isaiah,7,23,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall even be for briers and thorns. "
Isaiah,7,24,With arrows and with bow shall one come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. 
Isaiah,7,25,"And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.  "
Isaiah,8,1,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it in common script: The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth; "
Isaiah,8,2,"and I will take unto Me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.' "
Isaiah,8,3,"And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said HaShem unto me: 'Call his name Maher-shalal-hashbaz."
Isaiah,8,4,"For before the child shall have knowledge to cry: My father, and: My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.' "
Isaiah,8,5,"And HaShem spoke unto me yet again, saying: "
Isaiah,8,6,"Forasmuch as this people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoiceth with Rezin and Remaliah's son; "
Isaiah,8,7,"Now therefore, behold, the L-rd bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, mighty and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks; "
Isaiah,8,8,"And he shall sweep through Judah overflowing as he passeth through he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. "
Isaiah,8,9,"Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. "
Isaiah,8,10,"Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for G-d is with us. "
Isaiah,8,11,"For HaShem spoke thus to me with a strong hand, admonishing me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: "
Isaiah,8,12,"'Say ye not: A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people do say: A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor account it dreadful. "
Isaiah,8,13,"HaShem of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. "
Isaiah,8,14,"And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "
Isaiah,8,15,"And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.' "
Isaiah,8,16,"'Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction among My disciples.' "
Isaiah,8,17,"And I will wait for HaShem, that hideth His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for Him. "
Isaiah,8,18,"Behold, I and the children whom HaShem hath given me shall be for signs and for wonders in Israel from HaShem of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. "
Isaiah,8,19,"And when they shall say unto you: 'Seek unto the ghosts and the familiar spirits, that chirp and that mutter; should not a people seek unto their G-d? on behalf of the living unto the dead "
Isaiah,8,20,"for instruction and for testimony?' --Surely they will speak according to this word, wherein there is no light.-- "
Isaiah,8,21,"And they shall pass this way that are sore bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their G-d, and, whether they turn their faces upward, "
Isaiah,8,22,"or look unto the earth, behold distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness. "
Isaiah,8,23,"For is there no gloom to her that was stedfast? Now the former hath lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but the latter hath dealt a more grievous blow by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in the district of the nations. "
Isaiah,9,1,"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. "
Isaiah,9,2,"Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast increased their joy; they joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. "
Isaiah,9,3,"For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, Thou hast broken as in the day of Midian. "
Isaiah,9,4,"For every boot stamped with fierceness, and every cloak rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire. "
Isaiah,9,5,"For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele-joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom;"
Isaiah,9,6,"That the government may be increased, and of peace there be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it through justice and through righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of HaShem of hosts doth perform this. "
Isaiah,9,7,"The L-rd sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. "
Isaiah,9,8,"And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in arrogancy of heart: "
Isaiah,9,9,"'The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.' "
Isaiah,9,10,"Therefore HaShem doth set upon high the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies; "
Isaiah,9,11,"The Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west; and they devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. "
Isaiah,9,12,"Yet the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth them, neither do they seek HaShem of hosts. "
Isaiah,9,13,"Therefore HaShem doth cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day. "
Isaiah,9,14,"The elder and the man of rank, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. "
Isaiah,9,15,For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. 
Isaiah,9,16,"Therefore the L-rd shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is ungodly and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh wantonness. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. "
Isaiah,9,17,"For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in thick clouds of smoke. "
Isaiah,9,18,Through the wrath of HaShem of hosts is the land burnt up; the people also are as the fuel of fire; no man spareth his brother. 
Isaiah,9,19,"And one snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry; and he eateth on the left hand, and is not satisfied; they eat every man the flesh of his own arm: "
Isaiah,9,20,"Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together are against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. "
Isaiah,10,1,"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write iniquity; "
Isaiah,10,2,"To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right of the poor of My people, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey! "
Isaiah,10,3,"And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the ruin which shall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory? "
Isaiah,10,4,"They can do nought except crouch under the captives, and fall under the slain. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. "
Isaiah,10,5,"O Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, in whose hand as a staff is Mine indignation! "
Isaiah,10,6,"I do send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath do I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. "
Isaiah,10,7,"Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few. "
Isaiah,10,8,For he saith: 'Are not my princes all of them kings? 
Isaiah,10,9,Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus? 
Isaiah,10,10,"As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did exceed them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; "
Isaiah,10,11,"Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?' "
Isaiah,10,12,"Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the L-rd hath performed His whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his haughty looks. "
Isaiah,10,13,"For he hath said: by the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; in that I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants; "
Isaiah,10,14,"And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened mouth, or chirped. "
Isaiah,10,15,"Should the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Should the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if a rod should move them that lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him that is not wood. "
Isaiah,10,16,"Therefore will the L-rd, HaShem of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire. "
Isaiah,10,17,"And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. "
Isaiah,10,18,"And the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, he will consume both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man wasteth away. "
Isaiah,10,19,"And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them down. "
Isaiah,10,20,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon HaShem, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. "
Isaiah,10,21,"A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto G-d the Mighty. "
Isaiah,10,22,"For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return; an extermination is determined, overflowing with righteousness. "
Isaiah,10,23,"For an extermination wholly determined shall the L-rd, the GOD of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth. "
Isaiah,10,24,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd, the GOD of hosts: O My people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of Asshur, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. "
Isaiah,10,25,"For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and Mine anger shall be to their destruction. "
Isaiah,10,26,"And HaShem of hosts shall stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb; and as His rod was over the sea, so shall He lift it up after the manner of Egypt. "
Isaiah,10,27,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness. "
Isaiah,10,28,"He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmas he layeth up his baggage; "
Isaiah,10,29,They are gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah trembleth; Gibeath-shaul is fled. 
Isaiah,10,30,"Cry thou with a shrill voice, O daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laish! O thou poor Anathoth! "
Isaiah,10,31,Madmenah is in mad flight; the inhabitants of Gebim flee to cover. 
Isaiah,10,32,"This very day shall he halt at Nob, shaking his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. "
Isaiah,10,33,"Behold, the L-rd, HaShem of hosts, shall lop the boughs with terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be laid low. "
Isaiah,10,34,"And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.  "
Isaiah,11,1,"And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a twig shall grow forth out of his roots. "
Isaiah,11,2,"And the spirit of HaShem shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of HaShem. "
Isaiah,11,3,"And his delight shall be in the fear of HaShem; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the hearing of his ears; "
Isaiah,11,4,"But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the land; and he shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. "
Isaiah,11,5,"And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. "
Isaiah,11,6,"And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. "
Isaiah,11,7,And the cow and the bear feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
Isaiah,11,8,"And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk's den. "
Isaiah,11,9,"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of HaShem, as the waters cover the sea. "
Isaiah,11,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, that standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting-place shall be glorious. "
Isaiah,11,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the L-rd will set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant of His people, that shall remain from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. "
Isaiah,11,12,"And He will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the dispersed of Israel, and gather together the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth. "
Isaiah,11,13,"The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and they that harass Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. "
Isaiah,11,14,And they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines on the west; together shall they spoil the children of the east; they shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. 
Isaiah,11,15,"And HaShem will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with His scorching wind will He shake His hand over the River, and will smite it into seven streams, and cause men to march over dry-shod. "
Isaiah,11,16,"And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, that shall remain from Assyria, like as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. "
Isaiah,12,1,"And in that day thou shalt say: 'I will give thanks unto Thee, O HaShem; for though Thou was angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me. "
Isaiah,12,2,"Behold, G-d is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for GOD HaShem is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation.' "
Isaiah,12,3,Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
Isaiah,12,4,"And in that day shall ye say: 'Give thanks unto HaShem, proclaim His name, declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted. "
Isaiah,12,5,Sing unto HaShem; for He hath done gloriously; this is made known in all the earth. 
Isaiah,12,6,"Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.' "
Isaiah,13,1,"The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. "
Isaiah,13,2,"Set ye up an ensign upon the high mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. "
Isaiah,13,3,"I have commanded My consecrated ones, yea, I have called My mighty ones for mine anger, even My proudly exulting ones. "
Isaiah,13,4,"Hark, a tumult in the mountains, like as of a great people! Hark, the uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! HaShem of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. "
Isaiah,13,5,"They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even HaShem, and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole earth. "
Isaiah,13,6,Howl ye; for the day of HaShem is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

Isaiah,28,13,"And so the word of HaShem is unto them precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. "
Isaiah,28,14,"Wherefore hear the word of HaShem, ye scoffers, the ballad-mongers of this people which is in Jerusalem: "

Isaiah,28,26,For He doth instruct him aright; his G-d doth teach him. 
Isaiah,28,27,"For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing-sledge, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the black cummin is beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. "
Isaiah,28,28,"Is bread corn crushed? Nay, he will not ever be threshing it; and though the roller of his wagon and its sharp edges move noisily, he doth not crush it. "

Isaiah,29,8,"And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth, but he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh, but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite--so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. "
Isaiah,29,9,"Stupefy yourselves, and be stupid! Blind yourselves, and be blind! ye that are drunken, but not with wine, that stagger, but not with strong drink. "
Isaiah,29,10,"For HaShem hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets, and your heads, the seers, hath He covered. "
Isaiah,29,11,"And the vision of all this is become unto you as the words of a writing that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying: 'Read this, I pray thee'; and he saith: 'I cannot, for it is sealed'; "
Isaiah,29,12,"and the writing is delivered to him that is not learned, saying: 'Read this, I pray thee'; and he saith: 'I am not learned.' "

Isaiah,29,16,O your perversity! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it: 'He made me not'; or the thing framed say of him that framed it: 'He hath no understanding?' 
Isaiah,29,17,"Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? "
Isaiah,29,18,"And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. "
Isaiah,29,19,"The humble also shall increase their joy in HaShem, and the neediest among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel. "
Isaiah,29,20,"For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off; "
Isaiah,29,21,"That make a man an offender by words, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. "

Isaiah,30,1,"Woe to the rebellious children, saith HaShem, that take counsel, but not of Me; and that form projects, but not of My spirit, that they may add sin to sin; "
Isaiah,30,2,"That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at My mouth; to take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh, and to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt! "
Isaiah,30,3,"Therefore shall the stronghold of Pharaoh turn to your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your confusion. "
Isaiah,30,4,"For his princes are at Zoan, and his ambassadors are come to Hanes. "
Isaiah,30,5,"They shall all be ashamed of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. "
Isaiah,30,6,"The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. "
Isaiah,30,7,"For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called her arrogancy that sitteth still. "
Isaiah,30,8,"Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever. "
Isaiah,30,9,"For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that refuse to hear the teaching of HaShem; "
Isaiah,30,10,"That say to the seers: 'See not,' and to the prophets: 'Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy delusions; "
Isaiah,30,11,"Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.' "
Isaiah,30,12,"Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon; "
Isaiah,30,13,"Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. "

Isaiah,30,16,"But ye said: 'No, for we will flee upon horses'; therefore shall ye flee; and: 'We will ride upon the swift'; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. "
Isaiah,30,17,"One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, at the rebuke of five shall ye flee; till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill. "
Isaiah,30,18,"And therefore will HaShem wait, that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore will He be exalted, that He may have compassion upon you; for HaShem is a G-d of justice, happy are all they that wait for Him. "
Isaiah,30,19,"For, O people that dwellest in Zion at Jerusalem, thou shalt weep no more; He will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry, when He shall hear, He will answer thee. "
Isaiah,30,20,"And though the L-rd give you sparing bread and scant water, yet shall not thy Teacher hide Himself any more, but thine eyes shall see thy Teacher; "
Isaiah,30,21,"And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying: 'This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.' "

Isaiah,30,23,"And He will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous; in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. "
Isaiah,30,24,"The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savoury provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. "
Isaiah,30,25,"And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill streams and watercourses, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. "
Isaiah,30,26,"Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, in the day that HaShem bindeth up the bruise of His people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. "
Isaiah,30,27,"Behold, the name of HaShem cometh from far, with His anger burning, and in thick uplifting of smoke; His lips are full of indignation, and His tongue is as a devouring fire; "

Isaiah,30,31,"For through the voice of HaShem shall Asshur be dismayed, the rod with which He smote. "
Isaiah,30,32,"And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass, which HaShem shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps; and in battles of wielding will He fight with them. "
Isaiah,30,33,"For a hearth is ordered of old; yea, for the king it is prepared, deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of HaShem, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. "
Isaiah,31,1,"Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are exceeding mighty; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek HaShem! "
Isaiah,31,2,"Yet He also is wise, and bringeth evil, and doth not call back His words; but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. "
Isaiah,31,3,"Now the Egyptians are men, and not G-d, and their horses flesh, and not spirit; so when HaShem shall stretch out His hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall perish together. "
Isaiah,31,4,"For thus saith HaShem unto me: Like as the lion, or the young lion, growling over his prey, though a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them; so will HaShem of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.

Isaiah,31,6,"Turn ye unto Him against whom ye have deeply rebelled, O children of Israel. "
Isaiah,31,7,"For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. "

Isaiah,32,1,"Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and as for princes, they shall rule in justice. "
Isaiah,32,2,"And a man shall be as in a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as by the watercourses in a dry place, as in the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. "
Isaiah,32,3,"And the eyes of them that see shall not be closed, and the ears of them that hear shall attend. "
Isaiah,32,4,"The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. "
Isaiah,32,5,"The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be noble. "
Isaiah,32,6,"For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise ungodliness, and to utter wickedness against HaShem, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. "
Isaiah,32,7,"The instruments also of the churl are evil; he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, and the needy when he speaketh right. "
Isaiah,32,8,But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand. 
Isaiah,32,9,"Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, give ear unto my speech. "
Isaiah,32,10,"After a year and days shall ye be troubled, ye confident women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come. "
Isaiah,32,11,"Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye confident ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins, "
Isaiah,32,12,"Smiting upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine; "
Isaiah,32,13,"For the land of my people whereon thorns and briers come up; yea, for all the houses of joy and the joyous city. "
Isaiah,32,14,"For the palace shall be forsaken; the city with its stir shall be deserted; the mound and the tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; "
Isaiah,32,15,"Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. "
Isaiah,32,16,"Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field. "
Isaiah,32,17,And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever. 
Isaiah,32,18,"And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places. "
Isaiah,32,19,"And it shall hail, in the downfall of the forest; but the city shall descend into the valley. "
Isaiah,32,20,"Happy are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth freely the feet of the ox and the ass. "
Isaiah,33,1,"Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. "
Isaiah,33,2,"O HaShem, be gracious unto us; we have waited for Thee; be Thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. "
Isaiah,33,3,At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered. 
Isaiah,33,4,And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth; as locusts leap do they leap upon it. 
Isaiah,33,5,"HaShem is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness. "
Isaiah,33,6,"And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation--wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of HaShem which is His treasurer "
Isaiah,33,7,"Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. "
Isaiah,33,8,"The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth; he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man. "
Isaiah,33,9,"The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel are clean bare. "
Isaiah,33,10,"Now will I arise, saith HaShem; now will I be exalted; now will I lift Myself up. "
Isaiah,33,11,"Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that shall devour you. "
Isaiah,33,12,"And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime; as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire. "
Isaiah,33,13,"Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge My might. "
Isaiah,33,14,The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the ungodly: 'Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?' 
Isaiah,33,15,"He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil; "
Isaiah,33,16,"He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure. "
Isaiah,33,17,Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold a land stretching afar. 
Isaiah,33,18,"Thy heart shall muse on the terror: 'Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed? Where is he that counted the towers?' "
Isaiah,33,19,"Thou shalt not see the fierce people; a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive, of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand. "
Isaiah,33,20,"Look upon Zion, the city of our solemn gatherings; thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a peaceful habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. "
Isaiah,33,21,"But there HaShem will be with us in majesty, in a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. "
Isaiah,33,22,"For HaShem is our Judge, HaShem is our Lawgiver, HaShem is our King; He will save us. "
Isaiah,33,23,"Thy tacklings are loosed; they do not hold the stand of their mast, they do not spread the sail; then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. "
Isaiah,33,24,And the inhabitant shall not say: 'I am sick'; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. 
Isaiah,34,1,"Come near, ye nations, to hear, and attend, ye peoples; let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof, the world, and all things that come forth of it. "
Isaiah,34,2,"For HaShem hath indignation against all the nations, and fury against all their host; He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter. "
Isaiah,34,3,"Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their carcasses shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. "
Isaiah,34,4,"And all the host of heaven shall moulder away, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig-tree. "
Isaiah,34,5,"For My sword hath drunk its fill in heaven; behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My ban, to judgment. "
Isaiah,34,6,"The sword of HaShem is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for HaShem hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. "
Isaiah,34,7,"And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. "

Isaiah,34,9,"And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. "
Isaiah,34,10,"It shall not be quenched night nor day, the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste: none shall pass through it for ever and ever. "
Isaiah,34,11,"But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it, and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein; and He shall stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. "
Isaiah,34,12,"As for her nobles, none shall be there to be called to the kingdom; and all her princes shall be nothing. "

Isaiah,34,14,"And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall repose there, and shall find her a place of rest. "
Isaiah,34,15,"There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and brood under her shadow; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate. "
Isaiah,34,16,"Seek ye out of the book of HaShem, and read; no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for My mouth it hath commanded, and the breath thereof it hath gathered them. "
Isaiah,34,17,"And He hath cast the lot for them, and His hand hath divided it unto them by line; they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein. "
Isaiah,35,1,"The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. "
Isaiah,35,2,"It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of HaShem, the excellency of our G-d. "
Isaiah,35,3,"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make firm the tottering knees. "
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to them that are of a fearful heart: 'Be strong, fear not'; behold, your G-d will come with vengeance, with the recompense of G-d He will come and save you. "
Isaiah,35,5,"Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. "
Isaiah,35,6,"Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. "
Isaiah,35,7,"And the parched land shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; in the habitation of jackals herds shall lie down, it shall be an enclosure for reeds and rushes. "
Isaiah,35,8,"And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those; the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein. "
Isaiah,35,9,"No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon, they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there; "
Isaiah,35,10,"And the ransomed of HaShem shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. "
Isaiah,36,1,"Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. "
Isaiah,36,2,And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers' field. 
Isaiah,36,3,"Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. "
Isaiah,36,4,"And Rab-shakeh said unto them: 'Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? "
Isaiah,36,5,"I said: It is but vain words; for counsel and strength are for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me? "
Isaiah,36,6,"Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him. "
Isaiah,36,7,"But if thou say unto me: We trust in HaShem our G-d; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before this altar? "
Isaiah,36,8,"Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. "
Isaiah,36,9,"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my master's servants? yet thou puttest thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! "
Isaiah,36,10,"And am I now come up without HaShem against this land to destroy it? HaShem said unto me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.' "
Isaiah,36,11,"Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh: 'Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.' "
Isaiah,36,12,"But Rab-shakeh said: 'Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?' "
Isaiah,36,13,"Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: 'Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. "
Isaiah,36,14,"Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you, for he will not be able to deliver you; "
Isaiah,36,15,"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in HaShem, saying: HaShem will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
Isaiah,36,16,"Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; "
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. "
Isaiah,36,18,"Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying: HaShem will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? "
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
Isaiah,36,20,"Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that HaShem should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?' "
Isaiah,36,21,"But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying: 'Answer him not.' "
Isaiah,36,22,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh. "
Isaiah,37,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of HaShem. "
Isaiah,37,2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. "
Isaiah,37,3,"And they said unto him: 'Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. "
Isaiah,37,4,"It may be HaShem thy G-d will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living G-d, and will rebuke the words which HaShem thy G-d hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.' "
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
Isaiah,37,6,"And Isaiah said unto them: 'Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith HaShem: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. "
Isaiah,37,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.' "
Isaiah,37,8,"So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. "
Isaiah,37,9,"And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: 'He is come out to fight against thee.' And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying: "
Isaiah,37,10,"'Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy G-d in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
Isaiah,37,11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? "
Isaiah,37,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? "
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?' "
Isaiah,37,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of HaShem, and spread it before HaShem. "
Isaiah,37,15,"And Hezekiah prayed unto HaShem, saying: "
Isaiah,37,16,"'O HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the G-d, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. "
Isaiah,37,17,"Incline Thine ear, O HaShem, and hear; open Thine eyes, O HaShem, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to taunt the living G-d. "
Isaiah,37,18,"Of a truth, HaShem, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land, "
Isaiah,37,19,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. "
Isaiah,37,20,"Now therefore, O HaShem our G-d, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art HaShem, even Thou only.' "
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, "
Isaiah,37,22,this is the word which HaShem hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
Isaiah,37,23,"Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel! "
Isaiah,37,24,"By thy servants hast thou taunted the L-rd, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypress-trees thereof; and I have entered into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field. "
Isaiah,37,25,"I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt. "
Isaiah,37,26,"Hast thou not heard? Long ago I made it, in ancient times I fashioned it; now have I brought it to pass, yea, it is done; that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps. "
Isaiah,37,27,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field of corn before it is grown up. "
Isaiah,37,28,"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against Me. "
Isaiah,37,29,"Because of thy raging against Me, and for that thine uproar is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. "
Isaiah,37,30,"And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. "
Isaiah,37,31,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. "
Isaiah,37,32,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of HaShem of hosts shall perform this. "
Isaiah,37,33,"Therefore thus saith HaShem concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it. "
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith HaShem. "
Isaiah,37,35,"For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.' "
Isaiah,37,36,"And the angel of HaShem went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. "
Isaiah,37,37,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. "
Isaiah,37,38,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. "
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.' "
Isaiah,38,2,"Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto HaShem, "
Isaiah,38,3,"and said: 'Remember now, O HaShem, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore. "
Isaiah,38,4,"Then came the word of HaShem to Isaiah, saying: "
Isaiah,38,5,"'Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. "
Isaiah,38,6,And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city. 
Isaiah,38,7,"And this shall be the sign unto thee from HaShem, that HaShem will do this thing that He hath spoken: "
Isaiah,38,8,"behold, I will cause the shadow of the dial, which is gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to return backward ten degrees.' So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. "
Isaiah,38,9,"The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness. "
Isaiah,38,10,"I said: In the noontide of my days I shall go, even to the gates of the nether-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years. "
Isaiah,38,11,"I said: I shall not see HaShem, even HaShem in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. "
Isaiah,38,12,My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me as a shepherd's tent; I have rolled up like a weaver my life; He will cut me off from the thrum; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me. 
Isaiah,38,13,"The more I make myself like unto a lion until morning, the more it breaketh all my bones; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me. "
Isaiah,38,14,"Like a swallow or a crane, so do I chatter, I do moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward. O HaShem, I am oppressed, be Thou my surety. "
Isaiah,38,15,"What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, and Himself hath done it; I shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul. "
Isaiah,38,16,"O L-rd, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore recover Thou me, and make me to live. "
Isaiah,38,17,"Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back. "
Isaiah,38,18,"For the nether-world cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth. "
Isaiah,38,19,"The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day; the father to the children shall make known Thy truth. "
Isaiah,38,20,HaShem is ready to save me; therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of HaShem. 
Isaiah,38,21,"And Isaiah said: 'Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.' "
Isaiah,38,22,And Hezekiah said. 'What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of HaShem?' 
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. "
Isaiah,39,2,"And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. "
Isaiah,39,3,"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him: 'What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?' And Hezekiah said: 'They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.' "
Isaiah,39,4,Then said he: 'What have they seen in thy house?' And Hezekiah answered: 'All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.' 
Isaiah,39,5,Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah: 'Hear the word of HaShem of hosts: 
Isaiah,39,6,"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith HaShem. "
Isaiah,39,7,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.' "
Isaiah,39,8,Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: 'Good is the word of HaShem which thou hast spoken.' He said moreover: 'If but there shall be peace and truth in my days.' 
Isaiah,40,1,"Comfort ye, comfort ye My people, saith your G-d. "
Isaiah,40,2,"Bid Jerusalem take heart, and proclaim unto her, that her time of service is accomplished, that her guilt is paid off; that she hath received of HaShem'S hand double for all her sins. "
Isaiah,40,3,"Hark! one calleth: 'Clear ye in the wilderness the way of HaShem, make plain in the desert a highway for our G-d. "
Isaiah,40,4,"Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the rugged shall be made level, and the rough places a plain; "
Isaiah,40,5,"And the glory of HaShem shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of HaShem hath spoken it.' "
Isaiah,40,6,"Hark! one saith: 'Proclaim!' And he saith: 'What shall I proclaim?' 'All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field; "
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of HaShem bloweth upon it--surely the people is grass. "
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our G-d shall stand for ever.' "
Isaiah,40,9,"O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah: 'Behold your G-d!' "
Isaiah,40,10,"Behold, the L-rd GOD will come as a Mighty One, and His arm will rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him. "
Isaiah,40,11,"Even as a shepherd that feedeth his flock, that gathereth the lambs in his arm, and carrieth them in his bosom, and gently leadeth those that give suck. "
Isaiah,40,12,"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? "
Isaiah,40,13,Who hath meted out the spirit of HaShem? Or who was His counsellor that he might instruct Him? 
Isaiah,40,14,"With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him in the path of right, and taught Him knowledge, and made Him to know the way of discernment? "
Isaiah,40,15,"Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold the isles are as a mote in weight. "
Isaiah,40,16,"And Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for burnt-offerings. "
Isaiah,40,17,"All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity. "
Isaiah,40,18,To whom then will ye liken G-d? Or what likeness will ye compare unto Him? 
Isaiah,40,19,"The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted, and the goldsmith spread over with gold, the silversmith casting silver chains? "
Isaiah,40,20,"A holm-oak is set apart, he chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning craftsman to set up an image, that shall not be moved. "
Isaiah,40,21,Know ye not? hear ye not? Hath it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood the foundations of the earth? 
Isaiah,40,22,"It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; "
Isaiah,40,23,That bringeth princes to nothing; He maketh the judges of the earth as a thing of nought.

Isaiah,58,2,"Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways; as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their G-d, they ask of Me righteous ordinances, they delight to draw near unto G-d. "
Isaiah,58,3,"'Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge?'-- Behold, in the day of your fast ye pursue your business, and exact all your labours. "
Isaiah,58,4,"Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. "
Isaiah,58,5,"Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to HaShem? "
Isaiah,58,6,"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the fetters of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? "
Isaiah,58,7,"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? "
Isaiah,58,8,"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of HaShem shall be thy rearward. "
Isaiah,58,9,"Then shalt thou call, and HaShem will answer; thou shalt cry, and He will say: 'Here I am.' If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedness; "
Isaiah,58,10,"And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thy gloom be as the noon-day; "
Isaiah,58,11,"And HaShem will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. "
Isaiah,58,12,"And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places, thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in. "
Isaiah,58,13,"If thou turn away thy foot because of the sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of HaShem honourable; and shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof; "
Isaiah,58,14,"Then shalt thou delight thyself in HaShem, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of HaShem hath spoken it. "
Isaiah,59,1,"Behold, HaShem'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear; "
Isaiah,59,2,"But your iniquities have separated between you and your G-d, and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will not hear. "
Isaiah,59,3,"For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness. "
Isaiah,59,4,"None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth; they trust in vanity, and speak lies, they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. "
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch basilisks' eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. "
Isaiah,59,6,"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall men cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. "
Isaiah,59,7,"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are in their paths. "
Isaiah,59,8,"The way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their goings; they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace. "
Isaiah,59,9,"Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us; we look for light, but behold darkness, for brightness, but we walk in gloom. "
Isaiah,59,10,"We grope for the wall like the blind, yea, as they that have no eyes do we grope; we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in dark places like the dead. "
Isaiah,59,11,"We all growl like bears, and mourn sore like doves; we look for right, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. "
Isaiah,59,12,"For our transgressions are multiplied before Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are present to us, and as for our iniquities, we know them: "
Isaiah,59,13,"Transgressing and denying HaShem, and turning away from following our G-d, speaking oppression and perverseness, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. "
Isaiah,59,14,"And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the broad place, and uprightness cannot enter. "
Isaiah,59,15,"And truth is lacking, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And HaShem saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice; "
Isaiah,59,16,"And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him; "
Isaiah,59,17,"And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head, and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. "
Isaiah,59,18,"According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay, fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; to the islands He will repay recompense. "
Isaiah,59,19,"So shall they fear the name of HaShem from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun; for distress will come in like a flood, which the breath of HaShem driveth. "
Isaiah,59,20,"And a redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith HaShem. "

"
Isaiah,60,1,"Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of HaShem is risen upon thee. "

Isaiah,60,10,"And aliens shall build up thy walls, And their kings shall minister unto thee; for in My wrath I smote thee, but in My favour have I had compassion on thee. "
Isaiah,60,11,"Thy gates also shall be open continually, day and night, they shall not be shut; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings in procession. "
Isaiah,60,12,"For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. "
Isaiah,60,13,"The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the cypress, the plane-tree and the larch together; to beautify the place of My sanctuary, and I will make the place of My feet glorious. "
Isaiah,60,14,"And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee, and all they that despised thee shall bow down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of HaShem, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel. "

Isaiah,61,2,"To proclaim the year of HaShem'S good pleasure, and the day of vengeance of our G-d; to comfort all that mourn; "
Isaiah,61,3,"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called terebinths of righteousness, the planting of HaShem, wherein He might glory. "

Isaiah,63,7,"I will make mention of the mercies of HaShem, and the praises of HaShem, according to all that HaShem hath bestowed on us; and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He hath bestowed on them according to His compassions, and according to the multitude of His mercies. "
Isaiah,63,8,"For He said: 'Surely, they are My people, children that will not deal falsely'; so He was their Saviour. "

Isaiah,65,2,"I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; "
Isaiah,65,3,"A people that provoke Me to My face continually, that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks; "
Isaiah,65,4,"That sit among the graves, and lodge in the vaults; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; "
Isaiah,65,5,"That say: 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou'; these are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burneth all the day. "
Isaiah,65,6,"Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, except I have requited, yea, I will requite into their bosom, "
Isaiah,65,7,"Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith HaShem, that have offered upon the mountains, and blasphemed Me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom. "
Isaiah,65,8,"Thus saith HaShem: as, when wine is found in the cluster, one saith: 'Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it'; so will I do for My servants' sakes, that I may not destroy all. "
Isaiah,65,9,"And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and Mine elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there. "
Isaiah,65,10,"And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people that have sought Me; "
Isaiah,65,11,"But ye that forsake HaShem, that forget My holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny, "
Isaiah,65,12,"I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. "
Isaiah,65,13,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, My servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, My servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; "
Isaiah,65,14,"Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit. "
Isaiah,65,15,And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto Mine elect: 'So may the L-rd GOD slay thee'; but He shall call His servants by another name; 
Isaiah,65,16,"So that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself by the G-d of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the G-d of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from Mine eyes. "
Isaiah,65,17,"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. "
Isaiah,65,18,"But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. "

Isaiah,65,21,"And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. "
Isaiah,65,22,"They shall not build, and another inhabit, they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. "
Isaiah,65,23,"They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed blessed of HaShem, and their offspring with them. "
Isaiah,65,24,"And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. "

Isaiah,66,1,"Thus saith HaShem: the heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that ye may build unto Me? And where is the place that may be My resting-place? "
Isaiah,66,2,"For all these things hath My hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith HaShem; but on this man will I look, even on him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word. "
Isaiah,66,3,"He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he broke a dog's neck; he that offereth a meal-offering, as if he offered swine's blood; he that maketh a memorial-offering of frankincense, as if he blessed an idol; according as they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations; "
Isaiah,66,4,"Even so I will choose their mockings, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear, but they did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. "
Isaiah,66,5,"Hear the word of HaShem, ye that tremble at His word: your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for My name's sake, have said: 'Let HaShem be glorified, that we may gaze upon your joy', but they shall be ashamed. "

Isaiah,66,9,"Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith HaShem; shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy G-d. "
Isaiah,66,10,"Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her; "
Isaiah,66,11,"That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations; that ye may drink deeply with delight of the abundance of her glory. "
Isaiah,66,12,"For thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream, and ye shall suck thereof: ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees. "
Isaiah,66,13,"As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. "
Isaiah,66,14,"And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like young grass; and the hand of HaShem shall be known toward His servants, and He will have indignation against His enemies. "
Isaiah,66,15,"For, behold, HaShem will come in fire, and His chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire. "
Isaiah,66,16,"For by fire will HaShem contend, and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of HaShem shall be many. "
Isaiah,66,17,"They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the detestable thing, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith HaShem. "
Isaiah,66,18,"For I know their works and their thoughts; the time cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see My glory. "
Isaiah,66,19,"And I will work a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations. "
Isaiah,66,20,"And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto HaShem, upon horses, and in chariots, and in fitters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, saith HaShem, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of HaShem. "
Isaiah,66,21,"And of them also will I take for the priests and for the Levites, saith HaShem. "
Isaiah,66,22,"For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, saith HaShem, so shall your seed and your name remain. "
Isaiah,66,23,"And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith HaShem. "
Isaiah,66,24,"And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.  "
Jeremiah,1,1,"THE WORDS of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, "

Jeremiah,1,3,"It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. "
Jeremiah,1,4,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Jeremiah,1,5,"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations. "
Jeremiah,1,6,"Then said I: 'Ah, L-rd GOD! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.' "
Jeremiah,1,7,"But HaShem said unto me: say not: I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak. "
Jeremiah,1,8,"Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,1,9,"Then HaShem put forth His hand, and touched my mouth; and HaShem said unto me: Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth; "
Jeremiah,1,10,"See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy and to overthrow; to build, and to plant. "
Jeremiah,1,11,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: 'Jeremiah, what seest thou?' And I said: 'I see a rod of an almond-tree.'"
Jeremiah,1,12,Then said HaShem unto me: 'Thou hast well seen; for I watch over My word to perform it.' 
Jeremiah,1,13,"And the word of HaShem came unto me the second time, saying: 'What seest thou?' And I said: 'I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is from the north.' "
Jeremiah,1,14,Then HaShem said unto me: 'Out of the north the evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 
Jeremiah,1,15,"For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith HaShem; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. "
Jeremiah,1,16,"And I will utter My judgments against them touching all their wickedness; in that they have forsaken me, and have offered unto other gods, and worshipped the work of their own hands. "
Jeremiah,1,17,"Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them. "
Jeremiah,1,18,"For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. "
Jeremiah,1,19,"And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; For I am with thee, saith HaShem, to deliver thee.'  "
Jeremiah,2,1,"And the word of HaShem came to me, saying: "
Jeremiah,2,2,"Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith HaShem: I remember for thee the affection of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. "
Jeremiah,2,3,"Israel is HaShem'S hallowed portion, His first-fruits of the increase; all that devour him shall be held guilty, evil shall come upon them, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,2,4,"Hear ye the word of HaShem, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel; "
Jeremiah,2,5,"Thus saith HaShem: what unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me, and have walked after things of nought, and are become nought? "
Jeremiah,2,6,"Neither said they: 'Where is HaShem that brought us up out of the land of Egypt; that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?' "
Jeremiah,2,7,"And I brought you into a land of fruitful fields, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled My land, and made My heritage an abomination. "
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests said not: 'Where is HaShem?' And they that handle the law knew Me not, and the rulers transgressed against Me; the prophets also prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. "
Jeremiah,2,9,"Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith HaShem, and with your children's children will I plead. "
Jeremiah,2,10,"For pass over to the isles of the Kittites, and see, and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there hath been such a thing. "
Jeremiah,2,11,"Hath a nation changed its gods, which yet are no gods? But My people hath changed its glory for that which doth not profit. "
Jeremiah,2,12,"Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye exceeding amazed, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,2,13,"For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. "
Jeremiah,2,14,Is Israel a servant? Is he a home-born slave? Why is he become a prey? 
Jeremiah,2,15,"The young lions have roared upon him, and let their voice resound; and they have made his land desolate, his cities are laid waste, without inhabitant. "
Jeremiah,2,16,The children also of Noph and Tahpanhes feed upon the crown of thy head. 
Jeremiah,2,17,"Is it not this that doth cause it unto thee, that thou hast forsaken HaShem thy G-d, when He led thee by the way? "
Jeremiah,2,18,"And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? "
Jeremiah,2,19,"Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing, that thou hast forsaken HaShem thy G-d, neither is My fear in thee, saith the L-rd GOD of hosts. "
Jeremiah,2,20,"For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands, and thou saidst: 'I will not transgress'; upon every high hill and under every leafy tree thou didst recline, playing the harlot. "
Jeremiah,2,21,"Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto Me? "
Jeremiah,2,22,"For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before Me, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Jeremiah,2,23,"How canst thou say: 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim'? See thy way in the Valley, know what thou hast done; thou art a swift young camel traversing her ways; "
Jeremiah,2,24,"A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; her lust, who can hinder it? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. "
Jeremiah,2,25,"Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst; but thou saidst: 'There is no hope; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.' "
Jeremiah,2,26,"As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; "
Jeremiah,2,27,"Who say to a stock: 'Thou art my father', and to a stone: 'Thou hast brought us forth', for they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say: 'Arise, and save us.' "
Jeremiah,2,28,"But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. "
Jeremiah,2,29,"Wherefore will ye contend with Me? Ye all have transgressed against Me, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,2,30,"In vain have I smitten your children--they received no correction; your sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. "
Jeremiah,2,31,"O generation, see ye the word of HaShem: have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore say My people: 'We roam at large; we will come no more unto Thee'? "
Jeremiah,2,32,"Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number. "
Jeremiah,2,33,How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! Therefore--even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways; 
Jeremiah,2,34,Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor; thou didst not find them breaking in; yet for all these things 
Jeremiah,2,35,"Thou saidst: 'I am innocent; surely His anger is turned away from me' --behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest: 'I have not sinned.' "
Jeremiah,2,36,"How greatly dost thou cheapen thyself to change thy way? Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Asshur. "
Jeremiah,2,37,"From him also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head; for HaShem hath rejected them in whom thou didst trust, and thou shalt not prosper in them. "
Jeremiah,3,1,"...saying: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, may he return unto her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; and wouldest thou yet return to Me? saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,3,2,"Lift up thine eyes unto the high hills, and see: where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy harlotries and with thy wickedness. "
Jeremiah,3,3,"Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. "
Jeremiah,3,4,"Didst thou not just now cry unto Me: 'My father, Thou art the friend of my youth. "
Jeremiah,3,5,"Will He bear grudge for ever? Will He keep it to the end?' Behold, thou hast spoken, but hast done evil things, and hast had thy way. "
Jeremiah,3,6,"And HaShem said unto me in the days of Josiah the king: 'Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel did? she went up upon every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and there played the harlot. "
Jeremiah,3,7,"And I said: After she hath done all these things, she will return unto me; but she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. "
Jeremiah,3,8,"And I saw, when, forasmuch as backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, that yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot; "
Jeremiah,3,9,"and it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks; "
Jeremiah,3,10,"and yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto Me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith HaShem-- "
Jeremiah,3,11,even HaShem said unto me--backsliding Israel hath proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. 
Jeremiah,3,12,"Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: return, thou backsliding Israel, saith HaShem; I will not frown upon you; for I am merciful, saith HaShem, I will not bear grudge for ever. "
Jeremiah,3,13,"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against HaShem thy G-d, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every leafy tree, and ye have not hearkened to My voice, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,3,14,"Return, O backsliding children, saith HaShem; for I am a lord unto you, and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion; "
Jeremiah,3,15,"and I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. "
Jeremiah,3,16,"And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith HaShem, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of HaShem; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they make mention of it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more. "
Jeremiah,3,17,"At that time they shall call Jerusalem The throne of HaShem; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of HaShem, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. "
Jeremiah,3,18,"In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.' "
Jeremiah,3,19,"But I said: 'How would I put thee among the sons, and give thee a pleasant land, the goodliest heritage of the nations!' And I said: 'Thou shalt call Me, My father; and shalt not turn away from following Me.' "
Jeremiah,3,20,"Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,3,21,"Hark! upon the high hills is heard the suppliant weeping of the children of Israel; for that they have perverted their way, they have forgotten HaShem their G-d. "
Jeremiah,3,22,"Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings.-- 'Here we are, we are come unto Thee; for Thou art HaShem our G-d. "
Jeremiah,3,23,"Truly vain have proved the hills, the uproar on the mountains; truly in HaShem our G-d is the salvation of Israel. "
Jeremiah,3,24,"But the shameful thing hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. "
Jeremiah,3,25,"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against HaShem our G-d, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of HaShem our G-d.' "
Jeremiah,4,1,"If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith HaShem, yea, return unto Me; and if thou wilt put away thy detestable things out of My sight, and wilt not waver; "
Jeremiah,4,2,"And wilt swear: 'As HaShem liveth' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; then shall the nations bless themselves by Him, and in Him shall they glory. "
Jeremiah,4,3,"For thus saith HaShem to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: break up for you a fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. "
Jeremiah,4,4,"Circumcise yourselves to HaShem, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. "
Jeremiah,4,5,"Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say: 'Blow ye the horn in the land'; cry aloud and say: 'Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.' "
Jeremiah,4,6,"Set up a standard toward Zion; put yourselves under covert, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. "
Jeremiah,4,7,"A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place; to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. "
Jeremiah,4,8,"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of HaShem is not turned back from us. "
Jeremiah,4,9,"And it shall come to pass at that day, saith HaShem, that the heart of the king shall fail, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. "
Jeremiah,4,10,"Then said I: 'Ah, L-rd GOD! surely Thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.' "
Jeremiah,4,11,"At that time shall it be said of this people and of Jerusalem; a hot wind of the high hills in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to fan, nor to cleanse; "
Jeremiah,4,12,A wind too strong for this shall come for Me; now will I also utter judgments against them. 
Jeremiah,4,13,"Behold, he cometh up as clouds, and his chariots are as the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles.--' Woe unto us! for we are undone.'-- "
Jeremiah,4,14,"O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy baleful thoughts lodge within thee? "
Jeremiah,4,15,"For hark! one declareth from Dan, and announceth calamity from the hills of Ephraim: "
Jeremiah,4,16,"'Make ye mention to the nations: behold--publish concerning Jerusalem--watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.' "
Jeremiah,4,17,"As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against Me, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,4,18,"Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; yea, it is bitter, yea, it reacheth unto thy heart. "
Jeremiah,4,19,"My bowels, my bowels! I writhe in pain! The chambers of my heart! My heart moaneth within me! I cannot hold my peace! because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the horn, the alarm of war. "
Jeremiah,4,20,"Destruction followeth upon destruction, for the whole land is spoiled; suddenly are my tents spoiled, my curtains in a moment. "
Jeremiah,4,21,"How long shall I see the standard, shall I hear the sound of the horn? "
Jeremiah,4,22,"For My people is foolish, they know Me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. "
Jeremiah,4,23,"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. "
Jeremiah,4,24,"I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro. "
Jeremiah,4,25,"I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. "
Jeremiah,4,26,"I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of HaShem, and before His fierce anger. "
Jeremiah,4,27,For thus saith HaShem: The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. 
Jeremiah,4,28,"For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it. "
Jeremiah,4,29,"For the noise of the horsemen and bowmen the whole city fleeth; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks; every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein. "
Jeremiah,4,30,"And thou, that art spoiled, what doest thou, that thou clothest thyself with scarlet, that thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, that thou enlargest thine eyes with paint? In vain dost thou make thyself fair; thy lovers despise thee, they seek thy life. "
Jeremiah,4,31,"For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands: 'Woe is me, now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers.' "
Jeremiah,5,1,"Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her. "
Jeremiah,5,2,"And though they say: 'As HaShem liveth', surely they swear falsely. "
Jeremiah,5,3,"O HaShem, are not Thine eyes upon truth? Thou hast stricken them, but they were not affected; Thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. "
Jeremiah,5,4,"And I said: 'Surely these are poor, they are foolish, for they know not the way of HaShem, nor the ordinance of their G-d; "
Jeremiah,5,5,"I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of HaShem, and the ordinance of their G-d.' But these had altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bands. "
Jeremiah,5,6,"Wherefore a lion out of the forest doth slay them, a wolf of the deserts doth spoil them, a leopard watcheth over their cities, every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, their backslidings are increased. "
Jeremiah,5,7,"Wherefore should I pardon thee? The children have forsaken Me, and sworn by no-gods; and when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots' houses. "
Jeremiah,5,8,"They are become as well-fed horses, lusty stallions; every one neigheth after his neighbour's wife. "
Jeremiah,5,9,Shall I not punish for these things? saith HaShem; and shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
Jeremiah,5,10,"Go ye up into her rows, and destroy, but make not a full end; take away her shoots; for they are not HaShem'S. "
Jeremiah,5,11,"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against Me, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,5,12,"They have belied HaShem, and said: 'It is not He, neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine; "
Jeremiah,5,13,"And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them; thus be it done unto them.' "
Jeremiah,5,14,"Wherefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts: Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make My words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. "
Jeremiah,5,15,"Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith HaShem; it is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. "
Jeremiah,5,16,"Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. "
Jeremiah,5,17,"And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, they shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters, they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds, they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall batter thy fortified cities, wherein thou trusteth, with the sword. "
Jeremiah,5,18,"But even in those days, saith HaShem, I will not make a full end with you. "
Jeremiah,5,19,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say: 'Wherefore hath HaShem our G-d done all these things unto us?' then shalt Thou say unto them: 'Like as ye have forsaken Me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.' "
Jeremiah,5,20,"Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and announce it in Judah, saying: "
Jeremiah,5,21,"Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding, that have eyes, and see not, that have ears, and hear not: "
Jeremiah,5,22,"Fear ye not Me? saith HaShem; will ye not tremble at My presence? who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass; and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it. "
Jeremiah,5,23,"But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted, and gone. "
Jeremiah,5,24,"Neither say they in their heart: 'Let us now fear HaShem our G-d, that giveth the former rain, and the latter in due season; that keepeth for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.' "
Jeremiah,5,25,"Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you. "
Jeremiah,5,26,"For among My people are found wicked men; they pry, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men. "
Jeremiah,5,27,"As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit; therefore they are become great, and waxen rich; "
Jeremiah,5,28,"They are waxen fat, they are become sleek; yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they might make it to prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. "
Jeremiah,5,29,Shall I not punish for these things? saith HaShem; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
Jeremiah,5,30,An appalling and horrible thing is come to pass in the land: 
Jeremiah,5,31,"The prophets prophesy in the service of falsehood, and the priests bear rule at their beck; and My people love to have it so; what then will ye do in the end thereof? "
Jeremiah,6,1,"Put yourselves under covert, ye children of Benjamin, away from the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the horn in Tekoa, and set up a signal on Beth-cherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction. "
Jeremiah,6,2,"The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off. "
Jeremiah,6,3,Shepherds with their flocks come unto her; they pitch their tents against her round about; they feed bare every one what is nigh at hand. 
Jeremiah,6,4,"'Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon!' 'Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out!' "
Jeremiah,6,5,"'Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.' "
Jeremiah,6,6,"For thus hath HaShem of hosts said: hew ye down her trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem; this is the city to be punished; everywhere there is oppression in the midst of her. "
Jeremiah,6,7,"As a cistern welleth with her waters, so she welleth with her wickedness; violence and spoil is heard in her; before Me continually is sickness and wounds. "
Jeremiah,6,8,"Be thou corrected, O Jerusalem, lest My soul be alienated from thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. "
Jeremiah,6,9,Thus saith HaShem of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean as a vine the remnant of Israel; turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer upon the shoots. 
Jeremiah,6,10,"To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is dull, and they cannot attend; behold, the word of HaShem is become unto them a reproach, they have no delight in it. "
Jeremiah,6,11,"Therefore I am full of the fury of HaShem, I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the babes in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. "
Jeremiah,6,12,"And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,6,13,For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is greedy for gain; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
Jeremiah,6,14,"They have healed also the hurt of My people lightly, saying: 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace. "
Jeremiah,6,15,"They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination; yea, they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush; therefore they shall fall among them that fall, at the time that I punish them they shall stumble, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,6,16,"Thus saith HaShem: stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said: 'We will not walk therein.' "
Jeremiah,6,17,"And I set watchmen over you: 'Attend to the sound of the horn', but they said: 'We will not attend.' "
Jeremiah,6,18,"Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is against them. "
Jeremiah,6,19,"Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not attended unto My words, and as for My teaching, they have rejected it. "
Jeremiah,6,20,"To what purpose is to Me the frankincense that cometh from Sheba, and the sweet cane, from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto Me. "
Jeremiah,6,21,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them, the neighbour and his friend, and they shall perish. "
Jeremiah,6,22,"Thus saith HaShem: Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be roused from the uttermost parts of the earth. "
Jeremiah,6,23,"They lay hold on bow and spear, they are cruel, and have no compassion; their voice is like the roaring sea, and they ride upon horses; set in array, as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Zion. "
Jeremiah,6,24,"'We have heard the fame thereof, our hands wax feeble, anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.' "
Jeremiah,6,25,"Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for there is the sword of the enemy, and terror on every side. "
Jeremiah,6,26,"O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes; make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. "
Jeremiah,6,27,I have made thee a tower and a fortress among My people; that thou mayest know and try their way. 
Jeremiah,6,28,"They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron; they all of them deal corruptly. "
Jeremiah,6,29,"The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed of the fire; in vain doth the founder refine, for the wicked are not separated. "
Jeremiah,6,30,"Refuse silver shall men call them, because HaShem hath rejected them. "
Jeremiah,7,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,7,2,"Stand in the gate of HaShem'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say: Hear the word of HaShem, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship HaShem. "
Jeremiah,7,3,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. "
Jeremiah,7,4,"Trust ye not in lying words, saying: 'The temple of HaShem, the temple of HaShem, the temple of HaShem, are these.' "
Jeremiah,7,5,"Nay, but if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbour; "
Jeremiah,7,6,"if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt; "
Jeremiah,7,7,"then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. "
Jeremiah,7,8,"Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. "
Jeremiah,7,9,"Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and offer unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye have not known, "
Jeremiah,7,10,"and come and stand before Me in this house, whereupon My name is called, and say: 'We are delivered', that ye may do all these abominations? "
Jeremiah,7,11,"Is this house, whereupon My name is called, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,7,12,"For go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh, where I caused My name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Israel. "
Jeremiah,7,13,"And now, because ye have done all these works, saith HaShem, and I spoke unto you, speaking betimes and often, but ye heard not, and I called you, but ye answered not; "
Jeremiah,7,14,"therefore will I do unto the house, whereupon My name is called, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. "
Jeremiah,7,15,"And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. "
Jeremiah,7,16,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to Me; for I will not hear thee. "
Jeremiah,7,17,Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
Jeremiah,7,18,"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke Me. "
Jeremiah,7,19,"Do they provoke Me? saith HaShem; do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces? "
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, Mine anger and My fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the land; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched. "
Jeremiah,7,21,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh. "
Jeremiah,7,22,"For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices; "
Jeremiah,7,23,"but this thing I commanded them, saying: 'Hearken unto My voice, and I will be your G-d, and ye shall be My people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.' "
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels, even in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward, "
Jeremiah,7,25,"even since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day; and though I have sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily betimes and often, "
Jeremiah,7,26,"yet they hearkened not unto Me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff; they did worse than their fathers. "
Jeremiah,7,27,"And thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they will not hearken to thee; thou shalt also call unto them, but they will not answer thee. "
Jeremiah,7,28,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them: This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of HaShem their G-d, nor received correction; faithfulness is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. "
Jeremiah,7,29,"Cut off thy hair, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the high hills; for HaShem hath rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath. "
Jeremiah,7,30,"For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight, saith HaShem; they have set their detestable things in the house whereon My name is called, to defile it. "
Jeremiah,7,31,"And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind. "
Jeremiah,7,32,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter; for they shall bury in Topheth, for lack of room. "
Jeremiah,7,33,"And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away. "
Jeremiah,7,34,"Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall be desolate. "
Jeremiah,8,1,"At that time, saith HaShem, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves; "
Jeremiah,8,2,"and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped; they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. "
Jeremiah,8,3,"And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Jeremiah,8,4,"Moreover thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith HaShem: do men fall, and not rise up again? Doth one turn away, and not return? "
Jeremiah,8,5,"Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. "
Jeremiah,8,6,"I attended and listened, but they spoke not aright; no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying: 'What have I done?' Every one turneth away in his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle. "
Jeremiah,8,7,"Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but My people know not the ordinance of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,8,8,"How do ye say: 'We are wise, and the Law of HaShem is with us'? Lo, certainly in vain hath wrought the vain pen of the scribes. "
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they have rejected the word of HaShem; and what wisdom is in them? "
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them; for from the least even unto the greatest every one is greedy for gain, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. "
Jeremiah,8,11,"And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people lightly, saying: 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace. "
Jeremiah,8,12,"They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination; yea, they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush; therefore shall they fall among them that fall, in the time of their visitation they shall stumble, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will utterly consume them, saith HaShem; there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is faded; and I gave them that which they transgress. "
Jeremiah,8,14,"'Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be cut off there; for HaShem our G-d hath cut us off, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against HaShem. "
Jeremiah,8,15,"We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold terror!' "
Jeremiah,8,16,"The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those that dwell therein. "
Jeremiah,8,17,"For, behold, I will send serpents, basilisks, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,8,18,"Though I would take comfort against sorrow, my heart is faint within me. "
Jeremiah,8,19,"Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far off: 'Is not HaShem in Zion? Is not her King in her?'-- 'Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, and with strange vanities?'-- "
Jeremiah,8,20,"'The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.' "
Jeremiah,8,21,"For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I seized with anguish; I am black, appalment hath taken hold on me. "
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? 
Jeremiah,8,23,"Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! "
Jeremiah,9,1,"Oh that I were in the wilderness, in a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. "
Jeremiah,9,2,"And they bend their tongue, their bow of falsehood; and they are grown mighty in the land, but not for truth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and Me they know not, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,9,3,"Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother acteth subtly, and every neighbour goeth about with slanders. "
Jeremiah,9,4,"And they deceive every one his neighbour, and truth they speak not; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, they weary themselves to commit iniquity. "
Jeremiah,9,5,"Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,9,6,"Therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts: behold, I will smelt them, and try them; for how else should I do, because of the daughter of My people? "
Jeremiah,9,7,"Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaketh deceit; one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him. "
Jeremiah,9,8,Shall I not punish them for these things? saith HaShem; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
Jeremiah,9,9,"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through. And they hear not the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled, and gone. "
Jeremiah,9,10,"And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a lair of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without an inhabitant. "
Jeremiah,9,11,"Who is the wise man, that he may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of HaShem hath spoken, that he may declare it? Wherefore is the land perished and laid waste like a wilderness, so that none passeth through? "
Jeremiah,9,12,"And HaShem saith: Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not hearkened to My voice, neither walked therein; "
Jeremiah,9,13,"But have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them. "
Jeremiah,9,14,"Therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. "
Jeremiah,9,15,"I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them. "
Jeremiah,9,16,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the wise women, that they may come; "
Jeremiah,9,17,"And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. "
Jeremiah,9,18,"For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion: 'How are we undone! We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.' "
Jeremiah,9,19,"Yea, hear the word of HaShem, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of His mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation: "
Jeremiah,9,20,"'For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from the street, and the young men from the broad places.-- "
Jeremiah,9,21,"Speak: Thus saith HaShem--And the carcasses of men fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, which none gathereth.' "
Jeremiah,9,22,"Thus saith HaShem: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; "
Jeremiah,9,23,"But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth, and knoweth Me, that I am HaShem who exercise mercy, justice, and righteousness, in the earth; for in these things I delight, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,9,24,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision: "
Jeremiah,9,25,"Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. "
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear ye the word which HaShem speaketh unto you, O house of Israel; "
Jeremiah,10,2,"thus saith HaShem: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them. "
Jeremiah,10,3,"For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for it is but a tree which one cutteth out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. "
Jeremiah,10,4,"They deck it with silver and with gold, they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. "
Jeremiah,10,5,"They are like a pillar in a garden of cucumbers, and speak not; they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good. "
Jeremiah,10,6,"There is none like unto Thee, O HaShem; Thou art great, and Thy name is great in might. "
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who would not fear Thee, O king of the nations? For it befitteth Thee; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty, there is none like unto Thee. "
Jeremiah,10,8,But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock; 
Jeremiah,10,9,"Silver beaten into plates which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple is their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men. "
Jeremiah,10,10,"But HaShem G-d is the true G-d, He is the living G-d, and the everlasting King; at His wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide His indignation. "
Jeremiah,10,11,"Thus shall ye say unto them: 'The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.' "
Jeremiah,10,12,"He that hath made the earth by His power, that hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by His understanding; "
Jeremiah,10,13,"At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens, when He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; when He maketh lightnings with the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries; "
Jeremiah,10,14,"Every man is proved to be brutish, without knowledge, every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image, his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. "
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are vanity, a work of delusion; in the time of their visitation they shall perish. "
Jeremiah,10,16,"Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for He is the former of all things, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; HaShem of hosts is His name. "
Jeremiah,10,17,"Gather up thy wares from the ground, O thou that abidest in the siege. "
Jeremiah,10,18,"For thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it. "
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is grievous; but I said: 'This is but a sickness, and I must bear it.' "
Jeremiah,10,20,"My tent is spoiled, and all my cords are broken; my children are gone forth of me, and they are not; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. "
Jeremiah,10,21,"For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of HaShem; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered. "
Jeremiah,10,22,"Hark! a report, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, a dwelling-place of jackals. "
Jeremiah,10,23,"O HaShem, I know that man's way is not his own; it is not in man to direct his steps as he walketh. "
Jeremiah,10,24,"O HaShem, correct me, but in measure; not in Thine anger, lest Thou diminish me. "
Jeremiah,10,25,"Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the families that call not on Thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation. "
Jeremiah,11,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,11,2,"'Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,11,3,"and say thou unto them: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant, "
Jeremiah,11,4,"which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying: Hearken to My voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so shall ye be My people, and I will be your G-d; "
Jeremiah,11,5,"that I may establish the oath which I swore unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.' Then answered I, and said: 'Amen, O HaShem.' "
Jeremiah,11,6,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them. "
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I earnestly forewarned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, forewarning betimes and often, saying: Hearken to My voice. "
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart; therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.' "
Jeremiah,11,9,"And HaShem said unto me: 'A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,11,10,"They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers. "
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto Me, I will not hearken unto them. "
Jeremiah,11,12,Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
Jeremiah,11,13,"For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to offer unto Baal. "
Jeremiah,11,14,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto Me for their trouble.' "
Jeremiah,11,15,"What hath My beloved to do in My house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the hallowed flesh is passed from thee? When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. "
Jeremiah,11,16,"HaShem called thy name a leafy olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit; with the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken. "
Jeremiah,11,17,"For HaShem of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking Me by offering unto Baal. "
Jeremiah,11,18,"And HaShem gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it; then Thou showedst me their doings. "
Jeremiah,11,19,"But I was like a docile lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me: 'Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.' "
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, O HaShem of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I revealed my cause. "
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore thus saith HaShem concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying: 'Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of HaShem, that thou die not by our hand'; "
Jeremiah,11,22,"therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts: Behold, I will punish them; the young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; "
Jeremiah,11,23,"And there shall be no remnant unto them; for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation. "
Jeremiah,12,1,"Right wouldest Thou be, O HaShem, were I to contend with Thee, yet will I reason with Thee: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they secure that deal very treacherously? "
Jeremiah,12,2,"Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. "
Jeremiah,12,3,"But Thou, O HaShem, knowest me, Thou seest me, and triest my heart toward Thee; pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. "
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said: 'He seeth not our end.' "
Jeremiah,12,5,"'If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? And though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Jordan? "
Jeremiah,12,6,"For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried aloud after thee; believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.' "
Jeremiah,12,7,"I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies. "
Jeremiah,12,8,My heritage is become unto Me as a lion in the forest; she hath uttered her voice against Me; therefore have I hated her. 
Jeremiah,12,9,"Is My heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour. "
Jeremiah,12,10,"Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trodden My portion under foot, they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. "
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made it a desolation, it mourneth unto Me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. "
Jeremiah,12,12,"Upon all the high hills in the wilderness spoilers are come; for the sword of HaShem devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land, no flesh hath peace. "
Jeremiah,12,13,"They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, they profit not; be ye then ashamed of your increase, because of the fierce anger of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus saith HaShem: As for all Mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them. "
Jeremiah,12,15,"And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. "
Jeremiah,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people to swear by My name: 'As HaShem liveth,' even as they taught My people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of My people. "
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if they will not hearken, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus said HaShem unto me: 'Go, and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.' "
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I got a girdle according to the word of HaShem, and put it upon my loins. "
Jeremiah,13,3,"And the word of HaShem came unto me the second time, saying: "
Jeremiah,13,4,"'Take the girdle that thou hast gotten, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Perath, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.' "
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went, and hid it in Perath, as HaShem commanded me. "
Jeremiah,13,6,"And it came to pass after many days, that HaShem said unto me: 'Arise, go to Perath, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.' "
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to Perath, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. "
Jeremiah,13,8,"Then the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Jeremiah,13,9,"Thus saith HaShem: After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem, "
Jeremiah,13,10,"even this evil people, that refuse to hear My words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, that it be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing. "
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto Me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith HaShem, that they might be unto Me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hearken. "
Jeremiah,13,12,"Moreover thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: 'Every bottle is filled with wine'; and when they shall say unto thee: 'Do we not know that every bottle is filled with wine?' "
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then shalt thou say unto them: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. "
Jeremiah,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith HaShem; I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them. "
Jeremiah,13,15,"Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud; for HaShem hath spoken. "
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to HaShem your G-d, before it grow dark, and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight, and, while ye look for light, He turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. "
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and mine eyes shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because HaShem'S flock is carried away captive. "
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother: 'Sit ye down low; for your headtires are come down, even your beautiful crown.' "
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them; Judah is carried away captive all of it; it is wholly carried away captive. "
Jeremiah,13,20,"Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north; where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? "
Jeremiah,13,21,"What wilt thou say, when He shall set the friends over thee as head, whom thou thyself hast trained against thee? Shall not pangs take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail? "
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if thou say in thy heart: 'Wherefore are these things befallen me?' --for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence. "
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. "
Jeremiah,13,24,"Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. "
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from Me, saith HaShem; because thou hast forgotten Me, and trusted in falsehood. "
Jeremiah,13,26,"Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear. "
Jeremiah,13,27,"Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy harlotry, on the hills in the field have I seen thy detestable acts. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean! When shall it ever be? "
Jeremiah,14,1,The word of HaShem that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts. 
Jeremiah,14,2,"Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they bow down in black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. "
Jeremiah,14,3,"And their nobles send their lads for water: they come to the pits, and find no water; their vessels return empty; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads. "
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because of the ground which is cracked, for there hath been no rain in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads. "
Jeremiah,14,5,"Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young, because there is no grass, "
Jeremiah,14,6,"And the wild asses stand on the high hills, they gasp for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage. "
Jeremiah,14,7,"Though our iniquities testify against us, O HaShem, work Thou for Thy name's sake; for our backslidings are many, we have sinned against Thee. "
Jeremiah,14,8,"O Thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest Thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? "
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why shouldest thou be as a man overcome, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet Thou, O HaShem, art in the midst of us, and Thy name is called upon us; leave us not. "
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus saith HaShem unto this people: Even so have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet; therefore HaShem doth not accept them, now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins. "
Jeremiah,14,11,And HaShem said unto me: 'Pray not for this people for their good. 
Jeremiah,14,12,"When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.' "
Jeremiah,14,13,"Then said I: 'Ah, L-rd GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them: Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.' "
Jeremiah,14,14,"Then HaShem said unto me: 'The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I unto them; they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart. "
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: As for the prophets that prophesy in My name, and I sent them not, yet they say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land, by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed; "
Jeremiah,14,16,"and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their evil upon them.' "
Jeremiah,14,17,"And thou shalt say this word unto them: Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. "
Jeremiah,14,18,"If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest are gone about to a land, and knew it not. "
Jeremiah,14,19,"Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath Thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast Thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold terror! "
Jeremiah,14,20,"We acknowledge, O HaShem, our wickedness, even the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against Thee. "
Jeremiah,14,21,"Do not contemn us, for Thy name's sake, do not dishonour the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us. "
Jeremiah,14,22,"Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He, O HaShem our G-d, and do we not wait for Thee? For Thou hast made all these things. "
Jeremiah,15,1,"Then said HaShem unto me: 'Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My mind could not be toward this people; cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth. "
Jeremiah,15,2,"And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? then thou shall tell them: Thus saith HaShem: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity. "
Jeremiah,15,3,"And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith HaShem: the sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy. "
Jeremiah,15,4,"And I will cause them to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,15,5,"For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan thee? Or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare? "
Jeremiah,15,6,"Thou hast cast Me off, saith HaShem, thou art gone backward; therefore do I stretch out My hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting. "
Jeremiah,15,7,"And I fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I bereave them of children, I destroy My people, since they return not from their ways. "
Jeremiah,15,8,"Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas; I bring upon them, against the mother, a chosen one, even a spoiler at noonday; I cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly. "
Jeremiah,15,9,"She that hath borne seven languisheth; her spirit droopeth; her sun is gone down while it was yet day, she is ashamed and confounded; and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith HaShem.' "
Jeremiah,15,10,"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet every one of them doth curse me. "
Jeremiah,15,11,HaShem said: 'Verily I will release thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 
Jeremiah,15,12,Can iron break iron from the north and brass? 
Jeremiah,15,13,"Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. "
Jeremiah,15,14,"And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which shall burn upon you.' "
Jeremiah,15,15,"Thou, O HaShem, knowest; remember me, and think of me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away because of Thy long-suffering; know that for Thy sake I have suffered taunts. "
Jeremiah,15,16,"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart; because Thy name was called on me, O HaShem G-d of hosts. "
Jeremiah,15,17,"I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of Thy hand; for Thou hast filled me with indignation. "
Jeremiah,15,18,"Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, so that it refuseth to be healed? Wilt Thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail? "
Jeremiah,15,19,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: if thou return, and I bring thee back, thou shalt stand before Me; and if thou bring forth the precious out of the vile, thou shalt be as My mouth; let them return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them. "
Jeremiah,15,20,"And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,15,21,"And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. "
Jeremiah,16,1,"The word of HaShem came also unto me, saying: "
Jeremiah,16,2,"Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. "
Jeremiah,16,3,"For thus saith HaShem concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begot them in this land: "
Jeremiah,16,4,"They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried, they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. "
Jeremiah,16,5,"For thus saith HaShem: Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people, saith HaShem, even mercy and compassion. "
Jeremiah,16,6,"Both the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried; neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them; "
Jeremiah,16,7,"neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. "
Jeremiah,16,8,"And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink. "
Jeremiah,16,9,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. "
Jeremiah,16,10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee: 'Wherefore hath HaShem pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against HaShem our G-d?' "
Jeremiah,16,11,"then shalt thou say unto them: 'Because your fathers have forsaken Me, saith HaShem, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law; "
Jeremiah,16,12,"and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto Me; "
Jeremiah,16,13,"therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; forasmuch as I will show you no favour.' "
Jeremiah,16,14,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that it shall no more be said: 'As HaShem liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' "
Jeremiah,16,15,"but: 'As HaShem liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither He had driven them'; and I will bring them back into their land that I gave unto their fathers. "
Jeremiah,16,16,"Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith HaShem, and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks. "
Jeremiah,16,17,"For Mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from My face; neither is their iniquity concealed from Mine eyes. "
Jeremiah,16,18,And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have profaned My land; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations. 
Jeremiah,16,19,"O HaShem, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge, in the day of affliction, unto Thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: 'Our fathers have inherited nought but lies, vanity and things wherein there is no profit.' "
Jeremiah,16,20,"Shall a man make unto himself gods, and they are no gods? "
Jeremiah,16,21,"Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is HaShem. "
Jeremiah,17,1,"The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; it is graven upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars. "
Jeremiah,17,2,"Like the symbols of their sons are their altars, and their Asherim are by the leafy trees, upon the high hills. "
Jeremiah,17,3,"O thou that sittest upon the mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, and thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders. "
Jeremiah,17,4,"And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not; for ye have kindled a fire in My nostril, which shall burn for ever. "
Jeremiah,17,5,"Thus saith HaShem: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from HaShem. "
Jeremiah,17,6,"For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited. "
Jeremiah,17,7,"Blessed is the man that trusteth in HaShem, and whose trust HaShem is. "
Jeremiah,17,8,"For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but its foliage shall be luxuriant; and shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. "
Jeremiah,17,9,"The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceeding weak--who can know it? "
Jeremiah,17,10,"I HaShem search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings. "
Jeremiah,17,11,"As the partridge that broodeth over young which she hath not brought forth, so is he that getteth riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and at his end he shall be a fool. "
Jeremiah,17,12,"Thou throne of glory, on high from the beginning, thou place of our sanctuary, "
Jeremiah,17,13,"Thou hope of Israel, HaShem! All that forsake Thee shall be ashamed; they that depart from Thee shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken HaShem, the fountain of living waters. "
Jeremiah,17,14,"Heal me, O HaShem, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for Thou art my praise. "
Jeremiah,17,15,"Behold, they say unto me: 'Where is the word of HaShem? let it come now.' "
Jeremiah,17,16,"As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after Thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; Thou knowest it; that which came out of my lips was manifest before Thee. "
Jeremiah,17,17,Be not a ruin unto me; thou art my refuge in the day of evil. 
Jeremiah,17,18,"Let them be ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be ashamed; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction. "
Jeremiah,17,19,"Thus said HaShem unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,17,20,"and say unto them: Hear ye the word of HaShem, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates; "
Jeremiah,17,21,"thus saith HaShem: Take heed for the sake of your souls, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,17,22,"neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work; but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers; "
Jeremiah,17,23,"but they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. "
Jeremiah,17,24,"And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto Me, saith HaShem, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; "
Jeremiah,17,25,"then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited for ever. "
Jeremiah,17,26,"And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Lowland, and from the mountains, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, unto the house of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,17,27,"But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. "
Jeremiah,18,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,18,2,"'Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear My words.' "
Jeremiah,18,3,"Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he was at his work on the wheels. "
Jeremiah,18,4,"And whensoever the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. "
Jeremiah,18,5,"Then the word of HaShem came to me, saying: "
Jeremiah,18,6,"'O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith HaShem. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel. "
Jeremiah,18,7,"At one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; "
Jeremiah,18,8,"but if that nation turn from their evil, because of which I have spoken against it, I repent of the evil that I thought to do unto it. "
Jeremiah,18,9,"And at one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; "
Jeremiah,18,10,"but if it do evil in My sight, that it hearken not to My voice, then I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit it. "
Jeremiah,18,11,"Now therefore do thou speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you; return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings. "
Jeremiah,18,12,"But they say: There is no hope; but we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.' "
Jeremiah,18,13,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. "
Jeremiah,18,14,Doth the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? or are the strange cold flowing waters plucked up? 
Jeremiah,18,15,"For My people hath forgotten Me, they offer unto vanity; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up; "
Jeremiah,18,16,"To make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head. "
Jeremiah,18,17,"I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will look upon their back, and not their face, in the day of their calamity. "
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then said they: 'Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for instruction shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.' "
Jeremiah,18,19,"Give heed to me, O HaShem, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. "
Jeremiah,18,20,"Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before Thee to speak good for them, to turn away Thy wrath from them. "
Jeremiah,18,21,"Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and hurl them to the power of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, and their young men smitten of the sword in battle. "
Jeremiah,18,22,"Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. "
Jeremiah,18,23,"Yet, HaShem, Thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from Thy sight; but let them be made to stumble before Thee; deal Thou with them in the time of Thine anger. "
Jeremiah,19,1,"Thus said HaShem: Go, and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; "
Jeremiah,19,2,"and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee; "
Jeremiah,19,3,"and say: Hear ye the word of HaShem, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle; "
Jeremiah,19,4,"because they have forsaken Me, and have estranged this place, and have offered in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; "
Jeremiah,19,5,"and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind. "
Jeremiah,19,6,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter; "
Jeremiah,19,7,"and I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life; and their carcasses will I give to be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; "
Jeremiah,19,8,"and I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof; "
Jeremiah,19,9,"and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall straiten them. "
Jeremiah,19,10,"Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, "
Jeremiah,19,11,"and shalt say unto them: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, for want of room to bury. "
Jeremiah,19,12,"Thus will I do unto this place, saith HaShem, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth; "
Jeremiah,19,13,"and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have offered unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods. "
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither HaShem had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of HaShem'S house, and said to all the people: "
Jeremiah,19,15,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they might not hear My words.' "
Jeremiah,20,1,"Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of HaShem, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. "
Jeremiah,20,2,"Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,20,3,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him: 'The HaShem hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magormissabib."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. "
Jeremiah,20,5,"Moreover I will give all the store of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the wealth thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,20,6,"And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.' "
Jeremiah,20,7,"O HaShem, Thou hast enticed me, and I was enticed, Thou hast overcome me, and hast prevailed; I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me. "
Jeremiah,20,8,"For as often as I speak, I cry out, I cry: 'Violence and spoil'; because the word of HaShem is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day. "
Jeremiah,20,9,"And if I say: 'I will not make mention of Him, nor speak any more in His name', then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I weary myself to hold it in, but cannot. "
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I have heard the whispering of many, terror on every side: 'Denounce, and we will denounce him'; even of all my familiar friends, them that watch for my halting: 'Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.' "
Jeremiah,20,11,"But HaShem is with me as a mighty warrior; therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not prospered, even with an everlasting confusion which shall never be forgotten. "
Jeremiah,20,12,"But, O HaShem of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the reins and the heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I revealed my cause. "
Jeremiah,20,13,"Sing unto HaShem, praise ye HaShem; for He hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers. "
Jeremiah,20,14,"Cursed be the day wherein I was born; the day wherein my mother bore me, let it not be blessed. "
Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying: 'A man-child is born unto thee'; making him very glad. "
Jeremiah,20,16,"And let that man be as the cities which HaShem overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear a cry in the morning, and an alarm at noontide; "
Jeremiah,20,17,"Because He slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great. "
Jeremiah,20,18,"Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame? "
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from HaShem, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying: "
Jeremiah,21,2,"'Inquire, I pray thee, of HaShem for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; peradventure HaShem will deal with us according to all His wondrous works, that he may go up from us.' "
Jeremiah,21,3,Then said Jeremiah unto them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 
Jeremiah,21,4,"Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, that besiege you without the walls, and I will gather them into the midst of this city. "
Jeremiah,21,5,"And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. "
Jeremiah,21,6,"And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence. "
Jeremiah,21,7,"And afterward, saith HaShem, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have compassion. "
Jeremiah,21,8,"And unto this people thou shalt say: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. "
Jeremiah,21,9,"He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth away to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. "
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set My face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith HaShem; it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. "
Jeremiah,21,11,And unto the house of the king of Judah: Hear ye the word of HaShem; 
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David, thus saith HaShem: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. "
Jeremiah,21,13,"Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith HaShem; ye that say: 'Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?' "
Jeremiah,21,14,"And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith HaShem; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her. "
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus said HaShem: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, "
Jeremiah,22,2,"and say: Hear the word of HaShem, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates. "
Jeremiah,22,3,"Thus saith HaShem: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; and do no wrong, do no violence, to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. "
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. "
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by Myself, saith HaShem, that this house shall become a desolation. "
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus saith HaShem concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto Me, the head of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited. "
Jeremiah,22,7,"And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. "
Jeremiah,22,8,"And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour: 'Wherefore hath HaShem done thus unto this great city?' "
Jeremiah,22,9,"Then they shall answer: 'Because they forsook the covenant of HaShem their G-d, and worshipped other gods, and served them.' "
Jeremiah,22,10,"Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. "
Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus saith HaShem touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more; "
Jeremiah,22,12,"but in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more. "
Jeremiah,22,13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not his hire; "
Jeremiah,22,14,"That saith: 'I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers', and cutteth him out windows, and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. "
Jeremiah,22,15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him. "
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know Me? saith HaShem. 
Jeremiah,22,17,"But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. "
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus saith HaShem concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him: 'Ah my brother!' or: 'Ah sister!' They shall not lament for him: 'Ah lord!' or: 'Ah his glory!' "
Jeremiah,22,19,"He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon, and cry, and lift up thy voice in Bashan; and cry from Abarim, for all thy lovers are destroyed. "
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity, but thou saidst: 'I will not hear.' This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou hearkenedst not to My voice. "
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind shall feed upon all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. "
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, that art nestled in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! "
Jeremiah,22,24,"As I live, saith HaShem, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; "
Jeremiah,22,25,"and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. "
Jeremiah,22,26,"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. "
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land whereunto they long to return, thither shall they not return. "
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, broken image? Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not? "
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, hear the word of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus saith HaShem: Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. "
Jeremiah,23,1,Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture! saith HaShem. 
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, against the shepherds that feed My people: Ye have scattered My flock, and driven them away, and have not taken care of them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,3,"And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply. "
Jeremiah,23,4,"And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,5,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will raise unto David a righteous shoot, and he shall reign as king and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. "
Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, HaShem is our righteousness. "
Jeremiah,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that they shall no more say: 'As HaShem liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt'; "
Jeremiah,23,8,"but: 'As HaShem liveth, that brought up and that led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them'; and they shall dwell in their own land. "
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome; because of HaShem, and because of His holy words. "
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth, the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is evil, and their force is not right. "
Jeremiah,23,11,"For both prophet and priest are ungodly; yea, in My house have I found their wickedness, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,12,"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness, they shall be thrust, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,13,"And I have seen unseemliness in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal, and caused My people Israel to err. "
Jeremiah,23,14,"But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies, and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them become unto Me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. "
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land. "
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you, they lead you unto vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,17,They say continually unto them that despise Me: 'The HaShem hath said: Ye shall have peace'; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say: 'No evil shall come upon you'; 
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who hath stood in the council of HaShem, that he should perceive and hear His word? Who hath attended to His word, and heard it? "
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, a storm of HaShem is gone forth in fury, yea, a whirling storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked. "
Jeremiah,23,20,"The anger of HaShem shall not return, until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart; in the end of days ye shall consider it perfectly. "
Jeremiah,23,21,"I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. "
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they have stood in My council, then let them cause My people to hear My words, and turn them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. "
Jeremiah,23,23,"Am I a G-d near at hand, saith HaShem, and not a G-d afar off? "
Jeremiah,23,24,Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith HaShem. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith HaShem. 
Jeremiah,23,25,"I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in My name, saying: 'I have dreamed, I have dreamed.' "
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long shall this be? Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? "
Jeremiah,23,27,"That think to cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal. "
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word; let him speak My word faithfully. What hath the straw to do with the wheat? saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,29,Is not My word like as fire? saith HaShem; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? 
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith HaShem, that steal My words every one from his neighbour. "
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets, saith HaShem, that use there tongues and say: 'He saith.' "
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith HaShem, and do tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies, and by their wantonness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither can they profit this people at all, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,23,33,"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying: 'What is the burden of HaShem?' then shalt thou say unto them: 'What burden! I will cast you off, saith HaShem.' "
Jeremiah,23,34,"And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say: 'The burden of HaShem', I will even punish that man and his house. "
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother: 'What hath HaShem answered?' and: 'What hath HaShem spoken?' "
Jeremiah,23,36,"And the burden of HaShem shall ye mention no more; for every man's own word shall be his burden; and would ye pervert the words of the living G-d, of HaShem of hosts our G-d? "
Jeremiah,23,37,Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: 'What hath HaShem answered thee?' and: 'What hath HaShem spoken?' 
Jeremiah,23,38,"But if ye say: 'The burden of HaShem'; therefore thus saith HaShem: Because ye say this word: 'The burden of HaShem', and I have sent unto you, saying: 'Ye shall not say: The burden of HaShem'; "
Jeremiah,23,39,"therefore, behold, I will utterly tear you out, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from My presence; "
Jeremiah,23,40,"and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten "
Jeremiah,24,1,"HaShem showed me, and behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of HaShem; after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. "
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then said HaShem unto me: 'What seest thou, Jeremiah?' And I said: 'Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.' "
Jeremiah,24,4,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Jeremiah,24,5,"'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good. "
Jeremiah,24,6,"And I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. "
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am HaShem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their G-d; for they shall return unto Me with their whole heart. "
Jeremiah,24,8,"And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith HaShem: So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt; "
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will even make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. "
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.' "
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; "
Jeremiah,25,2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: "
Jeremiah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of HaShem hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, speaking betimes and often; but ye have not hearkened. "
Jeremiah,25,4,"And HaShem hath sent unto you all His servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often--but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear-- "
Jeremiah,25,5,"saying: 'Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that HaShem hath given unto you and to your fathers, for ever and ever; "
Jeremiah,25,6,"and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke Me not with the work of your hands, and I will do you no hurt.' "
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet ye have not hearkened unto Me, saith HaShem; that ye might provoke Me with the work of your hands to your own hurt. "
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts: Because ye have not heard My words, "
Jeremiah,25,9,"behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith HaShem, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. "
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will cause to cease from among them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. "
Jeremiah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, and a waste; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. "
Jeremiah,25,12,"And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith HaShem, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it perpetual desolations. "
Jeremiah,25,13,"And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. "
Jeremiah,25,14,"For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their own hands. "
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of fury at My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. "
Jeremiah,25,16,"And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be like madmen, because of the sword that I will send among them.-- "
Jeremiah,25,17,"Then took I the cup of HaShem'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom HaShem had sent me: "
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them an appalment, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; "
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; "
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the mingled people; and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; "
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon; "
Jeremiah,25,22,"and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; "
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners of their hair polled; "
Jeremiah,25,24,"and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness; "
Jeremiah,25,25,"and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; "
Jeremiah,25,26,"and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth. --And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. "
Jeremiah,25,27,"And thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. "
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Ye shall surely drink. "
Jeremiah,25,29,"For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city whereupon My name is called, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Jeremiah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them: HaShem doth roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He doth mightily roar because of His fold; He giveth a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. "
Jeremiah,25,31,"A noise is come even to the end of the earth; for HaShem hath a controversy with the nations, He doth plead with all flesh; as for the wicked, He hath given them to the sword, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth. "
Jeremiah,25,33,"And the slain of HaShem shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground. "
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the dust, ye leaders of the flock; for the days of your slaughter are fully come, and I will break you in pieces, and ye shall fall like a precious vessel. "
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock to escape. "
Jeremiah,25,36,"Hark! the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the leaders of the flock! For HaShem despoileth their pasture. "
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of HaShem. 
Jeremiah,25,38,"He hath forsaken His covert, as the lion; for their land is become a waste because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of His fierce anger.  "
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,26,2,"'Thus saith HaShem: Stand in the court of HaShem'S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in HaShem'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word. "
Jeremiah,26,3,"It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent Me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. "
Jeremiah,26,4,"And thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith HaShem: If ye will not hearken to Me, to walk in My law, which I have set before you, "
Jeremiah,26,5,"to hearken to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even sending them betimes and often, but ye have not hearkened; "
Jeremiah,26,6,"then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.' "
Jeremiah,26,7,So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of HaShem. 
Jeremiah,26,8,"Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that HaShem had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying: 'Thou shalt surely die. "
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why hast thou prophesied in the name of HaShem, saying: This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant?' And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house unto the house of HaShem; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of HaShem'S house. "
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying: 'This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.' "
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying: 'The HaShem sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. "
Jeremiah,26,13,"Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of HaShem your G-d; and HaShem will repent Him of the evil that He hath pronounced against you. "
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as is good and right in your eyes. "
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth HaShem hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.' "
Jeremiah,26,16,Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: 'This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of HaShem our G-d.' 
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: "
Jeremiah,26,18,"'Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. "
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear HaShem, and entreat the favour of HaShem, and HaShem repented Him of the evil which He had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our own souls.' "
Jeremiah,26,20,"And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of HaShem, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah; "
Jeremiah,26,21,"and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; "
Jeremiah,26,22,"and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; "
Jeremiah,26,23,"and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people. "
Jeremiah,26,24,"Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. "
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,27,2,"'Thus saith HaShem to me: Make thee bands and bars, and put them upon thy neck; "
Jeremiah,27,3,"and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; "
Jeremiah,27,4,"and give them a charge unto their masters, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Thus shall ye say unto your masters: "
Jeremiah,27,5,"I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto Me. "
Jeremiah,27,6,"And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him. "
Jeremiah,27,7,"And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land come; and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman. "
Jeremiah,27,8,"And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I visit, saith HaShem, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. "
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; "
Jeremiah,27,10,"for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out and ye should perish. "
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith HaShem; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.' "
Jeremiah,27,12,"And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying: 'Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. "
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as HaShem hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? "
Jeremiah,27,14,"And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon, for they prophesy a lie unto you. "
Jeremiah,27,15,"For I have not sent them, saith HaShem, and they prophesy falsely in My name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.' "
Jeremiah,27,16,"Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying: Behold, the vessels of HaShem'S house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. "
Jeremiah,27,17,"Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live; wherefore should this city become desolate? "
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they be prophets, and if the word of HaShem be with them, let them now make intercession to HaShem of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of HaShem, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, "
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,27,21,"yea, thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of HaShem, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: "
Jeremiah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I remember them, saith HaShem, and bring them up, and restore them to this place.' "
Jeremiah,28,1,"And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of HaShem, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying: "
Jeremiah,28,2,"'Thus speaketh HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, saying: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. "
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of HaShem'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon; "
Jeremiah,28,4,"and I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith HaShem; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.' "
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of HaShem, "
Jeremiah,28,6,"even the prophet Jeremiah said: 'Amen! HaShem do so! HaShem perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of HaShem'S house, and all them that are carried away captive, from Babylon unto this place! "
Jeremiah,28,7,"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: "
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. "
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that HaShem hath truly sent him.' "
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it. "
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.' And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. "
Jeremiah,28,12,"Then the word of HaShem came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,28,13,"'Go, and tell Hananiah, saying: Thus saith HaShem: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou shalt make in their stead bars of iron. "
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him; and I have given him the beasts of the field also.' "
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet: 'Hear now, Hananiah; HaShem hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. "
Jeremiah,28,16,"'Therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth; this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken perversion against HaShem.' "
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. 
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, "
Jeremiah,29,2,"after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the officers, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,29,3,"by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying: "
Jeremiah,29,4,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon: "
Jeremiah,29,5,"Build ye houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; "
Jeremiah,29,6,"take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished. "
Jeremiah,29,7,"And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto HaShem for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. "
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, beguile you, neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. "
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy falsely unto you in My name; I have not sent them, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,29,10,"For thus saith HaShem: After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will remember you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. "
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith HaShem, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. "
Jeremiah,29,12,"And ye shall call upon Me, and go, and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you. "
Jeremiah,29,13,"And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart. "
Jeremiah,29,14,"And I will be found of you, saith HaShem, and I will turn your captivity, and gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith HaShem; and I will bring you back unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. "
Jeremiah,29,15,For ye have said: 'The HaShem hath raised us up prophets in Babylon.' 
Jeremiah,29,16,"For thus saith HaShem concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; "
Jeremiah,29,17,"thus saith HaShem of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. "
Jeremiah,29,18,"And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will make them a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them; "
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they have not hearkened to My words, saith HaShem, wherewith I sent unto them My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often; but ye would not hear, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,29,20,"Hear ye therefore the word of HaShem, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon: "
Jeremiah,29,21,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; "
Jeremiah,29,22,"and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: 'The HaShem make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire'; "
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have wrought vile deeds in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I commanded them not; but I am He that knoweth, and am witness, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,29,24,"And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying: "
Jeremiah,29,25,"Thus speaketh HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, saying: Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying: "
Jeremiah,29,26,"'The HaShem hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers in the house of HaShem for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the collar. "
Jeremiah,29,27,"Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you, "
Jeremiah,29,28,"forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying: The captivity is long; build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?' "
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
Jeremiah,29,30,"Then came the word of HaShem unto Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,29,31,"Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith HaShem concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie; "
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto My people, saith HaShem; because he hath spoken perversion against HaShem. "
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,30,2,"'Thus speaketh HaShem, the G-d of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. "
Jeremiah,30,3,"For, lo, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will turn the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, saith HaShem; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.' "
Jeremiah,30,4,And these are the words that HaShem spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 
Jeremiah,30,5,"For thus saith HaShem: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. "
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child; wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? "
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it; and it is a time of trouble unto Jacob, but out of it shall he be saved. "
Jeremiah,30,8,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith HaShem of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bands; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman; "
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they shall serve HaShem their G-d, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. "
Jeremiah,30,10,"Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith HaShem; neither be dismayed, O Israel; for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. "
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with thee, saith HaShem, to save thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; for I will correct thee in measure, and will not utterly destroy thee. "
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus saith HaShem: Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. "
Jeremiah,30,13,None deemeth of thy wound that it may be bound up; thou hast no healing medicines. 
Jeremiah,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee, they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased. "
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why criest thou for thy hurt, that thy pain is incurable? For the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. "
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. "
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith HaShem; because they have called thee an outcast: 'She is Zion, there is none that careth for her.' "
Jeremiah,30,18,"Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon her own mound, and the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place. "
Jeremiah,30,19,"And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished, I will also increase them, and they shall not dwindle away. "
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress them. "
Jeremiah,30,21,"And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; for who is he that hath pledged his heart to approach unto Me? saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,30,22,"And ye shall be My people, and I will be your G-d. "
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, a storm of HaShem is gone forth in fury, a sweeping storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked. "
Jeremiah,30,24,"The fierce anger of HaShem shall not return, until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart; in the end of days ye shall consider it.  "
Jeremiah,31,1,"At that time, saith HaShem, will I be the G-d of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people. "
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus saith HaShem: the people that were left of the sword have found grace in the wilderness, even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest. "
Jeremiah,31,3,"'From afar HaShem appeared unto me.' 'Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with affection have I drawn thee. "
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. "
Jeremiah,31,5,"Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall have the use thereof. "
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there shall be a day, that the watchmen shall call upon the mount Ephraim: arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, unto HaShem our G-d.' "
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus saith HaShem: sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout at the head of the nations; announce ye, praise ye, and say: 'O HaShem, save Thy people, The remnant of Israel.' "
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together; a great company shall they return hither. "
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is My first-born. "
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of HaShem, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say: 'He that scattered Israel doth gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.' "
Jeremiah,31,11,"For HaShem hath ransomed Jacob, and He redeemeth him from the hand of him that is stronger than he. "
Jeremiah,31,12,"And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of HaShem, to the corn, and to the wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not pine any more at all. "
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. "
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus saith HaShem: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not. "
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus saith HaShem: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith HaShem; and they shall come back from the land of the enemy. "
Jeremiah,31,17,"And there is hope for thy future, saith HaShem; and thy children shall return to their own border. "
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself: 'Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf untrained; turn thou me, and I shall be turned, for Thou art HaShem my G-d. "
Jeremiah,31,19,"Surely after that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.' "
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim a darling son unto Me? Is he a child that is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore My heart yearneth for him, I will surely have compassion upon him, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the high-way, even the way by which thou wentest; return, O virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities. "
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long wilt thou turn away coyly, O thou backsliding daughter? For HaShem hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall court a man. "
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall turn their captivity: 'The HaShem bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.' "
Jeremiah,31,24,"And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together: the husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. "
Jeremiah,31,25,"For I have satiated the weary soul, and every pining soul have I replenished. "
Jeremiah,31,26,"Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. "
Jeremiah,31,27,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. "
Jeremiah,31,28,"And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to overthrow and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,31,29,"In those days they shall say no more: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' "
Jeremiah,31,30,"But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. "
Jeremiah,31,31,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; "
Jeremiah,31,32,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; forasmuch as they broke My covenant, although I was a lord over them, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,31,33,"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith HaShem, I will put My law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their G-d, and they shall be My people; "
Jeremiah,31,34,"and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: 'Know HaShem'; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith HaShem; for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more. "
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus saith HaShem, Who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar, HaShem of hosts is His name: "
Jeremiah,31,36,"If these ordinances depart from before Me, saith HaShem, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me for ever. "
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus saith HaShem: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,31,38,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that the city shall be built to HaShem from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner. "
Jeremiah,31,39,"And the measuring line shall yet go out straight forward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah. "
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto HaShem; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. "
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from HaShem in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. "
Jeremiah,32,2,"Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house. "
Jeremiah,32,3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying: 'Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; "
Jeremiah,32,4,"and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; "
Jeremiah,32,5,"and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I remember him, saith HaShem; though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?' "
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said: 'The word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Jeremiah,32,7,"Behold, Hanamel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall come unto thee, saying: Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.' "
Jeremiah,32,8,"So Hanamel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of HaShem, and said unto me: 'Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.' Then I knew that this was the word of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,32,9,"And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. "
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. "
Jeremiah,32,11,"So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open; "
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle 's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. "
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I charged Baruch before them, saying: "
Jeremiah,32,14,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. "
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.' "
Jeremiah,32,16,"Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,32,17,"'Ah L-rd GOD! behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for Thee; "
Jeremiah,32,18,"who showest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty G-d, HaShem of hosts is His name; "
Jeremiah,32,19,"great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; "
Jeremiah,32,20,"who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel and among other men; and madest Thee a name, as at this day; "
Jeremiah,32,21,"and didst bring forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; "
Jeremiah,32,22,"and gavest them this land, which Thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; "
Jeremiah,32,23,"and they came in, and possessed it; but they hearkened not to Thy voice, neither walked in Thy law; they have done nothing of all that Thou commandedst them to do; therefore Thou hast caused all this evil to befall them; "
Jeremiah,32,24,"behold the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what Thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, Thou seest it. "
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yet Thou hast said unto me, O L-rd GOD: Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.' "
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then came the word of HaShem unto Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,32,27,"'Behold, I am HaShem, the G-d of all flesh; is there any thing too hard for Me? "
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it; "
Jeremiah,32,29,"and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke Me. "
Jeremiah,32,30,"For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me with the work of their hands, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,32,31,"For this city hath been to Me a provocation of Mine anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even unto this day, that I should remove it from before My face; "
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they have turned unto Me the back, and not the face; and though I taught them, teaching them betimes and often, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. "
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they set their abominations in the house whereupon My name is called, to defile it. "
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to set apart their sons and their daughters unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination; to cause Judah to sin. "
Jeremiah,32,36,"And now therefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say: It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: "
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them back unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely; "
Jeremiah,32,38,"and they shall be My people, and I will be their G-d; "
Jeremiah,32,39,"and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them; "
Jeremiah,32,40,"and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me. "
Jeremiah,32,41,"Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth with My whole heart and with My whole soul. "
Jeremiah,32,42,"For thus saith HaShem: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. "
Jeremiah,32,43,"And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say: It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. "
Jeremiah,32,44,"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the Lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to return, saith HaShem.' "
Jeremiah,33,1,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying: "
Jeremiah,33,2,"Thus saith HaShem the Maker thereof, HaShem that formed it to establish it, HaShem is His name: "
Jeremiah,33,3,"Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and will tell thee great things, and hidden, which thou knowest not. "
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down for mounds, and for ramparts; "
Jeremiah,33,5,"whereon they come to fight with the Chaldeans, even to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in Mine anger and in My fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid My face from this city: "
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring it healing and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. "
Jeremiah,33,7,"And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. "
Jeremiah,33,8,"And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against Me, and whereby they have transgressed against Me. "
Jeremiah,33,9,"And this city shall be to Me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it. "
Jeremiah,33,10,"Thus saith HaShem: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say: It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, "
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say: 'Give thanks to HaShem of hosts, for HaShem is good, for His mercy endureth for ever', even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of HaShem. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,33,12,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. "
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the Lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that counteth them, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,33,14,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah. "
Jeremiah,33,15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause a shoot of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. "
Jeremiah,33,16,"In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby she shall be called, HaShem is our righteousness. "
Jeremiah,33,17,For thus saith HaShem: There shall not be cut off unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; 
Jeremiah,33,18,"neither shall there be cut off unto the priests the Levites a man before Me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually. "
Jeremiah,33,19,"And the word of HaShem came unto Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,33,20,"Thus saith HaShem: If ye can break My covenant with the day, and My covenant with the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season; "
Jeremiah,33,21,"Then may also My covenant be broken with David My servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, My ministers. "
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David My servant, and the Levites that minister unto Me. "
Jeremiah,33,23,"And the word of HaShem came to Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,33,24,"'Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying: The two families which HaShem did choose, He hath cast them off? and they contemn My people, that they should be no more a nation before them. "
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus saith HaShem: If My covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; "
Jeremiah,33,26,"then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David My servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have compassion on them.' "
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from HaShem, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the land of his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying: "
Jeremiah,34,2,"Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire; "
Jeremiah,34,3,"and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of HaShem, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Thus saith HaShem concerning thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword; "
Jeremiah,34,5,"thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee: 'Ah lord!' for I have spoken the word, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, "
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. "
Jeremiah,34,8,"The word that came unto Jeremiah from HaShem, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; "
Jeremiah,34,9,"that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, even of a Jew his brother; "
Jeremiah,34,10,"and all the princes and all the people hearkened, that had entered into the covenant to let every one his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, and not to make bondmen of them any more; they hearkened, and let them go; "
Jeremiah,34,11,"but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids; "
Jeremiah,34,12,"therefore the word of HaShem came to Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,34,13,"Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: "
Jeremiah,34,14,"'At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee'; but your fathers hearkened not unto Me, neither inclined their ear. "
Jeremiah,34,15,"And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in Mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before Me in the house whereon My name is called; "
Jeremiah,34,16,"but ye turned and profaned My name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. "
Jeremiah,34,17,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Ye have not hearkened unto Me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; behold, I proclaim for you a liberty, saith HaShem, unto the sword, unto the pestilence, and unto the famine; and I will make you a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth. "
Jeremiah,34,18,"And I will give the men that have transgressed My covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof; "
Jeremiah,34,19,"the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf; "
Jeremiah,34,20,"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. "
Jeremiah,34,21,"And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, that are gone up from you. "
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I will command, saith HaShem, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant. "
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from HaShem in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: "
Jeremiah,35,2,"'Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of HaShem, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.' "
Jeremiah,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; "
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them into the house of HaShem, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of G-d, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door; "
Jeremiah,35,5,"and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them: 'Drink ye wine.' "
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they said: 'We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying: Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever; "
Jeremiah,35,7,"neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn. "
Jeremiah,35,8,"And we have hearkened to the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; "
Jeremiah,35,9,"nor to build houses for us to dwell in, neither to have vineyard, or field, or seed; "
Jeremiah,35,10,"but we have dwelt in tents, and have hearkened, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. "
Jeremiah,35,11,"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, that we said: Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Arameans; so we dwell at Jerusalem.' "
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then came the word of HaShem unto Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,35,13,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to My words? saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,35,14,"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed, and unto this day they drink none, for they hearken to their father's commandment; but I have spoken unto you, speaking betimes and often, and ye have not hearkened unto Me. "
Jeremiah,35,15,"I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often, saying: Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto Me. "
Jeremiah,35,16,"Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto Me; "
Jeremiah,35,17,"therefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard, and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.' "
Jeremiah,35,18,"And unto the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Because ye have hearkened to the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you; "
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: There shall not be cut off unto Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before Me for ever.' "
Jeremiah,36,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from HaShem, saying: "
Jeremiah,36,2,"'Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. "
Jeremiah,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way, and I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.' "
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of HaShem, which He had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. "
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying: 'I am detained, I cannot go into the house of HaShem; "
Jeremiah,36,6,"therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of HaShem in the ears of the people in HaShem'S house upon a fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. "
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be they will present their supplication before HaShem, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the fury that HaShem hath pronounced against this people.' "
Jeremiah,36,8,"And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of HaShem in HaShem'S house. "
Jeremiah,36,9,"Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before HaShem, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then did Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of HaShem, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of HaShem'S house, in the ears of all the people. "
Jeremiah,36,11,"And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of HaShem, "
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber; and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. "
Jeremiah,36,13,"Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. "
Jeremiah,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying: 'Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come.' So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. "
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said unto him: 'Sit down now, and read it in our ears.' So Baruch read it in their ears. "
Jeremiah,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch: 'We will surely tell the king of all these words.' "
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying: 'Tell us now: How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?' "
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them: 'He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.' "
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then said the princes unto Baruch: 'Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.' "
Jeremiah,36,20,And they went in to the king into the court; but they had deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king. 
Jeremiah,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. "
Jeremiah,36,22,Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month; and the brazier was burning before him. 
Jeremiah,36,23,"And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. "
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. "
Jeremiah,36,25,Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king not to burn the roll; but he would not hear them. 
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but HaShem hid them. "
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then the word of HaShem came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,36,28,"'Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. "
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say: Thus saith HaShem: Thou hast burned this roll, saying: Why hast thou written therein, saying: The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? "
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus saith HaShem concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. "
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will visit upon him and his seed and his servants their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.' "
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words. "
Jeremiah,37,1,"And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. "
Jeremiah,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of HaShem, which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. "
Jeremiah,37,3,"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 'Pray now unto HaShem our G-d for us.' "
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison. 
Jeremiah,37,5,"And Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they broke up from Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then came the word of HaShem unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,37,7,"'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. "
Jeremiah,37,8,"And the Chaldeans shall return, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire. "
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus saith HaShem: Deceive not yourselves, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart. "
Jeremiah,37,10,"For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.' "
Jeremiah,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, "
Jeremiah,37,12,"then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people. "
Jeremiah,37,13,"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying: 'Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.' "
Jeremiah,37,14,"Then said Jeremiah: 'It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans'; but he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. "
Jeremiah,37,15,"And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. "
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; "
Jeremiah,37,17,"then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him; and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said: 'Is there any word from HaShem?' And Jeremiah said: 'There is.' He said also: 'Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.' "
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah: 'Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? "
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? "
Jeremiah,37,20,"And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.' "
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. "
Jeremiah,38,1,"And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying: "
Jeremiah,38,2,"'Thus saith HaShem: He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live. "
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus saith HaShem: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.' "
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the princes said unto the king: 'Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.' "
Jeremiah,38,5,"Then Zedekiah the king said: 'Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.' "
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of Malchiah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the pit there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. "
Jeremiah,38,7,"Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an officer, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; "
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying: "
Jeremiah,38,9,"'My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit; and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.' "
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: 'Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the pit, before he die.' "
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence worn clouts and worn rags, and let them down by cords into the pit to Jeremiah. "
Jeremiah,38,12,And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah: 'Put now these worn clouts and rags under thine armholes under the cords.' And Jeremiah did so. 
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. "
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of HaShem; and the king said unto Jeremiah: 'I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.' "
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah: 'If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.' "
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying: 'As HaShem liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.' "
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts, the G-d of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, thou, and thy house; "
Jeremiah,38,18,"but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.' "
Jeremiah,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah: 'I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.' "
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah said: 'They shall not deliver thee. Hearken, I beseech thee, to the voice of HaShem, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. "
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that HaShem hath shown me: "
Jeremiah,38,22,"Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say: Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back. "
Jeremiah,38,23,"And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.' "
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: 'Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. "
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee: Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee; "
Jeremiah,38,26,"then thou shalt say unto them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.' "
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not reported. "
Jeremiah,38,28,"So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass, when Jerusalem was taken-- "
Jeremiah,39,1,"in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it; "
Jeremiah,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city-- "
Jeremiah,39,3,"that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sarezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim Rab-saris, Nergal-sarezer Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. "
Jeremiah,39,4,"And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out the way of the Arabah. "
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him. "
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes; also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
Jeremiah,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,39,8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the house of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. "
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also, that fell away to him, with the rest of the people that remained. "
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields in that day. "
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying: "
Jeremiah,39,12,"'Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.' "
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban Rab-saris, and Nergal-sarezer Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; "
Jeremiah,39,14,"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home; so he dwelt among the people. "
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word of HaShem came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying: "
Jeremiah,39,16,"'Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day. "
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith HaShem; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. "
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in Me, saith HaShem.'  "
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from HaShem, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon. "
Jeremiah,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him: 'The HaShem thy G-d pronounced this evil upon this place; "
Jeremiah,40,3,"and HaShem hath brought it, and done according as He spoke; because ye have sinned against HaShem, and have not hearkened to His voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. "
Jeremiah,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear; behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.-- "
Jeremiah,40,5,"Yet he would not go back. --Go back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go.' So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance and a present, and let him go. "
Jeremiah,40,6,"Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. "
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; "
Jeremiah,40,8,"then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. "
Jeremiah,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying: 'Fear not to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. "
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that may come unto us; but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.' "
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; "
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance. "
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, "
Jeremiah,40,14,and said unto him: 'Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life?' But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying: 'Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it; wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?' "
Jeremiah,40,16,But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah: 'Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.' 
Jeremiah,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. "
Jeremiah,41,2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. "
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, even the men of war. "
Jeremiah,41,4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, "
Jeremiah,41,5,"that there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house of HaShem. "
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them: 'Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.' "
Jeremiah,41,7,"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. "
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael: 'Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.' So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren. "
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with them that were slain. 
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon. "
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, "
Jeremiah,41,12,"then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. "
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now it came to pass, that when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. "
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. "
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. "
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men, even the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the officers, whom he had brought back from Gibeon; "
Jeremiah,41,17,"and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt, "
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land. "
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, "
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said unto Jeremiah the prophet: 'Let, we pray thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto HaShem thy G-d, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us; "
Jeremiah,42,3,"that HaShem thy G-d may tell us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.' "
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them: 'I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto HaShem your G-d according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing HaShem shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.' "
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah: 'The HaShem be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not even according to all the word wherewith HaShem thy G-d shall send thee to us. "
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will hearken to the voice of HaShem our G-d, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we hearken to the voice of HaShem our G-d.' "
Jeremiah,42,7,"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of HaShem came unto Jeremiah. "
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, "
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before Him: "
Jeremiah,42,10,"If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent Me of the evil that I have done unto you. "
Jeremiah,42,11,"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith HaShem; for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. "
Jeremiah,42,12,"And I will grant you compassion, that he may have compassion upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. "
Jeremiah,42,13,But if ye say: We will not abide in this land; so that ye hearken not to the voice of HaShem your G-d; 
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying: No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the horn, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we abide; "
Jeremiah,42,15,"now therefore hear ye the word of HaShem, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; "
Jeremiah,42,16,"then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. "
Jeremiah,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. "
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: As Mine anger and My fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. "
Jeremiah,42,19,"HaShem hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah: Go ye not into Egypt; know certainly that I have forewarned you this day. "
Jeremiah,42,20,"For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto HaShem your G-d, saying: Pray for us unto HaShem our G-d; and according unto all that HaShem our G-d shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it; "
Jeremiah,42,21,and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not hearkened to the voice of HaShem your G-d in any thing for which He hath sent me unto you. 
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.' "
Jeremiah,43,1,"And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of HaShem their G-d, wherewith HaShem their G-d had sent him to them, even all these words, "
Jeremiah,43,2,"then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah: 'Thou speakest falsely; HaShem our G-d hath not sent thee to say: Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there; "
Jeremiah,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives to Babylon.' "
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, hearkened not to the voice of HaShem, to dwell in the land of Judah. "
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of Judah: "
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah; "
Jeremiah,43,7,and they came into the land of Egypt; for they hearkened not to the voice of HaShem; and they came even to Tahpanhes. 
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then came the word of HaShem unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying: "
Jeremiah,43,9,"'Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the mortar in the framework, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; "
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say unto them: Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. "
Jeremiah,43,11,"And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. "
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives; and he shall fold up the land of Egypt, as a shepherd foldeth up his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. "
Jeremiah,43,13,"He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.' "
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying: "
Jeremiah,44,2,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein; "
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me, in that they went to offer, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers. "
Jeremiah,44,4,"Howbeit I sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often, saying: Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. "
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to forbear offering unto other gods. "
Jeremiah,44,6,"Wherefore My fury and Mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. "
Jeremiah,44,7,"Therefore now thus saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining; "
Jeremiah,44,8,"in that ye provoke Me with the works of your hands, offering unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? "
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers, and the wicked deeds of the kings of Judah, and the wicked deeds of their wives, and your own wicked deeds, and the wicked deeds of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? "
Jeremiah,44,10,"They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in My law, nor in My statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. "
Jeremiah,44,11,"Therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. "
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. "
Jeremiah,44,13,"For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; "
Jeremiah,44,14,"so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return save such as shall escape.' "
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives offered unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: "
Jeremiah,44,16,"'As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of HaShem, we will not hearken unto thee. "
Jeremiah,44,17,"But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to offer unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. "
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. "
Jeremiah,44,19,"And is it we that offer to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink-offerings unto her? did we make her cakes in her image, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?' "
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying: "
Jeremiah,44,21,"'The offering that ye offered in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not HaShem remember them, and came it not into His mind? "
Jeremiah,44,22,"So that HaShem could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. "
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because ye have offered, and because ye have sinned against HaShem, and have not hearkened to the voice of HaShem, nor walked in His law, nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.' "
Jeremiah,44,24,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women: 'Hear the word of HaShem, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: "
Jeremiah,44,25,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, saying: Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying: We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her; ye shall surely establish your vows, and surely perform your vows. "
Jeremiah,44,26,"Therefore hear ye the word of HaShem, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, saith HaShem, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying: As the L-rd GOD liveth. "
Jeremiah,44,27,"Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. "
Jeremiah,44,28,"And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine, or theirs. "
Jeremiah,44,29,"And this shall be the sign unto you, saith HaShem, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that My words shall surely stand against you for evil; "
Jeremiah,44,30,"thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.' "
Jeremiah,45,1,"The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: "
Jeremiah,45,2,"'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch: Thou didst say: "
Jeremiah,45,3,"Woe is me now! for HaShem hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest. "
Jeremiah,45,4,"Thus shalt thou say unto him: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land. "
Jeremiah,45,5,"And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith HaShem; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.' "
Jeremiah,46,1,The word of HaShem which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. 
Jeremiah,46,2,"Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah. "
Jeremiah,46,3,"Make ready buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. "
Jeremiah,46,4,"Harness the horses, and mount, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail. "
Jeremiah,46,5,"Wherefore do I see them dismayed and turned backward? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and they are fled apace, and look not back; terror is on every side, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,46,6,"The swift cannot flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen. "
Jeremiah,46,7,"Who is this like the Nile that riseth up, like the rivers whose waters toss themselves? "
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt is like the Nile that riseth up, and like the rivers whose waters toss themselves; and he saith: 'I will rise up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.' "
Jeremiah,46,9,"Prance, ye horses, and rush madly, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield, and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow. "
Jeremiah,46,10,"For the L-rd GOD of hosts shall have on that day a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Him of His adversaries; and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall be made drunk with their blood; for the L-rd GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. "
Jeremiah,46,11,"Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no cure for thee. "
Jeremiah,46,12,"The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry; for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together. "
Jeremiah,46,13,"The word that HaShem spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. "
Jeremiah,46,14,"Declare ye in Egypt, and announce in Migdol, and announce in Noph and in Tahpanhes; say ye: 'Stand forth, and prepare thee, for the sword hath devoured round about thee.' "
Jeremiah,46,15,"Why is thy strong one overthrown? He stood not, because HaShem did thrust him down. "
Jeremiah,46,16,"He made many to stumble; yea, they fell one upon another, and said: 'Arise, and let us return to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.' "
Jeremiah,46,17,They cried there: 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by.' 
Jeremiah,46,18,"As I live, saith the King, whose name is HaShem of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. "
Jeremiah,46,19,"O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity; for Noph shall become a desolation, and shall be laid waste, without inhabitant. "
Jeremiah,46,20,"Egypt is a very fair heifer; but the gadfly out of the north is come, it is come. "
Jeremiah,46,21,"Also her mercenaries in the midst of her are like calves of the stall, for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand; for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation. "
Jeremiah,46,22,"The sound thereof shall go like the serpent's; for they march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. "
Jeremiah,46,23,"They cut down her forest, saith HaShem, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable. "
Jeremiah,46,24,The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she is delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 
Jeremiah,46,25,"HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him; "
Jeremiah,46,26,"and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,46,27,"But fear not thou, O Jacob My servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel; for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. "
Jeremiah,46,28,"Fear not thou, O Jacob My servant, saith HaShem, for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; and I will correct thee in measure, but will not utterly destroy thee. "
Jeremiah,47,1,"The word of HaShem that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. "
Jeremiah,47,2,"Thus saith HaShem: behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and they shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and them that dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail. "
Jeremiah,47,3,"At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands; "
Jeremiah,47,4,"Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth; for HaShem will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor. "
Jeremiah,47,5,"Baldness is come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley; how long wilt thou cut thyself? "
Jeremiah,47,6,"O thou sword of HaShem, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. "
Jeremiah,47,7,"How canst thou be quiet? for HaShem hath given it a charge; against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore, there hath He appointed it. "
Jeremiah,48,1,"Of Moab. Thus saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and dismayed. "
Jeremiah,48,2,"The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: 'Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation.' Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee. "
Jeremiah,48,3,"Hark! a cry from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction! "
Jeremiah,48,4,Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

Jeremiah,51,47,"Therefore behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon, and her whole land shall be ashamed; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. "
Jeremiah,51,48,"Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,51,49,"As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land. "
Jeremiah,51,50,"Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember HaShem from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. "
Jeremiah,51,51,"'We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach, confusion hath covered our faces; for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of HaShem'S house.' "
Jeremiah,51,52,"Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that I will do judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan. "
Jeremiah,51,53,"Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from Me shall spoilers come unto her, saith HaShem. "
Jeremiah,51,54,"Hark! a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! "
Jeremiah,51,55,"For HaShem spoileth Babylon, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters, the noise of their voice is uttered; "
Jeremiah,51,56,"For the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are shattered; for HaShem is a G-d of recompenses, He will surely requite. "
Jeremiah,51,57,"And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is HaShem of hosts. "
Jeremiah,51,58,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labour for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary. "
Jeremiah,51,59,"The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was quartermaster. "
Jeremiah,51,60,"And Jeremiah wrote in one book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. "
Jeremiah,51,61,"And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: 'When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words, "
Jeremiah,51,62,"and say: O HaShem, Thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. "
Jeremiah,51,63,"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates; "
Jeremiah,51,64,"and thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary.' Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.  "
Jeremiah,52,1,Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
Jeremiah,52,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. "
Jeremiah,52,3,"For through the anger of HaShem did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. "
Jeremiah,52,4,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. "
Jeremiah,52,5,So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
Jeremiah,52,6,"In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. "
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden--now the Chaldeans were against the city round about--and they went by the way of the Arabah. "
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. "
Jeremiah,52,9,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him. "
Jeremiah,52,10,And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
Jeremiah,52,11,"And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. "
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem; "
Jeremiah,52,13,"and he burned the house of HaShem, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great man's house, burned he with fire. "
Jeremiah,52,14,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. "
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. "
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. 
Jeremiah,52,17,"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of HaShem, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of HaShem, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. "
Jeremiah,52,18,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. "
Jeremiah,52,19,"And the cups, and the fire-pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the pans, and the bowls--that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver--the captain of the guard took away. "
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of HaShem--the brass of all these vessels was without weight. "
Jeremiah,52,21,"And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers; it was hollow. "
Jeremiah,52,22,"And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass; and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates. "
Jeremiah,52,23,And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the outside; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about. 
Jeremiah,52,24,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door; "
Jeremiah,52,25,"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. "
Jeremiah,52,26,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. "
Jeremiah,52,27,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. "
Jeremiah,52,28,This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty; 
Jeremiah,52,29,"in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, from Jerusalem, eight hundred thirty and two persons; "
Jeremiah,52,30,in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. 
Jeremiah,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison. "
Jeremiah,52,32,"And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon. "
Jeremiah,52,33,"And he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life. "
Jeremiah,52,34,"And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.  "
Ezekiel,1,1,"NOW IT came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of G-d. "
Ezekiel,1,2,"In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, "
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of HaShem came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of HaShem was there upon him. "
Ezekiel,1,4,"And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so that a brightness was round about it; and out of the midst thereof as the colour of electrum, out of the midst of the fire. "
Ezekiel,1,5,And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. 
Ezekiel,1,6,"And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings. "
Ezekiel,1,7,And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. 
Ezekiel,1,8,"And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and as for the faces and wings of them four, "
Ezekiel,1,9,their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. "
Ezekiel,1,11,"Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. "
Ezekiel,1,12,"And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went. "
Ezekiel,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning like the appearance of torches; it flashed up and down among the living creatures; and there was brightness to the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning. "
Ezekiel,1,14,And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel at the bottom hard by the living creatures, at the four faces thereof. "
Ezekiel,1,16,The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they went, they went toward their four sides; they turned not when they went. "
Ezekiel,1,18,"As for their rings, they were high and they were dreadful; and they four had their rings full of eyes round about. "
Ezekiel,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went hard by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the bottom, the wheels were lifted up. "
Ezekiel,1,20,"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, as the spirit was to go thither, so they went; and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. "
Ezekiel,1,21,"When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. "
Ezekiel,1,22,"And over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible ice, stretched forth over their heads above. "
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the firmament were their wings conformable the one to the other; this one of them had two which covered, and that one of them had two which covered, their bodies. "
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host; when they stood, they let down their wings. "
Ezekiel,1,25,"For, when there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads, as they stood, they let down their wings. "
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. "
Ezekiel,1,27,"And I saw as the colour of electrum, as the appearance of fire round about enclosing it, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. "
Ezekiel,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of HaShem. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke. "
Ezekiel,2,1,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.' "
Ezekiel,2,2,"And spirit entered into me when He spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard Him that spoke unto me. "
Ezekiel,2,3,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, even unto this very day; "
Ezekiel,2,4,"and the children are brazen-faced and stiff-hearted, I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear--for they are a rebellious house--yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. "
Ezekiel,2,6,"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though defiers and despisers be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. "
Ezekiel,2,7,"And thou shalt speak My words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious. "
Ezekiel,2,8,"And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee: be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house; open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.' "
Ezekiel,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; "
Ezekiel,2,10,"and He spread it before me, and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and moaning, and woe. "
Ezekiel,3,1,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.' "
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that roll. "
Ezekiel,3,3,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee.' Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. "
Ezekiel,3,4,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My words unto them. "
Ezekiel,3,5,"For thou art not sent to a people of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, but to the house of Israel; "
Ezekiel,3,6,"not to many peoples of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. "
Ezekiel,3,7,But the house of Israel will not consent to hearken unto thee; for they consent not to hearken unto Me; for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart. 
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. "
Ezekiel,3,9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.' "
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover He said unto me: 'Son of man, all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears. "
Ezekiel,3,11,"And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.' "
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then a spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing: 'Blessed be the glory of HaShem from His place'; "
Ezekiel,3,13,"also the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. "
Ezekiel,3,14,"So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of HaShem was strong upon me. "
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I remained there appalled among them seven days. "
Ezekiel,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,3,17,"'Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; and when thou shalt hear a word at My mouth, thou shalt give them warning from Me. "
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. "
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. "
Ezekiel,3,20,"Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand. "
Ezekiel,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.' "
Ezekiel,3,22,"And the hand of HaShem came there upon me; and He said unto me: 'Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there speak with thee.' "
Ezekiel,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, behold, the glory of HaShem stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. "
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and He spoke with me, and said unto me: 'Go, shut thyself within thy house. "
Ezekiel,3,25,"But thou, son of man, behold, bands shall be put upon thee, and thou shalt be bound with them, and thou shalt not go out among them; "
Ezekiel,3,26,"and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. "
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD; he that heareth, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house. "
Ezekiel,4,1,"Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and trace upon it a city, even Jerusalem; "
Ezekiel,4,2,"and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and set battering rams against it round about. "
Ezekiel,4,3,"And take thou unto thee an iron griddle, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,4,4,"Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. "
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,4,6,"And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee. "
Ezekiel,4,7,"And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it. "
Ezekiel,4,8,"And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege. "
Ezekiel,4,9,"Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof. "
Ezekiel,4,10,"And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it. "
Ezekiel,4,11,"Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink. "
Ezekiel,4,12,"And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.' "
Ezekiel,4,13,"And HaShem said: 'Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.' "
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then said I: 'Ah L-rd GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abhorred flesh into my mouth.' "
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then He said unto me: 'See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.' "
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover He said unto me: 'Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and in appalment; "
Ezekiel,4,17,"that they may want bread and water, and be appalled one with another, and pine away in their iniquity. "
Ezekiel,5,1,"And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword, as a barber's razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard; then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. "
Ezekiel,5,2,"A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite it with the sword round about her; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. "
Ezekiel,5,3,"Thou shalt also take thereof a few by number, and bind them in thy skirts. "
Ezekiel,5,4,"And of them again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,5,5,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: This is Jerusalem! I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her. "
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she hath rebelled against Mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected Mine ordinances, and as for My statutes, they have not walked in them. "
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because ye have outdone the nations that are round about you, in that ye have not walked in My statutes, neither have kept Mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you; "
Ezekiel,5,8,"therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. "
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. "
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds. "
Ezekiel,5,11,"Wherefore, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, surely, because thou hast defiled My sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall Mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity. "
Ezekiel,5,12,"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them. "
Ezekiel,5,13,"Thus shall Mine anger spend itself, and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased; and they shall know that I HaShem have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them. "
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover I will make thee an amazement and a reproach, among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. "
Ezekiel,5,15,"So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury, and in furious rebukes; I HaShem have spoken it; "
Ezekiel,5,16,"when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread; "
Ezekiel,5,17,"and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I HaShem have spoken it.' "
Ezekiel,6,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,6,2,"'Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, "
Ezekiel,6,3,"and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the L-rd GOD: Thus saith the L-rd GOD concerning the mountains and concerning the hills, concerning the ravines and concerning the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. "
Ezekiel,6,4,"And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. "
Ezekiel,6,5,And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be blotted out. "
Ezekiel,6,7,"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,6,8,"Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. "
Ezekiel,6,9,"And they that escape of you shall remember Me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, how that I have been anguished with their straying heart, which hath departed from Me, and with their eyes, which are gone astray after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. "
Ezekiel,6,10,And they shall know that I am HaShem; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them. 
Ezekiel,6,11,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say: Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. "
Ezekiel,6,12,He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine; thus will I spend My fury upon them. 
Ezekiel,6,13,"And ye shall know that I am HaShem, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every leafy tree, and under every thick terebinth, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. "
Ezekiel,6,14,"And I will stretch out My hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness of Diblah, throughout all their habitations; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,7,2,"'And thou, son of man, thus saith the L-rd GOD concerning the land of Israel: An end! the end is come upon the four corners of the land. "
Ezekiel,7,3,"Now is the end upon thee, and I will send Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. "
Ezekiel,7,4,"And Mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,7,5,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: An evil, a singular evil, behold, it cometh. "
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh. "
Ezekiel,7,7,"The turn is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day of tumult is near, and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains. "
Ezekiel,7,8,"Now will I shortly pour out My fury upon thee, and spend Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. "
Ezekiel,7,9,"And Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I HaShem do smite. "
Ezekiel,7,10,"Behold the day; behold, it cometh; the turn is come forth; the rod hath blossomed, arrogancy hath budded. "
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nought cometh from them, nor from their tumult, nor from their turmoil, neither is there eminency among them. "
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time is come, the day draweth near; let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. "
Ezekiel,7,13,"For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive; for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any stand possessed of the iniquity of his life. "
Ezekiel,7,14,"They have blown the horn, and have made all ready, but none goeth to the battle; for My wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. "
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within; he that is in the field shall die with the sword, and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. "
Ezekiel,7,16,"But they that shall at all escape of them, shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity. "
Ezekiel,7,17,"All hands shall be slack, and all knees shall drip with water. "
Ezekiel,7,18,"They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. "
Ezekiel,7,19,"They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of HaShem; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity. "
Ezekiel,7,20,"And as for the beauty of their ornament, which was set for a pride, they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things thereof; therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing. "
Ezekiel,7,21,"And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it. "
Ezekiel,7,22,"I will also turn My face from them, and they shall profane My secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it. "
Ezekiel,7,23,"Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. "
Ezekiel,7,24,"Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses; I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned. "
Ezekiel,7,25,"Horror cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. "
Ezekiel,7,26,"Calamity shall come upon calamity, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and instruction shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. "
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with appalment, and the hands of the people of the land shall be enfeebled; I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the L-rd GOD fell there upon me. "
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of electrum. "
Ezekiel,8,3,"And the form of a hand was put forth, and I was taken by a lock of my head; and a spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of G-d to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. "
Ezekiel,8,4,"And, behold, the glory of the G-d of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. "
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then said He unto me: 'Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north.' So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. "
Ezekiel,8,6,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet greater abominations.' "
Ezekiel,8,7,"And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. "
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then said He unto me: 'Son of man, dig now in the wall'; and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. "
Ezekiel,8,9,"And He said unto me: 'Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.' "
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and behold every detestable form of creeping things and beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. "
Ezekiel,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. "
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then said He unto me: 'Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say: HaShem seeth us not, HaShem hath forsaken the land.' "
Ezekiel,8,13,He said also unto me: 'Thou shalt again see yet greater abominations which they do.' 
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then He brought me to the door of the gate of HaShem'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz. "
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then said He unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.' "
Ezekiel,8,16,"And He brought me into the inner court of HaShem'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of HaShem, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of HaShem, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. "
Ezekiel,8,17,"Then He said unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here in that they fill the land with violence, and provoke Me still more, and, lo, they put the branch to their nose? "
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in fury; Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in Mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.' "
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then he called in mine ears with a loud voice, saying: 'Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.' "
Ezekiel,9,2,"And, behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn on his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar. "
Ezekiel,9,3,"And the glory of the G-d of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and He called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn on his side. "
Ezekiel,9,4,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.' "
Ezekiel,9,5,"And to the others He said in my hearing: 'Go ye through the city after him, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; "
Ezekiel,9,6,"slay utterly the old man, the young man and the maiden, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.' Then they began at the elders that were before the house. "
Ezekiel,9,7,"And He said unto them: 'Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain; go ye forth.' And they went forth, and smote in the city. "
Ezekiel,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said: 'Ah L-rd GOD! wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem?' "
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then said He unto me: 'The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting of judgment; for they say: HaShem hath forsaken the land, and HaShem seeth not. "
Ezekiel,9,10,"And as for Me also, Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.' "
Ezekiel,9,11,"And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn on his side, reported, saying: 'I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me.' "
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked, and, behold, upon the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim, there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. "
Ezekiel,10,2,"And He spoke unto the man clothed in linen, and said: 'Go in between the wheelwork, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and dash them against the city.' And he went in in my sight. "
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. "
Ezekiel,10,4,"And the glory of HaShem mounted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of HaShem'S glory. "
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of G-d Almighty when He speaketh. "
Ezekiel,10,6,"And it came to pass, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying: 'Take fire from between the wheelwork, from between the cherubim', that he went in, and stood beside a wheel. "
Ezekiel,10,7,"And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. "
Ezekiel,10,8,And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings. 
Ezekiel,10,9,"And I looked, and behold four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. "
Ezekiel,10,10,"And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel. "
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went, they went toward their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. "
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had. "
Ezekiel,10,13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing The wheelwork. "
Ezekiel,10,14,"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. "
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubim mounted up--this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. 
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. "
Ezekiel,10,17,"When they stood, these stood, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. "
Ezekiel,10,18,"And the glory of HaShem went forth from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. "
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of HaShem'S house; and the glory of the G-d of Israel was over them above. "
Ezekiel,10,20,This is the living creature that I saw under the G-d of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
Ezekiel,10,21,"Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. "
Ezekiel,10,22,"And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward. "
Ezekiel,11,1,"Then a spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of HaShem'S house, which looketh eastward; and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. "
Ezekiel,11,2,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city; "
Ezekiel,11,3,"that say: The time is not near to build houses! this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh. "
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.' "
Ezekiel,11,5,"And the spirit of HaShem fell upon me, and He said unto me: 'Speak: Thus saith HaShem: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. "
Ezekiel,11,6,"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. "
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. "
Ezekiel,11,8,"Ye have feared the sword; and the sword will I bring upon you, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. "
Ezekiel,11,10,Ye shall fall by the sword: I will judge you upon the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. 
Ezekiel,11,11,"Though this city shall not be your caldron, ye shall be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you upon the border of Israel; "
Ezekiel,11,12,"and ye shall know that I am HaShem; for ye have not walked in My statutes, neither have ye executed Mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.' "
Ezekiel,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said: 'Ah L-rd GOD! wilt Thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?' "
Ezekiel,11,14,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,11,15,"'Son of man, as for thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, concerning whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get you far from HaShem! unto us is this land given for a possession; "
Ezekiel,11,16,"therefore say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Although I have removed them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet have I been to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they are come; "
Ezekiel,11,17,"therefore say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will even gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. "
Ezekiel,11,18,"And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. "
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; "
Ezekiel,11,20,"that they may walk in My statutes, and keep Mine ordinances, and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their G-d. "
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the G-d of Israel was over them above. "
Ezekiel,11,23,"And the glory of HaShem went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. "
Ezekiel,11,24,"And a spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the spirit of G-d into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from Me. "
Ezekiel,11,25,Then I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that HaShem had shown me. 
Ezekiel,12,1,"The word of HaShem also came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,12,2,"'Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house. "
Ezekiel,12,3,"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for exile, and remove as though for exile by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight; it may be they will perceive, for they are a rebellious house. "
Ezekiel,12,4,"And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for exile; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile. "
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. "
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the darkness; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground; for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.' "
Ezekiel,12,7,"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for exile, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I carried out in the darkness, and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight. "
Ezekiel,12,8,"And in the morning came the word of HaShem unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,12,9,"'Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee: What doest thou? "
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say thou unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Concerning the prince, even this burden, in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are, "
Ezekiel,12,11,"say: I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them--they shall go into exile, into captivity. "
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder, and go forth in the darkness; they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby; he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes. "
Ezekiel,12,13,"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there. "
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I will disperse toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them. "
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they shall know that I am HaShem, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries. "
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreover the word of HaShem came to me, saying: "
Ezekiel,12,18,"'Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with anxiety; "
Ezekiel,12,19,"and say unto the people of the land: Thus saith the L-rd GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel. They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with appalment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. "
Ezekiel,12,20,"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,12,21,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,12,22,"'Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying: The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? "
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell them therefore: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them: The days are at hand, and the word of every vision. "
Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any vain vision nor smooth divination within the house of Israel. 
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I am HaShem; I will speak, what word soever it be that I shall speak, and it shall be performed; it shall be no more delayed; for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,12,26,"Again the word of HaShem came to me, saying: "
Ezekiel,12,27,"'Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say: The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off. "
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: There shall none of My words be delayed any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,13,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,13,2,"'Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart: Hear ye the word of HaShem: "
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Woe unto the vile prophets, that follow their own spirit, and things which they have not seen! "
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in ruins. "
Ezekiel,13,5,"Ye have not gone up into the breaches, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of HaShem. "
Ezekiel,13,6,"They have seen vanity and lying divination, that say: HaShem saith; and HaShem hath not sent them, yet they hope that the word would be confirmed! "
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say: HaShem saith; albeit I have not spoken? "
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,13,9,"And My hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies; they shall not be in the council of My people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,13,10,"Because, even because they have led My people astray, saying: Peace, and there is no peace; and when it buildeth up a slight wall, behold, they daub it with whited plaster; "
Ezekiel,13,11,"say unto them that daub it with whited plaster, that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall break forth, "
Ezekiel,13,12,"and, lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you: Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? "
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will even cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in Mine anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it. "
Ezekiel,13,14,"So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with whited plaster, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus will I spend My fury upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with whited plaster; and I will say unto you: The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; "
Ezekiel,13,16,"to wit, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,13,17,"And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, "
Ezekiel,13,18,"and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Woe to the women that sew cushions upon all elbows, and make pads for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of My people, and save souls alive for yourselves? "
Ezekiel,13,19,"And ye have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for crumbs of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to My people that hearken unto lies. "
Ezekiel,13,20,"Wherefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against your cushions, wherewith ye hunt the souls as birds, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt as birds. "
Ezekiel,13,21,"Your pads also will I tear, and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because with lies ye have cowed the heart of the righteous, when I have not grieved him; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, that he be saved alive; "
Ezekiel,13,23,"therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine divinations; and I will deliver My people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,14,1,"Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. "
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,14,3,"'Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their mind, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face; should I be inquired of at all by them? "
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his mind, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet--I HaShem will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; "
Ezekiel,14,5,"that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all turned away from Me through their idols. "
Ezekiel,14,6,"Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. "
Ezekiel,14,7,"For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from Me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, that he inquire for him of Me--I HaShem will answer him by Myself, "
Ezekiel,14,8,"and I will set My face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,14,9,"And when the prophet is enticed and speaketh a word, I HaShem have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel. "
Ezekiel,14,10,And they shall bear their iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that inquireth; 
Ezekiel,14,11,"that the house of Israel may go no more astray from Me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be My people, and I may be their G-d, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,14,12,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,14,13,"'Son of man, when a land sinneth against Me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out My hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast; "
Ezekiel,14,14,"though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,14,15,"If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they bereave it, and it be desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts; "
Ezekiel,14,16,"though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate. "
Ezekiel,14,17,"Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say: Let the sword go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and beast; "
Ezekiel,14,18,"though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves. "
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out My fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast; "
Ezekiel,14,20,"though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. "
Ezekiel,14,21,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: How much more when I send My four sore judgments against Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast. "
Ezekiel,14,22,"And, behold, though there be left a remnant therein that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters; behold, when they come forth unto you, and ye see their way and their doings, then ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it; "
Ezekiel,14,23,"and they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings, and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,15,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,15,2,"'Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine branch which grew up among the trees of the forest? "
Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
Ezekiel,15,4,"Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is singed; is it profitable for any work? "
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work; how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is singed, shall it yet be meet for any work? "
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so do I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I will set My face against them; out of the fire are they come forth, and the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am HaShem, when I set My face against them. "
Ezekiel,15,8,"And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,16,1,"Again the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,16,2,"'Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, "
Ezekiel,16,3,"and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD unto Jerusalem: Thine origin and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite. "
Ezekiel,16,4,"And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water for cleansing; thou was not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. "
Ezekiel,16,5,"No eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field in the loathsomeness of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. "
Ezekiel,16,6,"And when I passed by thee, and saw thee wallowing in thy blood, I said unto thee: In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee: In thy blood, live; "
Ezekiel,16,7,"I cause thee to increase, even as the growth of the field. And thou didst increase and grow up, and thou camest to excellent beauty: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare. "
Ezekiel,16,8,"Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and, behold, thy time was the time of love, I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the L-rd GOD, and thou becamest Mine. "
Ezekiel,16,9,"Then washed I thee with water; yea, I cleansed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. "
Ezekiel,16,10,"I clothed thee also with richly woven work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I wound fine linen about thy head, and covered thee with silk. "
Ezekiel,16,11,"I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. "
Ezekiel,16,12,"And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head. "
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and richly woven work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou didst wax exceeding beautiful, and thou wast meet for royal estate. "
Ezekiel,16,14,"And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through My splendour which I had put upon thee, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,16,15,"But thou didst trust in thy beauty and play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy harlotries on every one that passed by; his it was. "
Ezekiel,16,16,"And thou didst take of thy garments, and didst make for thee high places decked with divers colours, and didst play the harlot upon them; the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so. "
Ezekiel,16,17,"Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them; "
Ezekiel,16,18,"and thou didst take thy richly woven garments and cover them, and didst set Mine oil and Mine incense before them. "
Ezekiel,16,19,"My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour, and thus it was; saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,16,20,"Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy harlotries a small matter, "
Ezekiel,16,21,"that thou hast slain My children, and delivered them up, in setting them apart unto them? "
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all thine abominations and thy harlotries thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast wallowing in thy blood. "
Ezekiel,16,23,"And it came to pass after all thy wickedness--woe, woe unto thee! saith the L-rd GOD-- "
Ezekiel,16,24,"that thou hast built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street. "
Ezekiel,16,25,"Thou hast built thy lofty place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy harlotries. "
Ezekiel,16,26,"Thou hast also played the harlot with the Egyptians, thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke Me. "
Ezekiel,16,27,"Behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over thee, and have diminished thine allowance, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way. "
Ezekiel,16,28,"Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, without having enough; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied. "
Ezekiel,16,29,"Thou hast moreover multiplied thy harlotry with the land of traffic, even with Chaldea; and yet thou didst not have enough herewith. "
Ezekiel,16,30,"How weak is thy heart, saith the L-rd GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of a wanton harlot; "
Ezekiel,16,31,"in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot that enhanceth her hire. "
Ezekiel,16,32,"Thou wife that committest adultery, that takest strangers instead of thy husband-- "
Ezekiel,16,33,"to all harlots gifts are given; but thou hast given thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them to come unto thee from every side in thy harlotries. "
Ezekiel,16,34,"And the contrary is in thee from other women, in that thou didst solicit to harlotry, and wast not solicited; and in that thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, thus thou art contrary. "
Ezekiel,16,35,"Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of HaShem! "
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy harlotries with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them; "
Ezekiel,16,37,"therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, unto whom thou hast been pleasant, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee from every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. "
Ezekiel,16,38,"And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy. "
Ezekiel,16,39,"I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare. "
Ezekiel,16,40,"They shall also bring up an assembly against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. "
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more. "
Ezekiel,16,42,"So will I satisfy My fury upon thee, and My jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. "
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted Me in all these things; lo, therefore I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the L-rd GOD; or hast thou not committed this lewdness above all thine abominations? "
Ezekiel,16,44,"Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying: As the mother, so her daughter. "
Ezekiel,16,45,"Thou art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. "
Ezekiel,16,46,"And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. "
Ezekiel,16,47,"Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but in a very little while thou didst deal more corruptly than they in all thy ways. "
Ezekiel,16,48,"As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. "
Ezekiel,16,49,"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. "
Ezekiel,16,50,"And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. "
Ezekiel,16,51,"Neither hath Samaria committed even half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done. "
Ezekiel,16,52,"Thou also, bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou; yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. "
Ezekiel,16,53,"And I will turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them; "
Ezekiel,16,54,"that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. "
Ezekiel,16,55,"And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. "
Ezekiel,16,56,For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride; 
Ezekiel,16,57,"before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the taunt of the daughters of Aram, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that have thee in disdain round about. "
Ezekiel,16,58,"Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith HaShem. "
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. "
Ezekiel,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. "
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not because of thy covenant. "
Ezekiel,16,62,"And I will establish My covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am HaShem; "
Ezekiel,16,63,"that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame; when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,17,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,17,2,"'Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel, "
Ezekiel,17,3,"and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar; "
Ezekiel,17,4,"He cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants. "
Ezekiel,17,5,"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters, he set it as a slip. "
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose tendrils might turn toward him, and the roots thereof be under him; so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. "
Ezekiel,17,7,"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it. "
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a stately vine. "
Ezekiel,17,9,"Say thou: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither, yea, wither in all its sprouting leaves? neither shall great power or much people be at hand when it is plucked up by the roots thereof. "
Ezekiel,17,10,"Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? In the beds where it grew it shall wither.' "
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,17,12,"'Say now to the rebellious house: Know ye not what these things mean? tell them: Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon; "
Ezekiel,17,13,"and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him, and brought him under an oath, and the mighty of the land he took away; "
Ezekiel,17,14,"that his might be a lowly kingdom, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. "
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape? "
Ezekiel,17,16,"As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. "
Ezekiel,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company succour him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many souls; "
Ezekiel,17,18,"seeing he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape. "
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: As I live, surely Mine oath that he hath despised, and My covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head. "
Ezekiel,17,20,"And I will spread My net upon him, and he shall be taken in My snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his treachery that he hath committed against Me. "
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all his mighty men in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind; and ye shall know that I HaShem have spoken it. "
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Moreover I will take, even I, of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent; "
Ezekiel,17,23,"in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a stately cedar; and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing, in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. "
Ezekiel,17,24,"And all the trees of the field shall know that I HaShem have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I HaShem have spoken and have done it.' "
Ezekiel,18,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,18,2,"'What mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? "
Ezekiel,18,3,"As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. "
Ezekiel,18,4,"Behold, all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die. "
Ezekiel,18,5,"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, "
Ezekiel,18,6,"and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity; "
Ezekiel,18,7,"and hath not wronged any, but hath restored his pledge for a debt, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; "
Ezekiel,18,8,"he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man, "
Ezekiel,18,9,"hath walked in My statutes, and hath kept Mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,18,10,"If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth to a brother any of these things, "
Ezekiel,18,11,"whereas he himself had not done any of these things, for he hath even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, "
Ezekiel,18,12,"hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, "
Ezekiel,18,13,"hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live--he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely be put to death, his blood shall be upon him. "
Ezekiel,18,14,"Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins, which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, "
Ezekiel,18,15,"that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, "
Ezekiel,18,16,"neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, "
Ezekiel,18,17,"that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed Mine ordinances, hath walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. "
Ezekiel,18,18,"As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, committed robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he dieth for his iniquity. "
Ezekiel,18,19,"Yet say ye: Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father with him? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all My statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. "
Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul that sinneth, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father with him, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son with him; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. "
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. "
Ezekiel,18,22,None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; for his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. 
Ezekiel,18,23,"Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the L-rd GOD; and not rather that he should return from his ways, and live? "
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered; for his trespass that he trespassed, and for his sin that he hath sinned, for them shall he die. "
Ezekiel,18,25,"Yet ye say: The way of the L-rd is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is it My way that is not equal? is it not your ways that are unequal? "
Ezekiel,18,26,"When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therefor; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. "
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. "
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. "
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet saith the house of Israel: The way of the L-rd is not equal. O house of Israel, is it My ways that are not equal? is it not your ways that are unequal? "
Ezekiel,18,30,"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the L-rd GOD. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so shall they not be a stumblingblock of iniquity unto you. "
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? "
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the L-rd GOD; wherefore turn yourselves, and live. "
Ezekiel,19,1,"Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, "
Ezekiel,19,2,"and say: How was thy mother a lioness; among lions she couched, in the midst of the young lions she reared her whelps! "
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought up one of her whelps, he became a young lion; and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men. "
Ezekiel,19,4,"Then the nations assembled against him, he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,19,5,"Now when she saw that she was disappointed, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion. "
Ezekiel,19,6,"And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion; and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men. "
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he knew their castles, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring. "
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations cried out against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him, he was taken in their pit. "
Ezekiel,19,9,"And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; that they might bring him into strongholds, so that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. "
Ezekiel,19,10,"Thy mother was like a vine, in thy likeness, planted by the waters; she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. "
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had strong rods to be sceptres for them that bore rule; and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she was seen in her height with the multitude of her tendrils. "
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit; her strong rods were broken off and withered, the fire consumed her. "
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground. "
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, it hath devoured her fruit, so that there is in her no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule.' This is a lamentation, and it was for a lamentation. "
Ezekiel,20,1,"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of HaShem, and sat before me. "
Ezekiel,20,2,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,20,3,"'Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Are ye come to inquire of Me? As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, I will not be inquired of by you. "
Ezekiel,20,4,"Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers; "
Ezekiel,20,5,"and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up My hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up My hand unto them, saying: I am HaShem your G-d; "
Ezekiel,20,6,"in that day I lifted up My hand unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had sought out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the beauty of all lands; "
Ezekiel,20,7,"and I said unto them: Cast ye away every man the detestable things of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am HaShem your G-d. "
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against Me, and would not hearken unto Me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt; then I said I would pour out My fury upon them, to spend My anger upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I wrought for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among whom they were, in whose sight I made Myself known unto them, so as to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,20,10,"So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. "
Ezekiel,20,11,"And I gave them My statutes, and taught them Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them. "
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am HaShem that sanctify them. "
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they walked not in My statutes, and they rejected Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them, and My sabbaths they greatly profaned; then I said I would pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. "
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I wrought for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. "
Ezekiel,20,15,"Yet also I lifted up My hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the beauty of all lands; "
Ezekiel,20,16,"because they rejected Mine ordinances, and walked not in My statutes, and profaned My sabbaths--for their heart went after their idols. "
Ezekiel,20,17,"Nevertheless Mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness. "
Ezekiel,20,18,"And I said unto their children in the wilderness: Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols; "
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am HaShem your G-d; walk in My statutes, and keep Mine ordinances, and do them; "
Ezekiel,20,20,"and hallow My sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am HaShem your G-d. "
Ezekiel,20,21,"But the children rebelled against Me; they walked not in My statutes, neither kept Mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live by them; they profaned My sabbaths; then I said I would pour out My fury upon them, to spend My anger upon them in the wilderness. "
Ezekiel,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew My hand, and wrought for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth. "
Ezekiel,20,23,"I lifted up My hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; "
Ezekiel,20,24,"because they had not executed Mine ordinances, but had rejected My statutes, and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. "
Ezekiel,20,25,"Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live; "
Ezekiel,20,26,"and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they set apart all that openeth the womb, that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,20,27,"Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed Me, in that they dealt treacherously with Me. "
Ezekiel,20,28,"For when I had brought them into the land, which I lifted up My hand to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering, there also they made their sweet savour, and there they poured out their drink-offerings. "
Ezekiel,20,29,Then I said unto them: What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 
Ezekiel,20,30,"Wherefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: When ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers, and go after their abominations, "
Ezekiel,20,31,"and when, in offering your gifts, in making your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, unto this day; shall I then be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, I will not be inquired of by you; "
Ezekiel,20,32,"and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say: We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. "
Ezekiel,20,33,"As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I be king over you; "
Ezekiel,20,34,"and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out; "
Ezekiel,20,35,"and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I plead with you face to face. "
Ezekiel,20,36,"Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,20,37,"And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; "
Ezekiel,20,38,"and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,20,39,"As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the L-rd GOD: Go ye, serve every one his idols, even because ye will not hearken unto Me; but My holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols. "
Ezekiel,20,40,"For in My holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the L-rd GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve Me in the land; there will I accept them, and there will I require your heave-offerings, and the first of your gifts, with all your holy things. "
Ezekiel,20,41,"With your sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. "
Ezekiel,20,42,"And ye shall know that I am HaShem, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I lifted up My hand to give unto your fathers. "
Ezekiel,20,43,"And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. "
Ezekiel,20,44,"And ye shall know that I am HaShem, when I have wrought with you for My name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,21,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,21,2,"'Son of man, set thy face toward the South, and preach toward the South, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South; "
Ezekiel,21,3,"and say to the forest of the South: Hear the word of HaShem: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree, it shall not be quenched, even a flaming flame; and all faces from the south to the north shall be seared thereby. "
Ezekiel,21,4,And all flesh shall see that I HaShem have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.' 
Ezekiel,21,5,Then said I: 'Ah L-rd GOD! they say of me: Is he not a maker of parables?' 
Ezekiel,21,6,"Then the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,21,7,"'Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel; "
Ezekiel,21,8,"and say to the land of Israel: Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth My sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. "
Ezekiel,21,9,"Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall My sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north; "
Ezekiel,21,10,and all flesh shall know that I HaShem have drawn forth My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more. 
Ezekiel,21,11,"Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes. "
Ezekiel,21,12,"And it shall be, when they say unto thee: Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say: Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be slack, and every spirit shall be faint, and all knees shall drip with water; behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,21,13,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,21,14,"'Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith HaShem: Say: A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished: "
Ezekiel,21,15,"It is sharpened that it may make a sore slaughter, it is furbished that it may glitter--or shall we make mirth? --against the rod of My son, contemning every tree. "
Ezekiel,21,16,"And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled; the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. "
Ezekiel,21,17,"Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon My people, it is upon all the princes of Israel; they are thrust down to the sword with My people; smite therefore upon thy thigh. "
Ezekiel,21,18,"For there is a trial; and what if it contemn even the rod? It shall be no more, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,21,19,"Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of those to be slain; it is the sword of the great one that is to be slain, which compasseth them about. "
Ezekiel,21,20,"I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied; ah! it is made glittering, it is sharpened for slaughter. "
Ezekiel,21,21,"Go thee one way to the right, or direct thyself to the left; whither is thy face set? "
Ezekiel,21,22,"I will also smite My hands together, and I will satisfy My fury; I HaShem have spoken it.' "
Ezekiel,21,23,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,21,24,"'Now, thou son of man, make thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land; and mark a signpost, mark it clear at the head of the way to the city. "
Ezekiel,21,25,"Thou shalt make a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified. "
Ezekiel,21,26,"For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shaketh the arrows to and fro, he inquireth of the teraphim, he looketh in the liver. "
Ezekiel,21,27,"In his right hand is the lot Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth for the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts. "
Ezekiel,21,28,"And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have weeks upon weeks! but it bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken. "
Ezekiel,21,29,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that your sins do appear in all your doings; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. "
Ezekiel,21,30,"And thou, O wicked one, that art to be slain, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end; "
Ezekiel,21,31,"thus saith the L-rd GOD: The mitre shall be removed, and the crown taken off; this shall be no more the same: that which is low shall be exalted, and that which is high abased. "
Ezekiel,21,32,"A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, will I make it; this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him. "
Ezekiel,21,33,"And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their taunt; and say thou: O sword, O sword keen-edged, furbished for the slaughter, to the uttermost, because of the glitterings; "
Ezekiel,21,34,"While they see falsehood unto thee, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are to be slain, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end! "
Ezekiel,21,35,"Cause it to return into its sheath! --In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thine origin, will I judge thee. "
Ezekiel,21,36,"And I will pour out My indignation upon thee, I will blow upon thee with the fire of My wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy. "
Ezekiel,21,37,"Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be no more remembered; for I HaShem have spoken it.' "
Ezekiel,22,1,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,22,2,"'Now, thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations. "
Ezekiel,22,3,"And thou shalt say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: O city that sheddest blood in the midst of thee, that thy time may come, and that makest idols unto thyself to defile thee; "
Ezekiel,22,4,"thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years; therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries! "
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou defiled of name and full of tumult. "
Ezekiel,22,6,"Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his might, have been in thee to shed blood. "
Ezekiel,22,7,In thee have they made light of father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow. 
Ezekiel,22,8,"Thou hast despised My holy things, and hast profaned My sabbaths. "
Ezekiel,22,9,In thee have been talebearers to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains; in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness. 
Ezekiel,22,10,In thee have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity. 
Ezekiel,22,11,"And each hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and each hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and each in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. "
Ezekiel,22,12,"In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by oppression, and hast forgotten Me, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,22,13,"Behold, therefore, I have smitten My hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. "
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I HaShem have spoken it, and will do it. "
Ezekiel,22,15,"And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee. "
Ezekiel,22,16,"And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,22,17,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,22,18,"'Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto Me; all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver. "
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. "
Ezekiel,22,20,"As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in Mine anger and in My fury, and I will cast you in, and melt you. "
Ezekiel,22,21,"Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of My wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. "
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I HaShem have poured out My fury upon you.' "
Ezekiel,22,23,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,22,24,"'Son of man, say unto her: Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. "
Ezekiel,22,25,"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls, they take treasure and precious things, they have made her widows many in the midst thereof. "
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests have done violence to My law, and have profaned My holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and the common, neither have they taught difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. "
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey: to shed blood, and to destroy souls, so as to get dishonest gain. "
Ezekiel,22,28,"And her prophets have daubed for them with whited plaster, seeing falsehood, and divining lies unto them, saying: Thus saith the L-rd GOD, when HaShem hath not spoken. "
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have wronged the poor and needy, and have oppressed the stranger unlawfully. "
Ezekiel,22,30,"And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the breach before Me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. "
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore have I poured out Mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,23,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,23,2,"'Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; "
Ezekiel,23,3,"and they committed harlotries in Egypt; they committed harlotries in their youth; there were their bosoms pressed, and there their virgin breasts were bruised. "
Ezekiel,23,4,"And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister; and they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. "
Ezekiel,23,5,"And Oholah played the harlot when she was Mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians, warriors, "
Ezekiel,23,6,"clothed with blue, governors and rulers, handsome young men all of them, horsemen riding upon horses. "
Ezekiel,23,7,"And she bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself. "
Ezekiel,23,8,"Neither hath she left her harlotries brought from Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised her virgin breasts; and they poured out their lust upon her. "
Ezekiel,23,9,"Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. "
Ezekiel,23,10,"These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and her they slew with the sword; and she became a byword among women, for judgments were executed upon her. "
Ezekiel,23,11,"And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her harlotries more than her sister in her harlotries. "
Ezekiel,23,12,"She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, warriors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them handsome young men. "
Ezekiel,23,13,And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way. 
Ezekiel,23,14,"And she increased her harlotries; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, "
Ezekiel,23,15,"girded with girdles upon their loins, with pendant turbans upon their heads, all of them captains to look upon, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, even of Chaldea, the land of their nativity. "
Ezekiel,23,16,"And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. "
Ezekiel,23,17,"And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust; and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. "
Ezekiel,23,18,"So she uncovered her harlotries, and uncovered her nakedness; then My soul was alienated from her, like as My soul was alienated from her sister. "
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her harlotries, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,23,20,"And she doted upon concubinage with them, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. "
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus thou didst call to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, when they from Egypt bruised thy breasts for the bosom of thy youth. "
Ezekiel,23,22,"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side: "
Ezekiel,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, governors and rulers all of them, captains and councillors, all of them riding upon horses. "
Ezekiel,23,24,"And they shall come against thee with hosts, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of peoples; they shall set themselves in array against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. "
Ezekiel,23,25,"And I will set My jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy residue shall fall by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. "
Ezekiel,23,26,"They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. "
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy harlotry brought from the land of Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. "
Ezekiel,23,28,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated; "
Ezekiel,23,29,"and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy harlotries shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy harlotries. "
Ezekiel,23,30,"These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast gone astray after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols. "
Ezekiel,23,31,In the way of thy sister hast thou walked; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand. 
Ezekiel,23,32,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be for a scorn and a derision; it is full to the uttermost. "
Ezekiel,23,33,"Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and appalment, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. "
Ezekiel,23,34,"Thou shalt even drink it and drain it, and thou shalt craunch the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because thou hast forgotten Me, and cast Me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy harlotries.' "
Ezekiel,23,36,"HaShem said moreover unto me: 'Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations. "
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery; and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also set apart unto them to be devoured. "
Ezekiel,23,38,"Moreover this they have done unto Me: they have defiled My sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned My sabbaths. "
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into My sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of My house. "
Ezekiel,23,40,"And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far; unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments; "
Ezekiel,23,41,"and sattest upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set Mine incense and Mine oil. "
Ezekiel,23,42,"And the voice of a multitude being at ease was therein; and for the sake of men, they were so many, brought drunken from the wilderness, they put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. "
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then said I of her that was worn out by adulteries: Still they commit harlotries with her, even her. "
Ezekiel,23,44,"For every one went in unto her, as men go in unto a harlot; so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women. "
Ezekiel,23,45,"But righteous men, they shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as women that shed blood are judged; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. "
Ezekiel,23,46,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: An assembly shall be brought up against them, and they shall be made a horror and a spoil. "
Ezekiel,23,47,"And the assembly shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. "
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. "
Ezekiel,23,49,"And your lewdness shall be recompensed upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the L-rd GOD.'  "
Ezekiel,24,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, saying: "
Ezekiel,24,2,"'Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day; this selfsame day the king of Babylon hath invested Jerusalem. "
Ezekiel,24,3,"And utter a parable concerning the rebellious house, and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Set on the pot, set it on, and also pour water into it; "
Ezekiel,24,4,"Gather into it the pieces belonging to it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. "
Ezekiel,24,5,"Take the choice of the flock, and pile also the bones under it; make it boil well, that the bones thereof may also be seethed in the midst of it. "
Ezekiel,24,6,"Wherefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose filth is therein, and whose filth is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; no lot is fallen upon it. "
Ezekiel,24,7,"For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; "
Ezekiel,24,8,"that it might cause fury to come up, that vengeance might be taken, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered. "
Ezekiel,24,9,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great, "
Ezekiel,24,10,"heaping on the wood, kindling the fire, that the flesh may be consumed; and preparing the mixture, that the bones also may be burned; "
Ezekiel,24,11,"then will I set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the bottom thereof may burn, and that the impurity of it may be molten in it, that the filth of it may be consumed "
Ezekiel,24,12,"It hath wearied itself with toil; yet its great filth goeth not forth out of it, yea, its noisome filth. "
Ezekiel,24,13,"Because of thy filthy lewdness, because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have satisfied My fury upon thee. "
Ezekiel,24,14,"I HaShem have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,24,15,"Also the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,24,16,"'Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet neither shalt thou make lamentation nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. "
Ezekiel,24,17,"Sigh in silence; make no mourning for the dead, bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thine upper lip, and eat not the bread of men.' "
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spoke unto the people in the morning, and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. "
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people said unto me: 'Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?' "
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I said unto them: 'The word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,24,21,"Speak unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword. "
Ezekiel,24,22,"And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your upper lips, nor eat the bread of men; "
Ezekiel,24,23,"and your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not make lamentation nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another. "
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do; when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,24,25,"And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the yearning of their soul, their sons and their daughters, "
Ezekiel,24,26,"that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? "
Ezekiel,24,27,"In that day shall thy mouth be opened together with him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb; so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,25,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,25,2,"'Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them; "
Ezekiel,25,3,"and say unto the children of Ammon: Hear the word of the L-rd GOD: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because thou saidst: Aha! against My sanctuary, when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; "
Ezekiel,25,4,"therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. "
Ezekiel,25,5,"And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,25,6,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the disdain of thy soul against the land of Israel; "
Ezekiel,25,7,"therefore, behold, I stretch out My hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries; I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,25,8,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because that Moab and Seir do say: Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations, "
Ezekiel,25,9,"therefore, behold, I will open the flank of Moab on the side of the cities, on the side of his cities which are on his frontiers, the beauteous country of Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, "
Ezekiel,25,10,"together with the children of Ammon, unto the children of the east, and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations; "
Ezekiel,25,11,and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am HaShem. 
Ezekiel,25,12,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; "
Ezekiel,25,13,"therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will stretch out My hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman, even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. "
Ezekiel,25,14,"And I will lay My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to Mine anger and according to My fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,25,15,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with disdain of soul to destroy, for the old hatred; "
Ezekiel,25,16,"therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will stretch out My hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea-coast. "
Ezekiel,25,17,"And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am HaShem, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.' "
Ezekiel,26,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,26,2,"'Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem: aha, she is broken that was the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be filled with her that is laid waste; "
Ezekiel,26,3,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up. "
Ezekiel,26,4,"And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. "
Ezekiel,26,5,"She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the L-rd GOD; and she shall become a spoil to the nations. "
Ezekiel,26,6,And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword; and they shall know that I am HaShem. 
Ezekiel,26,7,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people. "
Ezekiel,26,8,"He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and set up bucklers against thee. "
Ezekiel,26,9,"And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. "
Ezekiel,26,10,"By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, thy walls shall shake, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. "
Ezekiel,26,11,"With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground. "
Ezekiel,26,12,"And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy the houses of thy delight; and thy stones and thy timber and thy dust shall they lay in the midst of the waters. "
Ezekiel,26,13,"And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. "
Ezekiel,26,14,"And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets, thou shalt be built no more; for I HaShem have spoken, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,26,15,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD to Tyre: Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee? "
Ezekiel,26,16,"Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and strip off their richly woven garments; they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be appalled at thee. "
Ezekiel,26,17,"And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee: how art thou destroyed, that wast peopled from the seas, the renowned city, that wast strong in the sea, thou and thy inhabitants, that caused your terror to be on all that inhabit the earth! "
Ezekiel,26,18,"Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be affrighted at thy going out. "
Ezekiel,26,19,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee; "
Ezekiel,26,20,"then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, like the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living; "
Ezekiel,26,21,"I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,27,1,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,27,2,"'And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre, "
Ezekiel,27,3,"and say unto Tyre, that dwelleth at the entry of the sea, that is the merchant of the peoples unto many isles: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: thou, O Tyre, hast said: I am of perfect beauty. "
Ezekiel,27,4,"Thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. "
Ezekiel,27,5,Of cypress-trees from Senir have they fashioned all thy planks; they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 
Ezekiel,27,6,"Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; thy deck have they made of ivory inlaid in larch, from the isles of the Kittites. "
Ezekiel,27,7,"Of fine linen with richly woven work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning. "
Ezekiel,27,8,"The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots. "
Ezekiel,27,9,The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to exchange thy merchandise. 
Ezekiel,27,10,"Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war; they hanged the shield and helmet in thee, they set forth thy comeliness. "
Ezekiel,27,11,"The men of Arvad and Helech were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty. "
Ezekiel,27,12,"Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares. "
Ezekiel,27,13,"Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise. "
Ezekiel,27,14,They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and horsemen and mules. 
Ezekiel,27,15,The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand; they brought thee as tribute horns of ivory and ebony. 
Ezekiel,27,16,"Aram was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy wealth; they traded for thy wares with carbuncles, purple, and richly woven work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies. "
Ezekiel,27,17,"Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and oil, and balm. "
Ezekiel,27,18,"Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy wealth, by reason of the multitude of all riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool. "

Ezekiel,27,20,Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding. 
Ezekiel,27,21,"Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants. "
Ezekiel,27,22,"The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy wares with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. "
Ezekiel,27,23,"Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur was as thine apprentice in traffic. "
Ezekiel,27,24,"These were thy traffickers in gorgeous fabrics, in wrappings of blue and richly woven work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and cedar-lined, among thy merchandise. "
Ezekiel,27,25,"The ships of Tarshish brought thee tribute for thy merchandise; so wast thou replenished, and made very heavy in the heart of the seas. "
Ezekiel,27,26,Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. 
Ezekiel,27,27,"Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the exchangers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin. "
Ezekiel,27,28,At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the waves shall shake. 
Ezekiel,27,29,"And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land, "
Ezekiel,27,30,"And shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall roll themselves in the ashes; "
Ezekiel,27,31,"And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter lamentation. "
Ezekiel,27,32,"And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee: who was there like Tyre, fortified in the midst of the sea? "
Ezekiel,27,33,"When thy wares came forth out of the seas, thou didst fill many peoples; with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise didst thou enrich the kings of the earth. "
Ezekiel,27,34,"Now that thou art broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, and thy merchandise and all thy company are fallen in the midst of thee, "
Ezekiel,27,35,"All the inhabitants of the isles are appalled at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid, they are troubled in their countenance; "
Ezekiel,27,36,"The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and never shalt be any more.' "
Ezekiel,28,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,28,2,"'Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said: I am a god, I sit in the seat of G-d, in the heart of the seas; yet thou art man, and not G-d, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of G-d-- "
Ezekiel,28,3,"Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel! there is no secret that they can hide from thee! "
Ezekiel,28,4,"By thy wisdom and by thy discernment thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures; "
Ezekiel,28,5,"In thy great wisdom by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches-- "
Ezekiel,28,6,Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of G-d; 
Ezekiel,28,7,"Therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. "
Ezekiel,28,8,"They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas. "
Ezekiel,28,9,"Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee: I am G-d? But thou art man, and not G-d, in the hand of them that defile thee. "
Ezekiel,28,10,"Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,28,11,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,28,12,"'Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say unto him: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Thou seal most accurate, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, "
Ezekiel,28,13,"thou wast in Eden the garden of G-d; every precious stone was thy covering, the carnelian, the topaz, and the emerald, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle, and the smaragd, and gold; the workmanship of thy settings and of thy sockets was in thee, in the day that thou wast created they were prepared. "
Ezekiel,28,14,"Thou wast the far-covering cherub; and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of G-d; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire. "
Ezekiel,28,15,"Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee. "
Ezekiel,28,16,"By the multitude of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of G-d; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. "
Ezekiel,28,17,"Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; I have cast thee to the ground, I have laid thee before kings, that they may gaze upon thee. "
Ezekiel,28,18,"By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee, it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. "
Ezekiel,28,19,"All they that know thee among the peoples shall be appalled at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.' "
Ezekiel,28,20,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,28,21,"'Son of man, set thy face toward Zidon, and prophesy against it, "
Ezekiel,28,22,"and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am HaShem, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. "
Ezekiel,28,23,For I will send into her pestilence and blood in her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am HaShem. 
Ezekiel,28,24,"And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a piercing thorn of any that are round about them, that did have them in disdain; and they shall know that I am the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,28,25,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob. "
Ezekiel,28,26,"And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell safely; when I have executed judgments upon all those that have them in disdain round about them; and they shall know that I am HaShem their G-d.' "
Ezekiel,29,1,"In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,29,2,"'Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt; "
Ezekiel,29,3,"speak, and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh King of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said: My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. "
Ezekiel,29,4,"And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. "
Ezekiel,29,5,"And I will cast thee into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; to the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the heaven have I given thee for food. "
Ezekiel,29,6,"And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am HaShem, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,29,7,"When they take hold of thee with the hand, thou dost break, and rend all their shoulders; and when they lean upon thee, thou breakest, and makest all their loins to be at a stand. "
Ezekiel,29,8,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast. "
Ezekiel,29,9,"And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste, and they shall know that I am HaShem; because he hath said: The river is mine, and I have made it. "
Ezekiel,29,10,"Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. "
Ezekiel,29,11,"No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. "
Ezekiel,29,12,"And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. "
Ezekiel,29,13,For thus saith the L-rd GOD: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered; 
Ezekiel,29,14,"and I will turn the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their origin; and they shall be there a lowly kingdom. "
Ezekiel,29,15,"It shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms, neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations; and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. "
Ezekiel,29,16,"And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn after them; and they shall know that I am the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,29,17,"And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,29,18,"'Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it; "
Ezekiel,29,19,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her abundance, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. "
Ezekiel,29,20,"I have given him the land of Egypt as his hire for which he served, because they wrought for Me, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,29,21,"In that day will I cause a horn to shoot up unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,30,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,30,2,"'Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: wail ye: Woe worth the day! "
Ezekiel,30,3,"For the day is near, even the day of HaShem is near, a day of clouds, it shall be the time of the nations. "
Ezekiel,30,4,"And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and convulsion shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her abundance, and her foundation shall be broken down. "
Ezekiel,30,5,"Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. "
Ezekiel,30,6,"Thus saith HaShem: they also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol to Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,30,7,"And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. "
Ezekiel,30,8,"And they shall know that I am HaShem, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed. "
Ezekiel,30,9,"In that day shall messengers go forth from before Me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid; and there shall come convulsion upon them in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. "
Ezekiel,30,10,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. "
Ezekiel,30,11,"He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. "
Ezekiel,30,12,"And I will make the rivers dry, and will give the land over into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; I HaShem have spoken it. "
Ezekiel,30,13,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the things of nought to cease from Noph; and there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt; and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,30,14,"And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No. "
Ezekiel,30,15,"And I will pour My fury upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. "
Ezekiel,30,16,"And I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall be in great convulsion, and No shall be rent asunder; and in Noph shall come adversaries in the day-time. "
Ezekiel,30,17,The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity. 
Ezekiel,30,18,"At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. "
Ezekiel,30,19,Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' 
Ezekiel,30,20,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,30,21,"'Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up to be healed, to put a roller, that it be bound up and wax strong, that it hold the sword. "
Ezekiel,30,22,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. "
Ezekiel,30,23,"And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. "
Ezekiel,30,24,"And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put My sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. "
Ezekiel,30,25,"And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am HaShem, when I shall put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. "
Ezekiel,30,26,"And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,31,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,31,2,"'Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: whom art thou like in thy greatness? "
Ezekiel,31,3,"Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs. "
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow; her rivers ran round about her plantation, and she sent out her conduits unto all the trees of the field. "
Ezekiel,31,5,"Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long, because of the multitude of waters, when it shot them forth. "
Ezekiel,31,6,"All the fowls of heaven made their nests in its boughs, and all the beasts of the field did bring forth their young under its branches, and under its shadow dwelt all great nations. "
Ezekiel,31,7,"Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters. "
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of G-d could not hide it; the cypress-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of G-d like unto it in its beauty. "
Ezekiel,31,9,"I made it fair by the multitude of its branches; so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of G-d, envied it. "
Ezekiel,31,10,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; "
Ezekiel,31,11,I do even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I do drive him out according to his wickedness. 
Ezekiel,31,12,"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, do cut him off, and cast him down; upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs lie broken in all the channels of the land; and all the peoples of the earth do go down from his shadow, and do leave him. "
Ezekiel,31,13,"Upon his carcass all the fowls of the heaven do dwell, and upon his branches are all the beasts of the field; "
Ezekiel,31,14,"to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height, even all that drink water; for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. "
Ezekiel,31,15,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In the day when he went down to the nether-world I caused the deep to mourn and cover itself for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof, and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. "
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to the nether-world with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth. "
Ezekiel,31,17,"They also went down into the nether-world with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were in his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations. "
Ezekiel,31,18,"To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth; thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,32,2,"'Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him: thou didst liken thyself unto a young lion of the nations; whereas thou art as a dragon in the seas; and thou didst gush forth with thy rivers, and didst trouble the waters with thy feet, and foul their rivers. "
Ezekiel,32,3,Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will therefore spread out My net over thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in My net. 
Ezekiel,32,4,"And I will cast thee upon the land, I will hurl thee upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. "
Ezekiel,32,5,"And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy foulness. "
Ezekiel,32,6,"I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the channels shall be full of thee. "
Ezekiel,32,7,"And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. "
Ezekiel,32,8,"All the bright lights of heaven will I make black over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,32,9,"I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. "
Ezekiel,32,10,"Yea, I will make many peoples appalled at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. "
Ezekiel,32,11,For thus saith the L-rd GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. 
Ezekiel,32,12,"By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all; and they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. "
Ezekiel,32,13,"I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. "
Ezekiel,32,14,"Then will I make their waters to settle, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,32,15,"When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,32,16,"This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,32,17,"It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,32,18,"'Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. "
Ezekiel,32,19,"Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. "
Ezekiel,32,20,They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword; draw her down and all her multitudes. 
Ezekiel,32,21,"The strong among the mighty shall speak of him out of the midst of the nether-world with them that helped him; they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. "
Ezekiel,32,22,"Asshur is there and all her company; their graves are round about them; all of them slain, fallen by the sword; "
Ezekiel,32,23,"whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living. "
Ezekiel,32,24,"There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. "
Ezekiel,32,25,"They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit; they are put in the midst of them that are slain. "
Ezekiel,32,26,"There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because they caused their terror in the land of the living. "
Ezekiel,32,27,"And they that are inferior to the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty that are gone down to the nether-world with their weapons of war, whose swords are laid under their heads, and whose iniquities are upon their bones; because the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living. "
Ezekiel,32,28,"But thou, in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou be broken and lie, even with them that are slain by the sword. "
Ezekiel,32,29,"There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. "
Ezekiel,32,30,"There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain, ashamed for all the terror which they caused by their might, and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. "
Ezekiel,32,31,"These shall Pharaoh see, and shall be comforted over all his multitude; even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,32,32,"For I have put My terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,33,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,33,2,"'Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; "
Ezekiel,33,3,"if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the horn, and warn the people; "
Ezekiel,33,4,"then whosoever heareth the sound of the horn, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head; "
Ezekiel,33,5,"he heard the sound of the horn, and took not warning, his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul. "
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the horn, and the people be not warned, and the sword do come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. "
Ezekiel,33,7,"So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore, when thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, warn them from Me. "
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say unto the wicked: O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. "
Ezekiel,33,9,"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul. "
Ezekiel,33,10,"Therefore, O thou son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying: Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live? "
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say unto them: As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? "
Ezekiel,33,12,"And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people: The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. "
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, for it shall he die. "
Ezekiel,33,14,"Again, when I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; "
Ezekiel,33,15,"if the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. "
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. 
Ezekiel,33,17,"Yet the children of thy people say: The way of the L-rd is not equal; but as for them, their way is not equal. "
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. "
Ezekiel,33,19,"And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. "
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet ye say: The way of the L-rd is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.' "
Ezekiel,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying: 'The city is smitten.' "
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of HaShem had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and He had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. "
Ezekiel,33,23,"Then the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,33,24,"'Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. "
Ezekiel,33,25,"Wherefore say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD. Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood; and shall ye possess the land? "
Ezekiel,33,26,"Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife; and shall ye possess the land? "
Ezekiel,33,27,"Thus shalt thou say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. "
Ezekiel,33,28,"And I will make the land most desolate, and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through. "
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then shall they know that I am HaShem, when I have made the land most desolate, because of all their abominations which they have committed. "
Ezekiel,33,30,"And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people that talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying: Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from HaShem; "
Ezekiel,33,31,"and come unto thee as the people cometh, and sit before thee as My people, and hear thy words, but do them not--for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness; "
Ezekiel,33,32,"and, lo, thou art unto them as a love song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; so they hear thy words, but they do them not-- "
Ezekiel,33,33,"when this cometh to pass--behold, it cometh--then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.' "
Ezekiel,34,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,34,2,"'Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that have fed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep? "
Ezekiel,34,3,"Ye did eat the fat, and ye clothed you with the wool, ye killed the fatlings; but ye fed not the sheep. "
Ezekiel,34,4,"The weak have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force have ye ruled over them and with rigour. "
Ezekiel,34,5,"So were they scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered. "
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill, yea, upon all the face of the earth were My sheep scattered, and there was none that did search or seek. "
Ezekiel,34,7,"Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of HaShem: "
Ezekiel,34,8,"As I live, saith the L-rd GOD, surely forasmuch as My sheep became a prey, and My sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did My shepherds search for My sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not My sheep; "
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of HaShem: "
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require My sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver My sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them. "
Ezekiel,34,11,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, here am I, and I will search for My sheep, and seek them out. "
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are separated, so will I seek out My sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the day of clouds and thick darkness. "
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the habitable places of the country. "
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. "
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed My sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; and the fat and the strong I will destroy, I will feed them in justice. "
Ezekiel,34,17,"And as for you, O My flock, thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, even the rams and the he-goats. "
Ezekiel,34,18,"Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the settled waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? "
Ezekiel,34,19,"And as for My sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. "
Ezekiel,34,20,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and the lean cattle. "
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the weak with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; "
Ezekiel,34,22,"therefore will I save My flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. "
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even My servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. "
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I HaShem will be their G-d, and My servant David prince among them; I HaShem have spoken. "
Ezekiel,34,25,"And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. "
Ezekiel,34,26,And I will make them and the places round about My hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing. 
Ezekiel,34,27,"And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her produce, and they shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am HaShem, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them. "
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beast of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid. "
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more. "
Ezekiel,34,30,"And they shall know that I HaShem their G-d am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,34,31,"And ye My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are men, and I am your G-d, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,35,2,"'Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, "
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say unto it: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out My hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. "
Ezekiel,35,4,"I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because thou hast had a hatred of old, and hast hurled the children of Israel unto the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; "
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee; surely thou hast hated thine own blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee. "
Ezekiel,35,7,"Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth. "
Ezekiel,35,8,And I will fill his mountains with his slain; in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy streams shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 
Ezekiel,35,9,"I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,35,10,"Because thou hast said: These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas HaShem was there; "
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore, as I live, saith the L-rd GOD, I will do according to thine anger and according to thine envy, which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them, when I shall judge thee. "
Ezekiel,35,12,"And thou shalt know that I HaShem have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour. "
Ezekiel,35,13,"And ye have magnified yourselves against Me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard it. "
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. "
Ezekiel,35,15,"As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,36,1,"And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of HaShem. "
Ezekiel,36,2,Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because the enemy hath said against you: Aha! even the ancient high places are ours in possession; 
Ezekiel,36,3,"therefore prophesy, and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the rest of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people; "
Ezekiel,36,4,"therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the L-rd GOD: Thus saith the L-rd GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the streams and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about; "
Ezekiel,36,5,"therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Surely in the fire of My jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed My land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with disdain of soul, to cast it out for a prey; "
Ezekiel,36,6,"therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the streams and to the valleys: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My fury, because ye have borne the shame of the nations; "
Ezekiel,36,7,"therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: I have lifted up My hand: Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame. "
Ezekiel,36,8,"But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they are at hand to come. "
Ezekiel,36,9,"For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown; "
Ezekiel,36,10,"and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded; "
Ezekiel,36,11,"and I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance; and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children. "
Ezekiel,36,13,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Because they say unto you: Thou land art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nations; "
Ezekiel,36,14,"therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the L-rd GOD; "
Ezekiel,36,15,"neither will I suffer the shame of the nations any more to be heard against thee, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to stumble any more, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,36,16,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,36,17,"'Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings; their way before Me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. "
Ezekiel,36,18,"Wherefore I poured out My fury upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols; "
Ezekiel,36,19,"and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. "
Ezekiel,36,20,"And when they came unto the nations, whither they came, they profaned My holy name; in that men said of them: These are the people of HaShem, and are gone forth out of His land. "
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had pity for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they came. "
Ezekiel,36,22,"Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I do not this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye came. "
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I will sanctify My great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am HaShem, saith the L-rd GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. "
Ezekiel,36,24,"For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. "
Ezekiel,36,25,"And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. "
Ezekiel,36,26,"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. "
Ezekiel,36,27,"And I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep Mine ordinances, and do them. "
Ezekiel,36,28,"And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be My people, and I will be your G-d. "
Ezekiel,36,29,"And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. "
Ezekiel,36,30,"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. "
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. "
Ezekiel,36,32,"Not for your sake do I this, saith the L-rd GOD, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,36,33,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded. "
Ezekiel,36,34,"And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by. "
Ezekiel,36,35,And they shall say: This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. 
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I HaShem have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate; I HaShem have spoken it, and I will do it. "
Ezekiel,36,37,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. "
Ezekiel,36,38,"As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed seasons, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of HaShem was upon me, and HaShem carried me out in a spirit, and set me down in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones; "
Ezekiel,37,2,"and He caused me to pass by them round about, and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. "
Ezekiel,37,3,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I answered: 'O L-rd GOD, Thou knowest.' "
Ezekiel,37,4,"Then He said unto me: 'Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them: O ye dry bones, hear the word of HaShem: "
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. "
Ezekiel,37,6,"And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a commotion, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. "
Ezekiel,37,8,"And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. "
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then said He unto me: 'Prophesy unto the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.' "
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great host. "
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then He said unto me: 'Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. "
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy, and say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. "
Ezekiel,37,13,"And ye shall know that I am HaShem, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O My people. "
Ezekiel,37,14,"And I will put My spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land; and ye shall know that I HaShem have spoken, and performed it, saith HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,37,15,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,37,16,"'And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it: For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions; then take another stick, and write upon it: For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel his companions; "
Ezekiel,37,17,"and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand. "
Ezekiel,37,18,"And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these? "
Ezekiel,37,19,"say into them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them unto him together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand. "
Ezekiel,37,20,And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. 
Ezekiel,37,21,"And say unto them: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land; "
Ezekiel,37,22,"and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all; "
Ezekiel,37,23,"neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; so shall they be My people, and I will be their G-d. "
Ezekiel,37,24,"And My servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd; they shall also walk in Mine ordinances, and observe My statutes, and do them. "
Ezekiel,37,25,"And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob My servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever; and David My servant shall be their prince for ever. "
Ezekiel,37,26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them--it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. "
Ezekiel,37,27,"My dwelling-place also shall be over them; and I will be their G-d, and they shall be My people. "
Ezekiel,37,28,"And the nations shall know that I am HaShem that sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.' "
Ezekiel,38,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Ezekiel,38,2,"'Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, "
Ezekiel,38,3,"and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; "
Ezekiel,38,4,"and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed most gorgeously, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords: "
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet; "
Ezekiel,38,6,"Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his bands; even many peoples with thee. "
Ezekiel,38,7,"Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou guarded of them. "
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many days thou shalt be mustered for service, in the latter years thou shalt come against the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, against the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they dwell safely all of them. "
Ezekiel,38,9,"And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many peoples with thee. "
Ezekiel,38,10,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device; "
Ezekiel,38,11,"and thou shalt say: I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will come upon them that are at quiet, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates; "
Ezekiel,38,12,"to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth. "
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the magnates thereof, shall say unto thee: Comest thou to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil? "
Ezekiel,38,14,"Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In that day when My people Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it? "
Ezekiel,38,15,"And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army; "
Ezekiel,38,16,"and thou shalt come up against My people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the end of days, and I will bring thee against My land, that the nations may know Me, when I shall be sanctified through thee, O Gog, before their eyes. "
Ezekiel,38,17,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Art thou he of whom I spoke in old time by My servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for many years, that I would bring thee against them? "
Ezekiel,38,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the L-rd GOD, that My fury shall arise up in My nostrils. "
Ezekiel,38,19,For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath have I spoken: Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
Ezekiel,38,20,"so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at My presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. "
Ezekiel,38,21,"And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the L-rd GOD; every man's sword shall be against his brother. "
Ezekiel,38,22,"And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will cause to rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. "
Ezekiel,38,23,"Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself, and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,39,1,"And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; "
Ezekiel,39,2,"and I will turn thee about and lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel; "
Ezekiel,39,3,"and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. "
Ezekiel,39,4,"Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the peoples that are with thee; I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field, to be devoured. "
Ezekiel,39,5,"Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,39,6,"And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell safely in the isles; and they shall know that I am HaShem. "
Ezekiel,39,7,"And My holy name will I make known in the midst of My people Israel; neither will I suffer My holy name to be profaned any more; and the nations shall know that I am HaShem, the Holy One in Israel. "
Ezekiel,39,8,"Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the L-rd GOD; This is the day whereof I have spoken. "
Ezekiel,39,9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and use them as fuel, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand-staves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years; "
Ezekiel,39,10,"so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests, for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place fit for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through; and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it the valley of Hamon-gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,"And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land. "
Ezekiel,39,13,"Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them, and it shall be to them a renown; in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,39,14,"And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land to bury with them that pass through those that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it; after the end of seven months shall they search. "
Ezekiel,39,15,"And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, and any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. "
Ezekiel,39,16,And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,17,"And thou, son of man, thus saith the L-rd GOD: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field: Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to My feast that I do prepare for you, even a great feast, upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. "
Ezekiel,39,18,"The flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink; rams, lambs, and goats, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan are they all of them. "
Ezekiel,39,19,"And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of My feast which I have prepared for you. "
Ezekiel,39,20,"And ye shall be filled at My table with horses and horsemen, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,39,21,"And I will set My glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see My judgment that I have executed, and My hand that I have laid upon them. "
Ezekiel,39,22,"So the house of Israel shall know that I am HaShem their G-d, from that day and forward. "
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they broke faith with Me, and I hid My face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword. "
Ezekiel,39,24,According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid My face from them. 
Ezekiel,39,25,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have compassion upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name. "
Ezekiel,39,26,"And they shall bear their shame, and all their breach of faith which they have committed against Me, when they shall dwell safely in their land, and none shall make them afraid; "
Ezekiel,39,27,"when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. "
Ezekiel,39,28,"And they shall know that I am HaShem their G-d, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there; "
Ezekiel,39,29,"neither will I hide My face any more from them; for I have poured out My spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of HaShem was upon me, and He brought me thither. "
Ezekiel,40,2,"In the visions of G-d brought He me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. "
Ezekiel,40,3,"And He brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. "
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the man said unto me: 'Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee, for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought thither; declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.' "
Ezekiel,40,5,"And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand-breadth each; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed, and the height, one reed. "
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof; and he measured the jamb of the gate, one reed broad, and the other jamb, one reed broad. "
Ezekiel,40,7,"And every cell was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the cells was five cubits; and the jambs of the gate by the porch of the gate within were one reed. "
Ezekiel,40,8,"He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. "
Ezekiel,40,9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. "
Ezekiel,40,10,"And the cells of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure; and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. "
Ezekiel,40,11,"And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; "
Ezekiel,40,12,"and a border before the cells, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the cells, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. "
Ezekiel,40,13,"And he measured the gate from the roof of the one cell to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. "
Ezekiel,40,14,He made also posts of threescore cubits; even unto the posts of the court in the gates round about. 
Ezekiel,40,15,And from the forefront of the gate of the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. 
Ezekiel,40,16,"And there were narrow windows to the cells and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm-trees. "
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then brought he me into the outer court, and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about; thirty chambers were upon the pavement. "
Ezekiel,40,18,"And the pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. "
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, eastward as also northward. "
Ezekiel,40,20,"And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof. "
Ezekiel,40,21,"And the cells thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. "
Ezekiel,40,22,"And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and it was ascended by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. "
Ezekiel,40,23,"And there was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, northward as also eastward; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. "
Ezekiel,40,24,"And he led me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south; and he measured the posts thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures. "
Ezekiel,40,25,"And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. "
Ezekiel,40,26,"And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. "
Ezekiel,40,27,And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. 
Ezekiel,40,28,Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
Ezekiel,40,29,"and the cells thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. "
Ezekiel,40,30,"And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. "
Ezekiel,40,31,And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof; and the going up to it had eight steps. 
Ezekiel,40,32,And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to these measures; 
Ezekiel,40,33,"and the cells thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures; and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. "
Ezekiel,40,34,"And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the going up to it had eight steps. "
Ezekiel,40,35,And he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to these measures; 
Ezekiel,40,36,"the cells thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof; and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. "
Ezekiel,40,37,"And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the going up to it had eight steps. "
Ezekiel,40,38,And a chamber with the entry thereof was by the posts at the gates; there was the burnt-offering to be washed. 
Ezekiel,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the guilt-offering. "
Ezekiel,40,40,"And on the one side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. "
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon to slay the sacrifices. "
Ezekiel,40,42,"Moreover there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, whereupon to lay the instruments wherewith the burnt-offering and the sacrifice are slain. "
Ezekiel,40,43,"And the slabs, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about; and upon the tables was to be the flesh of the offering. "
Ezekiel,40,44,"And without the inner gate were chambers for the guard in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate, and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. "
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he said unto me: 'This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. "
Ezekiel,40,46,"And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to HaShem to minister unto Him.' "
Ezekiel,40,47,"And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house. "
Ezekiel,40,48,"Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. "
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and it was by steps that it was ascended; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. "
Ezekiel,41,1,"And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tent. "
Ezekiel,41,2,"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side; and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. "
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits. "
Ezekiel,41,4,"And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple; and he said unto me: 'This is the most holy place.' "
Ezekiel,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. "
Ezekiel,41,6,"And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times; and there were cornices in the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house. "
Ezekiel,41,7,And the side-chambers were broader as they wound about higher and higher; for the winding about of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest row to the highest by the middle. 
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about; the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six cubits to the joining. 
Ezekiel,41,9,The breadth of the outer wall which belonged to the side-chambers was five cubits; and so that which was left by the structure of the side-chambers that belonged to the house. 
Ezekiel,41,10,And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
Ezekiel,41,11,"And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. "
Ezekiel,41,12,"And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. "
Ezekiel,41,13,"And he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; "
Ezekiel,41,14,"also the breadth of the face of the house and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. "
Ezekiel,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits. Now the temple, and the inner place, and the porches of the court, "
Ezekiel,41,16,"the jambs, and the narrow windows, and the galleries, that they three had round about, over against the jambs there was a veneering of wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows; and the windows were covered; "
Ezekiel,41,17,"to the space above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and on all the wall round about within and without, by measure. "
Ezekiel,41,18,"And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; "
Ezekiel,41,19,"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side; thus was it made through all the house round about. "
Ezekiel,41,20,From the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made; and so on the wall of the temple. 
Ezekiel,41,21,"As for the temple, the jambs were squared; and the face of the sanctuary had an appearance such as is the appearance. "
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits, was of wood, and so the corners thereof; the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were also of wood; and he said unto me: 'This is the table that is before HaShem.' "
Ezekiel,41,23,And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
Ezekiel,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other. "
Ezekiel,41,25,"And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick beams of wood upon the face of the porch without. "
Ezekiel,41,26,"And there were narrow windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch; there were also the brackets of the house, and the thick beams.  "
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building, toward the north, "
Ezekiel,42,2,"even to the front of the length of a hundred cubits, with the door on the north, and the breadth of fifty cubits, "
Ezekiel,42,3,"over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court; with gallery against gallery in three stories. "
Ezekiel,42,4,"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. "
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building. "
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts; therefore room was taken away from the lowest and the middlemost, in comparison with the ground. "
Ezekiel,42,7,"And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. "
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that were toward the outer court was fifty cubits; and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits. "
Ezekiel,42,9,"And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court. "
Ezekiel,42,10,"In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers, "
Ezekiel,42,11,"with a way before them; like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they, with all their goings out, and according to their fashions; and as their doors, "
Ezekiel,42,12,"so were also the doors of the chambers that were toward the south, there was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall, toward the way from the east, as one entereth into them. "
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then said he unto me: 'The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto HaShem shall eat the most holy things; there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering; for the place is holy. "
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister, for they are holy; and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.' "
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. "
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. "
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. "
Ezekiel,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. "
Ezekiel,42,19,"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. "
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it by the four sides; it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. "
Ezekiel,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east; "
Ezekiel,43,2,"and, behold, the glory of the G-d of Israel came from the way of the east; and His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth did shine with His glory. "
Ezekiel,43,3,And the appearance of the vision which I saw was like the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. 
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of HaShem came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. 
Ezekiel,43,5,"And a spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of HaShem filled the house. "
Ezekiel,43,6,And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me. 
Ezekiel,43,7,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, this is the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more defile My holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, and by the carcasses of their kings in their high places; "
Ezekiel,43,8,"in their setting of their threshold by My threshold, and their door-post beside My door-post, and there was but the wall between Me and them; and they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed; wherefore I have consumed them in Mine anger. "
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put away their harlotry, and the carcasses of their kings, far from Me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. "
Ezekiel,43,10,"Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure accurately. "
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof, and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. "
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. "
Ezekiel,43,13,"And these are the measures of the altar by cubits--the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth: the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. "
Ezekiel,43,14,"And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit. "
Ezekiel,43,15,And the hearth shall be four cubits; and from the hearth and upward there shall be four horns. 
Ezekiel,43,16,"And the hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof. "
Ezekiel,43,17,And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.' 
Ezekiel,43,18,"And He said unto me: 'Son of man, thus saith the L-rd GOD: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to dash blood against it. "
Ezekiel,43,19,"Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto Me, to minister unto Me, saith the L-rd GOD, a young bullock for a sin-offering. "
Ezekiel,43,20,"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about; thus shalt thou purify it and make atonement for it. "
Ezekiel,43,21,"Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. "
Ezekiel,43,22,"And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall purify the altar, as they did purify it with the bullock. "
Ezekiel,43,23,"When thou hast made an end of purifying it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. "
Ezekiel,43,24,"And thou shalt present them before HaShem, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto HaShem. "
Ezekiel,43,25,"Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering; they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. "
Ezekiel,43,26,Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so shall they consecrate it. 
Ezekiel,43,27,"And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the L-rd GOD.' "
Ezekiel,44,1,"Then he brought me back the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. "
Ezekiel,44,2,"And HaShem said unto me: 'This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it, for HaShem, the G-d of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut. "
Ezekiel,44,3,"As for the prince, being a prince, he shall sit therein to eat bread before HaShem; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.' "
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of HaShem filled the house of HaShem; and I fell upon my face. "
Ezekiel,44,5,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of HaShem, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. "
Ezekiel,44,6,"And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel: Thus saith the L-rd GOD: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, "
Ezekiel,44,7,"in that ye have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, even My house, when ye offer My bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken My covenant, to add unto all your abominations. "
Ezekiel,44,8,And ye have not kept the charge of My holy things; but ye have set keepers of My charge in My sanctuary to please yourselves. 
Ezekiel,44,9,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: No alien, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, even any alien that is among the children of Israel. "
Ezekiel,44,10,"But the Levites, that went far from Me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity; "
Ezekiel,44,11,"and they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. "
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up My hand against them, saith the L-rd GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity. "
Ezekiel,44,13,"And they shall not come near unto Me, to minister unto Me in the priest's office, nor to come near to any of My holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. "
Ezekiel,44,14,"And I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. "
Ezekiel,44,15,"But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister unto Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer unto Me the fat and the blood, saith the L-rd GOD; "
Ezekiel,44,16,"they shall enter into My sanctuary, and they shall come near to My table, to minister unto Me, and they shall keep My charge. "
Ezekiel,44,17,"And it shall be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. "
Ezekiel,44,18,"They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. "
Ezekiel,44,19,"And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. "
Ezekiel,44,20,"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. "
Ezekiel,44,21,"Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. "
Ezekiel,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. "
Ezekiel,44,23,"And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. "
Ezekiel,44,24,"And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to Mine ordinances shall they judge it; and they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed seasons, and they shall hallow My sabbaths. "
Ezekiel,44,25,"And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. "
Ezekiel,44,26,"And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. "
Ezekiel,44,27,"And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,44,28,And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. 
Ezekiel,44,29,"The meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, they, even they, shall eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. "
Ezekiel,44,30,"And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every heave-offering of every thing, of all your offerings, shall be for the priests; ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. "
Ezekiel,44,31,"The priests shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast. "
Ezekiel,45,1,"Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall set apart an offering unto HaShem, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand; it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about. "
Ezekiel,45,2,"Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred in length by five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits for the open land round about it. "
Ezekiel,45,3,"And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand; and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. "
Ezekiel,45,4,"It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto HaShem; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a place consecrated for the sanctuary. "
Ezekiel,45,5,"And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, which shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, for twenty chambers. "
Ezekiel,45,6,"And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the offering of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,45,7,"And for the prince, on the one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border "
Ezekiel,45,8,"of the land; it shall be to him for a possession in Israel, and My princes shall no more wrong My people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. "
Ezekiel,45,9,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel; remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from My people, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,45,10,"Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. "
Ezekiel,45,11,"The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer; the measure thereof shall be after the homer. "
Ezekiel,45,12,"And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your maneh. "
Ezekiel,45,13,"This is the offering that ye shall set apart: the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley; "
Ezekiel,45,14,"and the set portion of oil, the bath of oil, shall be the tithe of the bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer; for ten baths are a homer; "
Ezekiel,45,15,"and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,45,16,All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel. 
Ezekiel,45,17,"And it shall be the prince's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all the appointed seasons of the house of Israel; he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. "
Ezekiel,45,18,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt purify the sanctuary. "
Ezekiel,45,19,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. "
Ezekiel,45,20,"And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple; so shall ye make atonement for the house. "
Ezekiel,45,21,"In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover; a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. "
Ezekiel,45,22,And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering. 
Ezekiel,45,23,"And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to HaShem, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering. "
Ezekiel,45,24,"And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah. "
Ezekiel,45,25,"In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; to the sin-offering as well as the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering as well as the oil. "
Ezekiel,46,1,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. "
Ezekiel,46,2,"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate; then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. "
Ezekiel,46,3,Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before HaShem in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 
Ezekiel,46,4,And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto HaShem shall be in the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; 
Ezekiel,46,5,"and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. "
Ezekiel,46,6,"And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish; and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish; "
Ezekiel,46,7,"and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as his means suffice, and a hin of oil to an ephah. "
Ezekiel,46,8,"And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. "
Ezekiel,46,9,"But when the people of the land shall come before HaShem in the appointed seasons, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him. "
Ezekiel,46,10,"And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth together. "
Ezekiel,46,11,"And in the feasts and in the appointed seasons the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. "
Ezekiel,46,12,"And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto HaShem, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day; then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. "
Ezekiel,46,13,And thou shalt prepare a lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering unto HaShem daily; morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. 
Ezekiel,46,14,"And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour: a meal-offering unto HaShem continually by a perpetual ordinance. "
Ezekiel,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering. "
Ezekiel,46,16,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. "
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. "
Ezekiel,46,18,"Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them wrongfully out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession; that My people be not scattered every man from his possession.' "
Ezekiel,46,19,"Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north; and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. "
Ezekiel,46,20,"And he said unto me: 'This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt-offering and the sin-offering, where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.' "
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. "
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty cubits long and thirty broad; these four in the corners were of one measure. "
Ezekiel,46,23,"And there was a row of masonry round about in them, round about the four, and it was made with boiling-places under the rows round about. "
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then said he unto me: 'These are the boiling-places, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.' "
Ezekiel,47,1,"And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house looked toward the east; and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. "
Ezekiel,47,2,"Then brought he me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there trickled forth waters on the right side. "
Ezekiel,47,3,"When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. "
Ezekiel,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the loins. "
Ezekiel,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. "
Ezekiel,47,6,"And he said unto me: 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man?' Then he led me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. "
Ezekiel,47,7,"Now when I had been brought back, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. "
Ezekiel,47,8,"Then said he unto me: 'These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and when they shall enter into the sea, into the sea of the putrid waters, the waters shall be healed. "
Ezekiel,47,9,"And it shall come to pass, that every living creature wherewith it swarmeth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, that all things be healed and may live whithersoever the river cometh. "
Ezekiel,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; there shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the Great Sea, exceeding many. "
Ezekiel,47,11,"But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given for salt. "
Ezekiel,47,12,"And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail; it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.' "
Ezekiel,47,13,"Thus saith the L-rd GOD: 'This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel, Joseph receiving two portions. "
Ezekiel,47,14,"And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. "
Ezekiel,47,15,"And this shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad; "
Ezekiel,47,16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. "
Ezekiel,47,17,"And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. "
Ezekiel,47,18,"And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, by the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side. "
Ezekiel,47,19,"And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea. This is the south side southward. "
Ezekiel,47,20,"And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side. "
Ezekiel,47,21,So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. 
Ezekiel,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. "
Ezekiel,47,23,"And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,48,1,"Now these are the names of the tribes: from the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus, northward, beside Hamath; and they shall have their sides east and west: Dan, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,2,"And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side: Asher, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,3,"And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side: Naphtali, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,4,"And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side: Manasseh, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,5,"And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side: Ephraim, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,6,"And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side: Reuben, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,7,"And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side: Judah, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,8,"And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall set aside, five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. "
Ezekiel,48,9,"The offering that ye shall set apart unto HaShem shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in breadth. "
Ezekiel,48,10,"And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length; and the sanctuary of HaShem shall be in the midst thereof. "
Ezekiel,48,11,"The sanctified portion shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, that have kept My charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. "
Ezekiel,48,12,"And it shall be unto them a portion set apart from the offering of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites. "
Ezekiel,48,13,"And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth; all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. "
Ezekiel,48,14,"And they shall not sell of it, nor exchange, nor alienate the first portion of the land; for it is holy unto HaShem. "
Ezekiel,48,15,"And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for open land; and the city shall be in the midst thereof. "
Ezekiel,48,16,"And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. "
Ezekiel,48,17,"And the city shall have open land: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. "
Ezekiel,48,18,"And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy offering, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy offering; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city. "
Ezekiel,48,19,"And they that serve the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. "
Ezekiel,48,20,"All the offering shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; ye shall set apart the holy offering foursquare, with the possession of the city. "
Ezekiel,48,21,"And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the five and twenty thousand of the offering toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince; and the holy offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. "
Ezekiel,48,22,"Thus the possession of the Levites, and the possession of the city, shall be in the midst of that which is the prince's; between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be the prince's. "
Ezekiel,48,23,"And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side: Benjamin, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,24,"And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side: Simeon, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,25,"And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side: Issachar, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,26,"And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side: Zebulun, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,27,"And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side: Gad, one portion. "
Ezekiel,48,28,"And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea. "
Ezekiel,48,29,"This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Ezekiel,48,30,And these are the goings out of the city: on the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure; 
Ezekiel,48,31,"and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one; "
Ezekiel,48,32,"and at the east side four thousand and five hundred reeds; and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one; "
Ezekiel,48,33,"and at the south side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure; and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one; "
Ezekiel,48,34,"at the west side four thousand and five hundred reeds, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one. "
Ezekiel,48,35,"It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, HaShem is there.'  "
Hosea,1,1,"THE WORD of HaShem that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. "
Hosea,1,2,"When HaShem spoke at first with Hosea, HaShem said unto Hosea: 'Go, take unto thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry; for the land doth commit great harlotry, departing from HaShem.' "
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. "
Hosea,1,4,"And HaShem said unto him: 'Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. "
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.' "
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And He said unto him: 'Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them. "
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have compassion upon the house of Judah, and will save them by HaShem their G-d, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.' "
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. "
Hosea,1,9,"And He said: 'Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not My people, and I will not be yours.'  "
Hosea,2,1,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them: 'Ye are not My people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are the children of the living G-d.' "
Hosea,2,2,"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel. "
Hosea,2,3,"Say ye unto your brethren: 'Ammi'; and to your sisters, 'Ruhamah.' "
Hosea,2,4,"Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not My wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her harlotries from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; "
Hosea,2,5,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. "
Hosea,2,6,And I will not have compassion upon her children; for they are children of harlotry. 
Hosea,2,7,"For their mother hath played the harlot, she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said: 'I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.' "
Hosea,2,8,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths. "
Hosea,2,9,"And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, and she shall seek them, but shall not find them; then shall she say: 'I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.' "
Hosea,2,10,"For she did not know that it was I that gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. "
Hosea,2,11,"Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will snatch away My wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness. "
Hosea,2,12,"And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hand. "
Hosea,2,13,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her appointed seasons. "
Hosea,2,14,"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said: 'These are my hire that my lovers have given me'; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. "
Hosea,2,15,"And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, wherein she offered unto them, and decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot Me, saith HaShem. "
Hosea,2,16,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly unto her. "
Hosea,2,17,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. "
Hosea,2,18,"And it shall be at that day, saith HaShem, that thou shalt call Me Ishi, and shalt call Me no more Baali. "
Hosea,2,19,"For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name. "
Hosea,2,20,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely. "
Hosea,2,21,"And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in compassion. "
Hosea,2,22,And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know HaShem. 
Hosea,2,23,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith HaShem, I will respond to the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth; "
Hosea,2,24,"And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel. "
Hosea,2,25,And I will sow her unto Me in the land; and I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; and I will say to them that were not My people: 'Thou art My people'; and they shall say: 'Thou art my G-d.'  
Hosea,3,1,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as HaShem loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins. "
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; "
Hosea,3,3,"and I said unto her: 'Thou shalt sit solitary for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man's wife; nor will I be thine.' "
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim; "
Hosea,3,5,"afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek HaShem their G-d, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto HaShem and to His goodness in the end of days. "
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of HaShem, ye children of Israel! for HaShem hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of G-d in the land. "
Hosea,4,2,"Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery! they break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood. "
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore doth the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, with the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away. "
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. "
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother. "
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy G-d, I also will forget thy children. "
Hosea,4,7,"The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame. "
Hosea,4,8,"They feed on the sin of My people, and set their heart on their iniquity. "
Hosea,4,9,"And it is like people, like priest; and I will punish him for his ways, and will recompense him his doings. "
Hosea,4,10,"And they shall eat, and not have enough, they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; because they have left off to take heed to HaShem. "
Hosea,4,11,"Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart. "
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their G-d. "
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and offer upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit harlotry, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. "
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for they themselves consort with lewd women, and they sacrifice with harlots; and the people that is without understanding is distraught. "
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah become guilty; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear: 'As HaShem liveth.' "
Hosea,4,16,For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; now shall HaShem feed them as a lamb in a large place? 
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. 
Hosea,4,18,"When their carouse is over, they take to harlotry; her rulers deeply love dishonour. "
Hosea,4,19,The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. 
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. "
Hosea,5,2,And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; and I am rejected of them all. 
Hosea,5,3,"I, even I, know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled. "
Hosea,5,4,"Their doings will not suffer them to return unto their G-d; for the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not HaShem. "
Hosea,5,5,"But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them. "
Hosea,5,6,"With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek HaShem, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them. "
Hosea,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously against HaShem, for they have begotten strange children; now shall the new moon devour them with their portions. "
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; sound an alarm at Beth-aven: 'Behind thee, O Benjamin!' "
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be. 
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water. 
Hosea,5,11,"Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; because he willingly walked after filth. "
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. "
Hosea,5,13,"And when Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Contentious; but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound. "
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver. "
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their trouble they will seek Me earnestly: "
Hosea,6,1,"'Come, and let us return unto HaShem; for He hath torn, and He will heal us, He hath smitten, and He will bind us up. "
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will He revive us, on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence. "
Hosea,6,3,"And let us know, eagerly strive to know HaShem, His going forth is sure as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.' "
Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away. "
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; and thy judgment goeth forth as the light. "
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of G-d rather than burnt-offerings. "
Hosea,6,7,But they like men have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against Me. 
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is covered with footprints of blood. "
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so doth the company of priests; they murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they commit enormity. "
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; there harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled. "
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee! When I would turn the captivity of My people, "
Hosea,7,1,"when I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers maketh a raid without. "
Hosea,7,2,"And let them not say to their heart--I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about, they are before My face. "
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. "
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth to stir from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened. "
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king the princes make him sick with the heat of wine, he stretcheth out his hand with scorners. "
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. "
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me. "
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned. "
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not. "
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; but they have not returned unto HaShem their G-d, nor sought Him, for all this. "
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding; they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria. "
Hosea,7,12,"Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear. "
Hosea,7,13,"Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, seeing they have spoken lies against Me? "
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, though they wail upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me. "
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise evil against Me. "
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not upwards; they are become like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. "
Hosea,8,1,"Set the horn to thy mouth. As a vulture he cometh against the house of HaShem; because they have transgressed My covenant, and trespassed against My law. "
Hosea,8,2,"Will they cry unto Me: 'My G-d, we Israel know Thee'? "
Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off that which is good; the enemy shall pursue him. 
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not from Me, they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. "
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; Mine anger is kindled against them; how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? "
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is even this: the craftsman made it, and it is no G-d; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in shivers. "
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; it hath no stalk, the bud that shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up. "
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no value. 
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath hired lovers. "
Hosea,8,10,"Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them up; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of king and princes. "
Hosea,8,11,"For Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, yea, altars have been unto him to sin. "
Hosea,8,12,"Though I write for him never so many things of My Law, they are accounted as a stranger's. "
Hosea,8,13,"As for the sacrifices that are made by fire unto Me, let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, for HaShem accepteth them not. Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt. "
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces, and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof. "
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel, unto exultation, like the peoples, for thou hast gone astray from thy G-d, thou hast loved a harlot's hire upon every corn-floor. "
Hosea,9,2,"The threshing-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her. "
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in HaShem'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria. "
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not pour out wine-offerings to HaShem, neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite, it shall not come into the house of HaShem. "
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the day of the appointed season, and in the day of the feast of HaShem? "
Hosea,9,6,"For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their precious treasures of silver, nettles shall possess them, thorns shall be in their tents. "
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad! For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great. "
Hosea,9,8,"Ephraim is a watchman with my G-d; as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his G-d. "
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins. "
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season; but so soon as they came to Baal-peor, they separated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became detestable like that which they loved. "
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird; there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception. "
Hosea,9,12,"Yea, though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left; yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! "
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer. "
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O HaShem, whatsoever Thou wilt give; give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. "
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I hated them; because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house; I will love them no more, all their princes are rebellious. "
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. "
Hosea,9,17,"My G-d will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations. "
Hosea,10,1,"Israel was a luxuriant vine, which put forth fruit freely: as his fruit increased, he increased his altars; the more goodly his land was, the more goodly were his pillars. "
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt; He will break down their altars, He will spoil their pillars. "
Hosea,10,3,"Surely now shall they say: 'We have no king; for we feared not HaShem; and the king, what can he do for us?' "
Hosea,10,4,"They speak words, they swear falsely, they make covenants; thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. "
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it. "
Hosea,10,6,"It also shall be carried unto Assyria, for a present to King Contentious; Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. "
Hosea,10,7,"As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water. "
Hosea,10,8,"The high places also of Aven shall be destroyed, even the sin of Israel. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains: 'Cover us', and to the hills: 'Fall on us.' "
Hosea,10,9,"From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel; there they stood; no battle was to overtake them in Gibeah, nor the children of arrogancy. "
Hosea,10,10,"When it is My desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are yoked to their two rings. "
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim is a heifer well broken, that loveth to thresh, and I have passed over upon her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods. "
Hosea,10,12,"Sow to yourselves according to righteousness, reap according to mercy, break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek HaShem, till He come and cause righteousness to rain upon you. "
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. "
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy hosts, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. "
Hosea,10,15,So hath Beth-el done unto you because of your great wickedness; at daybreak is the king of Israel utterly cut off. 
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son. "
Hosea,11,2,"The more they called them, the more they went from them; they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and offered to graven images. "
Hosea,11,3,"And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. "
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I fed them gently. "
Hosea,11,5,"He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. "
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. "
Hosea,11,7,"And My people are in suspense about returning to Me; and though they call them upwards, none at all will lift himself up. "
Hosea,11,8,"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me, My compassions are kindled together. "
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am G-d, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in fury. "
Hosea,11,10,"They shall walk after HaShem, who shall roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. "
Hosea,11,11,"They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith HaShem. "
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim compasseth Me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is yet wayward towards G-d, and towards the Holy One who is faithful. "
Hosea,12,2,"Ephraim striveth after wind, and followeth after the east wind; all the day he multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. "
Hosea,12,3,"HaShem hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, according to his doings will He recompense him. "
Hosea,12,4,"In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and by his strength he strove with a godlike being; "
Hosea,12,5,"So he strove with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him; at Beth-el he would find him, and there he would speak with us; "
Hosea,12,6,"But HaShem, the G-d of hosts, HaShem is His name. "
Hosea,12,7,"Therefore turn thou to thy G-d; keep mercy and justice, and wait for thy G-d continually. "
Hosea,12,8,"As for the trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loveth to oppress. "
Hosea,12,9,"And Ephraim said: 'Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth; in all my labours they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.' "
Hosea,12,10,"But I am HaShem thy G-d from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed season. "
Hosea,12,11,"I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. "
Hosea,12,12,"If Gilead be given to iniquity becoming altogether vanity, in Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks; yea, their altars shall be as heaps in the furrows of the field. "
Hosea,12,13,"And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. "
Hosea,12,14,"And by a prophet HaShem brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he kept. "
Hosea,12,15,"Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly; therefore shall his blood be cast upon him, and his reproach shall his L-rd return unto him. "
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he became guilty through Baal, he died. "
Hosea,13,2,"And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, according to their own understanding, even idols, all of them the work of the craftsmen; of them they say: 'They that sacrifice men kiss calves.' "
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the wind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the window. "
Hosea,13,4,"Yet I am HaShem thy G-d from the land of Egypt; and thou knowest no G-d but Me, and beside Me there is no saviour. "
Hosea,13,5,"I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. "
Hosea,13,6,"When they were fed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten Me. "
Hosea,13,7,Therefore am I become unto them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way; 
Hosea,13,8,"I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the enclosure of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them. "
Hosea,13,9,"It is thy destruction, O Israel, that thou art against Me, against thy help. "
Hosea,13,10,"Ho, now, thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities! and thy judges, of whom thou saidst: 'Give me a king and princes!' "
Hosea,13,11,"I give thee a king in Mine anger, and take him away in My wrath. "
Hosea,13,12,The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store. 
Hosea,13,13,The throes of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children. 
Hosea,13,14,"Shall I ransom them from the power of the nether-world? Shall I redeem them from death? Ho, thy plagues, O death! Ho, thy destruction, O netherworld! Repentance be hid from Mine eyes! "
Hosea,13,15,"For though he be fruitful among the reed-plants, an east wind shall come, the wind of HaShem coming up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; he shall spoil the treasure of all precious vessels. "
Hosea,14,1,"Samaria shall bear her guilt, for she hath rebelled against her G-d; they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. "
Hosea,14,2,"Return, O Israel, unto HaShem thy G-d; for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity. "
Hosea,14,3,"Take with you words, and return unto HaShem; say unto Him: 'Forgive all iniquity, and accept that which is good; so will we render for bullocks the offering of our lips. "
Hosea,14,4,Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods; for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.' 
Hosea,14,5,"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for Mine anger is turned away from him. "
Hosea,14,6,"I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. "
Hosea,14,7,"His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon. "
Hosea,14,8,"They that dwell under his shadow shall again make corn to grow, and shall blossom as the vine; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. "
Hosea,14,9,"Ephraim shall say: 'What have I to do any more with idols?' As for Me, I respond and look on him; I am like a leafy cypress-tree; from Me is thy fruit found. "
Hosea,14,10,"Whoso is wise, let him understand these things, whoso is prudent, let him know them. For the ways of HaShem are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein.  "
Joel,1,1,THE WORD of HaShem that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. 
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? "
Joel,1,3,"Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. "
Joel,1,4,That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. 
Joel,1,5,"Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth. "
Joel,1,6,"For a people is come up upon my land, mighty, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness. "
Joel,1,7,"He hath laid my vine waste, and blasted my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it down, the branches thereof are made white. "
Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
Joel,1,9,"The meal-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of HaShem; the priests mourn, even HaShem'S ministers. "
Joel,1,10,"The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. "
Joel,1,11,"Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. "
Joel,1,12,"The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered; for joy is withered away from the sons of men. "
Joel,1,13,"Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests, wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my G-d; for the meal-offering and the drink-offering is withholden from the house of your G-d. "
Joel,1,14,"Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of HaShem your G-d, and cry unto HaShem. "
Joel,1,15,"Alas for the day! for the day of HaShem is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. "
Joel,1,16,"Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our G-d? "
Joel,1,17,"The grains shrivel under their hoes; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. "
Joel,1,18,"How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. "
Joel,1,19,"Unto Thee, O HaShem, do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath set ablaze all the trees of the field. "
Joel,1,20,"Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto Thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. "
Joel,2,1,"Blow ye the horn in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of HaShem cometh, for it is at hand; "
Joel,2,2,"A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as blackness spread upon the mountains; a great people and a mighty, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations. "
Joel,2,3,"A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame blazeth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing escapeth them. "
Joel,2,4,"The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run. "
Joel,2,5,"Like the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a mighty people set in battle array. "
Joel,2,6,At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces have gathered blackness. 
Joel,2,7,"They run like mighty men, they climb the wall like men of war; and they move on every one in his ways, and they entangle not their paths. "
Joel,2,8,"Neither doth one thrust another, they march every one in his highway; and they break through the weapons, and suffer no harm. "
Joel,2,9,"They leap upon the city, they run upon the wall, they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief. "
Joel,2,10,"Before them the earth quaketh, the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are become black, and the stars withdraw their shining. "
Joel,2,11,"And HaShem uttereth His voice before His army; for His camp is very great, for he is mighty that executeth His word; for great is the day of HaShem and very terrible; and who can abide it? "
Joel,2,12,"Yet even now, saith HaShem, turn ye unto Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation; "
Joel,2,13,"And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto HaShem your G-d; for He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repenteth Him of the evil. "
Joel,2,14,"Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind Him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto HaShem your G-d? "
Joel,2,15,"Blow the horn in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly; "
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her pavilion. "
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, the ministers of HaShem, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say: 'Spare thy people, O HaShem, and give not Thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should make them a byword: wherefore should they say among the peoples: Where is their G-d?' "
Joel,2,18,"Then was HaShem jealous for His land, and had pity on His people. "
Joel,2,19,"And HaShem answered and said unto His people: 'Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations; "
Joel,2,20,"But I will remove far off from you the northern one, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the eastern sea, and his hinder part toward the western sea; that his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up, because he hath done great things.' "
Joel,2,21,"Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for HaShem hath done great things. "
Joel,2,22,"Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength. "
Joel,2,23,"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in HaShem your G-d; for He giveth you the former rain in just measure, and He causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, at the first. "
Joel,2,24,"And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. "
Joel,2,25,"And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer-worm, My great army which I sent among you. "
Joel,2,26,"And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of HaShem your G-d, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be ashamed. "
Joel,2,27,"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am HaShem your G-d, and there is none else; and My people shall never be ashamed. "
Joel,3,1,"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions; "
Joel,3,2,And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My spirit. 
Joel,3,3,"And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. "
Joel,3,4,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of HaShem come. "
Joel,3,5,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of HaShem shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as HaShem hath said, and among the remnant those whom HaShem shall call. "
Joel,4,1,"For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, "
Joel,4,2,"I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will enter into judgment with them there for My people and for My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided My land. "
Joel,4,3,"And they have cast lots for My people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and have drunk. "
Joel,4,4,"And also what are ye to Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render retribution on My behalf? and if ye render retribution on My behalf, swiftly, speedily will I return your retribution upon your own head. "
Joel,4,5,"Forasmuch as ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My goodly treasures; "
Joel,4,6,"the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of Jevanim, that ye might remove them far from their border; "
Joel,4,7,"behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your retribution upon your own head; "
Joel,4,8,"and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off; for HaShem hath spoken. "
Joel,4,9,"Proclaim ye this among the nations, prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. "
Joel,4,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears; let the weak say: 'I am strong.' "
Joel,4,11,"Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together; thither cause Thy mighty ones to come down, O HaShem! "
Joel,4,12,"Let the nations be stirred up, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about. "
Joel,4,13,"Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, tread ye, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great. "
Joel,4,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of HaShem is near in the valley of decision. "
Joel,4,15,"The sun and the moon are become black, and the stars withdraw their shining. "
Joel,4,16,"And HaShem shall roar from Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but HaShem will be a refuge unto His people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel. "
Joel,4,17,"So shall ye know that I am HaShem your G-d, dwelling in Zion My holy mountain; then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. "
Joel,4,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth of the house of HaShem, and shall water the valley of Shittim. "
Joel,4,19,"Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. "
Joel,4,20,"But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. "
Joel,4,21,And I will hold as innocent their blood that I have not held as innocent; and HaShem dwelleth in Zion.   
Amos,1,1,"THE WORDS of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. "
Amos,1,2,"And he said: HaShem roareth from Zion, and uttereth His voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. "
Amos,1,3,"For thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have threshed Gilead with sledges of iron. "
Amos,1,4,"So will I send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad; "
Amos,1,5,"And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from Bikath-Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Beth-eden; and the people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith HaShem. "
Amos,1,6,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they carried away captive a whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom. "
Amos,1,7,"So will I send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof; "
Amos,1,8,"And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn My hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Amos,1,9,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they delivered up a whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant. "
Amos,1,10,"So will I send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. "
Amos,1,11,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever. "
Amos,1,12,"So will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. "
Amos,1,13,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border. "
Amos,1,14,"So will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind; "
Amos,1,15,"And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith HaShem. "
Amos,2,1,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime. "
Amos,2,2,"So will I send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the horn; "
Amos,2,3,"And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith HaShem. "
Amos,2,4,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have rejected the law of HaShem, and have not kept His statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk. "
Amos,2,5,"So will I send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. "
Amos,2,6,"Thus saith HaShem: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; "
Amos,2,7,"That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the humble; and a man and his father go unto the same maid, to profane My holy name; "
Amos,2,8,"And they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge, and in the house of their G-d they drink the wine of them that have been fined. "
Amos,2,9,"Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. "
Amos,2,10,"Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorites. "
Amos,2,11,"And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith HaShem. "
Amos,2,12,"But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying: 'Prophesy not.' "
Amos,2,13,"Behold, I will make it creak under you, as a cart creaketh that is full of sheaves. "
Amos,2,14,"And flight shall fail the swift, and the strong shall not exert his strength, neither shall the mighty deliver himself; "
Amos,2,15,Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself; 
Amos,2,16,"And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith HaShem. "
Amos,3,1,"Hear this word that HaShem hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying: "
Amos,3,2,You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities. 
Amos,3,3,"Will two walk together, except they have agreed? "
Amos,3,4,"Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? Will a young lion give forth his voice out of his den, if he have taken nothing? "
Amos,3,5,"Will a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where there is no lure for it? Will a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all? "
Amos,3,6,"Shall the horn be blown in a city, and the people not tremble? Shall evil befall a city, and HaShem hath not done it? "
Amos,3,7,"For the L-rd GOD will do nothing, but He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets. "
Amos,3,8,"The lion hath roared, who will not fear? The L-rd GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy? "
Amos,3,9,"Proclaim it upon the palaces at Ashdod, and upon the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: 'Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great confusions therein, and the oppressions in the midst thereof.' "
Amos,3,10,"For they know not to do right, saith HaShem, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. "
Amos,3,11,"Therefore thus saith the L-rd GOD: An adversary, even round about the land! And he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled. "
Amos,3,12,"Thus saith HaShem: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel that dwell in Samaria escape with the corner of a couch, and the leg of a bed. "
Amos,3,13,"Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the L-rd GOD, the G-d of hosts. "
Amos,3,14,"For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also punish the altars of Beth-el, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. "
Amos,3,15,"And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,1,"Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords: 'Bring, that we may feast.' "
Amos,4,2,"The L-rd GOD hath sworn by His holiness: Lo, surely the days shall come upon you, that ye shall be taken away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks. "
Amos,4,3,"And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall be cast into Harmon, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,4,"Come to Beth-el, and transgress, to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices in the morning, and your tithes after three days; "
Amos,4,5,"And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them; for so ye love to do, O ye children of Israel, saith the L-rd GOD. "
Amos,4,6,"And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,7,"And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. "
Amos,4,8,"So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,9,"I have smitten you with blasting and mildew; the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,10,"I have sent among you the pestilence in the way of Egypt; your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,11,"I have overthrown some of you, as G-d overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Amos,4,12,"Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy G-d, O Israel. "
Amos,4,13,"For, lo, He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth; HaShem, the G-d of hosts, is His name. "
Amos,5,1,"Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel: "
Amos,5,2,"The virgin of Israel is fallen, she shall no more rise; she is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up. "
Amos,5,3,"For thus saith the L-rd GOD: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, of the house of Israel. "
Amos,5,4,"For thus saith HaShem unto the house of Israel: Seek ye Me, and live; "
Amos,5,5,"But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. "
Amos,5,6,"Seek HaShem, and live--lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel-- "
Amos,5,7,"Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and cast righteousness to the ground; "
Amos,5,8,"Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and bringeth on the shadow of death in the morning, and darkeneth the day into night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; HaShem is His name; "
Amos,5,9,"That causeth destruction to flash upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress. "
Amos,5,10,"They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. "
Amos,5,11,"Therefore, because ye trample upon the poor, and take from him exactions of wheat; ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them, ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine thereof. "
Amos,5,12,"For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins; ye that afflict the just, that take a ransom, and that turn aside the needy in the gate. "
Amos,5,13,Therefore the prudent doth keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time. 
Amos,5,14,"Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so HaShem, the G-d of hosts, will be with you, as ye say. "
Amos,5,15,"Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that HaShem, the G-d of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. "
Amos,5,16,"Therefore thus saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts, the L-rd: Lamentation shall be in all the broad places, and they shall say in all the streets: 'Alas! alas!' and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and proclaim lamentation to such as are skilful of wailing. "
Amos,5,17,"And in all vineyards shall be lamentation; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith HaShem. "
Amos,5,18,"Woe unto you that desire the day of HaShem! Wherefore would ye have the day of HaShem? It is darkness, and not light. "
Amos,5,19,"As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; and went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. "
Amos,5,20,"Shall not the day of HaShem be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it? "
Amos,5,21,"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. "
Amos,5,22,"Yea, though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts. "
Amos,5,23,Take thou away from Me the noise of thy songs; and let Me not hear the melody of thy psalteries. 
Amos,5,24,"But let justice well up as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. "
Amos,5,25,"Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? "
Amos,5,26,"So shall ye take up Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. "
Amos,5,27,"Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith He, whose name is HaShem G-d of hosts. "
Amos,6,1,"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the first of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come! "
Amos,6,2,"Pass ye unto Calneh, and see, and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines; are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border? "
Amos,6,3,"Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; "
Amos,6,4,"That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; "
Amos,6,5,"That thrum on the psaltery, that devise for themselves instruments of music, like David; "
Amos,6,6,"That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved for the hurt of Joseph. "
Amos,6,7,"Therefore now shall they go captive at the head of them that go captive, and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away. "
Amos,6,8,"The L-rd GOD hath sworn by Himself, saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces; and I will deliver up the city with all that is therein. "
Amos,6,9,"And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. "
Amos,6,10,"And when a man's uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house: 'Is there yet any with thee?' and he shall say: 'No'; then shall he say: 'Hold thy peace; for we must not make mention of the name of HaShem.' "
Amos,6,11,"For, behold, HaShem commandeth, and the great house shall be smitten into splinters, and the little house into chips. "
Amos,6,12,"Do horses run upon the rocks? Doth one plow there with oxen? that ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood; "
Amos,6,13,"Ye that rejoice in a thing of nought, that say: 'Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?' "
Amos,6,14,"For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith HaShem, the G-d of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of the Arabah. "
Amos,7,1,"Thus the L-rd GOD showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. "
Amos,7,2,"And if it had come to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land--so I said: O L-rd GOD, forgive, I beseech Thee; how shall Jacob stand? for he is small. "
Amos,7,3,"HaShem repented concerning this; 'It shall not be', saith HaShem. "
Amos,7,4,"Thus the L-rd GOD showed me; and, behold, the L-rd GOD called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land. "
Amos,7,5,"Then said I: O L-rd GOD, cease, I beseech Thee; how shall Jacob stand? for he is small. "
Amos,7,6,"HaShem repented concerning this; 'This also shall not be', saith the L-rd GOD. "
Amos,7,7,"Thus He showed me; and, behold, the L-rd stood beside a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in His hand. "
Amos,7,8,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Amos, what seest thou?' And I said: 'A plumbline.' Then said the L-rd: Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of My people Israel; I will not again pardon them any more; "
Amos,7,9,"And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. "
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: 'Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. "
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos saith: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.' "
Amos,7,12,"Also Amaziah said unto Amos: 'O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there; "
Amos,7,13,"but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.' "
Amos,7,14,"Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah: 'I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees; "
Amos,7,15,"and HaShem took me from following the flock, and HaShem said unto me: Go, prophesy unto My people Israel. "
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore hear thou the word of HaShem: Thou sayest: Prophesy not against Israel, and preach not against the house of Isaac; "
Amos,7,17,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.' "
Amos,8,1,Thus the L-rd GOD showed me; and behold a basket of summer fruit. 
Amos,8,2,"And He said: 'Amos, what seest thou?' And I said: 'A basket of summer fruit.' Then said HaShem unto me: The end is come upon My people Israel; I will not again pardon them any more. "
Amos,8,3,"And the songs of the palace shall be wailings in that day, saith the L-rd GOD; the dead bodies shall be many; in every place silence shall be cast. "
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, O ye that would swallow the needy, and destroy the poor of the land, "
Amos,8,5,"Saying: 'When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth corn? making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances of deceit; "
Amos,8,6,"That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the corn?' "
Amos,8,7,HaShem hath sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their works. 
Amos,8,8,"Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? Yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt. "
Amos,8,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L-rd GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day. "
Amos,8,10,"And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day. "
Amos,8,11,"Behold, the days come, saith the L-rd GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of HaShem. "
Amos,8,12,"And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of HaShem, and shall not find it. "
Amos,8,13,In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst. 
Amos,8,14,"They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: 'As thy G-d, O Dan, liveth'; and: 'As the way of Beer-sheba liveth'; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.  "
Amos,9,1,"I saw the L-rd standing beside the altar; and He said: Smite the capitals, that the posts may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the residue of them with the sword; there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. "
Amos,9,2,"Though they dig into the nether-world, thence shall My hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. "
Amos,9,3,"And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them. "
Amos,9,4,"And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; and I will set Mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. "
Amos,9,5,"For the L-rd, the GOD of hosts, is He that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein mourn; and it riseth up wholly like the River, and sinketh again, like the River of Egypt; "
Amos,9,6,"It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and hath founded His vault upon the earth; He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; HaShem is His name. "
Amos,9,7,"Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of Israel? saith HaShem. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir? "
Amos,9,8,"Behold, the eyes of the L-rd GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith HaShem. "
Amos,9,9,"For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. "
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, that say: 'The evil shall not overtake nor confront us.' "
Amos,9,11,"In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof, and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; "
Amos,9,12,"That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations, upon whom My name is called, saith HaShem that doeth this. "
Amos,9,13,"Behold, the days come, saith HaShem, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. "
Amos,9,14,"And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. "
Amos,9,15,"And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith HaShem thy G-d.  "
Obadiah,1,1,"THE VISION of Obadiah. Thus saith the L-rd GOD concerning Edom: We have heard a message from HaShem, and an ambassador is sent among the nations: 'Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.' "
Obadiah,1,2,"Behold, I make thee small among the nations; thou art greatly despised. "
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride of thy heart hath beguiled thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, thy habitation on high; that sayest in thy heart: 'Who shall bring me down to the ground?' "
Obadiah,1,4,"Though thou make thy nest as high as the eagle, and though thou set it among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith HaShem. "
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night--how art thou cut off! --would they not steal till they had enough? If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? "
Obadiah,1,6,How is Esau searched out! How are his hidden places sought out! 
Obadiah,1,7,"All the men of thy confederacy have conducted thee to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have beguiled thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread lay a snare under thee, in whom there is no discernment. "
Obadiah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, saith HaShem, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and discernment out of the mount of Esau? "
Obadiah,1,9,"And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter. "
Obadiah,1,10,"For the violence done to thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. "
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that thou didst stand aloof, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. "
Obadiah,1,12,"But thou shouldest not have gazed on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. "
Obadiah,1,13,"Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of My people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have gazed on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity. "
Obadiah,1,14,"Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. "
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day of HaShem is near upon all the nations; as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head. "
Obadiah,1,16,"For as ye have drunk upon My holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been. "
Obadiah,1,17,"But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. "
Obadiah,1,18,"And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for HaShem hath spoken. "
Obadiah,1,19,"And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and they of the Lowland the Philistines; and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin shall possess Gilead. "
Obadiah,1,20,"And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, that are among the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath, and the captivity of Jerusalem, that is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South. "
Obadiah,1,21,And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be HaShem'S.  
Jonah,1,1,"NOW THE WORD of HaShem came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying: "
Jonah,1,2,"'Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim against it; for their wickedness is come up before Me.' "
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of HaShem; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of HaShem. "
Jonah,1,4,"But HaShem hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. "
Jonah,1,5,"And the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. "
Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him: 'What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy G-d, if so be that G-d will think upon us, that we perish not.' "
Jonah,1,7,"And they said every one to his fellow: 'Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.' So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. "
Jonah,1,8,"Then said they unto him: 'Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?' "
Jonah,1,9,"And he said unto them: 'I am an Hebrew; and I fear HaShem, the G-d of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.' "
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: 'What is this that thou hast done?' For the men knew that he fled from the presence of HaShem, because he had told them. "
Jonah,1,11,"Then said they unto him: 'What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?' for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. "
Jonah,1,12,"And he said unto them: 'Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.' "
Jonah,1,13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. 
Jonah,1,14,"Wherefore they cried unto HaShem, and said: 'We beseech Thee, O HaShem, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O HaShem, hast done as it pleased Thee.' "
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. "
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared HaShem exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto HaShem, and made vows. "
Jonah,2,1,And HaShem prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. 
Jonah,2,2,Then Jonah prayed unto HaShem his G-d out of the fish's belly. 
Jonah,2,3,"And he said: I called out of mine affliction unto HaShem, and He answered me; out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, and Thou heardest my voice. "
Jonah,2,4,"For Thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me. "
Jonah,2,5,And I said: 'I am cast out from before Thine eyes'; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple. 
Jonah,2,6,"The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head. "
Jonah,2,7,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O HaShem my G-d. "
Jonah,2,8,"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered HaShem; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple. "
Jonah,2,9,They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
Jonah,2,10,But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of HaShem. 
Jonah,2,11,"And HaShem spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. "
Jonah,3,1,"And the word of HaShem came unto Jonah the second time, saying: "
Jonah,3,2,"'Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.' "
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of HaShem. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days' journey. "
Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said: 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.' "
Jonah,3,5,"And the people of Nineveh believed G-d; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. "
Jonah,3,6,"And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. "
Jonah,3,7,"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: 'Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; "
Jonah,3,8,"but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto G-d; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. "
Jonah,3,9,"Who knoweth whether G-d will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?' "
Jonah,3,10,"And G-d saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and G-d repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not. "
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. "
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed unto HaShem, and said: 'I pray Thee, O HaShem, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious G-d, and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil. "
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O HaShem, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.' "
Jonah,4,4,And HaShem said: 'Art thou greatly angry?' 
Jonah,4,5,"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. "
Jonah,4,6,"And HaShem G-d prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. "
Jonah,4,7,"But G-d prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. "
Jonah,4,8,"And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that G-d prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: 'It is better for me to die than to live.' "
Jonah,4,9,"And G-d said to Jonah: 'Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?' And he said: 'I am greatly angry, even unto death.' "
Jonah,4,10,"And HaShem said: 'Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night; "
Jonah,4,11,"and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?'  "
Micah,1,1,"THE WORD of HaShem that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. "
Micah,1,2,"Hear, ye peoples, all of you; Hearken, O earth, and all that therein is; and let the L-rd GOD be witness against you, the L-rd from His holy temple. "
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, HaShem cometh forth out of His place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. "
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains shall be molten under Him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place. "
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? "
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof. "
Micah,1,7,"And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return. "
Micah,1,8,"For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the ostriches. "
Micah,1,9,"For her wound is incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. "
Micah,1,10,"Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all; at Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust. "
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Saphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the standing-place thereof. "
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good; because evil is come down from HaShem unto the gate of Jerusalem. 
Micah,1,13,"Bind the chariots to the swift steeds, O inhabitant of Lachish; she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel are found in thee. "
Micah,1,14,Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel. 
Micah,1,15,"I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee; the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam. "
Micah,1,16,"Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight; enlarge thy baldness as the vulture; for they are gone into captivity from thee. "
Micah,2,1,"Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they execute it, because it is in the power of their hand. "
Micah,2,2,"And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away; thus they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. "
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time. "
Micah,2,4,"In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say: 'We are utterly ruined; he changeth the portion of my people; how doth he remove it from me! Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.' "
Micah,2,5,Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of HaShem. 
Micah,2,6,"'Preach ye not', they preach; 'They shall not preach of these things, that they shall not take shame.' "
Micah,2,7,"Do I change, O house of Jacob? Is the spirit of HaShem straitened? Are these His doings? Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly? "
Micah,2,8,"But of late My people is risen up as an enemy; with the garment ye strip also the mantle from them that pass by securely, so that they are as men returning from war. "
Micah,2,9,The women of My people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away My glory for ever. 
Micah,2,10,"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of the uncleanness thereof, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. "
Micah,2,11,If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie: 'I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink'; he shall even be the preacher of this people. 
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will render them all as sheep in a fold; as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. "
Micah,2,13,"The breaker is gone up before them; they have broken forth and passed on, by the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and HaShem at the head of them. "
Micah,3,1,"And I said: Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice? "
Micah,3,2,"Who hate the good, and love the evil; who rob their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; "
Micah,3,3,"Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones; yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. "
Micah,3,4,"Then shall they cry unto HaShem, but He will not answer them; yea, He will hide His face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings. "
Micah,3,5,"Thus saith HaShem concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that cry: 'Peace', when their teeth have any thing to bite; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him: "
Micah,3,6,"Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them. "
Micah,3,7,"And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their upper lips; for there shall be no answer of G-d. "
Micah,3,8,"But I truly am full of power by the spirit of HaShem, and of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. "
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity; "
Micah,3,10,"That build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. "
Micah,3,11,"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon HaShem, and say: 'Is not HaShem in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us'? "
Micah,3,12,"Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. "
Micah,4,1,"But in the end of days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of HaShem'S house shall be established as the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it. "
Micah,4,2,"And many nations shall go and say: 'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of HaShem, and to the house of the G-d of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths'; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of HaShem from Jerusalem. "
Micah,4,3,"And He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide concerning mighty nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. "
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid; for the mouth of HaShem of hosts hath spoken. 
Micah,4,5,"For let all the peoples walk each one in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of HaShem our G-d for ever and ever. "
Micah,4,6,"In that day, saith HaShem, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven away, and her that I have afflicted; "
Micah,4,7,"And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a mighty nation; and HaShem shall reign over them in mount Zion from thenceforth even for ever. "
Micah,4,8,"And thou, Migdal-eder, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come; yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. "
Micah,4,9,"Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no King in thee, is thy Counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail? "
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon; there shalt thou be rescued; there shall HaShem redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. "
Micah,4,11,"And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say: 'Let her be defiled, and let our eye gaze upon Zion.' "
Micah,4,12,"But they know not the thoughts of HaShem, neither understand they His counsel; for He hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor. "
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples; and thou shalt devote their gain unto HaShem, and their substance unto the L-rd of the whole earth. "
Micah,4,14,"Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops; they have laid siege against us; they smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. "
Micah,5,1,"But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from ancient days. "
Micah,5,2,"Therefore will He give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth; then the residue of his brethren shall return with the children of Israel. "
Micah,5,3,"And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of HaShem, in the majesty of the name of HaShem his G-d; and they shall abide, for then shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. "
Micah,5,4,"And this shall be peace: when the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight princes among men. "
Micah,5,5,"And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with the keen-edged sword; and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border. "
Micah,5,6,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, as dew from HaShem, as showers upon the grass, that are not looked for from man, nor awaited at the hands of the sons of men. "
Micah,5,7,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver. "
Micah,5,8,"Let Thy hand be lifted up above Thine adversaries, and let all Thine enemies be cut off. "
Micah,5,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith HaShem, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots; "
Micah,5,10,"And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds; "
Micah,5,11,And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers; 
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands. 
Micah,5,13,And I will pluck up thy Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thine enemies. 
Micah,5,14,"And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations, because they hearkened not. "
Micah,6,1,"Hear ye now what HaShem saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. "
Micah,6,2,"Hear, O ye mountains, HaShem'S controversy, and ye enduring rocks, the foundations of the earth; for HaShem hath a controversy with His people, and He will plead with Israel. "
Micah,6,3,"O My people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me. "
Micah,6,4,"For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. "
Micah,6,5,"O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of HaShem. "
Micah,6,6,"'Wherewith shall I come before HaShem, and bow myself before G-d on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? "
Micah,6,7,"Will HaShem be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' "
Micah,6,8,"It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, and what HaShem doth require of thee: only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy G-d. "
Micah,6,9,"Hark! HaShem crieth unto the city--and it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name--hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. "
Micah,6,10,"Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? "
Micah,6,11,"'Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?' "
Micah,6,12,"For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. "
Micah,6,13,Therefore I also do smite thee with a grievous wound; I do make thee desolate because of thy sins. 
Micah,6,14,"Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy sickness shall be in thine inward parts; and thou shalt conceive, but shalt not bring forth; and whomsoever thou bringest forth will I give up to the sword. "
Micah,6,15,"Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink wine. "
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee an astonishment, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of My people. "
Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! for I am as the last of the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; nor first-ripe fig which my soul desireth. "
Micah,7,2,"The godly man is perished out of the earth, and the upright among men is no more; they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. "
Micah,7,3,"Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul; thus they weave it together. "
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge; the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity. "
Micah,7,5,"Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a familiar friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. "
Micah,7,6,"For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. "
Micah,7,7,"'But as for me, I will look unto HaShem; I will wait for the G-d of my salvation; my G-d will hear me. "
Micah,7,8,"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; though I am fallen, I shall arise; though I sit in darkness, HaShem is a light unto me. "
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of HaShem, because I have sinned against Him; until He plead my cause, and execute judgment for me; He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness. "
Micah,7,10,"Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her; who said unto me: Where is HaShem thy G-d? Mine eyes shall gaze upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.' "
Micah,7,11,"'The day for building thy walls, even that day, shall be far removed.' "
Micah,7,12,"There shall be a day when they shall come unto thee, from Assyria even to the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. "
Micah,7,13,"And the land shall be desolate for them that dwell therein, because of the fruit of their doings. "
Micah,7,14,"Tend Thy people with Thy staff, the flock of Thy heritage, that dwell solitarily, as a forest in the midst of the fruitful field; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. "
Micah,7,15,'As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous things.' 
Micah,7,16,"The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. "
Micah,7,17,"They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto HaShem our G-d, and shall be afraid because of Thee. "
Micah,7,18,"Who is a G-d like unto Thee, that pardoneth the iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger for ever, because He delighteth in mercy. "
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion upon us; He will subdue our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
Micah,7,20,"Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.  "
Nahum,1,1,THE BURDEN of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
Nahum,1,2,"HaShem is a jealous and avenging G-d, HaShem avengeth and is full of wrath; HaShem taketh vengeance on His adversaries, and He reserveth wrath for His enemies. "
Nahum,1,3,"HaShem is long-suffering, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty; HaShem, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, and the clouds are the dust of His feet. "
Nahum,1,4,"He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers; Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. "
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake at Him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at His presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. "
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before His indignation? And who can abide in the fierceness of His anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder before Him. "
Nahum,1,7,"HaShem is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knoweth them that take refuge in Him. "
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood He will make a full end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue His enemies. "
Nahum,1,9,What do ye devise against HaShem? He will make a full end; trouble shall not rise up the second time. 
Nahum,1,10,"For though they be like tangled thorns, and be drunken according to their drink, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. "
Nahum,1,11,"Out of thee came he forth, that deviseth evil against HaShem, that counselleth wickedness. "
Nahum,1,12,"Thus saith HaShem: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away; and though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. "
Nahum,1,13,"And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. "
Nahum,1,14,"And HaShem hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown; out of the house of thy god will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art become worthless. "
Nahum,2,1,"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that announceth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off. "
Nahum,2,2,"A maul is come up before thy face; guard the defences, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily!-- "
Nahum,2,3,"For HaShem restoreth the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine-branches.-- "
Nahum,2,4,"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet; the chariots are fire of steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are made to quiver. "
Nahum,2,5,"The chariots rush madly in the streets, they jostle one against another in the broad places; the appearance of them is like torches, they run to and fro like the lightnings. "
Nahum,2,6,"He bethinketh himself of his worthies; they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared. "
Nahum,2,7,"The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. "
Nahum,2,8,"And the queen is uncovered, she is carried away, and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. "
Nahum,2,9,"But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water; yet they flee away; 'Stand, stand'; but none looketh back. "
Nahum,2,10,"Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, rich with all precious vessels. "
Nahum,2,11,"She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and convulsion is in all loins, and the faces of them all have gathered blackness. "
Nahum,2,12,"Where is the den of the lions, which was the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? "
Nahum,2,13,"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin. "
Nahum,2,14,"Behold, I am against thee, saith HaShem of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. "
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not. 
Nahum,3,2,"Hark! the whip, and hark! the rattling of the wheels; and prancing horses, and bounding chariots; "
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman charging, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear; and a multitude of slain, and a heap of carcases; and there is no end of the corpses, and they stumble upon their corpses; "
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the multitude of the harlotries of the well-favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her harlotries, and families through her witchcrafts. "
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against thee, saith HaShem of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. "
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast detestable things upon thee, and make thee vile, and will make thee as dung. "
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say: 'Nineveh is laid waste; who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?' "
Nahum,3,8,"Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and of the sea her wall? "
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Egypt were thy strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. "
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. "
Nahum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken, thou shalt swoon; thou also shalt seek a refuge because of the enemy. "
Nahum,3,12,"All thy fortresses shall be like fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. "
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies; the fire hath devoured thy bars. "
Nahum,3,14,"Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar, lay hold of the brickmould. "
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the canker-worm; make thyself many as the canker-worm, make thyself many as the locusts. "
Nahum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven; the canker-worm spreadeth itself, and flieth away. "
Nahum,3,17,"Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the walls in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. "
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria, thy worthies are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them. "
Nahum,3,19,"There is no assuaging of thy hurt, thy wound is grievous; all that hear the report of thee clap the hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?  "
Habakkuk,1,1,THE BURDEN which Habakkuk the prophet did see. 
Habakkuk,1,2,"How long, O HaShem, shall I cry, and Thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto Thee of violence, and Thou wilt not save. "
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost Thou show me iniquity, and beholdest mischief? And why are spoiling and violence before me? so that there is strife, and contention ariseth. "
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is slacked, and right doth never go forth; for the wicked doth beset the righteous; therefore right goeth forth perverted. "
Habakkuk,1,5,"Look ye among the nations, and behold, and wonder marvellously; for, behold, a work shall be wrought in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you. "
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs. "
Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible and dreadful; their law and their majesty proceed from themselves. 
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the wolves of the desert; and their horsemen spread themselves; yea, their horsemen come from far, they fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour. "
Habakkuk,1,9,They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as the sand. 
Habakkuk,1,10,"And they scoff at kings, and princes are a derision unto them; they deride every stronghold, for they heap up earth, and take it. "
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then their spirit doth pass over and transgress, and they become guilty: even they who impute their might unto their god. "
Habakkuk,1,12,"Art not Thou from everlasting, O HaShem my G-d, my Holy One? we shall not die. O HaShem, Thou hast ordained them for judgment, and Thou, O Rock, hast established them for correction. "
Habakkuk,1,13,"Thou that art of eyes too pure to behold evil, and that canst not look on mischief, wherefore lookest Thou, when they deal treacherously, and holdest Thy peace, when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; "
Habakkuk,1,14,"And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? "
Habakkuk,1,15,"They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag; therefore they rejoice and exult. "
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and offer unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plenteous. "
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare to slay the nations continually? "
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look out to see what He will speak by me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. "
Habakkuk,2,2,"And HaShem answered me, and said: 'Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that a man may read it swiftly. "
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it declareth of the end, and doth not lie; though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.' "
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith. "
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer; the haughty man abideth not; he who enlargeth his desire as the nether-world, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples. "
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting riddle against him, and say: 'Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges!' "
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact interest of thee, and awake that shall violently shake thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? "
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. "
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him that gaineth evil gains for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! "
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast forfeited thy life. "
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. "
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! "
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not of HaShem of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity? "
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of HaShem, as the waters cover the sea. "
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy venom thereto, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! "
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled with shame instead of glory, drink thou also, and be uncovered; the cup of HaShem'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and filthiness shall be upon thy glory. "
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. "
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it, even the molten image, and the teacher of lies; that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? "
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood: 'Awake', to the dumb stone: 'Arise!' Can this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. "
Habakkuk,2,20,But HaShem is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him. 
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. Upon Shigionoth. 
Habakkuk,3,2,"O HaShem, I have heard the report of Thee, and am afraid; O HaShem, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember compassion. "
Habakkuk,3,3,"G-d cometh from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise. "
Habakkuk,3,4,And a brightness appeareth as the light; rays hath He at His side; and there is the hiding of His power. 
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him goeth the pestilence, and fiery bolts go forth at His feet. "
Habakkuk,3,6,"He standeth, and shaketh the earth, He beholdeth, and maketh the nations to tremble; and the everlasting mountains are dashed in pieces, the ancient hills do bow; His goings are as of old. "
Habakkuk,3,7,I see the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian do tremble. 
Habakkuk,3,8,"Is it, O HaShem, that against the rivers, is it that Thine anger is kindled against the rivers, or Thy wrath against the sea? that Thou dost ride upon Thy horses, upon Thy chariots of victory? "
Habakkuk,3,9,Thy bow is made quite bare; sworn are the rods of the word. Selah. Thou dost cleave the earth with rivers. 
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains have seen Thee, and they tremble; the tempest of waters floweth over; the deep uttereth its voice, and lifteth up its hands on high. "
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stand still in their habitation; at the light of Thine arrows as they go, at the shining of Thy glittering spear. "
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou marchest through the earth in indignation, Thou threshest the nations in anger. "
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou art come forth for the deliverance of Thy people, for the deliverance of Thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked, uncovering the foundation even unto the neck. Selah. "
Habakkuk,3,14,"Thou hast stricken through with his own rods the head of his rulers, that come as a whirlwind to scatter me; whose rejoicing is as to devour the poor secretly. "
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses, the foaming of mighty waters. "
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard, mine inward parts trembled, my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble where I stand; that I should wait for the day of trouble, when he cometh up against the people that he invadeth. "
Habakkuk,3,17,"For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; "
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice in HaShem, I will exult in the G-d of my salvation. "
Habakkuk,3,19,"G-d, the L-rd, is my strength, and He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and He maketh me to walk upon my high places. For the Leader. With my string-music.  "
Zephaniah,1,1,"THE WORD of HaShem which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. "
Zephaniah,1,2,"I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the earth, saith HaShem. "
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will consume man and beast, I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the earth, saith HaShem. "
Zephaniah,1,4,"And I will stretch out My hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the idolatrous priests with the priests; "
Zephaniah,1,5,"And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to HaShem and swear by Malcam; "
Zephaniah,1,6,"Them also that are turned back from following HaShem; and those that have not sought HaShem, nor inquired after Him. "
Zephaniah,1,7,"Hold thy peace at the presence of the L-rd GOD; for the day of HaShem is at hand, for HaShem hath prepared a sacrifice, He hath consecrated His guests. "
Zephaniah,1,8,"And it shall come to pass in the day of HaShem'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel. "
Zephaniah,1,9,"In the same day also will I punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master's house with violence and deceit. "
Zephaniah,1,10,"And in that day, saith HaShem, Hark! a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. "
Zephaniah,1,11,"Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off. "
Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart: 'The HaShem will not do good, neither will He do evil.' "
Zephaniah,1,13,"Therefore their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation; yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof. "
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of HaShem is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of HaShem, wherein the mighty man crieth bitterly. "
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, "
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day of the horn and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high towers. "
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against HaShem; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung. "
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of HaShem'S wrath; but the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy; for He will make and end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the earth. "
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O shameless nation; "
Zephaniah,2,2,"Before the decree bring forth the day when one passeth as the chaff, before the fierce anger of HaShem come upon you, before the day of HaShem'S anger come upon you. "
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek ye HaShem, all ye humble of the earth, that have executed His ordinance; seek righteousness, seek humility. It may be ye shall be hid in the day of HaShem'S anger. "
Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. "
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of HaShem is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. "
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea-coast shall be pastures, even meadows for shepherds, and folds for flocks. "
Zephaniah,2,7,"And it shall be a portion for the remnant of the house of Judah, whereon they shall feed; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for HaShem their G-d will remember them, and turn their captivity. "
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the taunt of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have taunted My people, and spoken boastfully concerning their border. "
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore as I live, saith HaShem of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding-place of nettles, and saltpits, and a desolation, for ever; the residue of My people shall spoil them, and the remnant of My nation shall inherit them. "
Zephaniah,2,10,"This shall they have for their pride, because they have taunted and spoken boastfully against the people of HaShem of hosts. "
Zephaniah,2,11,"HaShem will be terrible unto them; for He will famish all the gods of the earth; then shall all the isles of the nations worship Him, every one from its place. "
Zephaniah,2,12,"Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by My sword. "
Zephaniah,2,13,"And He will stretch out His hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness. "
Zephaniah,2,14,And all beasts of every kind shall lie down in the midst of her in herds; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the capitals thereof; voices shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the posts; for the cedar-work thereof shall be uncovered. 
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the joyous city that dwelt without care, that said in her heart: 'I am, and there is none else beside me'; how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand. "
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! "
Zephaniah,3,2,"She hearkened not the voice, she received not correction; she trusted not in HaShem, she drew not near to her G-d. "
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the desert, they leave not a bone for the morrow. "
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are wanton and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned that which is holy, they have done violence to the law. "
Zephaniah,3,5,"HaShem who is righteous is in the midst of her, He will not do unrighteousness; every morning doth He bring His right to light, it faileth not; but the unrighteous knoweth no shame. "
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off nations, their corners are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. "
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said: 'Surely thou wilt fear Me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, despite all that I have visited upon her'; but they betimes corrupted all their doings. "
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye for Me, saith HaShem, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for My determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them Mine indignation, even all My fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy. "
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of HaShem, to serve Him with one consent. "
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall they bring My suppliants, even the daughter of My dispersed, as Mine offering. "
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against Me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in My holy mountain. "
Zephaniah,3,12,"And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of HaShem. "
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. "
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion, shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. "
Zephaniah,3,15,"HaShem hath taken away thy judgments, He hath cast out thine enemy; The King of Israel, even HaShem, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more. "
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: 'Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack. "
Zephaniah,3,17,"HaShem thy G-d is in the midst of thee, a Mighty One who will save; He will rejoice over thee with joy, He will be silent in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.' "
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather them that are far from the appointed season, who are of thee, that hast borne the burden of reproach. "
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that is lame, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them to be a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. "
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you to be a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I turn your captivity before your eyes, saith HaShem.  "
Haggai,1,1,"IN THE second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of HaShem by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying: "
Haggai,1,2,"'Thus speaketh HaShem of hosts, saying: This people say: The time is not come, the time that HaShem'S house should be built.' "
Haggai,1,3,"Then came the word of HaShem by Haggai the prophet, saying: "
Haggai,1,4,"'Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your cieled houses, while this house lieth waste? "
Haggai,1,5,Now therefore thus saith HaShem of hosts: Consider your ways. 
Haggai,1,6,"Ye have sown much, and brought in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough, ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink, ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes. "
Haggai,1,7,Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Consider your ways. 
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the hill-country, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith HaShem. "
Haggai,1,9,"Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith HaShem of hosts. Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house. "
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore over you the heaven hath kept back, so that there is no dew, and the earth hath kept back her produce. "
Haggai,1,11,"And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.' "
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of HaShem their G-d, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as HaShem their G-d had sent him; and the people did fear before HaShem. "
Haggai,1,13,"Then spoke Haggai HaShem'S messenger in HaShem'S message unto the people, saying: 'I am with you, saith HaShem.' "
Haggai,1,14,"And HaShem stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of HaShem of hosts, their G-d, "
Haggai,1,15,"in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. "
Haggai,2,1,"In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of HaShem by Haggai the prophet, saying: "
Haggai,2,2,"'Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying: "
Haggai,2,3,Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is not such a one as nothing in your eyes? 
Haggai,2,4,"Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith HaShem; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith HaShem, and work; for I am with you, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Haggai,2,5,"The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt have I established, and My spirit abideth among you; fear ye not. "
Haggai,2,6,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; "
Haggai,2,7,"and I will shake all nations, and the choicest things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Haggai,2,8,"Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Haggai,2,9,"The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, saith HaShem of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith HaShem of hosts.' "
Haggai,2,10,"In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of HaShem by Haggai the prophet, saying: "
Haggai,2,11,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Ask now the priests for instruction, saying: "
Haggai,2,12,"If one bear hallowed flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy?' And the priests answered and said: 'No.' "
Haggai,2,13,"Then said Haggai: 'If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?' And the priests answered and said: 'It shall be unclean.' "
Haggai,2,14,"Then answered Haggai, and said: 'So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith HaShem; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. "
Haggai,2,15,"And now, I pray you, consider from this day and forward--before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of HaShem, "
Haggai,2,16,"through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty; "
Haggai,2,17,"I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye turned not to Me, saith HaShem-- "
Haggai,2,18,"consider, I pray you, from this day and forward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of HaShem'S temple was laid, consider it; "
Haggai,2,19,"is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree hath not brought forth--from this day will I bless you.' "
Haggai,2,20,"And the word of HaShem came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying: "
Haggai,2,21,"'Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying: I will shake the heavens and the earth; "
Haggai,2,22,"and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. "
Haggai,2,23,"In that day, saith HaShem of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith HaShem, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith HaShem of hosts.'  "
Zechariah,1,1,"IN THE eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of HaShem unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: "
Zechariah,1,2,'The HaShem hath been sore displeased with your fathers. 
Zechariah,1,3,"Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Return unto Me, saith HaShem of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Zechariah,1,4,"Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor attend unto Me, saith HaShem. "
Zechariah,1,5,"Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? "
Zechariah,1,6,"But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? so that they turned and said: Like as HaShem of hosts purposed to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath He dealt with us.' "
Zechariah,1,7,"Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of HaShem unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying-- "
Zechariah,1,8,"I saw in the night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. "
Zechariah,1,9,"Then said I: 'O my lord, what are these?' And the angel that spoke with me said unto me: 'I will show thee what these are.' "
Zechariah,1,10,And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said: 'These are they whom HaShem hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.' 
Zechariah,1,11,"And they answered the angel of HaShem that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said: 'We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.' "
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of HaShem spoke and said: 'O HaShem of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which Thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? "
Zechariah,1,13,"And HaShem answered the angel that spoke with me with good words, even comforting words-- "
Zechariah,1,14,"so the angel that spoke with me said unto me: 'Proclaim thou, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy; "
Zechariah,1,15,"and I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped for evil. "
Zechariah,1,16,"Therefore thus saith HaShem: I return to Jerusalem with compassions: My house shall be built in it, saith HaShem of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem. "
Zechariah,1,17,"Again, proclaim, saying: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; and HaShem shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.' "
Zechariah,2,1,"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. "
Zechariah,2,2,"And I said unto the angel that spoke with me: 'What are these?' And he said unto me: 'These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.' "
Zechariah,2,3,And HaShem showed me four craftsmen. 
Zechariah,2,4,"Then said I: 'What come these to do?' And he spoke, saying: 'These--the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head--these then are come to frighten them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.' "
Zechariah,2,5,"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. "
Zechariah,2,6,"Then said I: 'Whither goest thou?' And he said unto me: 'To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.' "
Zechariah,2,7,"And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, "
Zechariah,2,8,"and said unto him: 'Run, speak to this young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein. "
Zechariah,2,9,"For I, saith HaShem, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. "
Zechariah,2,10,"Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith HaShem; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith HaShem. "
Zechariah,2,11,"Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.' "
Zechariah,2,12,"For thus saith HaShem of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: 'Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. "
Zechariah,2,13,"For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them'; and ye shall know that HaShem of hosts hath sent me. "
Zechariah,2,14,"'Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith HaShem. "
Zechariah,2,15,"And many nations shall join themselves to HaShem in that day, and shall be My people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee'; and thou shalt know that HaShem of hosts hath sent me unto thee. "
Zechariah,2,16,"And HaShem shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. "
Zechariah,2,17,"Be silent, all flesh, before HaShem; for He is aroused out of His holy habitation. "
Zechariah,3,1,"And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of HaShem, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. "
Zechariah,3,2,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'The HaShem rebuke thee, O Satan, yea, HaShem that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?' "
Zechariah,3,3,"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. "
Zechariah,3,4,"And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying: 'Take the filthy garments from off him.' And unto him he said: 'Behold, I cause thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with robes.' "
Zechariah,3,5,"And I said: 'Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.' So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of HaShem stood by. "
Zechariah,3,6,"And the angel of HaShem forewarned Joshua, saying: "
Zechariah,3,7,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts: If thou wilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, and wilt also judge My house, and wilt also keep My courts, then I will give thee free access among these that stand by. "
Zechariah,3,8,"Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign; for, behold, I will bring forth My servant the Shoot. "
Zechariah,3,9,"For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone are seven facets; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith HaShem of hosts: And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. "
Zechariah,3,10,"In that day, saith HaShem of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree. "
Zechariah,4,1,"And the angel that spoke with me returned, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. "
Zechariah,4,2,"And he said unto me: 'What seest thou?' And I said: 'I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes, yea, seven, to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof; "
Zechariah,4,3,"and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.' "
Zechariah,4,4,"And I answered and spoke to the angel that spoke with me, saying: 'What are these, my lord?' "
Zechariah,4,5,"Then the angel that spoke with me answered and said unto me: 'Knowest thou not what these are?' And I said: 'No, my lord.' "
Zechariah,4,6,"Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying: 'This is the word of HaShem unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Zechariah,4,7,"Who art thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel? thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.' "
Zechariah,4,8,"Moreover the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Zechariah,4,9,'The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that HaShem of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
Zechariah,4,10,"For who hath despised the day of small things? even they shall see with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, even these seven, which are the eyes of HaShem, that run to and fro through the whole earth.' "
Zechariah,4,11,"Then answered I, and said unto him: 'What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?' "
Zechariah,4,12,"And I answered the second time, and said unto him: 'What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?' "
Zechariah,4,13,"And he answered me and said: 'Knowest thou not what these are?' And I said: 'No, my lord.' "
Zechariah,4,14,"Then said he: 'These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the L-rd of the whole earth.' "
Zechariah,5,1,"Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a flying roll. "
Zechariah,5,2,"And he said unto me: 'What seest thou?' And I answered: 'I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.' "
Zechariah,5,3,Then said he unto me: 'This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land; for every one that stealeth shall be swept away on the one side like it; and every one that sweareth shall be swept away on the other side like it. 
Zechariah,5,4,"I cause it to go forth, saith HaShem of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.' "
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel that spoke with me went forth, and said unto me: 'Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.' "
Zechariah,5,6,And I said: 'What is it?' And he said: 'This is the measure that goeth forth.' He said moreover: 'This is their eye in all the land-- 
Zechariah,5,7,"and, behold, there was lifted up a round piece of lead--and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the measure.' "
Zechariah,5,8,"And he said: 'This is Wickedness.' And he cast her down into the midst of the measure, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. "
Zechariah,5,9,"Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven. "
Zechariah,5,10,Then said I to the angel that spoke with me: 'Whither do these bear the measure?' 
Zechariah,5,11,"And he said unto me: 'To build her a house in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place. "
Zechariah,6,1,"And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between the two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. "
Zechariah,6,2,In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
Zechariah,6,3,and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled bay horses. 
Zechariah,6,4,"Then I answered and said unto the angel that spoke with me: 'What are these, my lord?' "
Zechariah,6,5,"And the angel answered and said unto me: 'These chariots go forth to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the L-rd of all the earth. "
Zechariah,6,6,That wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country; 
Zechariah,6,7,"and the bay went forth'. And they sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth; and he said: 'Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth.' So they walked to and fro through the earth. "
Zechariah,6,8,"Then cried he upon me, and spoke unto me, saying: 'Behold, they that go toward the north country have eased My spirit in the north country.' "
Zechariah,6,9,"And the word of HaShem came unto me, saying: "
Zechariah,6,10,"'Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, that are come from Babylon; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; "
Zechariah,6,11,"yea, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set the one upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; "
Zechariah,6,12,"and speak unto him, saying: Thus speaketh HaShem of hosts, saying: Behold, a man whose name is the Shoot, and who shall shoot up out of his place, and build the temple of HaShem; "
Zechariah,6,13,"even he shall build the temple of HaShem; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and there shall be a priest before his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. "
Zechariah,6,14,"And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of HaShem. "
Zechariah,6,15,"And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of HaShem, and ye shall know that HaShem of hosts hath sent me unto you. And it shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of HaShem your G-d--.' "
Zechariah,7,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of HaShem came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev; "
Zechariah,7,2,"When Bethel-sarezer, and Regem-melech and his men, had sent to entreat the favour of HaShem, "
Zechariah,7,3,"and to speak unto the priests of the house of HaShem of hosts, and to the prophets, saying: 'Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?' "
Zechariah,7,4,"Then came the word of HaShem of hosts unto me, saying: "
Zechariah,7,5,"'Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto Me, even to Me? "
Zechariah,7,6,"And when ye eat, and when ye did drink, are ye not they that eat, and they that drink? "
Zechariah,7,7,"Should ye not hearken to the words which HaShem hath proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the Lowland were inhabited?' "
Zechariah,7,8,"And the word of HaShem came unto Zechariah, saying: "
Zechariah,7,9,"'Thus hath HaShem of hosts spoken, saying: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother; "
Zechariah,7,10,"and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart. "
Zechariah,7,11,"But they refused to attend, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear. "
Zechariah,7,12,"Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which HaShem of hosts had sent by His spirit by the hand of the former prophets; therefore came there great wrath from HaShem of hosts. "
Zechariah,7,13,"And it came to pass that, as He called, and they would not hear; so they shall call, and I will not hear, said HaShem of hosts; "
Zechariah,7,14,"but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the pleasant land desolate.' "
Zechariah,8,1,"And the word of HaShem of hosts came, saying: "
Zechariah,8,2,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great fury. "
Zechariah,8,3,"Thus saith HaShem: I return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of HaShem of hosts The holy mountain. "
Zechariah,8,4,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age. "
Zechariah,8,5,And the broad places of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the broad places thereof. 
Zechariah,8,6,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in Mine eyes? saith HaShem of hosts. "
Zechariah,8,7,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the east country, and from the west country; "
Zechariah,8,8,"And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their G-d, in truth and in righteousness. "
Zechariah,8,9,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of HaShem of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built. "
Zechariah,8,10,"For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the adversary; for I set all men every one against his neighbour. "
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Zechariah,8,12,"For as the seed of peace, the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. "
Zechariah,8,13,"And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing; fear not, but let your hands be strong. "
Zechariah,8,14,"For thus saith HaShem of host: As I purposed to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked Me, saith HaShem of hosts, and I repented not; "
Zechariah,8,15,so again do I purpose in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear ye not. 
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; 
Zechariah,8,17,"and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate, saith HaShem.' "
Zechariah,8,18,"And the word of HaShem of hosts came unto me, saying: "
Zechariah,8,19,"'Thus saith HaShem of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful seasons; therefore love ye truth and peace. "
Zechariah,8,20,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities; "
Zechariah,8,21,"and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying: Let us go speedily to entreat the favour of HaShem, and to seek HaShem of hosts; I will go also. "
Zechariah,8,22,"Yea, many peoples and mighty nations shall come to seek HaShem of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favour of HaShem. "
Zechariah,8,23,"Thus saith HaShem of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you, for we have heard that G-d is with you.' "
Zechariah,9,1,"The burden of the word of HaShem. In the land of Hadrach, and in Damascus shall be His resting-place; for HaShem'S is the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel. "
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamath also shall border thereon; Tyre and Zidon, for she is very wise. "
Zechariah,9,3,"And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. "
Zechariah,9,4,"Behold, the L-rd will impoverish her, and He will smite her power into the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. "
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be sore pained, and Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. "
Zechariah,9,6,"And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. "
Zechariah,9,7,"And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth, and he also shall be a remnant for our G-d; and he shall be as a chief in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. "
Zechariah,9,8,"And I will encamp about My house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more; for now have I seen with Mine eyes. "
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy king cometh unto thee, he is triumphant, and victorious, lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. "
Zechariah,9,10,"And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. "
Zechariah,9,11,"As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. "
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee. "
Zechariah,9,13,"For I bend Judah for Me, I fill the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. "
Zechariah,9,14,"And HaShem shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the L-rd GOD will blow the horn, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. "
Zechariah,9,15,"HaShem of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar. "
Zechariah,9,16,"And HaShem their G-d shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, glittering over His land. "
Zechariah,9,17,"For how great is their goodness, and how great is their beauty! Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maids. "
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask ye of HaShem rain in the time of the latter rain, even of HaShem that maketh lightnings; and He will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. "
Zechariah,10,2,"For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreams speak falsely, they comfort in vain; therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. "
Zechariah,10,3,"Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for HaShem of hosts hath remembered His flock the house of Judah, and maketh them as His majestic horse in the battle. "
Zechariah,10,4,"Out of them shall come forth the corner-stone, out of them the stake, out of them the battle bow, out of them every master together. "
Zechariah,10,5,"And they shall be as mighty men, treading down in the mire of the streets in the battle, and they shall fight, because HaShem is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded. "
Zechariah,10,6,"And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back, for I have compassion upon them, and they shall be as though I had not cast them off; for I am HaShem their G-d, and I will hear them. "
Zechariah,10,7,"And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice, their heart shall be glad in HaShem. "
Zechariah,10,8,"I will hiss for them, and gather them, for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased. "
Zechariah,10,9,"And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return. "
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them back also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not suffice them. "
Zechariah,10,11,"And over the sea affliction shall pass, and the waves shall be smitten in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. "
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will strengthen them in HaShem; and they shall walk up and down in His name, saith HaShem. "
Zechariah,11,1,"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. "
Zechariah,11,2,"Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the glorious ones are spoiled; wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down. "
Zechariah,11,3,"Hark! the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is spoiled; Hark! the roaring of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are spoiled. "
Zechariah,11,4,Thus said HaShem my G-d: 'Feed the flock of slaughter; 
Zechariah,11,5,"whose buyers slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say: Blessed be HaShem, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not. "
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith HaShem; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.' "
Zechariah,11,7,"So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders; and I fed the flock. "
Zechariah,11,8,"And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; 'for My soul became impatient of them, and their soul also loathed Me.' "
Zechariah,11,9,"Then said I: 'I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.' "
Zechariah,11,10,"And I took my staff Graciousness, and cut it asunder, 'that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.' "
Zechariah,11,11,And it was broken in that day; and the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew of a truth that it was the word of HaShem. 
Zechariah,11,12,"And I said unto them: 'If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear.' So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver. "
Zechariah,11,13,"And HaShem said unto me: 'Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price that I was prized at of them.' And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the treasury, in the house of HaShem. "
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Binders, that the brotherhood between Judah and Israel might be broken. "
Zechariah,11,15,And HaShem said unto me: 'Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 
Zechariah,11,16,"For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not think of those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are young, nor heal that which is broken; neither will he feed that which standeth still, but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and will break their hoofs in pieces.' "
Zechariah,11,17,"Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. "
Zechariah,12,1,"The burden of the word of HaShem concerning Israel. The saying of HaShem, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him: "
Zechariah,12,2,"Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of staggering unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it fall to be in the siege against Jerusalem. "
Zechariah,12,3,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it. "
Zechariah,12,4,"In that day, saith HaShem, I will smite every horse with bewilderment, and his rider with madness; and I will open Mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness. "
Zechariah,12,5,And the chiefs of Judah shall say in their heart: 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength through HaShem of hosts their G-d.' 
Zechariah,12,6,"In that day will I make the chiefs of Judah like a pan of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. "
Zechariah,12,7,"HaShem also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah. "
Zechariah,12,8,"In that day shall HaShem defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that stumbleth among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as a godlike being, as the angel of HaShem before them. "
Zechariah,12,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. "
Zechariah,12,10,"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto Me because they have thrust him through; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. "
Zechariah,12,11,"In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. "
Zechariah,12,12,"And the land shall mourn, every family apart: the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; "
Zechariah,12,13,"The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart; "
Zechariah,12,14,"All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.  "
Zechariah,13,1,"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for purification and for sprinkling. "
Zechariah,13,2,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith HaShem of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. "
Zechariah,13,3,"And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begot him shall say unto him: 'Thou shalt not live, for thou speakest lies in the name of HaShem'; and his father and his mother that begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. "
Zechariah,13,4,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be brought to shame every one through his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive; "
Zechariah,13,5,"but he shall say: 'I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.' "
Zechariah,13,6,And one shall say unto him: 'What are these wounds between thy hands?' Then he shall answer: 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.' 
Zechariah,13,7,"Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is near unto Me, saith HaShem of hosts; smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn My hand upon the little ones. "
Zechariah,13,8,"And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith HaShem, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. "
Zechariah,13,9,"And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on My name, and I will answer them; I will say: 'It is My people', and they shall say: 'The HaShem is my G-d.' "
Zechariah,14,1,"Behold, a day of HaShem cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. "
Zechariah,14,2,"For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. "
Zechariah,14,3,"Then shall HaShem go forth, and fight against those nations, as when He fighteth in the day of battle. "
Zechariah,14,4,"And His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, so that there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. "
Zechariah,14,5,"And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and HaShem my G-d shall come, and all the holy ones with Thee. "
Zechariah,14,6,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light, but heavy clouds and thick; "
Zechariah,14,7,"And there shall be one day which shall be known as HaShem'S, not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light. "
Zechariah,14,8,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter shall it be. "
Zechariah,14,9,"And HaShem shall be King over all the earth; in that day shall HaShem be One, and His name one. "
Zechariah,14,10,"All the land shall be turned as the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto the king's winepresses. "
Zechariah,14,11,"And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more extermination; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely. "
Zechariah,14,12,"And this shall be the plague wherewith HaShem will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. "
Zechariah,14,13,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from HaShem shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. "
Zechariah,14,14,"And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. "
Zechariah,14,15,"And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as this plague. "
Zechariah,14,16,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, HaShem of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. "
Zechariah,14,17,"And it shall be, that whoso of the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, HaShem of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain. "
Zechariah,14,18,"And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, they shall have no overflow; there shall be the plague, wherewith HaShem will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. "
Zechariah,14,19,"This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. "
Zechariah,14,20,In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses: HOLY UNTO THE HaShem; and the pots in HaShem'S house shall be like the basins before the altar. 
Zechariah,14,21,"Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto HaShem of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein; and in that day there shall be no more a trafficker in the house of HaShem of hosts.  "
Malachi,1,1,THE BURDEN of the word of HaShem to Israel by Malachi. 
Malachi,1,2,"I have loved you, saith HaShem. Yet ye say: 'Wherein hast Thou loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith HaShem; yet I loved Jacob; "
Malachi,1,3,"But Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. "
Malachi,1,4,"Whereas Edom saith: 'We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places'; thus saith HaShem of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The border of wickedness, and The people whom HaShem execrateth for ever. "
Malachi,1,5,"And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say: 'The HaShem is great beyond the border of Israel.' "
Malachi,1,6,"A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then I be a father, where is My honour? and if I be a master, where is My fear? saith HaShem of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise My name. And ye say: 'Wherein have we despised Thy name?' "
Malachi,1,7,Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar. And ye say: 'Wherein have we polluted thee?' In that ye say: 'The table of HaShem is contemptible.' 
Malachi,1,8,"And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it no evil! And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,1,9,"And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of G-d that He may be gracious unto us! --this hath been of your doing. --will He accept any of your persons? saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,1,10,"Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith HaShem of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. "
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings are presented unto My name, even pure oblations; for My name is great among the nations, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,1,12,"But ye profane it, in that ye say: 'The table of HaShem is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.' "
Malachi,1,13,"Ye say also: 'Behold, what a weariness is it!' and ye have snuffed at it, saith HaShem of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering; should I accept this of your hand? saith HaShem. "
Malachi,1,14,"But cursed be he that dealeth craftily, whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the L-rd a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith HaShem of hosts, and My name is feared among the nations. "
Malachi,2,1,"And now, this commandment is for you, O ye priests. "
Malachi,2,2,"If ye will not hearken, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto My name, saith HaShem of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I curse them, because ye do not lay it to heart. "
Malachi,2,3,"Behold, I will rebuke the seed for your hurt, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your sacrifices; and ye shall be taken away unto it. "
Malachi,2,4,"Know then that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant might be with Levi, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,2,5,"My covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, and of fear, and he feared Me, and was afraid of My name. "
Malachi,2,6,"The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity. "
Malachi,2,7,"For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,2,8,"But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,2,9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept My ways, but have had respect of persons in the law. "
Malachi,2,10,"Have we not all one father? Hath not one G-d created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? "
Malachi,2,11,"Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of HaShem which He loveth, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. "
Malachi,2,12,"May HaShem cut off to the man that doeth this, him that calleth and him that answereth out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,2,13,"And this further ye do: ye cover the altar of HaShem with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that He regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand. "
Malachi,2,14,"Yet ye say: 'Wherefore?' Because HaShem hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. "
Malachi,2,15,"And not one hath done so who had exuberance of spirit! For what seeketh the one? a seed given of G-d. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. "
Malachi,2,16,"For I hate putting away, saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith HaShem of hosts; therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. "
Malachi,2,17,"Ye have wearied HaShem with your words. Yet ye say: 'Wherein have we wearied Him?' In that ye say: 'Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of HaShem, and He delighteth in them; or where is the G-d of justice?' "
Malachi,3,1,"Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall clear the way before Me; and the L-rd, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to His temple, and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he cometh, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,3,2,"But who may abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap; "
Malachi,3,3,"And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and there shall be they that shall offer unto HaShem offerings in righteousness. "
Malachi,3,4,"Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto HaShem, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. "
Malachi,3,5,"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers; and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not Me, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,3,6,"For I HaShem change not; and ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. "
Malachi,3,7,"From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from Mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith HaShem of hosts. But ye say: 'Wherein shall we return?' "
Malachi,3,8,Will a man rob G-d? Yet ye rob Me. But ye say: 'Wherein have we robbed Thee?' In tithes and heave-offerings. 
Malachi,3,9,"Ye are cursed with the curse, yet ye rob Me, even this whole nation. "
Malachi,3,10,"Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in My house, and try Me now herewith, saith HaShem of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall be more than sufficiency. "
Malachi,3,11,"And I will rebuke the devourer for your good, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your land; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,3,12,"And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith HaShem of hosts. "
Malachi,3,13,"Your words have been all too strong against Me, saith HaShem. Yet ye say: 'Wherein have we spoken against thee?' "
Malachi,3,14,"Ye have said: 'It is vain to serve G-d; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked mournfully because of HaShem of hosts? "
Malachi,3,15,"And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they try G-d, and are delivered.' "
Malachi,3,16,"Then they that feared HaShem spoke one with another; and HaShem hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that feared HaShem, and that thought upon His name. "
Malachi,3,17,"And they shall be Mine, saith HaShem of hosts, in the day that I do make, even Mine own treasure; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. "
Malachi,3,18,"Then shall ye again discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth G-d and him that serveth Him not.  "

Psalms,1,1,"HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful. "
Psalms,1,2,But his delight is in the law of HaShem; and in His law doth he meditate day and night. 
Psalms,1,3,"And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper. "
Psalms,1,4,Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
Psalms,1,5,"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. "
Psalms,1,6,For HaShem regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish. 
Psalms,2,1,Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples mutter in vain? 
Psalms,2,2,"The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, against HaShem, and against His anointed: "

Psalms,2,7,"I will tell of the decree: HaShem said unto me: 'Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee. "

Psalms,77,6,"I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times. "
Psalms,77,7,In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search: 
Psalms,77,8,'Will the L-rd cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more? 
Psalms,77,9,Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore? 
Psalms,77,10,Hath G-d forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?' Selah 
Psalms,77,11,"And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change. "

Psalms,78,1,"Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. "
Psalms,78,2,I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old; 
Psalms,78,3,"That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us, "
Psalms,78,4,"We will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of HaShem, and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done. "
Psalms,78,5,"For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; "
Psalms,78,6,"That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children, "
Psalms,78,7,"That they might put their confidence in G-d, and not forget the works of G-d, but keep His commandments; "
Psalms,78,8,"And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with G-d. "
Psalms,78,9,"The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle. "
Psalms,78,10,"They kept not the covenant of G-d, and refused to walk in His law; "
Psalms,78,11,"And they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them. "
Psalms,78,12,"Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. "
Psalms,78,13,"He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap. "
Psalms,78,14,"By day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. "
Psalms,78,15,"He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep. "
Psalms,78,16,"He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. "
Psalms,78,17,"Yet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert. "
Psalms,78,18,And they tried G-d in their heart by asking food for their craving. 
Psalms,78,19,"Yea, they spoke against G-d; they said: 'Can G-d prepare a table in the wilderness? "
Psalms,78,20,"Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?' "
Psalms,78,21,"Therefore HaShem heard, and was wroth; and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel; "
Psalms,78,22,"Because they believed not in G-d, and trusted not in His salvation. "
Psalms,78,23,"And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; "
Psalms,78,24,"And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven. "
Psalms,78,25,Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full. 
Psalms,78,26,He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind. 
Psalms,78,27,"He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas; "
Psalms,78,28,"And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings. "
Psalms,78,29,"So they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved. "
Psalms,78,30,"They were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths, "
Psalms,78,31,"When the anger of G-d went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, and smote down the young men of Israel. "
Psalms,78,32,"For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works. "
Psalms,78,33,"Therefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror. "
Psalms,78,34,"When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek G-d earnestly. "
Psalms,78,35,"And they remembered that G-d was their Rock, and the Most High G-d their redeemer. "
Psalms,78,36,"But they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue. "
Psalms,78,37,"For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant. "
Psalms,78,38,"But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath. "
Psalms,78,39,"So He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. "
Psalms,78,40,"How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert! "
Psalms,78,41,"And still again they tried G-d, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel. "
Psalms,78,42,"They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary. "
Psalms,78,43,"How He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan; "
Psalms,78,44,"And turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams. "
Psalms,78,45,"He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. "
Psalms,78,46,"He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust. "
Psalms,78,47,"He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost. "
Psalms,78,48,"He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts. "
Psalms,78,49,"He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil. "
Psalms,78,50,"He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; "
Psalms,78,51,"And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; "
Psalms,78,52,"But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. "
Psalms,78,53,"And He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. "
Psalms,78,54,"And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten. "
Psalms,78,55,"He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. "
Psalms,78,56,"Yet they tried and provoked G-d, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies; "
Psalms,78,57,"But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. "
Psalms,78,58,"For they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images. "
Psalms,78,59,"G-d heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel; "
Psalms,78,60,"And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men; "
Psalms,78,61,"And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary's hand. "
Psalms,78,62,He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance. 
Psalms,78,63,Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song. 
Psalms,78,64,Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
Psalms,78,65,"Then the L-rd awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine. "
Psalms,78,66,And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach. 
Psalms,78,67,"Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; "
Psalms,78,68,"But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved. "
Psalms,78,69,"And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever. "
Psalms,78,70,"He chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds; "
Psalms,78,71,"From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance. "
Psalms,78,72,So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands. 
Psalms,79,1,"A Psalm of Asaph. O G-d, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple; they have made Jerusalem into heaps. "
Psalms,79,2,"They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. "
Psalms,79,3,"They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them. "
Psalms,79,4,"We are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. "
Psalms,79,5,"How long, O HaShem, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire? "
Psalms,79,6,"Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name. "
Psalms,79,7,"For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation. "
Psalms,79,8,Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low. 
Psalms,79,9,"Help us, O G-d of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake. "
Psalms,79,10,Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their G-d?' Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight. 
Psalms,79,11,Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death; 
Psalms,79,12,"And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O L-rd. "
Psalms,79,13,So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; we will tell of Thy praise to all generations.

Job,1,1,"THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared G-d, and shunned evil. "
Job,1,2,And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
Job,1,3,"His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. "
Job,1,4,And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: 'It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed G-d in their hearts.' Thus did Job continually. "
Job,1,6,"Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of G-d came to present themselves before HaShem, and Satan came also among them. "
Job,1,7,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered HaShem, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' "
Job,1,8,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth G-d, and shunneth evil?' "
Job,1,9,"Then Satan answered HaShem, and said: 'Doth Job fear G-d for nought? "
Job,1,10,"Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land. "
Job,1,11,"But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.' "
Job,1,12,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.' So Satan went forth from the presence of HaShem. "
Job,1,13,"And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, "
Job,1,14,"that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: 'The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; "
Job,1,15,"and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' "
Job,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'A fire of G-d is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' "
Job,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' "
Job,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; "
Job,1,19,"And, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' "
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; "
Job,1,21,"And he said; naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither; HaShem gave, and HaShem hath taken away; blessed be the name of HaShem. "
Job,1,22,"For all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed aught unseemly to G-d.  "
Job,2,1,"Again it fell upon a day, that the sons of G-d came to present themselves before HaShem, and Satan came also among them to present himself before HaShem. "
Job,2,2,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'From whence comest thou?' And Satan answered HaShem, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' "
Job,2,3,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth G-d, and shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against him, to destroy him without cause.' "
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered HaShem, and said: 'Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. "
Job,2,5,"But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.' "
Job,2,6,"And HaShem said unto Satan: 'Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.' "
Job,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of HaShem, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown. "
Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes. 
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him: 'Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? blaspheme G-d, and die.' "
Job,2,10,"But he said unto her: 'Thou speakest as one of the impious women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of G-d, and shall we not receive evil?' For all this did not Job sin with his lips. "
Job,2,11,"Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. "
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and threw dust upon their heads toward heaven. "
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great. "
Job,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. "
Job,3,2,"And Job spoke, and said: "
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was said: 'A man-child is brought forth.' "
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not G-d inquire after it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. "
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that maketh black the day terrify it. 
Job,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. "
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be desolate; let no joyful voice come therein. "
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan. "
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning; "
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid trouble from mine eyes. "
Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth? 
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck? "
Job,3,13,For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest-- 
Job,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves; "
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver; "
Job,3,16,Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that never saw light. 
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest. 
Job,3,18,There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster. 
Job,3,19,The small and great are there alike; and the servant is free from his master. 
Job,3,20,"Wherewith is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul-- "
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; "
Job,3,22,"Who rejoice unto exultation, and are glad, when they can find the grave?-- "
Job,3,23,"To a man whose way is hid, and whom G-d hath hedged in? "
Job,3,24,"For my sighing cometh instead of my food, and my roarings are poured out like water. "
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me. "
Job,3,26,"I was not at ease, neither was I quiet, neither had I rest; but trouble came. "
Job,4,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said: "
Job,4,2,"If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking? "
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. "
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. "
Job,4,5,"But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; it toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted. "
Job,4,6,"Is not thy fear of G-d thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways? "
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? "
Job,4,8,"According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow mischief, reap the same. "
Job,4,9,"By the breath of G-d they perish, and by the blast of His anger are they consumed. "
Job,4,10,"The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth--yet the teeth of the young lions are broken. "
Job,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. "
Job,4,12,"Now a word was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof. "
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, "
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were made to shake. "
Job,4,15,"Then a spirit passed before my face, that made the hair of my flesh to stand up. "
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice: "
Job,4,17,'Shall mortal man be just before G-d? Shall a man be pure before his Maker? 
Job,4,18,"Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants, and His angels He chargeth with folly; "
Job,4,19,"How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth! "
Job,4,20,Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered; they perish for ever without any regarding it. 
Job,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.' "
Job,5,1,Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn? 
Job,5,2,"For anger killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. "
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root; but suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed. 
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them. "
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance. "
Job,5,6,"For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; "
Job,5,7,"But man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. "
Job,5,8,"But as for me, I would seek unto G-d, and unto G-d would I commit my cause; "
Job,5,9,"Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number; "
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields; "
Job,5,11,"So that He setteth up on high those that are low, and those that mourn are exalted to safety. "
Job,5,12,"He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands can perform nothing substantial. "
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong. 
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope at noonday as in the night. "
Job,5,15,"But He saveth from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty. "
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. "
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom G-d correcteth; therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. "
Job,5,18,"For He maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and His hands make whole. "
Job,5,19,"He will deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. "
Job,5,20,In famine He will redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword. 
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing. "
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. "
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season. "
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good. "
Job,6,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,6,2,"Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances altogether! "
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore are my words broken. 
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up; the terrors of G-d do set themselves in array against me. "
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
Job,6,6,Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the juice of mallows? 
Job,6,7,My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as the sickness of my flesh. 
Job,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request, and that G-d would grant me the thing that I long for! "
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please G-d to crush me; that He would let loose His hand, and cut me off! "
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain, though He spare not; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. "
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is mine end, that I should be patient? "
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 
Job,6,13,"Is it that I have no help in me, and that sound wisdom is driven quite from me? "
Job,6,14,"To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend, even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. "
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that overflow, "
Job,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself; "
Job,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish, when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. "
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way do wind, they go up into the waste, and are lost. "
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them-- "
Job,6,20,"They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came thither, and were confounded. "
Job,6,21,"For now ye are become His; ye see a terror, and are afraid. "
Job,6,22,Did I say: 'Give unto me'? or: 'Offer a present for me of your substance'? 
Job,6,23,or: 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? or: 'Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors'? 
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. "
Job,6,25,How forcible are words of uprightness! But what doth your arguing argue? 
Job,6,26,"Do ye hold words to be an argument, but the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind? "
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend. "
Job,6,28,Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; for surely I shall not lie to your face. 
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yea, return again, my cause is righteous. "
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern crafty devices? 
Job,7,1,Is there not a time of service to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling? 
Job,7,2,"As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow, and as a hireling that looketh for his wages; "
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess--months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. "
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say: 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. "
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh. 
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. "
Job,7,7,O remember that my life is a breath; mine eye shall no more see good. 
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; while Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone. "
Job,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. "
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. "
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that Thou settest a watch over me? "
Job,7,13,"When I say: 'My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint'; "
Job,7,14,"Then Thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions; "
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than these my bones. "
Job,7,16,I loathe it; I shall not live alway; let me alone; for my days are vanity. 
Job,7,17,"What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him, and that Thou shouldest set Thy heart upon him, "
Job,7,18,"And that Thou shouldest remember him every morning, and try him every moment? "
Job,7,19,"How long wilt Thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? "
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as a mark for Thee, so that I am a burden to myself? "
Job,7,21,"And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; and Thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be. "
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said: "
Job,8,2,"How long wilt thou speak these things, seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind? "
Job,8,3,Doth G-d pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
Job,8,4,"If thy children sinned against Him, He delivered them into the hand of their transgression. "
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto G-d, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; "
Job,8,6,"If thou wert pure and upright; surely now He would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. "
Job,8,7,"And though thy beginning was small, yet thy end should greatly increase. "
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out-- "
Job,8,9,"For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow-- "
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? "
Job,8,11,Can the rush shoot up without mire? Can the reed-grass grow without water? 
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. "
Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget G-d; and the hope of the godless man shall perish; 
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence is gossamer, and whose trust is a spider's web. "
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure. "
Job,8,16,"He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden. "
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones. "
Job,8,18,"If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him: 'I have not seen thee.' "
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring. "
Job,8,20,"Behold, G-d will not cast away an innocent man, neither will He uphold the evil-doers; "
Job,8,21,"Till He fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting. "
Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more. 
Job,9,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,9,2,Of a truth I know that it is so; and how can man be just with G-d? 
Job,9,3,"If one should desire to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one of a thousand. "
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who hath hardened himself against Him, and prospered? "
Job,9,5,"Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not, when He overturneth them in His anger. "
Job,9,6,"Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. "
Job,9,7,"Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. "
Job,9,8,"Who alone stretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. "
Job,9,9,"Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. "
Job,9,10,"Who doeth great things past finding out; yea, marvellous things without number. "
Job,9,11,"Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him not. He passeth on also, but I perceive Him not. "
Job,9,12,"Behold, He snatcheth away, who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him: 'What doest Thou?' "
Job,9,13,G-d will not withdraw His anger; the helpers of Rahab did stoop under Him. 
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer Him, and choose out my arguments with Him? "
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to Him that contendeth with me. "
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and He had answered me; yet would I not believe that He would hearken unto my voice-- "
Job,9,17,"He that would break me with a tempest, and multiply my wounds without cause; "
Job,9,18,"That would not suffer me to take my breath, but fill me with bitterness. "
Job,9,19,"If it be a matter of strength, lo, He is mighty! and if of justice, who will appoint me a time? "
Job,9,20,"Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me; though I be innocent, He shall prove me perverse. "
Job,9,21,"I am innocent--I regard not myself, I despise my life. "
Job,9,22,It is all one--therefore I say: He destroyeth the innocent and the wicked. 
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the calamity of the guiltless. "
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if it be not He, who then is it? "
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good. "
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships; as the vulture that swoopeth on the prey. 
Job,9,27,"If I say: 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer', "
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my pains, I know that Thou wilt not hold me guiltless. "
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned; why then do I labour in vain? 
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; "
Job,9,31,"Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. "
Job,9,32,"For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in judgment. "
Job,9,33,"There is no arbiter betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. "
Job,9,34,"Let Him take His rod away from me, and let not His terror make me afraid; "
Job,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear Him; for I am not so with myself. "
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
Job,10,2,I will say unto G-d: Do not condemn me; make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me. 
Job,10,3,"Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress, that Thou shouldest despise the work of Thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? "
Job,10,4,Hast Thou eyes of flesh? or seest Thou as man seeth? 
Job,10,5,"Are Thy days as the days of man, or Thy years as a man's days, "
Job,10,6,"That Thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin, "
Job,10,7,Although Thou knowest that I shall not be condemned; and there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand? 
Job,10,8,Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me together round about; yet Thou dost destroy me! 
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast fashioned me as clay; and wilt Thou bring me into dust again? "
Job,10,10,"Hast Thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? "
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. "
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favour, and Thy providence hath preserved my spirit. "
Job,10,13,Yet these things Thou didst hide in Thy heart; I know that this is with Thee; 
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then Thou markest me, and Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. "
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head--being filled with ignominy and looking upon mine affliction. "
Job,10,16,"And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest me as a lion; and again Thou showest Thyself marvellous upon me. "
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, and increasest Thine indignation upon me; host succeeding host against me. "
Job,10,18,"Wherefore then hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished, and no eye had seen me! "
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, "
Job,10,21,"Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; "
Job,10,22,"A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness. "
Job,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said: "
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be accounted right? 
Job,11,3,"Thy boastings have made men hold their peace, and thou hast mocked, with none to make thee ashamed; "
Job,11,4,"And thou hast said: 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in Thine eyes.' "
Job,11,5,"But oh that G-d would speak, and open His lips against thee; "
Job,11,6,"And that He would tell thee the secrets of wisdom, that sound wisdom is manifold! Know therefore that G-d exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. "
Job,11,7,Canst thou find out the deep things of G-d? Canst thou attain unto the purpose of the Almighty? 
Job,11,8,It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than the nether-world; what canst thou know? 
Job,11,9,"The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. "
Job,11,10,"If He pass by, and shut up, or gather in, then who can hinder Him? "
Job,11,11,"For He knoweth base men; and when He seeth iniquity, will He not then consider it? "
Job,11,12,"But an empty man will get understanding, when a wild ass's colt is born a man. "
Job,11,13,"If thou set thy heart aright, and stretch out thy hands toward Him-- "
Job,11,14,"If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents-- "
Job,11,15,"Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear; "
Job,11,16,For thou shalt forget thy misery; thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away; 
Job,11,17,"And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. "
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt look about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety. "
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. "
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the drooping of the soul. "
Job,12,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,12,2,"No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. "
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you; yea, who knoweth not such things as these? "
Job,12,4,"I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, a man that called upon G-d, and He answered him; the just, the innocent man is a laughing-stock, "
Job,12,5,"A contemptible brand in the thought of him that is at ease, a thing ready for them whose foot slippeth. "
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke G-d are secure, in whatsoever G-d bringeth into their hand. "
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; "
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee; "
Job,12,9,"Who knoweth not among all these, that the hand of HaShem hath wrought this? "
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.-- "
Job,12,11,"Doth not the ear try words, even as the palate tasteth its food? "
Job,12,12,"Is wisdom with aged men, and understanding in length of days?-- "
Job,12,13,With Him is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding. 
Job,12,14,"Behold, He breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. "
Job,12,15,"Behold, He withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; also He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. "
Job,12,16,With Him is strength and sound wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His. 
Job,12,17,"He leadeth counsellors away stripped, and judges maketh He fools. "
Job,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle. "
Job,12,19,"He leadeth priests away stripped, and overthroweth the mighty. "
Job,12,20,"He removeth the speech of men of trust, and taketh away the sense of the elders. "
Job,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, and looseth the belt of the strong. "
Job,12,22,"He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. "
Job,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them; He enlargeth the nations, and leadeth them away. "
Job,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the land, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. "
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. "
Job,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. "
Job,13,2,"What ye know, do I know also; I am not inferior unto you. "
Job,13,3,"Notwithstanding I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with G-d. "
Job,13,4,"But ye are plasterers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. "
Job,13,5,Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it would be your wisdom. 
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. "
Job,13,7,"Will ye speak unrighteously for G-d, and talk deceitfully for Him? "
Job,13,8,Will ye show Him favour? Will ye contend for G-d? 
Job,13,9,"Would it be good that He should search you out? Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him? "
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly show favour. "
Job,13,11,"Shall not His majesty terrify you, and His dread fall upon you? "
Job,13,12,"Your memorials shall be like unto ashes, your eminences to eminences of clay. "
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. "
Job,13,14,"Wherefore? I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand. "
Job,13,15,"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; but I will argue my ways before Him. "
Job,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation, that a hypocrite cannot come before Him. "
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears. "
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified. "
Job,13,19,Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and die. 
Job,13,20,"Only do not two things unto me, then will I not hide myself from Thee: "
Job,13,21,Withdraw Thy hand far from me; and let not Thy terror make me afraid. 
Job,13,22,"Then call Thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer Thou me. "
Job,13,23,How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin. 
Job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and holdest me for Thine enemy? "
Job,13,25,Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble? 
Job,13,26,"That Thou shouldest write bitter things against me, and make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth. "
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; Thou drawest Thee a line about the soles of my feet; "
Job,13,28,"Though I am like a wine-skin that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten. "
Job,14,1,"Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. "
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and withereth; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. "
Job,14,3,"And dost Thou open Thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with Thee? "
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. 
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with Thee, and Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; "
Job,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. "
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. "
Job,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; "
Job,14,9,"Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant. "
Job,14,10,"But man dieth, and lieth low; yea, man perisheth, and where is he? "
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the river is drained dry; "
Job,14,12,"So man lieth down and riseth not; till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep. "
Job,14,13,"Oh that Thou wouldest hide me in the nether-world, that Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!-- "
Job,14,14,"If a man die, may he live again? All the days of my service would I wait, till my relief should come-- "
Job,14,15,"Thou wouldest call, and I would answer Thee; Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of Thy hands. "
Job,14,16,"But now Thou numberest my steps, Thou dost not even wait for my sin; "
Job,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and Thou heapest up mine iniquity. "
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling crumbleth away, and the rock is removed out of its place; "
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones; the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth; so Thou destroyest the hope of man. 
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. "
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he regardeth them not. "
Job,14,22,"But his flesh grieveth for him, and his soul mourneth over him. "
Job,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said: "
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? "
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? "
Job,15,4,"Yea, thou doest away with fear, and impairest devotion before G-d. "
Job,15,5,"For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. "
Job,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee. "
Job,15,7,Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills? 
Job,15,8,Dost thou hearken in the council of G-d? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 
Job,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us? "
Job,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than thy father. "
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of G-d too small for thee, and the word that dealeth gently with thee? "
Job,15,12,Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink? 
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against G-d, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth. "
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? "
Job,15,15,"Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight. "
Job,15,16,"How much less one that is abominable and impure, man who drinketh iniquity like water! "
Job,15,17,"I will tell thee, hear thou me; and that which I have seen I will declare-- "
Job,15,18,"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it; "
Job,15,19,"Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them. "
Job,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. "
Job,15,21,A sound of terrors is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 
Job,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. "
Job,15,23,He wandereth abroad for bread: 'Where is it?' He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish overwhelm him; they prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. "
Job,15,25,"Because he hath stretched out his hand against G-d, and behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty; "
Job,15,26,"He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers. "
Job,15,27,"Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and made collops of fat on his loins; "
Job,15,28,"And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man would inhabit, which were ready to become heaps. "
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their produce bend to the earth. "
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of His mouth shall he go away. "
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; for vanity shall be his recompense. "
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be leafy. "
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. "
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery. "
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit. "
Job,16,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things; sorry comforters are ye all. 
Job,16,3,Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you. "
Job,16,5,"I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would assuage your grief. "
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; and though I forbear, what am I eased? "
Job,16,7,But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company. 
Job,16,8,"And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face. "
Job,16,9,"He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. "
Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; they gather themselves together against me. 
Job,16,11,"G-d delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked. "
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark. "
Job,16,13,"His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. "
Job,16,14,He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant. 
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust. "
Job,16,16,"My face is reddened with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; "
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. "
Job,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting-place. "
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, and He that testifieth of me is on high. "
Job,16,20,"Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, mine eye poureth out tears unto G-d; "
Job,16,21,"That He would set aright a man contending with G-d, as a son of man setteth aright his neighbour! "
Job,16,22,"For the years that are few are coming on, and I shall go the way whence I shall not return. "
Job,17,1,"My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me. "
Job,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation. "
Job,17,3,"Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; who else is there that will strike hands with me? "
Job,17,4,For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; therefore shalt Thou not exalt them. 
Job,17,5,"He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, even the eyes of his children shall fail. "
Job,17,6,He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become one in whose face they spit. 
Job,17,7,"Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, and all my members are as a shadow. "
Job,17,8,"Upright men are astonished at this, and the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless. "
Job,17,9,"Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, and he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger. "
Job,17,10,"But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; and I shall not find a wise man among you. "
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. "
Job,17,12,They change the night into day; the light is short because of darkness. 
Job,17,13,If I look for the nether-world as my house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness; 
Job,17,14,"If I have said to corruption: 'Thou art my father', to the worm: 'Thou art my mother, and my sister'; "
Job,17,15,"Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it? "
Job,17,16,"They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, when we are at rest together in the dust. "
Job,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said: "
Job,18,2,"How long will ye lay snares for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak. "
Job,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed dull in your sight? "
Job,18,4,"Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place? "
Job,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. "
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp over him shall be put out. "
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. "
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon the toils. "
Job,18,9,"A gin shall take him by the heel, and a snare shall lay hold on him. "
Job,18,10,"A noose is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. "
Job,18,11,"Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side, and shall entrap him at his feet. "
Job,18,12,"His trouble shall be ravenous, and calamity shall be ready for his fall. "
Job,18,13,"It shall devour the members of his body, yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members. "
Job,18,14,That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent; and he shall be brought to the king of terrors. 
Job,18,15,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his; brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
Job,18,16,"His roots shall dry up beneath, and above shall his branch wither. "
Job,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name abroad. "
Job,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. "
Job,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. "
Job,18,20,"They that come after shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before are affrighted. "
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not G-d. "
Job,19,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, and crush me with words? "
Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me; ye are not ashamed that ye deal harshly with me. 
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. "
Job,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach; "
Job,19,6,"Know now that G-d hath subverted my cause, and hath compassed me with His net. "
Job,19,7,"Behold, I cry out: 'Violence!' but I am not heard; I cry aloud, but there is no justice. "
Job,19,8,"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and hath set darkness in my paths. "
Job,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. "
Job,19,10,"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; and my hope hath He plucked up like a tree. "
Job,19,11,"He hath also kindled His wrath against me, and He counteth me unto Him as one of His adversaries. "
Job,19,12,"His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent. "
Job,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me. "
Job,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. "
Job,19,15,"They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am become an alien in their sight. "
Job,19,16,"I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, though I entreat him with my mouth. "
Job,19,17,"My breath is abhorred of my wife, and I am loathsome to the children of my tribe. "
Job,19,18,"Even urchins despised me; if I arise, they speak against me. "
Job,19,19,All my intimate friends abhor me; and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
Job,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. "
Job,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of G-d hath touched me. "
Job,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as G-d, and are not satisfied with my flesh? "
Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! 
Job,19,24,That with an iron pen and lead they were graven in the rock for ever! 
Job,19,25,"But as for me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He will witness at the last upon the dust; "
Job,19,26,"And when after my skin this is destroyed, then without my flesh shall I see G-d; "
Job,19,27,"Whom I, even I, shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another's. My reins are consumed within me. "
Job,19,28,If ye say: 'How we will persecute him!' seeing that the root of the matter is found in me; 
Job,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword; for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. "
Job,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said: "
Job,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of mine agitation that is in me. "
Job,20,3,"I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, but out of my understanding my spirit answereth me. "
Job,20,4,"Knowest thou not this of old time, since man was placed upon earth, "
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment? "
Job,20,6,"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; "
Job,20,7,Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; they that have seen him shall say: 'Where is he?' 
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. "
Job,20,9,The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 
Job,20,10,"His children shall appease the poor, and his hands shall restore his wealth. "
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust. "
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; "
Job,20,13,"Though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth; "
Job,20,14,"Yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. "
Job,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; G-d shall cast them out of his belly. "
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue shall slay him. 
Job,20,17,"He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and curd. "
Job,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down; according to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice. "
Job,20,19,"For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up. "
Job,20,20,"Because he knew no quietness within him, in his greed he suffered nought to escape, "
Job,20,21,There was nothing left that he devoured not--therefore his prosperity shall not endure. 
Job,20,22,In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. 
Job,20,23,"It shall be for the filling of his belly; He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him, and shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh. "
Job,20,24,"If he flee from the iron weapon, the bow of brass shall strike him through. "
Job,20,25,"He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him. "
Job,20,26,All darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tent. 
Job,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. "
Job,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart, his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. "
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from G-d, and the heritage appointed unto him by G-d. "
Job,21,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,21,2,Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations. 
Job,21,3,"Suffer me, that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. "
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient? "
Job,21,5,"Turn unto me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. "
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am affrighted, and horror hath taketh hold on my flesh. "
Job,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power? "
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. "
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe, without fear, neither is the rod of G-d upon them. "
Job,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. "
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. "
Job,21,12,"They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. "
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave. "
Job,21,14,Yet they said unto G-d: 'Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. 
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?'-- "
Job,21,16,"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; the counsel of the wicked is far from me. "
Job,21,17,How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? that He distributeth pains in His anger? 
Job,21,18,"That they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm stealeth away? "
Job,21,19,"'G-d layeth up his iniquity for his children!' --let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it. "
Job,21,20,"Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. "
Job,21,21,For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? seeing the number of his months is determined. 
Job,21,22,Shall any teach G-d knowledge? seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high. 
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet; "
Job,21,24,"His pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened. "
Job,21,25,"And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and hath never tasted of good. "
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covereth them. "
Job,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. "
Job,21,28,For ye say: 'Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?' 
Job,21,29,"Have ye not asked them that go by the way; and will ye misdeem their tokens, "
Job,21,30,"That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, that they are led forth to the day of wrath? "
Job,21,31,But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done? 
Job,21,32,"For he is borne to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb. "
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley are sweet unto him, and all men draw after him, as there were innumerable before him. "
Job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain? And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness? "
Job,22,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said: "
Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable unto G-d? Or can he that is wise be profitable unto Him? 
Job,22,3,"Is it any advantage to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to Him, that thou makest thy ways blameless? "
Job,22,4,"Is it for thy fear of Him that He reproveth thee, that He entereth with thee into judgment? "
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? And are not thine iniquities without end? 
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. "
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. "
Job,22,8,"And as a mighty man, who hath the earth, and as a man of rank, who dwelleth in it, "
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. "
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden dread affrighted thee, "
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee. "
Job,22,12,"Is not G-d in the height of heaven? And behold the topmost of the stars, how high they are! "
Job,22,13,And thou sayest: 'What doth G-d know? Can He judge through the dark cloud? 
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to Him, that He seeth not; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven.' "
Job,22,15,Wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden? 
Job,22,16,"Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream; "
Job,22,17,Who said unto G-d: 'Depart from us'; and what could the Almighty do unto them? 
Job,22,18,Yet He filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
Job,22,19,"The righteous saw it, and were glad, and the innocent laugh them to scorn: "
Job,22,20,"'Surely their substance is cut off, and their abundance the fire hath consumed.' "
Job,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace; thereby shall thine increase be good. "
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in thy heart. "
Job,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up--if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents, "
Job,22,24,"And lay thy treasure in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks; "
Job,22,25,"And the Almighty be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee; "
Job,22,26,"Then surely shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto G-d. "
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows; "
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, and light shall shine upon thy ways. "
Job,22,29,"When they cast thee down, thou shalt say: 'There is lifting up'; for the humble person He saveth. "
Job,22,30,"He delivereth him that is innocent, yea, thou shalt be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands. "
Job,23,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,23,2,Even to-day is my complaint bitter; my hand is become heavy because of my groaning. 
Job,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His seat! "
Job,23,4,"I would order my cause before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments. "
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me. "
Job,23,6,Would He contend with me in His great power? Nay; but He would give heed unto me. 
Job,23,7,There the upright might reason with Him; so should I be delivered for ever from my Judge. 
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but He is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive Him; "
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, when He doth work, but I cannot behold Him, He turneth Himself to the right hand, but I cannot see Him. "
Job,23,10,"For He knoweth the way that I take; when He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. "
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held fast to His steps, His way have I kept, and turned not aside. "
Job,23,12,I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured up the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. 
Job,23,13,"But He is at one with Himself, and who can turn Him? And what His soul desireth, even that He doeth. "
Job,23,14,For He will perform that which is appointed for me; and many such things are with Him. 
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I affrighted at His presence; when I consider, I am afraid of Him. "
Job,23,16,"Yea, G-d hath made my heart faint, and the Almighty hath affrighted me; "
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did He cover the thick darkness from my face. "
Job,24,1,Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know Him see His days? 
Job,24,2,"There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them. "
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. "
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way; the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; the desert yieldeth them bread for their children. "
Job,24,6,They cut his provender in the field; and they despoil the vineyard of the wicked. 
Job,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. "
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. "
Job,24,9,"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor; "
Job,24,10,"So that they go about naked without clothing, and being hungry they carry the sheaves; "
Job,24,11,"They make oil within the rows of these men; they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. "
Job,24,12,"From out of the populous city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth out; yet G-d imputeth it not for unseemliness. "
Job,24,13,"These are of them that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. "
Job,24,14,"The murderer riseth with the light, to kill the poor and needy; and in the night he is as a thief. "
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying: 'No eye shall see me'; and he putteth a covering on his face. "
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses; they shut themselves up in the day-time; they know not the light. 
Job,24,17,For the shadow of death is to all of them as the morning; for they know the terrors of the shadow of death. 
Job,24,18,He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; he turneth not by the way of the vineyards. 
Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so doth the nether-world those that have sinned. 
Job,24,20,The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and unrighteousness is broken as a tree. 
Job,24,21,He devoureth the barren that beareth not; and doeth not good to the widow. 
Job,24,22,"He draweth away the mighty also by his power; he riseth up, and he trusteth not his own life. "
Job,24,23,"Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth, yet His eyes are upon their ways. "
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; yea, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, and wither as the tops of the ears of corn. "
Job,24,25,"And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? "
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said: "
Job,25,2,Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places. 
Job,25,3,Is there any number of His armies? And upon whom doth not His light arise? 
Job,25,4,How then can man be just with G-d? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
Job,25,5,"Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in His sight; "
Job,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot! "
Job,26,1,Then Job answered and said: 
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength! 
Job,26,3,"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! "
Job,26,4,With whose help hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee? 
Job,26,5,The shades tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof. 
Job,26,6,"The nether-world is naked before Him, and Destruction hath no covering. "
Job,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth over nothing. "
Job,26,8,He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
Job,26,9,"He closeth in the face of His throne, and spreadeth His cloud upon it. "
Job,26,10,"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness. "
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke. 
Job,26,12,"He stirreth up the sea with His power, and by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab. "
Job,26,13,By His breath the heavens are serene; His hand hath pierced the slant serpent. 
Job,26,14,"Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways; and how small a whisper is heard of Him! But the thunder of His mighty deeds who can understand? "
Job,27,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said: "
Job,27,2,"As G-d liveth, who hath taken away my right; and the Almighty, who hath dealt bitterly with me; "
Job,27,3,"All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of G-d is in my nostrils, "
Job,27,4,"Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit; "
Job,27,5,Far be it from me that I should justify you; till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me. 
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. "
Job,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous. "
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, when G-d taketh away his soul? "
Job,27,9,"Will G-d hear his cry, when trouble cometh upon him? "
Job,27,10,"Will he have his delight in the Almighty, and call upon G-d at all times? "
Job,27,11,I will teach you concerning the hand of G-d; that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
Job,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye become altogether vain? "
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with G-d, and the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty. "
Job,27,14,"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not have bread enough. "
Job,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried by pestilence, and his widows shall make no lamentation. "
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; "
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. "
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth which the keeper maketh. "
Job,27,19,"He lieth down rich, but there shall be not to gather; he openeth his eyes, and his wealth is not. "
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like waters; a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
Job,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; and it sweepeth him out of his place. "
Job,27,22,"Yea, it hurleth at him, and spareth not; he would fain flee from its power. "
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. "
Job,28,1,"For there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine. "
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the dust, and brass is molten out of the stone. "
Job,28,3,"Man setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death. "
Job,28,4,"He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro. "
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. "
Job,28,6,"The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold. "
Job,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knoweth, neither hath the falcon's eye seen it; "
Job,28,8,"The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor hath the lion passed thereby. "
Job,28,9,He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
Job,28,10,He cutteth out channels among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
Job,28,11,He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
Job,28,12,"But wisdom, where shall it be found? And where is the place of understanding? "
Job,28,13,Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
Job,28,14,The deep saith: 'It is not in me'; and the sea saith: 'It is not with me.' 
Job,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. "
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. "
Job,28,17,Gold and glass cannot equal it; neither shall the exchange thereof be vessels of fine gold. 
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies. "
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. "
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding? 
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. "
Job,28,22,Destruction and Death say: 'We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.' 
Job,28,23,"G-d understandeth the way thereof, and He knoweth the place thereof. "
Job,28,24,"For He looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; "
Job,28,25,"When He maketh a weight for the wind, and meteth out the waters by measure. "
Job,28,26,"When He made a decree for the rain, and a way for the storm of thunders; "
Job,28,27,"Then did He see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out. "
Job,28,28,"And unto man He said: 'Behold, the fear of the L-rd, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.' "
Job,29,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said: "
Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when G-d watched over me; "
Job,29,3,"When His lamp shined above my head, and by His light I walked through darkness; "
Job,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when the converse of G-d was upon my tent; "
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were about me; "
Job,29,6,"When my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil! "
Job,29,7,"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, when I prepared my seat in the broad place, "
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged rose up and stood; "
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth; "
Job,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. "
Job,29,11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me; "
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherless also, that had none to help him. "
Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; my justice was as a robe and a diadem. "
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. "
Job,29,16,I was a father to the needy; and the cause of him that I knew not I searched out. 
Job,29,17,"And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth. "
Job,29,18,"Then I said: 'I shall die with my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix; "
Job,29,19,"My root shall be spread out to the waters, and the dew shall lie all night upon my branch; "
Job,29,20,"My glory shall be fresh in me, and my bow shall be renewed in my hand.' "
Job,29,21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel. "
Job,29,22,After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 
Job,29,23,And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 
Job,29,24,"If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. "
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. "
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. "
Job,30,2,"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? men in whom ripe age is perished. "
Job,30,3,"They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation. "
Job,30,4,They pluck salt-wort with wormwood; and the roots of the broom are their food. 
Job,30,5,They are driven forth from the midst of men; they cry after them as after a thief. 
Job,30,6,"In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks. "
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they are gathered together. 
Job,30,8,"They are children of churls, yea, children of ignoble men; they were scourged out of the land. "
Job,30,9,"And now I am become their song, yea, I am a byword unto them. "
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. "
Job,30,11,"For He hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, and they have cast off the bridle before me. "
Job,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the brood; they entangle my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction. "
Job,30,13,"They break up my path, they further my calamity, even men that have no helper. "
Job,30,14,As through a wide breach they come; in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me. 
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me, they chase mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away as a cloud. "
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 
Job,30,17,"In the night my bones are pierced, and fall from me, and my sinews take no rest. "
Job,30,18,By the great force of my disease is my garment disfigured; it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. "
Job,30,20,"I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not answer me; I stand up, and Thou lookest at me. "
Job,30,21,Thou art turned to be cruel to me; with the might of Thy hand Thou hatest me. 
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind, Thou causest me to ride upon it; and Thou dissolvest my substance. "
Job,30,23,"For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. "
Job,30,24,"Surely none shall put forth his hand to a ruinous heap, neither because of these things shall help come in one's calamity, "
Job,30,25,"If I have not wept for him that was in trouble, and if my soul grieved not for the needy. "
Job,30,26,"Yet, when I looked for good, there came evil; and when I waited for light, there came darkness. "
Job,30,27,"Mine inwards boil, and rest not; days of affliction are come upon me. "
Job,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun; I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. "
Job,30,29,"I am become a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches. "
Job,30,30,"My skin is black, and falleth from me, and my bones are burned with heat. "
Job,30,31,"Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of them that weep. "
Job,31,1,I made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid? 
Job,31,2,"For what would be the portion of G-d from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high? "
Job,31,3,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? "
Job,31,4,"Doth not He see my ways, and count all my steps? "
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit-- "
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed in a just balance, that G-d may know mine integrity-- "
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to my hands; "
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. "
Job,31,9,"If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbour's door; "
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. "
Job,31,11,"For that were a heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges. "
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction, and would root out all mine increase. "
Job,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my man-servant, or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me-- "
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when G-d riseth up? And when He remembereth, what shall I answer Him? "
Job,31,15,Did not He that made me in the womb make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb? 
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld aught that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; "
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof-- "
Job,31,18,"Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother's womb. "
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any wanderer in want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; "
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; "
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate; "
Job,31,22,"Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. "
Job,31,23,"For calamity from G-d was a terror to me, and by reason of His majesty I could do nothing. "
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold: 'Thou art my confidence'; "
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; "
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; "
Job,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand; "
Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have lied to G-d that is above. 
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or exulted when evil found him-- "
Job,31,30,"Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse. "
Job,31,31,If the men of my tent said not: 'Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?' 
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street; my doors I opened to the roadside. 
Job,31,33,"If after the manner of men I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom-- "
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, and the most contemptible among families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door. "
Job,31,35,"Oh that I had one to hear me! --Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me--and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written! "
Job,31,36,Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown. 
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 
Job,31,38,"If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together; "
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the tillers thereof to be disappointed-- "
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and noisome weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. "
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. "
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than G-d. "
Job,32,3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. "
Job,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were older than he. "
Job,32,5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled. "
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I held back, and durst not declare you mine opinion. "
Job,32,7,"I said: 'Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.' "
Job,32,8,"But it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding. "
Job,32,9,"It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged that discern judgment. "
Job,32,10,Therefore I say: 'Hearken to me; I also will declare mine opinion.' 
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. "
Job,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none that convinced Job, or that answered his words, among you. "
Job,32,13,"Beware lest ye say: 'We have found wisdom; G-d may vanquish him, not man!' "
Job,32,14,For he hath not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
Job,32,15,"They are amazed, they answer no more; words are departed from them. "
Job,32,16,"And shall I wait, because they speak not, because they stand still, and answer no more? "
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, I also will declare mine opinion. "
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; the spirit within me constraineth me. 
Job,32,19,"Behold, mine inwards are as wine which hath no vent; like new wine-skins which are ready to burst. "
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer. "
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person; neither will I give flattering titles unto any man. "
Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; else would my Maker soon take me away. 
Job,33,1,"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, and hearken to all my words. "
Job,33,2,"Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. "
Job,33,3,My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. 
Job,33,4,"The spirit of G-d hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty given me life. "
Job,33,5,"If thou canst, answer thou me, set thy words in order before me, stand forth. "
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am toward G-d even as thou art; I also am formed out of the clay. "
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. "
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words; "
Job,33,9,"'I am clean, without transgression, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me; "
Job,33,10,"Behold, He findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for His enemy; "
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.' "
Job,33,12,"Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right, that G-d is too great for man; "
Job,33,13,Why hast thou striven against Him? seeing that He will not answer any of his words. 
Job,33,14,"For G-d speaketh in one way, yea in two, though man perceiveth it not. "
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; "
Job,33,16,"Then He openeth the ears of men, and by their chastisement sealeth the decree, "
Job,33,17,"That men may put away their purpose, and that He may hide pride from man; "
Job,33,18,"That He may keep back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. "
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and all his bones grow stiff; "
Job,33,20,"So that his life maketh him to abhor bread, and his soul dainty food. "
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones corrode to unsightliness. "
Job,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers. "
Job,33,23,"If there be for him an angel, an intercessor, one among a thousand, to vouch for a man's uprightness; "
Job,33,24,"Then He is gracious unto him, and saith: 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.' "
Job,33,25,His flesh is tenderer than a child's; he returneth to the days of his youth; 
Job,33,26,"He prayeth unto G-d, and He is favourable unto him; so that he seeth His face with joy; and He restoreth unto man his righteousness. "
Job,33,27,"He cometh before men, and saith: 'I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not.' "
Job,33,28,"So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit, and his life beholdeth the light. "
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things doth G-d work, twice, yea thrice, with a man, "
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. "
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; hold thy peace, and I will speak. "
Job,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee. "
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken thou unto me; hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom. "
Job,34,1,Moreover Elihu answered and said: 
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. "
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food. "
Job,34,4,Let us choose for us that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good. 
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said: 'I am righteous, and G-d hath taken away my right; "
Job,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' "
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? "
Job,34,8,"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. "
Job,34,9,For he hath said: 'It profiteth a man nothing that he should be in accord with G-d.' 
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from G-d, that He should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that He should commit iniquity. "
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man will He requite unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. "
Job,34,12,"Yea, of a surety, G-d will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. "
Job,34,13,Who gave Him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world? 
Job,34,14,"If He set His heart upon man, if He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath; "
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return unto dust. "
Job,34,16,"If now thou hast understanding, hear this; hearken to the voice of my words. "
Job,34,17,Shall even one that hateth right govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty-- 
Job,34,18,Is it fit to say to a king: 'Thou art base'? Or to nobles: 'Ye are wicked'?-- 
Job,34,19,"That respecteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the work of His hands. "
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand. "
Job,34,21,"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He seeth all his goings. "
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. "
Job,34,23,"For He doth not appoint a time unto any man, when he should go before G-d in judgment. "
Job,34,24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition, and setteth others in their stead. "
Job,34,25,"Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works; and He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed. "
Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 
Job,34,27,"Because they turned aside from following Him, and would not have regard to any of His ways; "
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, and He heareth the cry of the afflicted. "
Job,34,29,"When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him? whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike; "
Job,34,30,"That the godless man reign not, that there be none to ensnare the people. "
Job,34,31,"For hath any said unto G-d: 'I have borne chastisement, though I offend not; "
Job,34,32,"That which I see not teach Thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'? "
Job,34,33,"Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it, so that thou must choose, and not I; therefore speak what thou knowest. "
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me: "
Job,34,35,"'Job speaketh without knowledge, and his words are without discernment.' "
Job,34,36,"Would that Job were tried unto the end, because of his answering like wicked men. "
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against G-d. "
Job,35,1,Moreover Elihu answered and said: 
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou: 'I am righteousness before G-d', "
Job,35,3,"That thou inquirest: 'What advantage will it be unto Thee?' And: 'What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?' "
Job,35,4,"I will give thee answer, and thy companions with thee. "
Job,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou. "
Job,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him? "
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand? "
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; and thy righteousness a son of man. 
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
Job,35,10,"But none saith: 'Where is G-d my Maker, who giveth songs in the night; "
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?' "
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. "
Job,35,13,"Surely G-d will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. "
Job,35,14,"Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him--the cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him. "
Job,35,15,"And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance? "
Job,35,16,But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge. 
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said: "
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will tell thee; for there are yet words on G-d's behalf. "
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. "
Job,36,4,For truly my words are not false; one that is upright in mind is with thee. 
Job,36,5,"Behold, G-d is mighty, yet He despiseth not any; He is mighty in strength of understanding. "
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked; but giveth to the poor their right. 
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous; but with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted. "
Job,36,8,"And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; "
Job,36,9,"Then He declareth unto them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. "
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. "
Job,36,11,"If they hearken and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. "
Job,36,12,"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. "
Job,36,13,But they that are godless in heart lay up anger; they cry not for help when He bindeth them. 
Job,36,14,"Their soul perisheth in youth, and their life as that of the depraved. "
Job,36,15,"He delivereth the afflicted by His affliction, and openeth their ear by tribulation. "
Job,36,16,"Yea, He hath allured thee out of distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which is set on thy table is full of fatness; "
Job,36,17,And thou art full of the judgment of the wicked; judgment and justice take hold on them. 
Job,36,18,"For beware of wrath, lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. "
Job,36,19,"Will thy riches avail, that are without stint, or all the forces of thy strength? "
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off in their place. "
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity; for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. "
Job,36,22,"Behold, G-d doeth loftily in His power; who is a teacher like Him? "
Job,36,23,Who hath enjoined Him His way? Or who hath said: 'Thou hast wrought unrighteousness'? 
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify His work, whereof men have sung. "
Job,36,25,All men have looked thereon; man beholdeth it afar off. 
Job,36,26,"Behold, G-d is great, beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable. "
Job,36,27,"For He draweth away the drops of water, which distil rain from His vapour; "
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down and drop upon the multitudes of men. 
Job,36,29,"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, the crashings of His pavilion? "
Job,36,30,"Behold, He spreadeth His light upon it; and He covereth the depths of the sea. "
Job,36,31,For by these He judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance. 
Job,36,32,"He covereth His hands with the lightning, and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. "
Job,36,33,"The noise thereof telleth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up. "
Job,37,1,"At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place. "
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of His voice, and the sound that goeth out of His mouth. "
Job,37,3,"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and His lightning unto the ends of the earth. "
Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty; and He stayeth them not when His voice is heard. 
Job,37,5,"G-d thundereth marvellously with His voice; great things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend. "
Job,37,6,"For He saith to the snow: 'Fall thou on the earth'; likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain. "
Job,37,7,"He sealeth up the hand of every man, that all men whom He hath made may know it. "
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens. "
Job,37,9,Out of the Chamber cometh the storm; and cold out of the north. 
Job,37,10,"By the breath of G-d ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is straitened. "
Job,37,11,"Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with moister, He spreadeth abroad the cloud of His lightning; "
Job,37,12,"And they are turned round about by His guidance, that they may do whatsoever He commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world: "
Job,37,13,"Whether it be for correction, or for His earth, or for mercy, that He cause it to come. "
Job,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job; Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of G-d. "
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know how G-d enjoineth them, and causeth the lightning of His cloud to shine? "
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge? "
Job,37,17,"Thou whose garments are warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind; "
Job,37,18,"Canst thou with Him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror? "
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto Him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. 
Job,37,20,Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 
Job,37,21,"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. "
Job,37,22,"Out of the north cometh golden splendour, about G-d is terrible majesty. "
Job,37,23,"The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, is excellent in power, yet to judgment and plenteous justice He doeth no violence. "
Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart. 
Job,38,1,"Then HaShem answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: "
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 
Job,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me. "
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast the understanding. "
Job,38,5,"Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it? "
Job,38,6,"Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof, "
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of G-d shouted for joy? "
Job,38,8,"Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, and issued out of the womb; "
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, "
Job,38,10,"And prescribed for it My decree, and set bars and doors, "
Job,38,11,"And said: 'Thus far shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed'? "
Job,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, and caused the dayspring to know its place; "
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? "
Job,38,14,It is changed as clay under the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
Job,38,15,"But from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm is broken. "
Job,38,16,Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep? 
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death? 
Job,38,18,"Hast thou surveyed unto the breadths of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all. "
Job,38,19,"Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and as for darkness, where is the place thereof; "
Job,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? "
Job,38,21,"Thou knowest it, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great! "
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail, "
Job,38,23,"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? "
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, or the east wind scattered upon the earth? "
Job,38,25,"Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder; "
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where no man is, on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; "
Job,38,27,"To satisfy the desolate and waste ground, and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? "
Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
Job,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoar-frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? "
Job,38,30,"The waters are congealed like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. "
Job,38,31,"Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? "
Job,38,32,Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons? 
Job,38,33,Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth? 
Job,38,34,"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? "
Job,38,35,"Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee: 'Here we are'? "
Job,38,36,Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind? 
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven, "
Job,38,38,"When the dust runneth into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together? "
Job,38,39,"Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, "
Job,38,40,"When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? "
Job,38,41,"Who provideth for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry unto G-d, and wander for lack of food? "
Job,39,1,Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
Job,39,2,Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
Job,39,3,"They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they cast out their fruit. "
Job,39,4,"Their young ones wax strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not again. "
Job,39,5,Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
Job,39,6,"Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling-place. "
Job,39,7,"He scorneth the tumult of the city, neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. "
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. "
Job,39,9,Will the wild-ox be willing to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib? 
Job,39,10,Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 
Job,39,11,"Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? "
Job,39,12,"Wilt thou rely on him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather the corn of thy threshing-floor? "
Job,39,13,The wing of the ostrich beateth joyously; but are her pinions and feathers the kindly stork's? 
Job,39,14,"For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, and warmeth them in dust, "
Job,39,15,"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may trample them. "
Job,39,16,"She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers; though her labour be in vain, she is without fear; "
Job,39,17,"Because G-d hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath He imparted to her understanding. "
Job,39,18,"When the time cometh, she raiseth her wings on high, and scorneth the horse and his rider. "
Job,39,19,Hast thou given the horse his strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with fierceness? 
Job,39,20,Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible. 
Job,39,21,"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; he goeth out to meet the clash of arms. "
Job,39,22,"He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. "
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattleth upon him, the glittering spear and the javelin. "
Job,39,24,He swalloweth the ground with storm and rage; neither believeth he that it is the voice of the horn. 
Job,39,25,"As oft as he heareth the horn he saith: 'Ha, ha!' and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. "
Job,39,26,"Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? "
Job,39,27,"Doth the vulture mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? "
Job,39,28,"She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the stronghold. "
Job,39,29,From thence she spieth out the prey; her eyes behold it afar off. 
Job,39,30,"Her young ones also suck up blood; and where the slain are, there is she. "
Job,40,1,"Moreover HaShem answered Job, and said: "
Job,40,2,"Shall he that reproveth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with G-d, let him answer it. "
Job,40,3,"Then Job answered HaShem, and said: "
Job,40,4,"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth. "
Job,40,5,"Once have I spoken, but I will not answer again; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further. "
Job,40,6,"Then HaShem answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: "
Job,40,7,"Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me. "
Job,40,8,"Wilt thou even make void My judgment? Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou mayest be justified? "
Job,40,9,Or hast thou an arm like G-d? And canst thou thunder with a voice like Him? 
Job,40,10,"Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, and array thyself with glory and beauty. "
Job,40,11,"Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; and look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. "
Job,40,12,"Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. "
Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the hidden place. 
Job,40,14,Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 
Job,40,15,"Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. "
Job,40,16,"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the stays of his body. "
Job,40,17,He straineth his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 
Job,40,18,His bones are as pipes of brass; his gristles are like bars of iron. 
Job,40,19,He is the beginning of the ways of G-d; He only that made him can make His sword to approach unto him. 
Job,40,20,"Surely the mountains bring him forth food, and all the beasts of the field play there. "
Job,40,21,"He lieth under the lotus-trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. "
Job,40,22,The lotus-trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 
Job,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; he is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth. "
Job,40,24,"Shall any take him by his eyes, or pierce through his nose with a snare? "
Job,40,25,Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? or press down his tongue with a cord? 
Job,40,26,Canst thou put a ring into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a hook? 
Job,40,27,Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee? 
Job,40,28,"Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? "
Job,40,29,Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
Job,40,30,Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants? 
Job,40,31,Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? 
Job,40,32,"Lay thy hand upon him; think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more. "
Job,41,1,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? "
Job,41,2,None is so fierce that dare stir him up; who then is able to stand before Me? 
Job,41,3,"Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine. "
Job,41,4,"Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, or his proud talk, or his fair array of words? "
Job,41,5,Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle? 
Job,41,6,Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. 
Job,41,7,"His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. "
Job,41,8,"One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. "
Job,41,9,"They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. "
Job,41,10,"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. "
Job,41,11,"Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth. "
Job,41,12,"Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot and burning rushes. "
Job,41,13,"His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. "
Job,41,14,"In his neck abideth strength, and dismay danceth before him. "
Job,41,15,The flakes of his flesh are joined together; they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. 
Job,41,16,"His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone. "
Job,41,17,"When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; by reason of despair they are beside themselves. "
Job,41,18,"If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. "
Job,41,19,"He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. "
Job,41,20,The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
Job,41,21,Clubs are accounted as stubble; he laugheth at the rattling of the javelin. 
Job,41,22,Sharpest potsherds are under him; he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire. 
Job,41,23,He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a seething mixture. 
Job,41,24,He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
Job,41,25,"Upon earth there is not his like, who is made to be fearless. "
Job,41,26,He looketh at all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts. 
Job,42,1,"Then Job answered HaShem, and said: "
Job,42,2,"I know that Thou canst do every thing, and that no purpose can be withholden from Thee. "
Job,42,3,"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. "
Job,42,4,"Hear, I beseech Thee, and I will speak; I will demand of Thee, and declare Thou unto me. "
Job,42,5,I had heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee; 
Job,42,6,"Wherefore I abhor my words, and repent, seeing I am dust and ashes. "
Job,42,7,"And it was so, that after HaShem had spoken these words unto Job, HaShem said to Eliphaz the Temanite: 'My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job hath. "
Job,42,8,"Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I do not unto you aught unseemly; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.' "
Job,42,9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as HaShem commanded them; and HaShem accepted Job. "
Job,42,10,"And HaShem changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends; and HaShem gave Job twice as much as he had before. "
Job,42,11,"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that HaShem had brought upon him; every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold. "
Job,42,12,"So HaShem blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. "
Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
Job,42,14,"And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. "
Job,42,15,And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
Job,42,16,"And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. "
Job,42,17,"So Job died, being old and full of days.   "
Proverbs,1,1,"THE PROVERBS of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; "
Proverbs,1,2,To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the words of understanding; 
Proverbs,1,3,"To receive the discipline of wisdom, justice, and right, and equity; "
Proverbs,1,4,"To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion; "
Proverbs,1,5,"That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels; "
Proverbs,1,6,"To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. "
Proverbs,1,7,The fear of HaShem is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline. 
Proverbs,1,8,"Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother; "
Proverbs,1,9,"For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. "
Proverbs,1,10,"My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. "
Proverbs,1,11,"If they say: 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause; "
Proverbs,1,12,"Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit; "
Proverbs,1,13,"We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil; "
Proverbs,1,14,Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse'-- 
Proverbs,1,15,"My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path; "
Proverbs,1,16,"For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. "
Proverbs,1,17,For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird; 
Proverbs,1,18,"And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives. "
Proverbs,1,19,So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 
Proverbs,1,20,"Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, she uttereth her voice in the broad places; "
Proverbs,1,21,"She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, at the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words: "
Proverbs,1,22,"'How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge? "
Proverbs,1,23,"Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. "
Proverbs,1,24,"Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended, "
Proverbs,1,25,"But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof; "
Proverbs,1,26,"I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh; "
Proverbs,1,27,"When your dread cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when trouble and distress come upon you. "
Proverbs,1,28,"Then will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me. "
Proverbs,1,29,"For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of HaShem; "
Proverbs,1,30,"They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof. "
Proverbs,1,31,"Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. "
Proverbs,1,32,"For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them. "
Proverbs,1,33,"But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.' "
Proverbs,2,1,"My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee; "
Proverbs,2,2,"So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, and thy heart incline to discernment; "
Proverbs,2,3,"Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment; "
Proverbs,2,4,"If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; "
Proverbs,2,5,"Then shalt thou understand the fear of HaShem, and find the knowledge of G-d. "
Proverbs,2,6,"For HaShem giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment; "
Proverbs,2,7,"He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity; "
Proverbs,2,8,"That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones. "
Proverbs,2,9,"Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path. "
Proverbs,2,10,"For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul; "
Proverbs,2,11,"Discretion shall watch over thee, discernment shall guard thee; "
Proverbs,2,12,"To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things; "
Proverbs,2,13,"Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; "
Proverbs,2,14,"Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil; "
Proverbs,2,15,"Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths; "
Proverbs,2,16,"To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words; "
Proverbs,2,17,"That forsaketh the lord of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her G-d. "
Proverbs,2,18,"For her house sinketh down unto death, and her paths unto the shades; "
Proverbs,2,19,"None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life; "
Proverbs,2,20,"That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. "
Proverbs,2,21,"For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the whole-hearted shall remain in it. "
Proverbs,2,22,"But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the faithless shall be plucked up out of it. "
Proverbs,3,1,"My son, forget not my teaching; but let thy heart keep my commandments; "
Proverbs,3,2,"For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee. "
Proverbs,3,3,"Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart; "
Proverbs,3,4,So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of G-d and man. 
Proverbs,3,5,"Trust in HaShem with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding. "
Proverbs,3,6,"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths. "
Proverbs,3,7,"Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear HaShem, and depart from evil; "
Proverbs,3,8,"It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. "
Proverbs,3,9,"Honour HaShem with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase; "
Proverbs,3,10,"So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine. "
Proverbs,3,11,"My son, despise not the chastening of HaShem, neither spurn thou His correction; "
Proverbs,3,12,"For whom HaShem loveth He correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. "
Proverbs,3,13,"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth understanding. "
Proverbs,3,14,"For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. "
Proverbs,3,15,She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. 
Proverbs,3,16,Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honour. 
Proverbs,3,17,"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. "
Proverbs,3,18,"She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast. "
Proverbs,3,19,HaShem by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens. 
Proverbs,3,20,"By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew. "
Proverbs,3,21,"My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion; "
Proverbs,3,22,"So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. "
Proverbs,3,23,"Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thou shalt not dash thy foot. "
Proverbs,3,24,"When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. "
Proverbs,3,25,"Be not afraid of sudden terror, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh; "
Proverbs,3,26,"For HaShem will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being caught. "
Proverbs,3,27,"Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it. "
Proverbs,3,28,"Say not unto thy neighbour: 'Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give'; when thou hast it by thee. "
Proverbs,3,29,"Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. "
Proverbs,3,30,"Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. "
Proverbs,3,31,"Envy thou not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways. "
Proverbs,3,32,For the perverse is an abomination to HaShem; but His counsel is with the upright. 
Proverbs,3,33,The curse of HaShem is in the house of the wicked; but He blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 
Proverbs,3,34,"If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace. "
Proverbs,3,35,"The wise shall inherit honour; but as for the fools, they carry away shame. "
Proverbs,4,1,"Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. "
Proverbs,4,2,For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my teaching. 
Proverbs,4,3,"For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother. "
Proverbs,4,4,"And he taught me, and said unto me: 'Let thy heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments, and live; "
Proverbs,4,5,"Get wisdom, get understanding; forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth; "
Proverbs,4,6,"Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; love her, and she will keep thee. "
Proverbs,4,7,"The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom; yea, with all thy getting get understanding. "
Proverbs,4,8,"Extol her, and she will exalt thee; she will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. "
Proverbs,4,9,She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow on thee.' 
Proverbs,4,10,"Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. "
Proverbs,4,11,I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness. 
Proverbs,4,12,"When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened; and if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. "
Proverbs,4,13,"Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy life. "
Proverbs,4,14,"Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men. "
Proverbs,4,15,"Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on. "
Proverbs,4,16,"For they sleep not, except they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. "
Proverbs,4,17,"For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. "
Proverbs,4,18,"But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. "
Proverbs,4,19,The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble. 
Proverbs,4,20,"My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. "
Proverbs,4,21,Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart. 
Proverbs,4,22,"For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. "
Proverbs,4,23,Above all that thou guardest keep thy heart; for out of it are the issues of life. 
Proverbs,4,24,"Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. "
Proverbs,4,25,"Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. "
Proverbs,4,26,"Make plain the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. "
Proverbs,4,27,Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil. 
Proverbs,5,1,"My son, attend unto my wisdom; incline thine ear to my understanding; "
Proverbs,5,2,"That thou mayest preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. "
Proverbs,5,3,"For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil; "
Proverbs,5,4,"But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. "
Proverbs,5,5,Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on the nether-world; 
Proverbs,5,6,"Lest she should walk the even path of life, her ways wander, but she knoweth it not. "
Proverbs,5,7,"Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth. "
Proverbs,5,8,"Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house; "
Proverbs,5,9,"Lest thou give thy vigour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel; "
Proverbs,5,10,"Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in the house of an alien; "
Proverbs,5,11,"And thou moan, when thine end cometh, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, "
Proverbs,5,12,"And say: 'How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; "
Proverbs,5,13,"Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! "
Proverbs,5,14,I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.' 
Proverbs,5,15,"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. "
Proverbs,5,16,"Let thy springs be dispersed abroad, and courses of water in the streets. "
Proverbs,5,17,"Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. "
Proverbs,5,18,Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth. 
Proverbs,5,19,"A lovely hind and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; with her love be thou ravished always. "
Proverbs,5,20,"Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of an alien? "
Proverbs,5,21,"For the ways of man are before the eyes of HaShem, and He maketh even all his paths. "
Proverbs,5,22,"His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin. "
Proverbs,5,23,He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall reel. 
Proverbs,6,1,"My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger-- "
Proverbs,6,2,"Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth, thou art caught by the words of thy mouth-- "
Proverbs,6,3,"Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour. "
Proverbs,6,4,"Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. "
Proverbs,6,5,"Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. "
Proverbs,6,6,"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; "
Proverbs,6,7,"Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, "
Proverbs,6,8,"Provideth her bread in the summer, and gatherest her food in the harvest. "
Proverbs,6,9,"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? "
Proverbs,6,10,"'Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep'-- "
Proverbs,6,11,"So shall thy poverty come as a runner, and thy want as an armed man. "
Proverbs,6,12,"A base person, a man of iniquity, is he that walketh with a froward mouth; "
Proverbs,6,13,"That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, that pointeth with his fingers; "
Proverbs,6,14,"Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord. "
Proverbs,6,15,"Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy. "
Proverbs,6,16,"There are six things which HaShem hateth, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him: "
Proverbs,6,17,"Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; "
Proverbs,6,18,"A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil; "
Proverbs,6,19,"A false witness that breatheth out lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. "
Proverbs,6,20,"My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother; "
Proverbs,6,21,"Bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck. "
Proverbs,6,22,"When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. "
Proverbs,6,23,"For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life; "
Proverbs,6,24,"To keep thee from the evil woman, from the smoothness of the alien tongue. "
Proverbs,6,25,Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids. 
Proverbs,6,26,"For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, but the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. "
Proverbs,6,27,"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? "
Proverbs,6,28,"Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? "
Proverbs,6,29,So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished. 
Proverbs,6,30,"Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; "
Proverbs,6,31,"But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold, he must give all the substance of his house. "
Proverbs,6,32,He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he doeth it that would destroy his own soul. 
Proverbs,6,33,"Wounds and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away. "
Proverbs,6,34,"For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance. "
Proverbs,6,35,"He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. "
Proverbs,7,1,"My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. "
Proverbs,7,2,"Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the apple of thine eye. "
Proverbs,7,3,"Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart. "
Proverbs,7,4,"Say unto wisdom: 'Thou art my sister', and call understanding thy kinswoman; "
Proverbs,7,5,"That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words. "
Proverbs,7,6,For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice; 
Proverbs,7,7,"And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, "
Proverbs,7,8,"Passing through the street near her corner, and he went the way to her house; "
Proverbs,7,9,"In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness. "
Proverbs,7,10,"And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. "
Proverbs,7,11,"She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house; "
Proverbs,7,12,"Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner. "

Ruth,1,2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there. "
Ruth,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. "

Ruth,1,5,And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband. 
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of Moab how that HaShem had remembered His people in giving them bread. "
Ruth,1,7,"And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. "
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law: 'Go, return each of you to her mother's house; HaShem deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. "
Ruth,1,9,"HaShem grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.' Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. "
Ruth,1,10,"And they said unto her: 'Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.' "
Ruth,1,11,"And Naomi said: 'Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? "
Ruth,1,12,"Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an husband to-night, and also bear sons; "
Ruth,1,13,"would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of HaShem is gone forth against me.' "
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her. "
Ruth,1,15,"And she said: 'Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.' "
Ruth,1,16,"And Ruth said: 'Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy G-d my G-d; "
Ruth,1,17,"where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; HaShem do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.' "

Ruth,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: 'Is this Naomi?' "
Ruth,1,20,"And she said unto them: 'Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. "
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, and HaShem hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing HaShem hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?' "
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab--and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.  "
Ruth,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of valour, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. "
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi: 'Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find favour.' And she said unto her: 'Go, my daughter.' "
Ruth,2,3,"And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. "
Ruth,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: 'The HaShem be with you.' And they answered him: 'The HaShem bless thee.' "
Ruth,2,5,Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: 'Whose damsel is this?' 
Ruth,2,6,And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab; 
Ruth,2,7,"and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.' "
Ruth,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth: 'Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens. "
Ruth,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.' "
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?' "
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore. "
Ruth,2,12,"HaShem recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from HaShem, the G-d of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.' "
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my HaShem; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.' "
Ruth,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof. "
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame. "
Ruth,2,16,"And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.' "
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. "
Ruth,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied. "
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.' "
Ruth,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of HaShem, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.' "
Ruth,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said: 'Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.' "
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: 'It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be not met in any other field.' "
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law. 
Ruth,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: 'My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? "
Ruth,3,2,"And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor. "
Ruth,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. "
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.' "
Ruth,3,5,And she said unto her: 'All that thou sayest unto me I will do.' 
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. "
Ruth,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. "
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. "
Ruth,3,9,And he said: 'Who art thou?' And she answered: 'I am Ruth thine handmaid; spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.' 
Ruth,3,10,"And he said: 'Blessed be thou of HaShem, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow the young men, whether poor or rich. "
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman. "
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part; but if he be not willing to do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as HaShem liveth; lie down until the morning.' "
Ruth,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said: 'Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.' 
Ruth,3,15,"And he said: 'Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it'; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city. "
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: 'Who art thou, my daughter?' And she told her all that the man had done to her. "
Ruth,3,17,And she said: 'These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me: Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.' 
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she: 'Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.' "
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: 'Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.' And he turned aside, and sat down. "
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: 'Sit ye down here.' And they sat down. "
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman: 'Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's; "
Ruth,4,4,"and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.' And he said: 'I will redeem it.' "
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Boaz: 'What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi--hast thou also bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance?' "
Ruth,4,6,"And the near kinsman said: 'I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.'-- "
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel.-- "
Ruth,4,8,So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: 'Buy it for thyself.' And he drew off his shoe. 
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: 'Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. "
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this day.' "
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: 'We are witnesses. HaShem make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem; "
Ruth,4,12,"and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which HaShem shall give thee of this young woman.' "
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and HaShem gave her conception, and she bore a son. "
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi: 'Blessed be HaShem, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman, and let his name be famous in Israel. "
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.' "
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. "
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying: 'There is a son born to Naomi'; and they called his name Obed; he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. "
Ruth,4,18,Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron; 
Ruth,4,19,"and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; "
Ruth,4,20,"and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;"
Ruth,4,21,"and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed; "
Ruth,4,22,"and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.  "
Song of Solomon,1,1,"THE SONG of songs, which is Solomon's. "
Song of Solomon,1,2,Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth--for thy love is better than wine. 
Song of Solomon,1,3,Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the maidens love thee. 
Song of Solomon,1,4,"Draw me, we will run after thee; the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will find thy love more fragrant than wine! sincerely do they love thee. "
Song of Solomon,1,5,"'I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. "
Song of Solomon,1,6,"Look not upon me, that I am swarthy, that the sun hath tanned me; my mother's sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.' "
Song of Solomon,1,7,"Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; for why should I be as one that veileth herself beside the flocks of thy companions? "
Song of Solomon,1,8,"If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids, beside the shepherds' tents. "
Song of Solomon,1,9,"I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots. "
Song of Solomon,1,10,"Thy cheeks are comely with circlets, thy neck with beads. "
Song of Solomon,1,11,We will make thee circlets of gold with studs of silver. 
Song of Solomon,1,12,"While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance. "
Song of Solomon,1,13,"My beloved is unto me as a bag of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts. "
Song of Solomon,1,14,My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna in the vineyards of En-gedi. 
Song of Solomon,1,15,"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves. "
Song of Solomon,1,16,"Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; also our couch is leafy. "
Song of Solomon,1,17,"The beams of our houses are cedars, and our panels are cypresses. "
Song of Solomon,2,1,"I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. "
Song of Solomon,2,2,"As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. "
Song of Solomon,2,3,"As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit, and its fruit was sweet to my taste. "
Song of Solomon,2,4,"He hath brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me is love. "
Song of Solomon,2,5,"'Stay ye me with dainties, refresh me with apples; for I am love-sick.' "
Song of Solomon,2,6,"Let his left hand be under my head, and his right hand embrace me. "
Song of Solomon,2,7,"'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.' "
Song of Solomon,2,8,"Hark! my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. "
Song of Solomon,2,9,"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in through the windows, he peereth through the lattice. "
Song of Solomon,2,10,"My beloved spoke, and said unto me: 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. "
Song of Solomon,2,11,"For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; "
Song of Solomon,2,12,"The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; "
Song of Solomon,2,13,"The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines in blossom give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. "
Song of Solomon,2,14,"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.' "
Song of Solomon,2,15,"'Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.' "
Song of Solomon,2,16,"My beloved is mine, and I am his, that feedeth among the lilies. "
Song of Solomon,2,17,"Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hart upon the mountains of spices. "
Song of Solomon,3,1,"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth; I sought him, but I found him not. "
Song of Solomon,3,2,"'I will rise now, and go about the city, in the streets and in the broad ways, I will seek him whom my soul loveth.' I sought him, but I found him not. "
Song of Solomon,3,3,The watchmen that go about the city found me: 'Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?' 
Song of Solomon,3,4,"Scarce had I passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me. "
Song of Solomon,3,5,"'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.' "
Song of Solomon,3,6,"Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant? "
Song of Solomon,3,7,"Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. "
Song of Solomon,3,8,"They all handle the sword, and are expert in war; every man hath his sword upon his thigh, because of dread in the night. "
Song of Solomon,3,9,King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon. 
Song of Solomon,3,10,"He made the pillars thereof of silver, the top thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple, the inside thereof being inlaid with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem. "
Song of Solomon,3,11,"Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and gaze upon king Solomon, even upon the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart. "
Song of Solomon,4,1,"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from mount Gilead. "
Song of Solomon,4,2,"Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes all shaped alike, which are come up from the washing; whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them. "
Song of Solomon,4,3,"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely; thy temples are like a pomegranate split open behind thy veil. "
Song of Solomon,4,4,"Thy neck is like the tower of David builded with turrets, whereon there hang a thousand shields, all the armour of the mighty men. "
Song of Solomon,4,5,"Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lilies. "
Song of Solomon,4,6,"Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. "
Song of Solomon,4,7,"Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee. "
Song of Solomon,4,8,"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. "
Song of Solomon,4,9,"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one bead of thy necklace. "
Song of Solomon,4,10,"How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices! "
Song of Solomon,4,11,"Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey--honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. "
Song of Solomon,4,12,"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. "
Song of Solomon,4,13,"Thy shoots are a park of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants, "
Song of Solomon,4,14,"Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. "
Song of Solomon,4,15,"Thou art a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon. "
Song of Solomon,4,16,"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits. "
Song of Solomon,5,1,"I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. "
Song of Solomon,5,2,"I sleep, but my heart waketh; Hark! my beloved knocketh: 'Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.' "
Song of Solomon,5,3,I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 
Song of Solomon,5,4,"My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him. "
Song of Solomon,5,5,"I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bar. "
Song of Solomon,5,6,"I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had turned away, and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. "
Song of Solomon,5,7,"The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me. "
Song of Solomon,5,8,"'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him? that I am love-sick.' "
Song of Solomon,5,9,"'What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so adjure us?' "
Song of Solomon,5,10,"'My beloved is white and ruddy, pre-eminent above ten thousand. "
Song of Solomon,5,11,"His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are curled, and black as a raven. "
Song of Solomon,5,12,"His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks; washed with milk, and fitly set. "
Song of Solomon,5,13,"His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs; his lips are as lilies, dropping with flowing myrrh. "
Song of Solomon,5,14,His hands are as rods of gold set with beryl; his body is as polished ivory overlaid with sapphires. 
Song of Solomon,5,15,"His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold; his aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. "
Song of Solomon,5,16,"His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.' "
Song of Solomon,6,1,"'Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?' "
Song of Solomon,6,2,"'My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. "
Song of Solomon,6,3,"I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, that feedeth among the lilies.' "
Song of Solomon,6,4,"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. "
Song of Solomon,6,5,"Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from Gilead. "
Song of Solomon,6,6,"Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which are come up from the washing; whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them. "
Song of Solomon,6,7,Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open behind thy veil. 
Song of Solomon,6,8,"There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and maidens without number. "
Song of Solomon,6,9,"My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her happy; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. "
Song of Solomon,6,10,"Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners? "
Song of Solomon,6,11,"I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower. "
Song of Solomon,6,12,"Before I was aware, my soul set me upon the chariots of my princely people. "
Song of Solomon,7,1,"Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulammite? As it were a dance of two companies. "
Song of Solomon,7,2,"How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, the work of the hands of a skilled workman. "
Song of Solomon,7,3,"Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. "
Song of Solomon,7,4,Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle. 
Song of Solomon,7,5,"Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. "
Song of Solomon,7,6,"Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof. "
Song of Solomon,7,7,"How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! "
Song of Solomon,7,8,"This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. "
Song of Solomon,7,9,"I said: 'I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; and let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy countenance like apples; "
Song of Solomon,7,10,"And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, that glideth down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.' "
Song of Solomon,7,11,"I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. "
Song of Solomon,7,12,"Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. "
Song of Solomon,7,13,"Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love. "
Song of Solomon,7,14,"The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. "
Song of Solomon,8,1,"Oh that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, and none would despise me. "
Song of Solomon,8,2,"I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, that thou mightest instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. "
Song of Solomon,8,3,"His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. "
Song of Solomon,8,4,"'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem: Why should ye awaken, or stir up love, until it please?' "
Song of Solomon,8,5,"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened thee; there thy mother was in travail with thee; there was she in travail and brought thee forth. "
Song of Solomon,8,6,"Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very flame of HaShem. "
Song of Solomon,8,7,"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would utterly be contemned. "
Song of Solomon,8,8,"We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? "
Song of Solomon,8,9,"If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver; and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. "
Song of Solomon,8,10,"I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof; then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. "
Song of Solomon,8,11,Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he gave over the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof brought in a thousand pieces of silver. 
Song of Solomon,8,12,"My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. "
Song of Solomon,8,13,"Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice: 'Cause me to hear it.' "
Song of Solomon,8,14,"Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a gazelle or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.  "

Ecclesiastes,1,18,For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. 
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said in my heart: 'Come now, I will try thee with mirth, and enjoy pleasure'; and, behold, this also was vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,2,2,I said of laughter: 'It is mad'; and of mirth: 'What doth it accomplish?' 
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, till I might see which it was best for the sons of men that they should do under the heaven the few days of their life. "
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; 
Ecclesiastes,2,5,"I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; "
Ecclesiastes,2,6,"I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees; "
Ecclesiastes,2,7,"I acquired men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; "
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I gathered me also silver and gold, and treasure such as kings and the provinces have as their own; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, women very many. "
Ecclesiastes,2,9,"So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom stood me in stead. "
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart had joy of all my labour; and this was my portion from all my labour. "
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. "
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. "
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise man, his eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness. And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all. "
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then said I in my heart: 'As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?' Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise man die even as the fool! "
Ecclesiastes,2,17,So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. 
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. "
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun. 
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. "
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun? "
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy pleasure for his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of G-d. "
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I? "
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of G-d. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. "
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: "
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; "
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; "
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; "
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; "
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; "
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; "
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. "
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit hath he that worketh in that he laboureth? 
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the task which G-d hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He hath made every thing beautiful in its time; also He hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that G-d hath done from the beginning even to the end. "
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to get pleasure so long as they live. "
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"But also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his labour, is the gift of G-d. "
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know that, whatsoever G-d doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it; and G-d hath so made it, that men should fear before Him. "
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"That which is hath been long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and G-d seeketh that which is pursued. "
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. "
Ecclesiastes,3,17,I said in my heart: 'The righteous and the wicked G-d will judge; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.' 
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said in my heart: 'It is because of the sons of men, that G-d may sift them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.' "
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust. "
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth? "
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"Wherefore I perceived that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? "
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"But I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter. "
Ecclesiastes,4,2,Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; 
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"but better than they both is he that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. "
Ecclesiastes,4,5,"The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. "
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better is a handful of quietness, than both the hands full of labour and striving after wind. "
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. 
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches: 'for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?' This also is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business. "
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. "
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? "
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. "
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. "
Ecclesiastes,4,14,For out of prison he came forth to be king; although in his kingdom he was born poor. 
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the child, the second, that was to stand up in his stead. "
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom he did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind. "
Ecclesiastes,4,17,"Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of G-d, and be ready to hearken: it is better than when fools give sacrifices; for they know not that they do evil. "
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before G-d; for G-d is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. "
Ecclesiastes,5,2,For a dream cometh through a multitude of business; and a fool's voice through a multitude of words. 
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"When thou vowest a vow unto G-d, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou vowest. "
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. "
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt, neither say thou before the messenger, that it was an error; wherefore should G-d be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? "
Ecclesiastes,5,6,For through the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also many words; but fear thou G-d. 
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent perverting of justice and righteousness in the state, marvel not at the matter; for one higher than the high watcheth, and there are higher than they. "
Ecclesiastes,5,8,But the profit of a land every way is a king that maketh himself servant to the field. 
Ecclesiastes,5,9,"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase; this also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, saving the beholding of them with his eyes? "
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"Sweet is the sleep of a labouring man, whether he eat little or much; but the satiety of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. "
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt; "
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. "
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he go back as he came, and shall take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. "
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what profit hath he that he laboureth for the wind? "
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much vexation and sickness and wrath. "
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"Behold that which I have seen: it is good, yea, it is comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy pleasure for all his labour, wherein he laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which G-d hath given him; for this is his portion. "
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Every man also to whom G-d hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour--this is the gift of G-d. "
Ecclesiastes,5,19,For let him remember the days of his life that they are not many; for G-d answereth him in the joy of his heart. 
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men: "
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"a man to whom G-d giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet G-d giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. "
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul have not enough of good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he; "
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness; "
Ecclesiastes,6,5,moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath gratification rather than the other; 
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and enjoy no good; do not all go to one place? "
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. "
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or the poor man that hath understanding, in walking before the living? "
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire; this also is vanity and a striving after wind. 
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatsoever cometh into being, the name thereof was given long ago, and it is foreknown what man is; neither can he contend with Him that is mightier than he. "
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"Seeing there are many words that increase vanity, what is man the better? "
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? "
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. 
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. "
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart may be gladdened. 
Ecclesiastes,7,4,The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 
Ecclesiastes,7,5,"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. "
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely oppression turneth a wise man into a fool; and a gift destroyeth the understanding. 
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 
Ecclesiastes,7,10,Say not thou: 'How was it that the former days were better than these?' for it is not out of wisdom that thou inquirest concerning this. 
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Wisdom is good with an inheritance, yea, a profit to them that see the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. "
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider the work of G-d; for who can make that straight, which He hath made crooked? "
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; G-d hath made even the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. "
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing. "
Ecclesiastes,7,16,Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou die before thy time? "
Ecclesiastes,7,18,"It is good that thou shouldest take hold of the one; yea, also from the other withdraw not thy hand; for he that feareth G-d shall discharge himself of them all. "
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city. 
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. "
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee; "
Ecclesiastes,7,22,for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. 
Ecclesiastes,7,23,All this have I tried by wisdom; I said: 'I will get wisdom'; but it was far from me. 
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"That which is is far off, and exceeding deep; who can find it out? "
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I turned about, and applied my heart to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness; "
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth G-d shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. "
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Behold, this have I found, saith Koheleth, adding one thing to another, to find out the account; "
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"which yet my soul sought, but I found not; one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. "
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Behold, this only have I found, that G-d made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. "
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face is changed. "
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I counsel thee: keep the king's command, and that in regard of the oath of G-d. "
Ecclesiastes,8,3,Be not hasty to go out of his presence; stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
Ecclesiastes,8,4,Forasmuch as the king's word hath power; and who may say unto him: 'What doest thou?' 
Ecclesiastes,8,5,Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgment. 
Ecclesiastes,8,6,For to every matter there is a time and judgment; for the evil of man is great upon him. 
Ecclesiastes,8,7,"For he knoweth not that which shall be; for even when it cometh to pass, who shall declare it unto him? "
Ecclesiastes,8,8,There is no man that hath power over the wind to retain the wind; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it. 
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this have I seen, even applied my heart thereto, whatever the work that is done under the sun; what time one man had power over another to his hurt. "
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"And so I saw the wicked buried, and they entered into their rest; but they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city; this also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil; "
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"because a sinner doeth evil a hundred times, and prolongeth his days--though yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear G-d, that fear before Him; "
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not before G-d. "
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth: that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous--I said that this also is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"So I commended mirth, that a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry, and that this should accompany him in his labour all the days of his life which G-d hath given him under the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth--for neither day nor night do men see sleep with their eyes-- "
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"then I beheld all the work of G-d, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. "
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For all this I laid to my heart, even to make clear all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of G-d; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them. "
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. "
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. "
Ecclesiastes,9,4,For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. "
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is long ago perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for G-d hath already accepted thy works. "
Ecclesiastes,9,8,Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no oil. 
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which He hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatsoever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength, that do; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. "
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. "
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man also knoweth not his time; as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. "
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: "
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it; "
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. "
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"Then said I: 'Wisdom is better than strength; nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.' "
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words of the wise spoken in quiet are more acceptable than the cry of a ruler among fools. 
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good. 
Ecclesiastes,10,1,Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour. 
Ecclesiastes,10,2,A wise man's understanding is at his right hand; but a fool's understanding at his left. 
Ecclesiastes,10,3,"Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. "
Ecclesiastes,10,4,"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences. "
Ecclesiastes,10,5,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from a ruler: "
Ecclesiastes,10,6,"Folly is set on great heights, and the rich sit in low place. "
Ecclesiastes,10,7,"I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. "
Ecclesiastes,10,8,"He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him. "
Ecclesiastes,10,9,Whoso quarrieth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. 
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct. "
Ecclesiastes,10,11,"If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then the charmer hath no advantage. "
Ecclesiastes,10,12,The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 
Ecclesiastes,10,13,The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is grievous madness. 
Ecclesiastes,10,14,"A fool also multiplieth words; yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him? "
Ecclesiastes,10,15,"The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city. "
Ecclesiastes,10,16,"Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy, and thy princes feast in the morning! "
Ecclesiastes,10,17,"Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man, and thy princes eat in due season, in strength, and not in drunkenness! "
Ecclesiastes,10,18,By slothfulness the rafters sink in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. 
Ecclesiastes,10,19,"A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things. "
Ecclesiastes,10,20,"Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought, and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. "
Ecclesiastes,11,1,"Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days. "
Ecclesiastes,11,2,"Divide a portion into seven, yea, even into eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. "
Ecclesiastes,11,3,"If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall in the south, or in the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. "
Ecclesiastes,11,4,He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of G-d who doeth all things. "
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. "
Ecclesiastes,11,7,"And the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. "
Ecclesiastes,11,8,"For if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. all that cometh is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,11,9,"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things G-d will bring thee into judgment. "
Ecclesiastes,11,10,"Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,12,1,"Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say: 'I have no pleasure in them'; "
Ecclesiastes,12,2,"Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain; "
Ecclesiastes,12,3,"In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out shall be darkened in the windows, "
Ecclesiastes,12,4,"And the doors shall be shut in the street, when the sound of the grinding is low; and one shall start up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; "
Ecclesiastes,12,5,"Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall drag itself along, and the caperberry shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets; "
Ecclesiastes,12,6,"Before the silver cord is snapped asunder, and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel falleth shattered, into the pit; "
Ecclesiastes,12,7,"And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto G-d who gave it. "
Ecclesiastes,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; all is vanity. "
Ecclesiastes,12,9,"And besides that Koheleth was wise, he also taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. "
Ecclesiastes,12,10,"Koheleth sought to find out words of delight, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth. "
Ecclesiastes,12,11,"The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are those that are composed in collections; they are given from one shepherd. "
Ecclesiastes,12,12,"And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. "
Ecclesiastes,12,13,"The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear G-d, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole man. "
Ecclesiastes,12,14,"For G-d shall bring every work into the judgment concerning every hidden thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.  "
Lamentations,1,1,"HOW DOTH the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow! She that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary! "
Lamentations,1,2,"She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; she hath none to comfort her among all her lovers; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. "
Lamentations,1,3,"Judah is gone into exile because of affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest; all her pursuers overtook her within the straits. "
Lamentations,1,4,"The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; all her gates are desolate, her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness. "
Lamentations,1,5,"Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies are at ease; for HaShem hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary. "
Lamentations,1,6,"And gone is from the daughter of Zion all her splendour; her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. "
Lamentations,1,7,"Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her anguish all her treasures that she had from the days of old; now that her people fall by the hand of the adversary, and none doth help her, the adversaries have seen her, they have mocked at her desolations. "
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore she is become as one unclean; all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness; she herself also sigheth, and turneth backward. "
Lamentations,1,9,"Her filthiness was in her skirts, she was not mindful of her end; therefore is she come down wonderfully, she hath no comforter. 'Behold, O HaShem, my affliction, for the enemy hath magnified himself.' "
Lamentations,1,10,"The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her treasures; for she hath seen that the heathen are entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom Thou didst command that they should not enter into Thy congregation. "
Lamentations,1,11,"All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul. 'See, O HaShem, and behold, how abject I am become.' "
Lamentations,1,12,"'Let it not come unto you, all ye that pass by! Behold, and see if there be any pain like unto my pain, which is done unto me, wherewith HaShem hath afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger. "
Lamentations,1,13,"From on high hath He sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me back; He hath made me desolate and faint all the day. "
Lamentations,1,14,"The yoke of my transgressions is impressed by His hand; they are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; He hath made my strength to fail; the L-rd hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand. "
Lamentations,1,15,The L-rd hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men; the L-rd hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin the daughter of Judah.' 
Lamentations,1,16,"'For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; because the comforter is far from me, even he that should refresh my soul; my children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.' "
Lamentations,1,17,"Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; HaShem hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem is among them as one unclean. "
Lamentations,1,18,"'The HaShem is righteous; for I have rebelled against His word; hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my pain: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. "
Lamentations,1,19,"I called for my lovers, but they deceived me; my priests and mine elders perished in the city, while they sought them food to refresh their souls. "
Lamentations,1,20,"Behold, O HaShem, for I am in distress, mine inwards burn; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is the like of death. "
Lamentations,1,21,"They have heard that I sigh, there is none to comfort me; all mine enemies have heard of my trouble, and are glad, for Thou hast done it; Thou wilt bring the day that Thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me. "
Lamentations,1,22,"Let all their wickedness come before Thee; and do unto them, as Thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions; for my sighs are many and my heart is faint.' "
Lamentations,2,1,"How hath the L-rd covered with a cloud the daughter of Zion in His anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and hath not remembered His footstool in the day of His anger. "
Lamentations,2,2,The L-rd hath swallowed up unsparingly all the habitations of Jacob; He hath thrown down in His wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof. 
Lamentations,2,3,"He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back His right hand from before the enemy; and He hath burned in Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. "
Lamentations,2,4,"He hath bent His bow like an enemy, standing with His right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye; in the tent of the daughter of Zion He hath poured out His fury like fire. "
Lamentations,2,5,"The L-rd is become as an enemy, He hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, He hath destroyed his strongholds; and He hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and moaning. "
Lamentations,2,6,"And He hath stripped His tabernacle, as if it were a garden, He hath destroyed His place of assembly; HaShem hath caused to be forgotten in Zion appointed season and sabbath, and hath rejected in the indignation of His anger the king and the priest. "
Lamentations,2,7,"The L-rd hath cast off His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary, He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of HaShem, as in the day of a solemn assembly. "
Lamentations,2,8,"HaShem hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, He hath not withdrawn His hand from destroying; but He hath made the rampart and wall to mourn, they languish together. "
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates are sunk into the ground; He hath destroyed and broken her bars; her king and her princes are among the nations, instruction is no more; yea, her prophets find no vision from HaShem. "
Lamentations,2,10,"They sit upon the ground, and keep silence, the elders of the daughter of Zion; they have cast up dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. "
Lamentations,2,11,"Mine eyes do fail with tears, mine inwards burn, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the breach of the daughter of my people; because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the broad places of the city. "
Lamentations,2,12,"They say to their mothers: 'Where is corn and wine?' when they swoon as the wounded in the broad places of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom. "
Lamentations,2,13,"What shall I take to witness for thee? What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea; who can heal thee? "
Lamentations,2,14,"Thy prophets have seen visions for thee of vanity and delusion; and they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity; but have prophesied for thee burdens of vanity and seduction. "
Lamentations,2,15,"All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: 'Is this the city that men called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?' "
Lamentations,2,16,"All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say: 'We have swallowed her up; certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.' "
Lamentations,2,17,"HaShem hath done that which He devised; He hath performed His word that He commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down unsparingly; and He hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, He hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries. "
Lamentations,2,18,"Their heart cried unto the L-rd: 'O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease. "
Lamentations,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the L-rd; lift up thy hands toward Him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.' "
Lamentations,2,20,"'See, O HaShem, and consider, to whom Thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the L-rd? "
Lamentations,2,21,The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; Thou hast slain them in the day of Thine anger; Thou hast slaughtered unsparingly. 
Lamentations,2,22,"Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side, and there was none in the day of HaShem'S anger that escaped or remained; those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.' "
Lamentations,3,1,I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of His wrath. 
Lamentations,3,2,He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light. 
Lamentations,3,3,Surely against me He turneth His hand again and again all the day. 
Lamentations,3,4,My flesh and my skin hath He worn out; He hath broken my bones. 
Lamentations,3,5,"He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. "
Lamentations,3,6,"He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. "
Lamentations,3,7,"He hath hedged me about, that I cannot go forth; He hath made my chain heavy. "
Lamentations,3,8,"Yea, when I cry and call for help, He shutteth out my prayer. "
Lamentations,3,9,"He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, He hath made my paths crooked. "
Lamentations,3,10,"He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. "
Lamentations,3,11,"He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; He hath made me desolate. "
Lamentations,3,12,"He hath bent His bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. "
Lamentations,3,13,He hath caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my reins. 
Lamentations,3,14,"I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day. "
Lamentations,3,15,"He hath filled me with bitterness, He hath sated me with wormwood. "
Lamentations,3,16,"He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, He hath made me to wallow in ashes. "
Lamentations,3,17,"And my soul is removed far off from peace, I forgot prosperity. "
Lamentations,3,18,"And I said: 'My strength is perished, and mine expectation from HaShem.' "
Lamentations,3,19,"Remember mine affliction and mine anguish, the wormwood and the gall. "
Lamentations,3,20,"My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me. "
Lamentations,3,21,"This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. "
Lamentations,3,22,"Surely HaShem'S mercies are not consumed, surely His compassions fail not. "
Lamentations,3,23,They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness. 
Lamentations,3,24,"'The HaShem is my portion', saith my soul; 'Therefore will I hope in Him.' "
Lamentations,3,25,"HaShem is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him. "
Lamentations,3,26,It is good that a man should quietly wait for the salvation of HaShem. 
Lamentations,3,27,It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
Lamentations,3,28,"Let him sit alone and keep silence, because He hath laid it upon him. "
Lamentations,3,29,"Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. "
Lamentations,3,30,Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him let him be filled full with reproach. 
Lamentations,3,31,For the L-rd will not cast off for ever. 
Lamentations,3,32,"For though He cause grief, yet will He have compassion according to the multitude of His mercies. "
Lamentations,3,33,"For He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. "
Lamentations,3,34,"To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, "
Lamentations,3,35,"To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, "
Lamentations,3,36,"To subvert a man in his cause, the L-rd approveth not. "
Lamentations,3,37,"Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the L-rd commandeth it not? "
Lamentations,3,38,Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good? 
Lamentations,3,39,"Wherefore doth a living man complain, a strong man because of his sins? "
Lamentations,3,40,"Let us search and try our ways, and return to HaShem. "
Lamentations,3,41,Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto G-d in the heavens. 
Lamentations,3,42,We have transgressed and have rebelled; Thou hast not pardoned. 
Lamentations,3,43,Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; Thou hast slain unsparingly. 
Lamentations,3,44,"Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. "
Lamentations,3,45,Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. 
Lamentations,3,46,All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 
Lamentations,3,47,"Terror and the pit are come upon us, desolation and destruction. "
Lamentations,3,48,"Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water, for the breach of the daughter of my people. "
Lamentations,3,49,"Mine eye is poured out, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, "
Lamentations,3,50,"Till HaShem look forth, and behold from heaven. "
Lamentations,3,51,"Mine eye affected my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. "
Lamentations,3,52,"They have chased me sore like a bird, that are mine enemies without cause. "
Lamentations,3,53,"They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast stones upon me. "
Lamentations,3,54,Waters flowed over my head; I said: 'I am cut off.' 
Lamentations,3,55,"I called upon Thy name, O HaShem, Out of the lowest dungeon. "
Lamentations,3,56,"Thou heardest my voice; hide not Thine ear at my sighing, at my cry. "
Lamentations,3,57,Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon Thee; Thou saidst: 'Fear not.' 
Lamentations,3,58,"O L-rd, Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; Thou hast redeemed my life. "
Lamentations,3,59,"O HaShem, Thou hast seen my wrong; judge Thou my cause. "
Lamentations,3,60,Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. 
Lamentations,3,61,"Thou hast heard their taunt, O HaShem, and all their devices against me; "
Lamentations,3,62,"The lips of those that rose up against me, and their muttering against me all the day. "
Lamentations,3,63,"Behold Thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. "
Lamentations,3,64,"Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O HaShem, according to the work of their hands. "
Lamentations,3,65,"Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, Thy curse unto them. "
Lamentations,3,66,"Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of HaShem. "
Lamentations,4,1,How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed! The hallowed stones are poured out at the head of every street. 
Lamentations,4,2,"The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! "
Lamentations,4,3,"Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones; the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. "
Lamentations,4,4,"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask bread, and none breaketh it unto them. "
Lamentations,4,5,They that did feed on dainties are desolate in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
Lamentations,4,6,"For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands fell upon her. "
Lamentations,4,7,"Her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire; "
Lamentations,4,8,"Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets; their skin is shrivelled upon their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. "
Lamentations,4,9,"They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. "
Lamentations,4,10,The hands of women full of compassion have sodden their own children; they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
Lamentations,4,11,"HaShem hath accomplished His fury, He hath poured out His fierce anger; and He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. "
Lamentations,4,12,"The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem. "
Lamentations,4,13,"It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. "
Lamentations,4,14,"They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments. "
Lamentations,4,15,"'Depart ye! unclean!' men cried unto them, 'Depart, depart, touch not'; yea, they fled away and wandered; men said among the nations: 'They shall no more sojourn here.' "
Lamentations,4,16,"The anger of HaShem hath divided them; He will no more regard them; they respected not the persons of the priests, they were not gracious unto the elders. "
Lamentations,4,17,"As for us, our eyes do yet fail for our vain help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. "
Lamentations,4,18,"They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our broad places; our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. "
Lamentations,4,19,"Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heaven; they chased us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. "
Lamentations,4,20,"The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of HaShem, was taken in their pits; of whom we said: 'Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.' "
Lamentations,4,21,"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass over unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. "
Lamentations,4,22,"The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion, He will no more carry thee away into captivity; He will punish thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He will uncover thy sins. "
Lamentations,5,1,"Remember, O HaShem, what is come upon us; behold, and see our reproach. "
Lamentations,5,2,"Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, our houses unto aliens. "
Lamentations,5,3,"We are become orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. "
Lamentations,5,4,We have drunk our water for money; our wood cometh to us for price. 
Lamentations,5,5,"To our very necks we are pursued; we labour, and have no rest. "
Lamentations,5,6,"We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to have bread enough; "
Lamentations,5,7,"Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. "
Lamentations,5,8,Servants rule over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hand. 
Lamentations,5,9,We get our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 
Lamentations,5,10,Our skin is hot like an oven because of the burning heat of famine. 
Lamentations,5,11,"They have ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah. "
Lamentations,5,12,Princes are hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders are not honoured. 
Lamentations,5,13,"The young men have borne the mill, and the children have stumbled under the wood. "
Lamentations,5,14,"The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. "
Lamentations,5,15,The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
Lamentations,5,16,The crown is fallen from our head; woe unto us! for we have sinned. 
Lamentations,5,17,"For this our heart is faint, for these things our eyes are dim; "
Lamentations,5,18,"For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. "
Lamentations,5,19,"Thou, O HaShem, art enthroned for ever, Thy throne is from generation to generation. "
Lamentations,5,20,"Wherefore dost Thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? "
Lamentations,5,21,"Turn Thou us unto Thee, O HaShem, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. "
Lamentations,5,22,"Thou canst not have utterly rejected us, and be exceeding wroth against us!  "
Esther,1,1,"NOW IT came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus--this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces-- "
Esther,1,2,"that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the castle, "
Esther,1,3,"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him; "
Esther,1,4,"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty, many days, even a hundred and fourscore days. "
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the castle, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; "
Esther,1,6,"there were hangings of white, fine cotton, and blue, bordered with cords of fine linen and purple, upon silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and shell, and onyx marble. "
Esther,1,7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold--the vessels being diverse one from another--and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. "
Esther,1,8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. "
Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. 
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, "
Esther,1,11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on. "
Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains; therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. "
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times--for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment; "
Esther,1,14,"and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat the first in the kingdom: "
Esther,1,15,"'What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, forasmuch as she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?' "
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: 'Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples, that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. "
Esther,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it will be said: The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. "
Esther,1,18,And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king's princes. So will there arise enough contempt and wrath. 
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and that the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. "
Esther,1,20,"And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, great though it be, all the wives will give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.' "
Esther,1,21,And the word pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan; 
Esther,1,22,"for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people. "
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was assuaged, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. "
Esther,2,2,Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him: 'Let there be sought for the king young virgins fair to look on; 
Esther,2,3,"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their ointments be given them; "
Esther,2,4,and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.' And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. 
Esther,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite, "
Esther,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. "
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was of beautiful form and fair to look on; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter. "
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was published, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the castle, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. "
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her ointments, with her portions, and the seven maidens, who were meet to be given her out of the king's house; and he advanced her and her maidens to the best place in the house of the women. "
Esther,2,10,Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not tell it. 
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her. "
Esther,2,12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months--for so were the days of their anointing accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six month with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women-- "
Esther,2,13,"when then the maiden came unto the king, whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. "
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name. "
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. "
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. "
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. "
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king. "
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, and Mordecai sat in the king's gate-- "
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him-- "
Esther,2,21,"in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. "
Esther,2,22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai's name. "
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.  "
Esther,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. "
Esther,3,2,"And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed down, and prostrated themselves before Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him. "
Esther,3,3,"Then the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai: 'Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?' "
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. "
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him, then was Haman full of wrath. "
Esther,3,6,"But it seemed contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. "
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. "
Esther,3,8,And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus: 'There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king's laws; therefore it profiteth not the king to suffer them. 
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.' "
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. "
Esther,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman: 'The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.' "
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written, according to all that Haman commanded, unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring. "
Esther,3,13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. "
Esther,3,14,"The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all peoples, that they should be ready against that day. "
Esther,3,15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle; and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed. "
Esther,4,1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; "
Esther,4,2,and he came even before the king's gate; for none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. 
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. "
Esther,4,4,And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly pained; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai; and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he accepted it not. 
Esther,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was. "
Esther,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate. "
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. "
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people. "
Esther,4,9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai: "
Esther,4,11,"'All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.' "
Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. 
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai bade them to return answer unto Esther: 'Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. "
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish; and who knoweth whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a time as this?' "
Esther,4,15,Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai: 
Esther,4,16,"'Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.' "
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. "
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house. "
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. "
Esther,5,3,"Then said the king unto her: 'What wilt thou, queen Esther? for whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be given thee.' "
Esther,5,4,"And Esther said: 'If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.' "
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said: 'Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said.' So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. "
Esther,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine: 'Whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.' "
Esther,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said: 'My petition and my request is-- "
Esther,5,8,"if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request--let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.' "
Esther,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai. "
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife. "
Esther,5,11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and everything as to how the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. "
Esther,5,12,"Haman said moreover: 'Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king. "
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.' "
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him: 'Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.' And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. "
Esther,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king. "
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those that kept the door, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. "
Esther,6,3,And the king said: 'What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?' Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him: 'There is nothing done for him.' 
Esther,6,4,"And the king said: 'Who is in the court?' --Now Haman was come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.-- "
Esther,6,5,"And the king's servants said unto him: 'Behold, Haman standeth in the court.' And the king said: 'Let him come in.' "
Esther,6,6,So Haman came in. And the king said unto him: 'What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?' --Now Haman said in his heart: 'Whom would the king delight to honour besides myself?'-- 
Esther,6,7,"And Haman said unto the king: 'For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, "
Esther,6,8,"let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on whose head a crown royal is set; "
Esther,6,9,"and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honour, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.' "
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman: 'Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.' "
Esther,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him: 'Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.' "
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. "
Esther,6,13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him: 'If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.' "
Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared. "
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine: 'Whatever thy petition, queen Esther, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.' "
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said: 'If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request; "
Esther,7,4,"for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the king be endamaged.' "
Esther,7,5,"Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen: 'Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?' "
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said: 'An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman.' Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen. "
Esther,7,7,And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman remained to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. 
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king: 'Will he even force the queen before me in the house?' As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. "
Esther,7,9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king: 'Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.' And the king said: 'Hang him thereon.' "
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath assuaged. 
Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. 
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. "
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. "
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king. "
Esther,8,5,"And she said: 'If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces; "
Esther,8,6,for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?' 
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew: 'Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. "
Esther,8,8,"Write ye also concerning the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.' "
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king's scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, even to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language. "
Esther,8,10,"And they wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud; "
Esther,8,11,"that the king had granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, and to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, "
Esther,8,12,"upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. "
Esther,8,13,"The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. "
Esther,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle. "
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a rob of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad. "
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour. "
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them. "
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; "
Esther,9,2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples. "
Esther,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them. "
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. "
Esther,9,5,"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them. "
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan the castle the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, "
Esther,9,8,"and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, "
Esther,9,9,"and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha, "
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. "
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the castle was brought before the king. 
Esther,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen: 'The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the castle, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request further, it shall be done.' "
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther: 'If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.' "
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done; and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 
Esther,9,15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. "
Esther,9,16,"And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand--but on the spoil they laid not their hand-- "
Esther,9,17,"on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. "
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. "
Esther,9,19,"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. "
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, "
Esther,9,21,"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, "
Esther,9,22,"the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. "
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews took upon them to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; "
Esther,9,24,"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast pur, that is, the lot, to discomfit them, and to destroy them; "
Esther,9,25,"but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. "
Esther,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, "
Esther,9,27,"the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; "
Esther,9,28,"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. "
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote down all the acts of power, to confirm this second letter of Purim. "
Esther,9,30,"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, "
Esther,9,31,"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. "
Esther,9,32,And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.  
Esther,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. "
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, how the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? "
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his seed.  "
Daniel,1,1,"IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. "
Daniel,1,2,"And the L-rd gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of G-d; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god. "
Daniel,1,3,"And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles, "
Daniel,1,4,"youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. "
Daniel,1,5,"And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. "
Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. "
Daniel,1,7,"And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego. "
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself. "
Daniel,1,9,And G-d granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers. 
Daniel,1,10,"And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: 'I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.' "
Daniel,1,11,"Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: "
Daniel,1,12,"'Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. "
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.' "
Daniel,1,14,"So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days. "
Daniel,1,15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king's food. "
Daniel,1,16,"So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse. "
Daniel,1,17,"Now as for these four youths, G-d gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. "
Daniel,1,18,"And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. "
Daniel,1,19,"And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king. "
Daniel,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. "
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. 
Daniel,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him. "
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. "
Daniel,2,3,"And the king said unto them: 'I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.' "
Daniel,2,4,"Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic: 'O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.' "
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans: 'The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. "
Daniel,2,6,"But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.' "
Daniel,2,7,"They answered the second time and said: 'Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.' "
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said: 'I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me, "
Daniel,2,9,"that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof.' "
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: 'There is not a man upon the earth that can declare the king's matter; forasmuch as no great and powerful king hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. "
Daniel,2,11,"And it is a hard thing that the king asketh, and there is none other that can declare it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.' "
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. "
Daniel,2,13,"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain. "
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; "
Daniel,2,15,he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain: 'Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?' Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
Daniel,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, that he might declare unto the king the interpretation. "
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; "
Daniel,2,18,that they might ask mercy of the G-d of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the G-d of heaven. 
Daniel,2,20,Daniel spoke and said: Blessed be the name of G-d from everlasting even unto everlasting; for wisdom and might are His; 
Daniel,2,21,"And He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding; "
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him. "
Daniel,2,23,"I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou G-d of my fathers, who hath given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee; for Thou hast made known unto us the king's matter. "
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: 'Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.' "
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: 'I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.' "
Daniel,2,26,"The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: 'Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?' "
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said: 'The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the king; "
Daniel,2,28,"but there is a G-d in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: "
Daniel,2,29,"as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass. "
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart. "
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing, stood before thee; and the appearance thereof was terrible. "
Daniel,2,32,"As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, "
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. "
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces. "
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. "
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. 
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the G-d of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; "
Daniel,2,38,"and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven dwell, hath He given them into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all; thou art the head of gold. "
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. "
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and beateth down all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. "
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the firmness of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. "
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part thereof broken. "
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. "
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of those kings shall the G-d of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; nor shall the kingdom be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but it shall stand for ever. "
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great G-d hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.' "
Daniel,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odours unto him. "
Daniel,2,47,"The king spoke unto Daniel, and said: 'Of a truth it is, that your G-d is the G-d of gods, and the L-rd of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.' "
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. "
Daniel,2,49,"And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king. "
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. "
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. "
Daniel,3,3,"Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. "
Daniel,3,4,"And the herald cried aloud: 'To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, "
Daniel,3,5,"that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up; "
Daniel,3,6,and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.' 
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. "
Daniel,3,8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. "
Daniel,3,9,"They spoke and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: 'O king, live for ever! "
Daniel,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; "
Daniel,3,11,and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.' "
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king. "
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them: 'Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? "
Daniel,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made ,well; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?' "
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king: 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter. "
Daniel,3,17,"If our G-d whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and out of thy hand, O king. "
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.' "
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. "
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. "
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. "
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king's commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. "
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. "
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was alarmed, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his ministers: 'Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?' They answered and said unto the king: 'True, O king.' "
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said: 'Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.' "
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said: 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of G-d Most High, come forth, and come hither.' Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire. "
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them. "
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: 'Blessed be the G-d of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own G-d. "
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the G-d of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.' "
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon. "
Daniel,3,31,"'Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; peace be multiplied unto you. "
Daniel,3,32,It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that G-d Most High hath wrought toward me. 
Daniel,3,33,"How great are His signs! and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation. "
Daniel,4,1,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. "
Daniel,4,2,I saw a dream which made me afraid; and imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head affrighted me. 
Daniel,4,3,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. "
Daniel,4,4,"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. "
Daniel,4,5,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before him: "
Daniel,4,6,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret causeth thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. "
Daniel,4,7,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. "
Daniel,4,8,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. "
Daniel,4,9,"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. "
Daniel,4,10,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven. "
Daniel,4,11,"He cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. "
Daniel,4,12,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth; "
Daniel,4,13,"Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. "
Daniel,4,14,"The matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the sentence by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men. "
Daniel,4,15,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.' "
Daniel,4,16,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him. The king spoke and said: 'Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee.' Belteshazzar answered and said: 'My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. "
Daniel,4,17,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; "
Daniel,4,18,"whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation; "
Daniel,4,19,"it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. "
Daniel,4,20,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying: Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him-- "
Daniel,4,21,"this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king, "
Daniel,4,22,"that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will. "
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. "
Daniel,4,24,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity.' "
Daniel,4,25,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 
Daniel,4,26,At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon. 
Daniel,4,27,"The king spoke, and said: 'Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?' "
Daniel,4,28,"While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: 'O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee. "
Daniel,4,29,"And thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will.' "
Daniel,4,30,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. "
Daniel,4,31,"'And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever; for His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom from generation to generation; "
Daniel,4,32,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and He doeth according to His will in the host of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him: What doest Thou? "
Daniel,4,33,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendour returned unto me; and my ministers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added unto me. "
Daniel,4,34,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all His works are truth, and His ways justice; and those that walk in pride He is able to abase.' "
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. "
Daniel,5,2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, might drink therein. "
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of G-d which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, drank in them. "
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. "
Daniel,5,5,"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote. "
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts affrighted him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. "
Daniel,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon: 'Whosoever shall read this writing, and declare unto me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as one of three in the kingdom.' "
Daniel,5,8,"Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation. "
Daniel,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly affrighted, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed. "
Daniel,5,10,"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house; the queen spoke and said: 'O king, live for ever! let not thy thoughts affright thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; "
Daniel,5,11,"there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers; "
Daniel,5,12,"forasmuch as a surpassing spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring of riddles, and loosing of knots, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will declare the interpretation.' "
Daniel,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel: 'Art thou Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? "
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and surpassing wisdom is found in thee. "
Daniel,5,15,"And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not declare the interpretation of the thing. "
Daniel,5,16,"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and loose knots; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as one of three in the kingdom.' "
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king: 'Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. "
Daniel,5,18,"O thou king, G-d Most High gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty; "
Daniel,5,19,"and because of the greatness that He gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. "
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him; "
Daniel,5,21,"and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that G-d Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that He setteth up over it whomsoever He will. "
Daniel,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this; "
Daniel,5,23,"but hast lifted up thyself against the L-rd of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy consorts and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the G-d in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified; "
Daniel,5,24,"then was the palm of the hand sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed. "
Daniel,5,25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN. "
Daniel,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, G-d hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end. "
Daniel,5,27,"TEKEL, Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. "
Daniel,5,28,"PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.' "
Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should rule as one of three in the kingdom. "
Daniel,5,30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. 
Daniel,6,1,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old. "
Daniel,6,2,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; "
Daniel,6,3,"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage. "
Daniel,6,4,"Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and the satraps, because a surpassing spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. "
Daniel,6,5,"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. "
Daniel,6,6,"Then said these men: 'We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the matter of the law of his G-d.' "
Daniel,6,7,"Then these presidents and satraps came tumultuously to the king, and said thus unto him: 'King Darius, live for ever! "
Daniel,6,8,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the ministers and the governors, have consulted together that the king should establish a statute, and make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. "
Daniel,6,9,"Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.' "
Daniel,6,10,Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict. 
Daniel,6,11,"And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house--now his windows were open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem--and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his G-d, as he did aforetime. "
Daniel,6,12,"Then these men came tumultuously, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his G-d. "
Daniel,6,13,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's interdict: 'Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?' The king answered and said: 'The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.' "
Daniel,6,14,"Then answered they and said before the king: 'That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.' "
Daniel,6,15,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. "
Daniel,6,16,"Then these men came tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king: 'Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.' "
Daniel,6,17,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel: 'Thy G-d whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.' "
Daniel,6,18,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. "
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were diversions brought before him; and his sleep fled from him. "
Daniel,6,20,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. "
Daniel,6,21,"And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a pained voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel: 'O Daniel, servant of the living G-d, is thy G-d, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?' "
Daniel,6,22,"Then said Daniel unto the king: 'O king, live for ever! "
Daniel,6,23,"My G-d hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.' "
Daniel,6,24,"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his G-d. "
Daniel,6,25,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and they had not come to the bottom of the den, when the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces. "
Daniel,6,26,"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: 'Peace be multiplied unto you. "
Daniel,6,27,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the G-d of Daniel; for He is the living G-d, and stedfast for ever, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and His dominion shall be even unto the end; "
Daniel,6,28,"He delivereth and rescueth, and He worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth; who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.' "
Daniel,6,29,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. "
Daniel,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. 
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea. "
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. "
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. "
Daniel,7,5,"And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.' "
Daniel,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. "
Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. "
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. "
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire. "
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened. "
Daniel,7,11,"I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. "
Daniel,7,12,"And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. "
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of days, and he was brought near before Him. "
Daniel,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. "
Daniel,7,15,"As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me. "
Daniel,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things: "
Daniel,7,17,"'These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. "
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.' "
Daniel,7,19,"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; "
Daniel,7,20,"and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows. "
Daniel,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; "
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom. "
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. "
Daniel,7,24,"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. "
Daniel,7,25,"And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. "
Daniel,7,26,"But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end. "
Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.' "
Daniel,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart. "
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. "
Daniel,8,2,"And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai. "
Daniel,8,3,"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. "
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. "
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. "
Daniel,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power. "
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. "
Daniel,8,8,"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven. "
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land. "
Daniel,8,10,"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. "
Daniel,8,11,"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. "
Daniel,8,12,"And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered. "
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: 'How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?' "
Daniel,8,14,And he said unto me: 'Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.' 
Daniel,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. "
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.' "
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: 'Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.' "
Daniel,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. "
Daniel,8,19,"And he said: 'Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. "
Daniel,8,20,"The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. "
Daniel,8,21,And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 
Daniel,8,22,"And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. "
Daniel,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems. "
Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints. "
Daniel,8,25,"And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. "
Daniel,8,26,"And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.' "
Daniel,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was appalled at the vision, but understood it not. "
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; "
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign I Daniel meditated in the books, over the number of the years, whereof the word of HaShem came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years. "
Daniel,9,3,"And I set my face unto the L-rd G-d, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes. "
Daniel,9,4,"And I prayed unto HaShem my G-d, and made confession, and said: 'O L-rd, the great and awful G-d, who keepest covenant and mercy with them that love Thee and keep Thy commandments, "
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned, and have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments and from Thine ordinances; "
Daniel,9,6,"neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, that spoke in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. "
Daniel,9,7,"Unto Thee, O L-rd, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou hast driven them, because they dealt treacherously with Thee. "
Daniel,9,8,"O HaShem, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee. "
Daniel,9,9,To the L-rd our G-d belong compassions and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against Him; 
Daniel,9,10,"neither have we hearkened to the voice of HaShem our G-d, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets. "
Daniel,9,11,"Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, and have turned aside, so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and so there hath been poured out upon us the curse and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of G-d; for we have sinned against Him. "
Daniel,9,12,"And He hath confirmed His word, which He spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. "
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet have we not entreated the favour of HaShem our G-d, that we might turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in Thy truth. "
Daniel,9,14,"And so HaShem hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for HaShem our G-d is righteous in all His works which He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice. "
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O L-rd our G-d, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. "
Daniel,9,16,"O L-rd, according to all Thy righteousness, let Thine anger and Thy fury, I pray Thee, be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. "
Daniel,9,17,"Now therefore, O our G-d, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the L-rd's sake. "
Daniel,9,18,"O my G-d, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city upon which Thy name is called; for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousness, but because of Thy great compassions. "
Daniel,9,19,"O L-rd, hear, O L-rd, forgive, O L-rd, attend and do, defer not; for Thine own sake, O my G-d, because Thy name is called upon Thy city and Thy people.' "
Daniel,9,20,"And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before HaShem my G-d for the holy mountain of my G-d; "
Daniel,9,21,"yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, approached close to me about the time of the evening offering. "
Daniel,9,22,"And he made me to understand, and talked with me, and said: 'O Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding. "
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of thy supplications a word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore look into the word, and understand the vision. "
Daniel,9,24,"Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sin, and to forgive iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy place. "
Daniel,9,25,"Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto one anointed, a prince, shall be seven weeks; and for threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with broad place and moat, but in troublous times. "
Daniel,9,26,"And after the threescore and two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and be no more; and the people of a prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; but his end shall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. "
Daniel,9,27,And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease; and upon the wing of detestable things shall be that which causeth appalment; and that until the extermination wholly determined be poured out upon that which causeth appalment.' 
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, even a great warfare; and he gave heed to the word, and had understanding of the vision. "
Daniel,10,2,In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks. 
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. "
Daniel,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris, "
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz; "
Daniel,10,6,"his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. "
Daniel,10,7,"And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; howbeit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. "
Daniel,10,8,"So that I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. "
Daniel,10,9,"Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground. "
Daniel,10,10,"And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me tottering upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. "
Daniel,10,11,"And he said unto me: 'O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for now am I sent unto thee'; and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. "
Daniel,10,12,"Then said he unto me: 'Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy G-d, thy words were heard; and I am come because of thy words. "
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia. "
Daniel,10,14,Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of days; for there is yet a vision for the days.' 
Daniel,10,15,"And when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. "
Daniel,10,16,"And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said unto him that stood before me: 'O my lord, by reason of the vision my pains are come upon me, and I retain no strength. "
Daniel,10,17,"For how can this servant of my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.' "
Daniel,10,18,"Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. "
Daniel,10,19,"And he said: 'O man greatly beloved, fear not! peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.' And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said: 'Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.' "
Daniel,10,20,"Then said he: Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. "
Daniel,10,21,"Howbeit I will declare unto thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth; and there is none that holdeth with me against these, except Michael your prince. "
Daniel,11,1,"And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to be a supporter and a stronghold unto him. "
Daniel,11,2,"And now will I declare unto thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. "
Daniel,11,3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. "
Daniel,11,4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those. "
Daniel,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. "
Daniel,11,6,"And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begot her, and he that obtained her in those times. "
Daniel,11,7,"But one of the shoots of her roots shall stand up in his place, and shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the stronghold of the king of the north, and shall deal with them, and shall prevail; "
Daniel,11,8,"and also their gods, with their molten images, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall he bring into captivity into Egypt; and he shall desist some years from the king of the north. "
Daniel,11,9,"And he shall come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land. "
Daniel,11,10,"And his sons shall stir themselves up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, and he shall come on, and overflow, as he passes through; and he shall return and stir himself up, even to his stronghold. "
Daniel,11,11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand. "
Daniel,11,12,"and the multitude shall be carried away, and his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down tens of thousands; but he shall not prevail. "
Daniel,11,13,"And the king of the north shall again set forth a multitude, greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance. "
Daniel,11,14,And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south; also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall stumble. 
Daniel,11,15,"And the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city; and the arms of the south shall not withstand; and as for his chosen people, there shall be no strength in them to withstand. "
Daniel,11,16,"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the beauteous land, and in his hand shall be extermination. "
Daniel,11,17,"And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, but shall make an agreement with him; and he shall give him the daughter of women, to destroy it; but it shall not stand, neither be for him. "
Daniel,11,18,"After this shall he set his face unto the isles, and shall take many; but a captain shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, he shall cause his own reproach to return upon him. "
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the strongholds of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found. "
Daniel,11,20,"Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. "
Daniel,11,21,"And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, upon whom had not been conferred the majesty of the kingdom; but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by blandishments. "
Daniel,11,22,"And the arms of the flood shall be swept away from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. "
Daniel,11,23,"And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; and he shall come up and become strong, with a little nation. "
Daniel,11,24,"In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers: he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance; yea, he shall devise his devices against fortresses, but only until the time. "
Daniel,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall stir himself up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise devices against him. "
Daniel,11,26,"Yea, they that eat of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall be swept away; and many shall fall down slain. "
Daniel,11,27,"And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper, for the end remaineth yet for the time appointed. "
Daniel,11,28,"And he shall return to his own land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land. "
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former. "
Daniel,11,30,"For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be cowed, and he shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure; and he shall return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant. "
Daniel,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the stronghold, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the detestable thing that causeth appalment. "
Daniel,11,32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by blandishments; but the people that know their G-d shall show strength, and prevail. "
Daniel,11,33,"And they that are wise among the people shall cause the many to understand; yet they shall stumble by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days. "
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they shall stumble, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with blandishments. "
Daniel,11,35,"And some of them that are wise shall stumble, to refine among them, and to purify, and to make white, even to the time of the end; for it is yet for the time appointed. "
Daniel,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak strange things against the G-d of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. "
Daniel,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers; and neither the desire of women, nor any god, shall he regard; for he shall magnify himself above all. "
Daniel,11,38,"But in his place shall he honour the god of strongholds; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and costly things. "
Daniel,11,39,"And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god; whom he shall acknowledge, shall increase glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price. "
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow, as he passes through. "
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter also into the beauteous land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. "
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
Daniel,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. "
Daniel,11,44,But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall affright him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to take away many. 
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the beauteous holy mountain; and he shall come to his end, and none shall help him. "
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. "
Daniel,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence. "
Daniel,12,3,And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. 
Daniel,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.' "
Daniel,12,5,"Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the bank of the river on this side, and the other on the bank of the river on that side. "
Daniel,12,6,"And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river: 'How long shall it be to the end of the wonders?' "
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. "
Daniel,12,8,"And I heard, but I understood not; then said I: 'O my L-rd, what shall be the latter end of these things?' "
Daniel,12,9,"And he said: 'Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. "
Daniel,12,10,"Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand. "
Daniel,12,11,"And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the detestable thing that causes appalment set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. "
Daniel,12,12,"Happy is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. "
Daniel,12,13,"But go thou thy way till the end be; and thou shalt rest, and shalt stand up to thy lot, at the end of the days.'  "
Ezra,1,1,"NOW IN the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of HaShem by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, HaShem stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying: "
Ezra,1,2,"'Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath HaShem, the G-d of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. "
Ezra,1,3,"Whosoever there is among you of all His people--his G-d be with him--let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, He is the G-d who is in Jerusalem. "
Ezra,1,4,"And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill-offering for the house of G-d which is in Jerusalem.' "
Ezra,1,5,"Then rose up the heads of fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit G-d had stirred to go up to build the house of HaShem which is in Jerusalem. "
Ezra,1,6,"And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. "
Ezra,1,7,"Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of HaShem, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; "
Ezra,1,8,"even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. "
Ezra,1,9,"And this is the number of them: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty knives; "
Ezra,1,10,"thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. "
Ezra,1,11,"All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. "
Ezra,2,1,"Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; "
Ezra,2,2,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: "
Ezra,2,3,"The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and two. "

Ezra,2,35,"The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and thirty. "
Ezra,2,36,"The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three. "
Ezra,2,37,"The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two. "
Ezra,2,38,"The children of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven. "
Ezra,2,39,"The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen. "
Ezra,2,40,"The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four. "
Ezra,2,41,"The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred twenty and eight. "
Ezra,2,42,"The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all a hundred thirty and nine. "
Ezra,2,43,"The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth; "
Ezra,2,44,"the children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon; "
Ezra,2,45,"the children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub; "
Ezra,2,46,"the children of Hagab, the children of Salmai, the children of Hanan; "
Ezra,2,47,"the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah; "
Ezra,2,48,"the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam; "
Ezra,2,49,"the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai; "
Ezra,2,50,"the children of Asnah, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephusim; "
Ezra,2,51,"the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur; "
Ezra,2,52,"the children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha; "
Ezra,2,53,"the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah; "
Ezra,2,54,"the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. "
Ezra,2,55,"The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Hassophereth, the children of Peruda; "
Ezra,2,56,"the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel; "
Ezra,2,57,"the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami. "
Ezra,2,58,"All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. "
Ezra,2,59,"And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not tell their fathers' houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel: "
Ezra,2,60,"the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. "
Ezra,2,61,"And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. "
Ezra,2,62,"These sought their register, that is, the genealogy, but it was not found; therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. "
Ezra,2,63,"And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim. "
Ezra,2,64,"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, "
Ezra,2,65,"beside their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. "
Ezra,2,66,"Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; "
Ezra,2,67,"their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. "
Ezra,2,68,"And some of the heads of fathers' houses, when they came to the house of HaShem which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of G-d to set it up in its place; "
Ezra,2,69,"they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' tunics. "
Ezra,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.  "
Ezra,3,1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. "
Ezra,3,2,"Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the G-d of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of G-d. "
Ezra,3,3,"And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries, and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto HaShem, even burnt-offerings morning and evening. "
Ezra,3,4,"And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required; "
Ezra,3,5,"and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the appointed seasons of HaShem that were hallowed, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto HaShem. "
Ezra,3,6,From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto HaShem; but the foundation of the temple of HaShem was not yet laid. 
Ezra,3,7,"They gave money also unto the hewers, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. "
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of G-d at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of HaShem. "
Ezra,3,9,"Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of G-d; the sons of Henadad also, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. "
Ezra,3,10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of HaShem, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise HaShem, according to the direction of David king of Israel. "
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto HaShem: 'for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.' And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised HaShem, because the foundation of the house of HaShem was laid. "
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, the old men that had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept with a loud voice, when this house was before their eyes; and many shouted aloud for joy; "
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. "
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel; "
Ezra,4,2,"then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' houses, and said unto them: 'Let us build with you; for we seek your G-d, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.' "
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, said unto them: 'Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our G-d; but we ourselves together will build unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.' "
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building, "
Ezra,4,5,"and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. "
Ezra,4,6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. "
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Aramaic character, and set forth in the Aramaic tongue. "
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort-- 
Ezra,4,9,"then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinites, and the Apharesattechites, the Tarpelites, the Apharesites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehites, the Elamites, "
Ezra,4,10,"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asenappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest that are in the country beyond the River:-- 'And now-- "
Ezra,4,11,"this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king--thy servants the men beyond the River--and now "
Ezra,4,12,"be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and are digging out the foundations. "
Ezra,4,13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, impost, or toll, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings. "
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and announced to the king, "
Ezra,4,15,"that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste. "
Ezra,4,16,"We announce to the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.' "
Ezra,4,17,"Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the River: 'Peace, and now "
Ezra,4,18,the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 
Ezra,4,19,"And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. "
Ezra,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, impost, and toll, was paid unto them. "
Ezra,4,21,"Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me. "
Ezra,4,22,And take heed that ye be not slack herein; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?' 
Ezra,4,23,"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. "
Ezra,4,24,Then ceased the work of the house of G-d which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
Ezra,5,1,"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the G-d of Israel prophesied they unto them. "
Ezra,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of G-d which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of G-d, helping them. "
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them: 'Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this structure?' "
Ezra,5,4,"'Then spoke we unto them after this manner ,wrote they: What are the names of the men that build this building?' "
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their G-d was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it. "
Ezra,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharesachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king; "
Ezra,5,7,"they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: 'Unto Darius the king, all peace. "
Ezra,5,8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great G-d, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. "
Ezra,5,9,"Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall? "
Ezra,5,10,"We asked them their names also, to announce to thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them. "
Ezra,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying: We are the servants of the G-d of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished. "
Ezra,5,12,"But because that our fathers had provoked the G-d of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. "
Ezra,5,13,"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of G-d. "
Ezra,5,14,"And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of G-d, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; "
Ezra,5,15,"and he said unto him: Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of G-d be builded in its place. "
Ezra,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of G-d which is in Jerusalem; and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed. "
Ezra,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house there, which is at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of G-d at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.' "
Ezra,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up, in Babylon. "
Ezra,6,2,"And there was found at Ahmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written: 'A record. "
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of G-d at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; "
Ezra,6,4,"with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber, and let the expenses be given out of the king's house; "
Ezra,6,5,"and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of G-d, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought back unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and thou shalt put them in the house of G-d.' "
Ezra,6,6,"'Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharesachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence; "
Ezra,6,7,let the work of this house of G-d alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of G-d in its place. 
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree concerning what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of G-d; that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered. "
Ezra,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the G-d of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail; "
Ezra,6,10,"that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savour unto the G-d of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. "
Ezra,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this; "
Ezra,6,12,"and may the G-d that hath caused His name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples, that shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of G-d which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.' "
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had thus sent, acted with all diligence. "
Ezra,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the G-d of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. "
Ezra,6,15,"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. "
Ezra,6,16,"And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of G-d with joy. "
Ezra,6,17,"And they offered at the dedication of this house of G-d a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. "
Ezra,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of G-d, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. "
Ezra,6,19,And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. 
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure; and they killed the passover lamb for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. "
Ezra,6,21,"And the children of Israel, that were come back out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek HaShem, the G-d of Israel, did eat, "
Ezra,6,22,"and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for HaShem had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of G-d, the G-d of Israel. "
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, "
Ezra,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, "
Ezra,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, "
Ezra,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, "
Ezra,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest-- "
Ezra,7,6,"this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the Law of Moses, which HaShem, the G-d of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of HaShem his G-d upon him. "
Ezra,7,7,"And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. "
Ezra,7,8,"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. "
Ezra,7,9,"For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his G-d upon him. "
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of HaShem, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances. "
Ezra,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of HaShem, and of His statutes to Israel: "
Ezra,7,12,"'Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the G-d of heaven, and so forth. And now "
Ezra,7,13,"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go with thee to Jerusalem, go. "
Ezra,7,14,"Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy G-d which is in thy hand; "
Ezra,7,15,"and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the G-d of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, "
Ezra,7,16,"and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their G-d which is in Jerusalem; "
Ezra,7,17,"therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your G-d which is in Jerusalem. "
Ezra,7,18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your G-d. "
Ezra,7,19,"And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy G-d, deliver thou before the G-d of Jerusalem. "
Ezra,7,20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy G-d, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house. "
Ezra,7,21,"And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the G-d of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence, "
Ezra,7,22,"unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. "
Ezra,7,23,"Whatsoever is commanded by the G-d of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the G-d of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? "
Ezra,7,24,"Also we announce to you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of G-d, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, impost, or toll, upon them. "
Ezra,7,25,"And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy G-d that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy G-d; and teach ye him that knoweth them not. "
Ezra,7,26,"And whosoever will not do the law of thy G-d, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.' "
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of HaShem which is in Jerusalem; "
Ezra,7,28,"and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of HaShem my G-d upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. "
Ezra,8,1,"Now these are the heads of their fathers' houses, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. "
Ezra,8,2,"Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush. "
Ezra,8,3,"Of the sons of Shecaniah: of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty. "
Ezra,8,4,"Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males. "
Ezra,8,5,"Of the sons of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males. "
Ezra,8,6,"And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males. "
Ezra,8,7,"And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males. "
Ezra,8,8,"And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males. "
Ezra,8,9,"Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males. "
Ezra,8,10,"And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and threescore males. "
Ezra,8,11,"And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males. "
Ezra,8,12,"And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males. "
Ezra,8,13,"And of the sons of Adonikam, that were the last; and these are their names, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males. "
Ezra,8,14,"And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur; and with him seventy males. "
Ezra,8,15,"And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. "
Ezra,8,16,"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, teachers. "
Ezra,8,17,"And I gave them commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo and his brother, who were set over the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our G-d. "
Ezra,8,18,"And according to the good hand of our G-d upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; "
Ezra,8,19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; "
Ezra,8,20,"and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim; all of them were mentioned by name. "
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our G-d, to seek of Him a straight way, for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. "
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying: 'The hand of our G-d is upon all them that seek Him, for good; but His power and His wrath is against all them that forsake Him.' "
Ezra,8,23,So we fasted and besought our G-d for this; and He was entreated of us. 
Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, besides Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, "
Ezra,8,25,"and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our G-d, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered; "
Ezra,8,26,"I even weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents; "
Ezra,8,27,"and twenty bowels of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold. "
Ezra,8,28,"And I said unto them: 'Ye are holy unto HaShem, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto HaShem, the G-d of your fathers. "
Ezra,8,29,"Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of HaShem.' "
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our G-d. "
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our G-d was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and lier-in-wait by the way. "
Ezra,8,32,"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. "
Ezra,8,33,"And on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our G-d into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites; "
Ezra,8,34,the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time. 
Ezra,8,35,"The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the G-d of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering; all this was a burnt-offering unto HaShem. "
Ezra,8,36,"And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River; and they furthered the people and the house of G-d. "
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying: 'The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. "
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands; yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this faithlessness.' "
Ezra,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down appalled. "
Ezra,9,4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the G-d of Israel, because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity; and I sat appalled until the evening offering. "
Ezra,9,5,"And at the evening offering I arose up from my fasting, even with my garment and my mantle rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto HaShem my G-d; "
Ezra,9,6,"and I said: 'O my G-d, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my G-d; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens. "
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to spoiling, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. "
Ezra,9,8,"And now for a little moment grace hath been shown from HaShem our G-d, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in His holy place, that our G-d may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. "
Ezra,9,9,"For we are bondmen; yet our G-d hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our G-d, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a fence in Judah and in Jerusalem. "
Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our G-d, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken Thy commandments, "
Ezra,9,11,"which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets, saying: The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness. "
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. "
Ezra,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that Thou our G-d hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant, "
Ezra,9,14,"shall we again break Thy commandments, and make marriages with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not Thou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? "
Ezra,9,15,"O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before Thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before Thee because of this.' "
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of G-d, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore. "
Ezra,10,2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: 'We have broken faith with our G-d, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. "
Ezra,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our G-d to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of HaShem, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our G-d; and let it be done according to the law. "
Ezra,10,4,"Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee; be of good courage, and do it.' "
Ezra,10,5,"Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore. "
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of G-d, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity. "
Ezra,10,7,"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; "
Ezra,10,8,"and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity. "
Ezra,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of G-d, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain. "
Ezra,10,10,"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them: 'Ye have broken faith, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel. "
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore make confession unto HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, and do His pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.' "
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice: 'As thou hast said, so it is for us to do. "
Ezra,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. "
Ezra,10,14,"Let now our princes of all the congregation stand, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our G-d be turned from us, as touching this matter.' "
Ezra,10,15,Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. 
Ezra,10,16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers' houses, after their fathers' houses, and all of them by their names, were separated; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. "
Ezra,10,17,And they were finished with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month. 
Ezra,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women, namely: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. "
Ezra,10,19,"And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt. "
Ezra,10,20,And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 
Ezra,10,21,"And of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah. "
Ezra,10,22,"And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah. "
Ezra,10,23,"And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah--the same is Kelita--Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. "
Ezra,10,24,"And of the singers: Eliashib; and of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. "
Ezra,10,25,"And of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. "
Ezra,10,26,"And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah. "
Ezra,10,27,"And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. "
Ezra,10,28,"And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai. "
Ezra,10,29,"And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth. "
Ezra,10,30,"And of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. "
Ezra,10,31,"And of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon; "
Ezra,10,32,"Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah. "
Ezra,10,33,"Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei. "
Ezra,10,34,"Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel; "
Ezra,10,35,"Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhu; "
Ezra,10,36,"Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib; "
Ezra,10,37,"Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasai; "
Ezra,10,38,"and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei; "
Ezra,10,39,"Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah; "
Ezra,10,40,"Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai; "
Ezra,10,41,"Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah; "
Ezra,10,42,"Shallum, Amariah, Joseph. "
Ezra,10,43,"Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, and Joel, Benaiah. "
Ezra,10,44,All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.  
Nehemiah,1,1,"THE WORDS of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the castle, "
Nehemiah,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brethren, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. "
Nehemiah,1,3,"And they said unto me: 'The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.' "
Nehemiah,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the G-d of heaven, "
Nehemiah,1,5,"and said: 'I beseech Thee, O HaShem, the G-d of heaven, the great and awful G-d, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments; "
Nehemiah,1,6,"let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel Thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and my father's house have sinned. "
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses. "
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember, I beseech Thee, the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying: If ye deal treacherously, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples; "
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if ye return unto Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to dwell there. "
Nehemiah,1,10,"Now these are Thy servants and Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand. "
Nehemiah,1,11,"O L-rd, I beseech Thee, let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant, and to the prayer of Thy servants, who delight to fear Thy name; and prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.' Now I was cupbearer to the king. "
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. "
Nehemiah,2,2,"And the king said unto me: 'Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.' Then I was very sore afraid. "
Nehemiah,2,3,"And I said unto the king: 'Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?' "
Nehemiah,2,4,Then the king said unto me: 'For what dost thou make request?' So I prayed to the G-d of heaven. 
Nehemiah,2,5,"And I said unto the king: 'If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.' "
Nehemiah,2,6,"And the king said unto me, the queen also sitting by him: 'For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?' So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. "
Nehemiah,2,7,"Moreover I said unto the king: 'If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah; "
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's park, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.' And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my G-d upon me. "
Nehemiah,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. "
Nehemiah,2,10,"And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. "
Nehemiah,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. "
Nehemiah,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my G-d put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. "
Nehemiah,2,13,"And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the dragon's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. "
Nehemiah,2,14,Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool; but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. 
Nehemiah,2,15,"Then went I up in the night in the valley, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. "
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. "
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then said I unto them: 'Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire; come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.' "
Nehemiah,2,18,And I told them of the hand of my G-d which was good upon me; as also of the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said: 'Let us rise up and build.' So they strengthened their hands for the good work. 
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said: 'What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?' "
Nehemiah,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them: 'The G-d of heaven, He will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.' "
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel. "
Nehemiah,3,2,And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. 
Nehemiah,3,3,"And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. "
Nehemiah,3,4,"And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. "
Nehemiah,3,5,And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; and their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord. 
Nehemiah,3,6,"And the gate of the old city repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. "
Nehemiah,3,7,"And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, for them that appertained to the throne of the governor beyond the River. "
Nehemiah,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they restored Jerusalem even unto the broad wall. "
Nehemiah,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem. "
Nehemiah,3,10,"And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah. "
Nehemiah,3,11,"Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. "
Nehemiah,3,12,"And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. "
Nehemiah,3,13,"The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate. "
Nehemiah,3,14,"And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-cherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. "
Nehemiah,3,15,"And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. "
Nehemiah,3,16,"After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men. "
Nehemiah,3,17,"After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district. "
Nehemiah,3,18,"After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah. "
Nehemiah,3,19,"And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armoury at the Turning. "
Nehemiah,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zaccai earnestly repaired another portion, from the Turning unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. "
Nehemiah,3,21,"After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. "
Nehemiah,3,22,"And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain. "
Nehemiah,3,23,After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house. 
Nehemiah,3,24,"After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the Turning and unto the corner. "
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai repaired over against the Turning, and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh repaired.-- "
Nehemiah,3,26,"Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.-- "
Nehemiah,3,27,"After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel. "
Nehemiah,3,28,"Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house. "
Nehemiah,3,29,"After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate. "
Nehemiah,3,30,"After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. "
Nehemiah,3,31,"After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the upper chamber of the corner. "
Nehemiah,3,32,And between the upper chamber of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants. 
Nehemiah,3,33,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. "
Nehemiah,3,34,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said: 'What do these feeble Jews? will they restore at will? will they sacrifice? will they make an end this day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?' "
Nehemiah,3,35,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said: 'Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.' "
Nehemiah,3,36,"Hear, O our G-d; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up to spoiling in a land of captivity; "
Nehemiah,3,37,"and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before Thee; for they have vexed Thee before the builders. "
Nehemiah,3,38,So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half the height thereof; for the people had a mind to work. 
Nehemiah,4,1,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth; "
Nehemiah,4,2,"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein. "
Nehemiah,4,3,"But we made our prayer unto our G-d, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. "
Nehemiah,4,4,"And Judah said: 'The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.' "
Nehemiah,4,5,"And our adversaries said: 'They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.' "
Nehemiah,4,6,"And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times: 'Ye must return unto us from all places.' "
Nehemiah,4,7,"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. "
Nehemiah,4,8,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people: 'Be not ye afraid of them; remember the L-rd, who is great and awful, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.' "
Nehemiah,4,9,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and G-d had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. "
Nehemiah,4,10,"And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. "
Nehemiah,4,11,"They that builded the wall and they that bore burdens laded themselves, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon; "
Nehemiah,4,12,"and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the horn was by me. "
Nehemiah,4,13,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people: 'The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another; "
Nehemiah,4,14,"in what place soever ye hear the sound of the horn, resort ye thither unto us; our G-d will fight for us.' "
Nehemiah,4,15,So we wrought in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 
Nehemiah,4,16,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people: 'Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.' "
Nehemiah,4,17,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one that went to the water had his weapon. "
Nehemiah,5,1,Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were that said: 'We, our sons and our daughters, are many; let us get for them corn, that we may eat and live.' "
Nehemiah,5,3,"Some also there were that said: 'We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses; let us get corn, because of the dearth.' "
Nehemiah,5,4,There were also that said: 'We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and our vineyards. 
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already; neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.' "
Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them: 'Ye lend upon pledge, every one to his brother.' And I held a great assembly against them. "
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said unto them: 'We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that sold themselves unto the heathen; and would ye nevertheless sell your brethren, and should they sell themselves unto us?' Then held they their peace, and found never a word. "
Nehemiah,5,9,"Also I said: 'The thing that ye do is not good; ought ye not to walk in the fear of our G-d, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? "
Nehemiah,5,10,"And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this exaction. "
Nehemiah,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundred pieces of silver, and the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.' "
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then said they: 'We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest.' Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. "
Nehemiah,5,13,"Also I shook out my lap, and said: 'So G-d shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.' And all the congregation said: 'Amen', and praised HaShem. And the people did according to this promise. "
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. "
Nehemiah,5,15,"But the former governors that were before me laid burdens upon the people, and took of them for bread and wine above forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants lorded over the people; but so did not I, because of the fear of G-d. "
Nehemiah,5,16,"Yea, also I set hand to the work of this wall, neither bought we any land; and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. "
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table of the Jews and the rulers a hundred and fifty men, beside those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us. "
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me; and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine; yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the service was heavy upon this people. "
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember unto me, O my G-d, for good, all that I have done for this people. "
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein--though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates-- "
Nehemiah,6,2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying: 'Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.' But they thought to do me mischief. "
Nehemiah,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying: 'I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?' "
Nehemiah,6,4,And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
Nehemiah,6,5,Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
Nehemiah,6,6,"wherein was written: 'It is reported among the nations, and Geshem saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall; and thou wouldest be their king, even according to these words. "
Nehemiah,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judah; and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.' "
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying: 'There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.' "
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all would have us afraid, saying: 'Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.' But now, strengthen Thou my hands. "
Nehemiah,6,10,"And as for me, I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said: 'Let us meet together in the house of G-d, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.' "
Nehemiah,6,11,"And I said: 'Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.' "
Nehemiah,6,12,"And I discerned, and, lo, G-d had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me, whereas Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. "
Nehemiah,6,13,"For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might taunt me. "
Nehemiah,6,14,"Remember, O my G-d, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have me put in fear. "
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. "
Nehemiah,6,16,"And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our G-d. "
Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. "
Nehemiah,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. "
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.  "
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, "
Nehemiah,7,2,"that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared G-d above many. "
Nehemiah,7,3,"And I said unto them: 'Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them; and let watches be appointed of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.' "
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. "
Nehemiah,7,5,"And my G-d put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein: "
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; "
Nehemiah,7,7,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: "

Nehemiah,7,35,"The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty. "
Nehemiah,7,36,"The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five. "
Nehemiah,7,37,"The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one. "
Nehemiah,7,38,"The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty. "
Nehemiah,7,39,"The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three. "
Nehemiah,7,40,"The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two. "
Nehemiah,7,41,"The children of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven. "

Nehemiah,7,53,"the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur; "
Nehemiah,7,54,"the children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha; "
Nehemiah,7,55,"the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah; "
Nehemiah,7,56,"the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. "
Nehemiah,7,57,"The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida; "
Nehemiah,7,58,"the children of Jala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel; "
Nehemiah,7,59,"the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon. "
Nehemiah,7,60,"All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. "
Nehemiah,7,61,"And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not tell their fathers' houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel: "
Nehemiah,7,62,"the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. "
Nehemiah,7,63,"And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. "
Nehemiah,7,64,"These sought their register, that is, the genealogy, but it was not found; therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. "
Nehemiah,7,65,"And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. "
Nehemiah,7,66,"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, "
Nehemiah,7,67,"beside their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. "
Nehemiah,7,68,"Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;"
Nehemiah,7,69,"their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. "
Nehemiah,7,70,"And some from among the heads of fathers' houses gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' tunics. "
Nehemiah,7,71,"And some of the heads of fathers' houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. "
Nehemiah,7,72,"And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests' tunics. So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities, "
Nehemiah,8,1,"all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the Law of Moses, which HaShem had commanded to Israel. "
Nehemiah,8,2,"And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the congregation, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. "
Nehemiah,8,3,"And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the Law. "
Nehemiah,8,4,"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. "
Nehemiah,8,5,"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people--for he was above all the people--and when he opened it, all the people stood up. "
Nehemiah,8,6,"And Ezra blessed HaShem, the great G-d. And all the people answered: 'Amen, Amen', with the lifting up of their hands; and they bowed their heads, and fell down before HaShem with their faces to the ground. "
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, even the Levites, caused the people to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place. "
Nehemiah,8,8,"And they read in the book, in the Law of G-d, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. "
Nehemiah,8,9,"And Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people: 'This day is holy unto HaShem your G-d; mourn not, nor weep.' For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law. "
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said unto them: 'Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our L-rd; neither be ye grieved; for the joy of HaShem is your strength.' "
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying: 'Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.' "
Nehemiah,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. "
Nehemiah,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the Law. "
Nehemiah,8,14,"And they found written in the Law, how that HaShem had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; "
Nehemiah,8,15,"and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.' "
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of G-d, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim. "
Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come back out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the Law of G-d. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance. "
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them. "
Nehemiah,9,2,"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. "
Nehemiah,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the Law of HaShem their G-d a fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and prostrated themselves before HaShem their G-d. "
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood up upon the platform of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto HaShem their G-d. "
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: 'Stand up and bless HaShem your G-d from everlasting to everlasting; and let them say: Blessed be Thy glorious Name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise. "
Nehemiah,9,6,"Thou art HaShem, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee. "
Nehemiah,9,7,"Thou art HaShem the G-d, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; "
Nehemiah,9,8,"and foundest his heart faithful before Thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed Thy words; for Thou art righteous; "
Nehemiah,9,9,"And Thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; "
Nehemiah,9,10,"and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get Thee a name, as it is this day. "
Nehemiah,9,11,"And Thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers Thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. "
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover in a pillar of cloud Thou didst lead them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. "
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and laws of truth, good statutes and commandments; "
Nehemiah,9,14,"and madest known unto them Thy holy sabbath, and didst command them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses Thy servant; "
Nehemiah,9,15,"and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and didst command them that they should go in to possess the land which Thou hadst lifted up Thy hand to give them. "
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to Thy commandments, "
Nehemiah,9,17,"and refused to hearken, neither were mindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage; but Thou art a G-d ready to pardon, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and forsookest them not. "
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said: 'This is thy G-d that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; "
Nehemiah,9,19,"yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. "
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest also Thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. "
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. "
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which Thou didst allot quarter by quarter; so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. "
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also didst Thou multiply as the stars of heaven, and didst bring them into the land, concerning which Thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. "
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and Thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. "
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance; so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and luxuriated in Thy great goodness. "
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and slew Thy prophets that did forewarn them to turn them back unto Thee, and they wrought great provocations. "
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto Thee, Thou heardest from heaven; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them saviours who might save them out of the hand of their adversaries. "
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before Thee; therefore didst Thou leave them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried unto Thee, many times didst Thou hear from heaven, and deliver them according to Thy mercies; "
Nehemiah,9,29,"and didst forewarn them, that Thou mightest bring them back unto Thy law; yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto Thy commandments, but sinned against Thine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them, and presented a stubborn shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. "
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years didst Thou extend mercy unto them, and didst forewarn them by Thy spirit through Thy prophets; yet would they not give ear; therefore gavest Thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. "
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless in Thy manifold mercies Thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for Thou art a gracious and merciful G-d. "
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our G-d, the great, the mighty, and the awful G-d, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the travail seem little before Thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all Thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. "
Nehemiah,9,33,"Howbeit Thou art just in all that is come upon us; for Thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; "
Nehemiah,9,34,"neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law, nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and Thy testimonies, wherewith Thou didst testify against them. "
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served Thee in their kingdom, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. "
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it. "
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.' "
Nehemiah,10,1,"And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and subscribe it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, set their seal unto it. "
Nehemiah,10,2,"Now those that set their seal were: Nehemiah the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zedekiah; "
Nehemiah,10,3,"Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah; "

Nehemiah,10,29,"And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of G-d, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge and understanding; "
Nehemiah,10,30,"they cleaved to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in G-d's law, which was given by Moses the servant of G-d, and to observe and do all the commandments of HaShem our L-rd, and His ordinances and His statutes; "
Nehemiah,10,31,"and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; "
Nehemiah,10,32,"and if the peoples of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt. "
Nehemiah,10,33,"Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our G-d; "
Nehemiah,10,34,"for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the appointed seasons, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our G-d. "
Nehemiah,10,35,"And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our G-d, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of HaShem our G-d, as it is written in the Law; "
Nehemiah,10,36,"and to bring the first-fruits of our land, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of HaShem; "
Nehemiah,10,37,"also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our G-d, unto the priests that minister in the house of our G-d; "
Nehemiah,10,38,"and that we should bring the first of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our G-d; and the tithes of our land unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. "
Nehemiah,10,39,"And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes; and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our G-d, to the chambers, into the treasure-house. "
Nehemiah,10,40,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers; and we will not forsake the house of our G-d. "
Nehemiah,11,1,"And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem; the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities. "
Nehemiah,11,2,And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. 
Nehemiah,11,3,"Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israelites, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants. "
Nehemiah,11,4,"And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; "

Nehemiah,11,18,All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four. 
Nehemiah,11,19,"Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two. "
Nehemiah,11,20,"And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance. "
Nehemiah,11,21,But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 
Nehemiah,11,22,"The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of G-d. "
Nehemiah,11,23,"For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a sure ordinance concerning the singers, as every day required. "
Nehemiah,11,24,"And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people. "
Nehemiah,11,25,"And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof; "
Nehemiah,11,26,"and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet; "
Nehemiah,11,27,"and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof; "
Nehemiah,11,28,"and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof; "
Nehemiah,11,29,"and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth; "
Nehemiah,11,30,"Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom. "
Nehemiah,11,31,"And the children of Benjamin from Geba onward, at Michmas and Aijah, and at Beth-el and the towns thereof; "
Nehemiah,11,32,"at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah; "
Nehemiah,11,33,"Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim; "
Nehemiah,11,34,"Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat; "
Nehemiah,11,35,"Lod, and Ono, Ge-harashim. "
Nehemiah,11,36,"And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah were joined to Benjamin. "
Nehemiah,12,1,"Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra; "
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush; "
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth; "

Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and their brethren in the days of Jeshua. "
Nehemiah,12,8,"Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren. "
Nehemiah,12,9,"Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in wards. "
Nehemiah,12,10,"And Jeshua begot Joiakim, and Joiakim begot Eliashib, and Eliashib begot Joiada, "
Nehemiah,12,11,and Joiada begot Jonathan and Jonathan begot Jaddua. 
Nehemiah,12,12,"And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers' houses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; "
Nehemiah,12,13,"of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; "
Nehemiah,12,14,"of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; "
Nehemiah,12,15,"of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; "

Nehemiah,12,21,"of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. "
Nehemiah,12,22,"The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded heads of fathers' houses; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian. "
Nehemiah,12,23,"The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' houses, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. "
Nehemiah,12,24,"And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of G-d, ward against ward. "
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the store-houses of the gates. "
Nehemiah,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe. "
Nehemiah,12,27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. "
Nehemiah,12,28,"And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the Plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites; "
Nehemiah,12,29,"also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. "
Nehemiah,12,30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. "
Nehemiah,12,31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession: on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate; "
Nehemiah,12,32,"and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah; "
Nehemiah,12,33,"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, "
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah; "
Nehemiah,12,35,"and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; "
Nehemiah,12,36,"and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of G-d; and Ezra the scribe was before them; "
Nehemiah,12,37,"and by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. "
Nehemiah,12,38,"And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall; "
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the gate of the old city and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the gate of the guard. "
Nehemiah,12,40,"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of G-d, and I, and the half of the rulers with me; "
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; "
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. "
Nehemiah,12,43,"And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for G-d had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. "
Nehemiah,12,44,"And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that took their stations. "
Nehemiah,12,45,"And they kept the ward of their G-d, and the ward of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. "
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto G-d. "
Nehemiah,12,47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required; and they hallowed for the Levites; and the Levites hallowed for the sons of Aaron. "
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of G-d for ever; "
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; howbeit our G-d turned the curse into a blessing. "
Nehemiah,13,3,"And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the alien mixture. "
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our G-d, being allied unto Tobiah, "
Nehemiah,13,5,"had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests. "
Nehemiah,13,6,"But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king, and after certain days asked I leave of the king; "
Nehemiah,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of G-d. "
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of G-d, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense. "
Nehemiah,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. "
Nehemiah,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said: 'Why is the house of G-d forsaken?' And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. "
Nehemiah,13,12,Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. "
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, O my G-d, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my G-d, and for the wards thereof. "
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of corn, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I forewarned them in the day wherein they sold victuals. "
Nehemiah,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. "
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them: 'What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? "
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our G-d bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.' "
Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath; and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. "
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I forewarned them, and said unto them: 'Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.' From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. "
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my G-d, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy. "
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab; "
Nehemiah,13,24,"and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. "
Nehemiah,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by G-d: 'Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. "
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his G-d, and G-d made him king over all Israel; nevertheless even him did the foreign women cause to sin. "
Nehemiah,13,27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to break faith with our G-d in marrying foreign women?' "
Nehemiah,13,28,"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me. "
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my G-d, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. "
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and appointed wards for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work; "
Nehemiah,13,31,"and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my G-d, for good.  "

I Chronicles,11,4,"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem--the same is Jebus--and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. "
I Chronicles,11,5,And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: 'Thou shalt not come in hither.' Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 
I Chronicles,11,6,"And David said: 'Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.' And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. "
I Chronicles,11,7,And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David. 
I Chronicles,11,8,"And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. "
I Chronicles,11,9,And David waxed greater and greater; for HaShem of hosts was with him. 
I Chronicles,11,10,"Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who held strongly with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of HaShem concerning Israel. "
I Chronicles,11,11,"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time. "
I Chronicles,11,12,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. "
I Chronicles,11,13,"He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. "
I Chronicles,11,14,"But they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and HaShem saved them by a great victory. "
I Chronicles,11,15,"And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, unto the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. "
I Chronicles,11,16,"And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. "
I Chronicles,11,17,"And David longed, and said: 'Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!' "
I Chronicles,11,18,"And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto HaShem, "
I Chronicles,11,19,"and said: 'My G-d forbid it me, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.' Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. "
I Chronicles,11,20,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. "
I Chronicles,11,21,"Of the three in the second rank he was the most honourable, and was made their captain; howbeit he attained not to the first three. "
I Chronicles,11,22,"Beniah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. "
I Chronicles,11,23,"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. "
I Chronicles,11,24,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. "
I Chronicles,11,25,"Behold, he was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three; and David set him over his guard. "

"
I Chronicles,13,1,"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. "
I Chronicles,13,2,"And David said unto all the assembly of Israel: 'If it seem good unto you, and if it be of HaShem our G-d, let us send abroad everywhere unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites that are in their cities that have open land about them, that they may gather themselves unto us; "
I Chronicles,13,3,and let us bring back the ark of our G-d to us; for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.' 
I Chronicles,13,4,And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
I Chronicles,13,5,"So David assembled all Israel together, from Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of G-d from Kiriath-jearim. "
I Chronicles,13,6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of G-d, HaShem that sitteth upon the cherubim, whereon is called the Name. "
I Chronicles,13,7,"And they set the ark of G-d upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. "
I Chronicles,13,8,"And David and all Israel played before G-d with all their might; even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. "
I Chronicles,13,9,"And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. "
I Chronicles,13,10,"And the anger of HaShem was kindled against Uzza, and He smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before G-d. "
I Chronicles,13,11,"And David was displeased, because HaShem had broken forth upon Uzza; and that place was called Perez-uzza unto this day. "
I Chronicles,13,12,"And David was afraid of G-d that day, saying: 'How shall I bring the ark of G-d home to me?' "
I Chronicles,13,13,"So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. "
I Chronicles,13,14,"And the ark of G-d remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and HaShem blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.  "
I Chronicles,14,1,"And Huram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. "
I Chronicles,14,2,"And David perceived that HaShem had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted exceedingly, for His people Israel's sake. "
I Chronicles,14,3,And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begot more sons and daughters. 
I Chronicles,14,4,"And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; "
I Chronicles,14,5,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet; "
I Chronicles,14,6,"and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia; "
I Chronicles,14,7,"and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. "
I Chronicles,14,8,"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out to meet them. "
I Chronicles,14,9,Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
I Chronicles,14,10,"And David inquired of G-d, saying: 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And HaShem said unto him: 'Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.' "
I Chronicles,14,11,"So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said: 'G-d hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters.' Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim."
I Chronicles,14,12,"And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. "
I Chronicles,14,13,And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 
I Chronicles,14,14,"And David inquired again of G-d; and G-d said unto him: 'Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. "
I Chronicles,14,15,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for G-d is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.' "
I Chronicles,14,16,And David did as G-d commanded him; and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
I Chronicles,14,17,And the fame of David went out into all lands; and HaShem brought the fear of him upon all nations. 
I Chronicles,15,1,"And David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of G-d, and pitched for it a tent. "
I Chronicles,15,2,"Then David said: 'None ought to carry the ark of G-d but the Levites; for them hath HaShem chosen to carry the ark of HaShem, and to minister unto Him for ever.' "
I Chronicles,15,3,"And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of HaShem unto its place, which he had prepared for it. "
I Chronicles,15,4,"And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites; "
I Chronicles,15,5,"of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty; "
I Chronicles,15,6,"of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty; "
I Chronicles,15,7,"of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty; "
I Chronicles,15,8,"of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred; "
I Chronicles,15,9,"of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore; "
I Chronicles,15,10,"of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. "
I Chronicles,15,11,"And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, "
I Chronicles,15,12,"and said unto them: 'Ye are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it. "
I Chronicles,15,13,"For because ye bore it not at the first, HaShem our G-d made a breach upon us, for that we sought Him not according to the ordinance.' "
I Chronicles,15,14,"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
I Chronicles,15,15,"And the children of the Levites bore the ark of G-d upon their shoulders with the bars thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of HaShem. "
I Chronicles,15,16,"And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. "
I Chronicles,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; "
I Chronicles,15,18,"and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. "
I Chronicles,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan ,were appointed, with cymbals of brass to sound aloud; "
I Chronicles,15,20,"and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth; "
I Chronicles,15,21,"and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiahu, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith, to lead. "
I Chronicles,15,22,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song; he was master in the song, because he was skilful. "
I Chronicles,15,23,And Berechiah and Elkanah were door-keepers for the ark. 
I Chronicles,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of G-d; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. "
I Chronicles,15,25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of HaShem out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. "
I Chronicles,15,26,"And it came to pass, when G-d helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of HaShem, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams. "
I Chronicles,15,27,"And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the singers in the song; and David had upon him an ephod of linen. "
I Chronicles,15,28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of HaShem with shouting, and with sound of the horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps. "
I Chronicles,15,29,"And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of HaShem came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and making merry; and she despised him in her heart. "
I Chronicles,16,1,"And they brought in the ark of G-d, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before G-d. "
I Chronicles,16,2,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of HaShem. "
I Chronicles,16,3,"And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake. "
I Chronicles,16,4,"And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of HaShem, and to celebrate and to thank and praise HaShem, the G-d of Israel: "
I Chronicles,16,5,"Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; "
I Chronicles,16,6,"and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of G-d. "
I Chronicles,16,7,"Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto HaShem, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. "
I Chronicles,16,8,"O give thanks unto HaShem, call upon His name; make known His doings among the peoples. "
I Chronicles,16,9,"Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; speak ye of all His marvellous works. "
I Chronicles,16,10,Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek HaShem. 
I Chronicles,16,11,Seek ye HaShem and His strength; seek His face continually. 
I Chronicles,16,12,"Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth; "
I Chronicles,16,13,"O ye seed of Israel His servant, ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones. "
I Chronicles,16,14,He is HaShem our G-d; His judgments are in all the earth. 
I Chronicles,16,15,"Remember His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations; "
I Chronicles,16,16,"The covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac; "
I Chronicles,16,17,"And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant; "
I Chronicles,16,18,"Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.' "
I Chronicles,16,19,"When ye were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it, "
I Chronicles,16,20,"And when they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people, "
I Chronicles,16,21,"He suffered no man to do them wrong, yea, for their sake He reproved kings: "
I Chronicles,16,22,"'Touch not Mine anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.' "
I Chronicles,16,23,"Sing unto HaShem, all the earth; proclaim His salvation from day to day. "
I Chronicles,16,24,"Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. "
I Chronicles,16,25,"For great is HaShem, and highly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods. "
I Chronicles,16,26,For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but HaShem made the heavens. 
I Chronicles,16,27,Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place. 
I Chronicles,16,28,"Ascribe unto HaShem, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto HaShem glory and strength. "
I Chronicles,16,29,"Ascribe unto HaShem the glory due unto His name; bring an offering, and come before Him; worship HaShem in the beauty of holiness. "
I Chronicles,16,30,"Tremble before Him, all the earth; the world also is established that it cannot be moved. "
I Chronicles,16,31,"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let them say among the nations: 'The HaShem reigneth.' "
I Chronicles,16,32,"Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the field exult, and all that is therein; "
I Chronicles,16,33,"Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy, before HaShem, for He is come to judge the earth. "
I Chronicles,16,34,O give thanks unto HaShem; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever. 
I Chronicles,16,35,"And say ye: 'Save us, O G-d of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.' "
I Chronicles,16,36,"Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said: 'Amen,' and praised HaShem. "
I Chronicles,16,37,"So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of HaShem, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required; "
I Chronicles,16,38,"and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jedithun and Hosah to be door-keepers; "
I Chronicles,16,39,"and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of HaShem in the high place that was at Gibeon, "
I Chronicles,16,40,"to offer burnt-offerings unto HaShem upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the Law of HaShem, which He commanded unto Israel; "
I Chronicles,16,41,"and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to HaShem, because His mercy endureth for ever; "
I Chronicles,16,42,"and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals, and with instruments for the songs of G-d; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. "
I Chronicles,16,43,And all the people departed every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house. 
I Chronicles,17,1,"And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet: 'Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of HaShem dwelleth under curtains.' "
I Chronicles,17,2,And Nathan said unto David: 'Do all that is in thy heart; for G-d is with thee.' 
I Chronicles,17,3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of G-d came to Nathan, saying: "
I Chronicles,17,4,'Go and tell David My servant: Thus saith HaShem: Thou shalt not build Me a house to dwell in; 
I Chronicles,17,5,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. "
I Chronicles,17,6,"In all places wherein I have walked among all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? "
I Chronicles,17,7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith HaShem of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people Israel; "
I Chronicles,17,8,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. "
I Chronicles,17,9,"And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, "
I Chronicles,17,10,even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that HaShem will build thee a house. 
I Chronicles,17,11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. "
I Chronicles,17,12,"He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. "
I Chronicles,17,13,"I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; "
I Chronicles,17,14,but I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.' 
I Chronicles,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. "
I Chronicles,17,16,"Then David the king went in, and sat before HaShem; and he said: 'Who am I, O HaShem G-d, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? "
I Chronicles,17,17,"And this was a small thing in Thine eyes, O G-d; but Thou hast spoken of Thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me after the manner of a man of high degree, O HaShem G-d. "
I Chronicles,17,18,What can David say yet more unto Thee concerning the honour which is done to Thy servant? for Thou knowest Thy servant. 
I Chronicles,17,19,"O HaShem, for Thy servant's sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things. "
I Chronicles,17,20,"O HaShem, there is none like Thee, neither is there any G-d beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. "
I Chronicles,17,21,"And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom G-d went to redeem unto Himself for a people, to make Thee a name by great and tremendous things, in driving out nations from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem out of Egypt. "
I Chronicles,17,22,"For Thy people Israel didst Thou make Thine own people for ever; and Thou, HaShem, becamest their G-d. "
I Chronicles,17,23,"And now, O HaShem, let the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. "
I Chronicles,17,24,"Yea, let it be established, and let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: HaShem of hosts is the G-d of Israel, even a G-d to Israel; and the house of David Thy servant shall be established before Thee. "
I Chronicles,17,25,"For Thou, O my G-d, hast revealed to Thy servant that Thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray before Thee. "
I Chronicles,17,26,"And now, O HaShem, Thou alone art G-d, and hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; "
I Chronicles,17,27,"and now it hath pleased Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O HaShem, hast blessed, and so let Thy servant be blessed for ever.' "
I Chronicles,18,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. "
I Chronicles,18,2,"And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. "
I Chronicles,18,3,"And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah by Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. "
I Chronicles,18,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. "
I Chronicles,18,5,"And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men. "
I Chronicles,18,6,"Then David put garrisons in Aram Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And HaShem gave victory to David whithersoever he went. "
I Chronicles,18,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. "
I Chronicles,18,8,"And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. "
I Chronicles,18,9,"And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, "
I Chronicles,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him--because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer had wars with Tou--and he had with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. "
I Chronicles,18,11,"These also did king David dedicate unto HaShem, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. "
I Chronicles,18,12,Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand. 
I Chronicles,18,13,And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And HaShem gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 
I Chronicles,18,14,And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. 
I Chronicles,18,15,And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder. 
I Chronicles,18,16,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe; "
I Chronicles,18,17,and Beniah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.  
I Chronicles,19,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. "
I Chronicles,19,2,"And David said: 'l will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. "
I Chronicles,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun: 'Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?' "
I Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their hips, and sent them away. "
I Chronicles,19,5,"Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said: 'Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.' "
I Chronicles,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Aram-naharaim, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. "
I Chronicles,19,7,"So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. "
I Chronicles,19,8,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. "
I Chronicles,19,9,And the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
I Chronicles,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans. "
I Chronicles,19,11,"And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. "
I Chronicles,19,12,"And he said: 'If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. "
I Chronicles,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our G-d; and HaShem do that which seemeth Him good.' "
I Chronicles,19,14,So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle to meet the Arameans; and they fled before him. 
I Chronicles,19,15,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. "
I Chronicles,19,16,"And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Arameans that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. "
I Chronicles,19,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him. "
I Chronicles,19,18,"And the Arameans fled before Israel; and David slew of the Arameans the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. "
I Chronicles,19,19,"And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him; neither would the Arameans help the children of Ammon any more. "
I Chronicles,20,1,"And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it. "
I Chronicles,20,2,"And David took the crown of Malcam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head; and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. "
I Chronicles,20,3,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. "
I Chronicles,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giants; and they were subdued. "
I Chronicles,20,5,"And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. "
I Chronicles,20,6,"And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born unto the giant. "
I Chronicles,20,7,"And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. "
I Chronicles,20,8,These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 
I Chronicles,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. "
I Chronicles,21,2,"And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people: 'Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.' "
I Chronicles,21,3,"And Joab said: 'The HaShem make His people a hundred times so many more as they are; but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?' "
I Chronicles,21,4,"Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. "
I Chronicles,21,5,And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword; and Judah was four hundred three-score and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
I Chronicles,21,6,But Levi and Benjamin he did not number among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 
I Chronicles,21,7,And G-d was displeased with this thing; therefore He smote Israel. 
I Chronicles,21,8,"And David said unto G-d: 'I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing; but now, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.' "
I Chronicles,21,9,"And HaShem spoke unto Gad, David's seer, saying: "
I Chronicles,21,10,"'Go and speak unto David, saying: Thus saith HaShem: I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.' "
I Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David, and said unto him: 'Thus saith HaShem: Take which thou wilt: "
I Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine; or three months to be swept away before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of HaShem, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of HaShem destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent me.' "
I Chronicles,21,13,"And David said unto Gad: 'I am in a great strait; let me fall now into the hand of HaShem, for very great are His mercies; and let me not fall into the hand of man.' "
I Chronicles,21,14,So HaShem sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
I Chronicles,21,15,"And G-d sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was about to destroy, HaShem beheld, and He repented Him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel: 'It is enough; now stay thy hand.' And the angel of HaShem was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. "
I Chronicles,21,16,"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of HaShem standing between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. "
I Chronicles,21,17,"And David said unto G-d: 'Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, O HaShem my G-d, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against Thy people, that they should be plagued.' "
I Chronicles,21,18,"Then the angel of HaShem commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto HaShem in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. "
I Chronicles,21,19,"And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of HaShem. "
I Chronicles,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. "
I Chronicles,21,21,"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed down to David with his face to the ground. "
I Chronicles,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan: 'Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto HaShem; for the full price shalt thou give it me; that the plague may be stayed from the people.' "
I Chronicles,21,23,"And Ornan said unto David: 'Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all' "
I Chronicles,21,24,"And king David said to Ornan: 'Nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for HaShem, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.' "
I Chronicles,21,25,So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
I Chronicles,21,26,"And David built there an altar unto HaShem, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon HaShem; and He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. "
I Chronicles,21,27,And HaShem commanded the angel; and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof. 
I Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, when David saw that HaShem had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. "
I Chronicles,21,29,"For the tabernacle of HaShem, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. "
I Chronicles,21,30,But David could not go before it to inquire of G-d; for he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of HaShem. 
I Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said: 'This is the house of HaShem G-d, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.' "
I Chronicles,22,2,And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of G-d. 
I Chronicles,22,3,"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight; "
I Chronicles,22,4,and cedar-trees without number; for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David. 
I Chronicles,22,5,"And David said: 'Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for HaShem must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries; I will therefore make preparation for him.' So David prepared abundantly before his death. "
I Chronicles,22,6,"Then He called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
I Chronicles,22,7,"And David said to Solomon: 'My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of HaShem my G-d. "
I Chronicles,22,8,"But the word of HaShem came to me, saying: Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars; thou shalt not build a house unto My name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in My sight. "
I Chronicles,22,9,"Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. "
I Chronicles,22,10,"He shall build a house for My name; and he shall be to Me for a son, and I will be to him for a father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. "
I Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son, HaShem be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of HaShem thy G-d, as He hath spoken concerning thee. "
I Chronicles,22,12,"Only HaShem give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of HaShem thy G-d. "
I Chronicles,22,13,"Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which HaShem charged Moses with concerning Israel; be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed. "
I Chronicles,22,14,"Now, behold, in my straits I have prepared for the house of HaShem a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. "
I Chronicles,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in any manner of work; "
I Chronicles,22,16,"of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and HaShem be with thee.' "
I Chronicles,22,17,David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son: 
I Chronicles,22,18,"'Is not HaShem your G-d with you? and hath He not given you rest on every side? for He hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before HaShem, and before His people. "
I Chronicles,22,19,"Now set your heart and your soul to seek after HaShem your G-d; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of HaShem G-d, to bring the ark of the covenant of HaShem, and the holy vessels of G-d, into the house that is to be built to the name of HaShem.'  "
I Chronicles,23,1,Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
I Chronicles,23,2,"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. "
I Chronicles,23,3,"And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. "
I Chronicles,23,4,"Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of HaShem; and six thousand were officers and judges; "
I Chronicles,23,5,and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised HaShem `with the instruments which I made to praise therewith.' 
I Chronicles,23,6,"And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. "
I Chronicles,23,7,"Of the Gershonites: Ladan, and Shimei. "
I Chronicles,23,8,"The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. "
I Chronicles,23,9,"The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan. "
I Chronicles,23,10,"And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. "
I Chronicles,23,11,"And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning. "
I Chronicles,23,12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. "
I Chronicles,23,13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should be sanctified as most holy, he and his sons for ever, to offer before HaShem, to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name for ever. "
I Chronicles,23,14,"But as for Moses the man of G-d, his sons are named among the tribe of Levi. "
I Chronicles,23,15,"The sons of Moses: Gershom, and Eliezer. "
I Chronicles,23,16,The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
I Chronicles,23,17,And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
I Chronicles,23,18,The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
I Chronicles,23,19,"The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. "
I Chronicles,23,20,"The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. "
I Chronicles,23,21,"The sons of Merari: Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar, and Kish. "
I Chronicles,23,22,"And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their brethren the sons of Kish took them to wife. "
I Chronicles,23,23,"The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. "
I Chronicles,23,24,"These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses, according to their muster, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of HaShem, from twenty years old and upward. "
I Chronicles,23,25,"For David said: 'The HaShem, the G-d of Israel, hath given rest unto His people, and He dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever; "
I Chronicles,23,26,and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.' 
I Chronicles,23,27,For by the last ordinances of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward. 
I Chronicles,23,28,"For their station was at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of HaShem, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of G-d; "
I Chronicles,23,29,"for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked on the griddle, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size; "
I Chronicles,23,30,"and to stand every morning to thank and praise HaShem, and likewise at even; "
I Chronicles,23,31,"and to offer all burnt-offerings unto HaShem, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and in the appointed seasons, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually, before HaShem; "
I Chronicles,23,32,"and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of HaShem. "
I Chronicles,24,1,"And the courses of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. "
I Chronicles,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office. "
I Chronicles,24,3,"And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. "
I Chronicles,24,4,"And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses, eight. "
I Chronicles,24,5,"Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for they were princes of the sanctuary and princes of G-d, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. "
I Chronicles,24,6,"And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites: one father's house being taken for Eleazar, and proportionately for Ithamar. "
I Chronicles,24,7,"Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah; "
I Chronicles,24,8,"the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim; "
I Chronicles,24,9,"the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin; "
I Chronicles,24,10,"the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah; "
I Chronicles,24,11,"the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah; "
I Chronicles,24,12,"the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim; "
I Chronicles,24,13,"the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab; "
I Chronicles,24,14,"the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer; "
I Chronicles,24,15,"the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez; "
I Chronicles,24,16,"the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel; "
I Chronicles,24,17,"the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul; "
I Chronicles,24,18,"the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. "
I Chronicles,24,19,"These were the orderings of them in their service, to come into the house of HaShem according to the ordinance given unto them by the hand of Aaron their father, as HaShem, the G-d of Israel, had commanded him. "
I Chronicles,24,20,"And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. "
I Chronicles,24,21,"Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. "
I Chronicles,24,22,"Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. "
I Chronicles,24,23,"And Benai, Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. "
I Chronicles,24,24,"The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. "
I Chronicles,24,25,"The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. "
I Chronicles,24,26,"The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, his son, "
I Chronicles,24,27,"even the sons of Merari through Jaaziah his son: Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. "
I Chronicles,24,28,"Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. "

"
I Chronicles,28,2,"Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said: 'Hear me, my brethren, and my people; as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of HaShem, and for the footstool of our G-d; and I had made ready for the building. "
I Chronicles,28,3,"But G-d said unto me: Thou shalt not build a house for My name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. "
I Chronicles,28,4,"Howbeit HaShem, the G-d of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for He hath chosen Judah to be prince, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel; "
I Chronicles,28,5,and of all my sons--for HaShem hath given me many sons--He hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of HaShem over Israel. 
I Chronicles,28,6,"And He said unto me: Solomon thy son, he shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be to Me for a son, and I will be to him for a father. "
I Chronicles,28,7,"And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do My commandments and Mine ordinances, as at this day. "
I Chronicles,28,8,"Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of HaShem, and in the hearing of our G-d, observe and seek out all the commandments of HaShem your G-d; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever. "
I Chronicles,28,9,"And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the G-d of thy father, and serve Him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for HaShem searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever. "
I Chronicles,28,10,"Take heed now; for HaShem hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.' "
I Chronicles,28,11,"Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the ark-cover; "
I Chronicles,28,12,"and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, for the courts of the house of HaShem, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of G-d, and for the treasuries of the hallowed things; "
I Chronicles,28,13,"also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of HaShem, and for all the vessels of service in the house of HaShem: "
I Chronicles,28,14,"of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; "
I Chronicles,28,15,"by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, silver by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick; "
I Chronicles,28,16,"and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; "
I Chronicles,28,17,"and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the jars, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; "
I Chronicles,28,18,"and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of HaShem. "
I Chronicles,28,19,"'All this do I give thee in writing, as HaShem hath made me wise by His hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.' "
I Chronicles,28,20,"And David said to Solomon his son: 'Be strong and of good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed; for HaShem G-d, even my G-d, is with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of HaShem be finished. "
I Chronicles,28,21,"And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of G-d; and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service; also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.' "
I Chronicles,29,1,"And David the king said unto all the congregation: 'Solomon my son, whom alone G-d hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for HaShem G-d. "
I Chronicles,29,2,"Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my G-d the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. "
I Chronicles,29,3,"Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my G-d, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my G-d, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, "
I Chronicles,29,4,"even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses; "
I Chronicles,29,5,"of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto HaShem?' "
I Chronicles,29,6,"Then the princes of the fathers' houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly; "
I Chronicles,29,7,"and they gave for the service of the house of G-d of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. "
I Chronicles,29,8,"And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of HaShem, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. "
I Chronicles,29,9,"Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a whole heart they offered willingly to HaShem; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. "
I Chronicles,29,10,"Wherefore David blessed HaShem before all the congregation; and David said: 'Blessed be Thou, O HaShem, the G-d of Israel our father, for ever and ever. "
I Chronicles,29,11,"Thine, O HaShem, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O HaShem, and Thou art exalted as head above all. "
I Chronicles,29,12,"Both riches and honour come of Thee, and Thou rulest over all; and in Thy hand is power and might; and in Thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. "
I Chronicles,29,13,"Now therefore, our G-d, we thank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name. "
I Chronicles,29,14,"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee. "
I Chronicles,29,15,"For we are strangers before Thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. "
I Chronicles,29,16,"O HaShem our G-d, all this store that we have prepared to build Thee a house for Thy holy name cometh of Thy hand, and is all Thine own. "
I Chronicles,29,17,"I know also, my G-d, that Thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy Thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto Thee. "
I Chronicles,29,18,"O HaShem, the G-d of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever, even the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and direct their heart unto Thee; "
I Chronicles,29,19,"and give unto Solomon my son a whole heart, to keep Thy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made, provision.' "
I Chronicles,29,20,"And David said to all the congregation: 'Now bless HaShem your G-d.' And all the congregation blessed HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves before HaShem, and before the king. "
I Chronicles,29,21,"And they sacrificed sacrifices unto HaShem, and offered burnt-offerings unto HaShem, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; "
I Chronicles,29,22,"and did eat and drink before HaShem on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto HaShem to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. "
I Chronicles,29,23,"Then Solomon sat on the throne of HaShem as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel hearkened to him. "
I Chronicles,29,24,"And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. "
I Chronicles,29,25,"And HaShem magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. "
I Chronicles,29,26,Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
I Chronicles,29,27,"And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. "
I Chronicles,29,28,"And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. "
I Chronicles,29,29,"Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of Samuel the seer, and in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Gad the seer; "
I Chronicles,29,30,"with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.  "
II Chronicles,1,1,"AND SOLOMON the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and HaShem his G-d was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. "
II Chronicles,1,2,"And Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' houses. "
II Chronicles,1,3,"So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of G-d, which Moses the servant of HaShem had made in the wilderness. "
II Chronicles,1,4,But the ark of G-d had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,1,5,"Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, had been put before the tabernacle of HaShem; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. "
II Chronicles,1,6,"And Solomon offered there, upon the brazen altar before HaShem, which was at the tent of meeting, he offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it. "
II Chronicles,1,7,"In that night did G-d, appear unto Solomon, and said unto him: 'Ask what I shall give thee.' "
II Chronicles,1,8,"And Solomon said unto G-d: 'Thou hast shown great kindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead. "
II Chronicles,1,9,"Now, O HaShem G-d, let Thy promise unto David my father be established; for Thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. "
II Chronicles,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this Thy people, that is so great?' "
II Chronicles,1,11,"And G-d said to Solomon: 'Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge My people, over whom I have made thee king; "
II Chronicles,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.' "
II Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. "
II Chronicles,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,1,15,"And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. "
II Chronicles,1,16,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keve, the king's merchants buying them of the men of Keve at a price. "
II Chronicles,1,17,"And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means. "
II Chronicles,1,18,"Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of HaShem, and a house for his kingdom. "
II Chronicles,2,1,"And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. "
II Chronicles,2,2,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying: 'As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein ,even so deal with me. "
II Chronicles,2,3,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of HaShem my G-d, to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed seasons of HaShem our G-d. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. "
II Chronicles,2,4,And the house which I build is great; for great is our G-d above all gods. 
II Chronicles,2,5,"But who is able to build Him a house, seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? who am I then, that I should build Him a house, save only to offer before Him? "
II Chronicles,2,6,"Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to grave all manner of gravings, to be with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide. "
II Chronicles,2,7,"Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees, and sandal-wood, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, "
II Chronicles,2,8,even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful. 
II Chronicles,2,9,"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.' "
II Chronicles,2,10,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: 'Because HaShem loveth His people, He hath made thee king over them.' "
II Chronicles,2,11,"Huram said moreover: 'Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for HaShem, and a house for his kingdom. "
II Chronicles,2,12,"And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, even Huram my master craftsman, "
II Chronicles,2,13,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; to do whatever may be set before him, with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father. "
II Chronicles,2,14,"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants; "
II Chronicles,2,15,"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.' "
II Chronicles,2,16,"And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred. "
II Chronicles,2,17,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work. "
II Chronicles,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of HaShem at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where HaShem appeared unto David his father; for which provision had been made in the Place of David, in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. "
II Chronicles,3,2,"And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. "
II Chronicles,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of G-d. The length by cubits after the ancient measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. "
II Chronicles,3,4,"And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. "
II Chronicles,3,5,"And the greater house he covered with cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains. "
II Chronicles,3,6,And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim. 
II Chronicles,3,7,"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls. "
II Chronicles,3,8,"And he made the most holy place; the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. "
II Chronicles,3,9,And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. 
II Chronicles,3,10,And in the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold. 
II Chronicles,3,11,"And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. "
II Chronicles,3,12,"And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub. "
II Chronicles,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward. "
II Chronicles,3,14,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon. "
II Chronicles,3,15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. "
II Chronicles,3,16,"And he made chains in the Sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. "
II Chronicles,3,17,"And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. "
II Chronicles,4,1,"Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. "
II Chronicles,4,2,"Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. "
II Chronicles,4,3,"And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. "
II Chronicles,4,4,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. "
II Chronicles,4,5,"And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths. "
II Chronicles,4,6,"He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. "
II Chronicles,4,7,"And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. "
II Chronicles,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold. "
II Chronicles,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. "
II Chronicles,4,10,"And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. "
II Chronicles,4,11,"And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of G-d: "
II Chronicles,4,12,"the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; "
II Chronicles,4,13,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars. "
II Chronicles,4,14,"He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases; "
II Chronicles,4,15,"one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. "
II Chronicles,4,16,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his master craftsman make for king Solomon for the house of HaShem of bright brass. "
II Chronicles,4,17,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. "
II Chronicles,4,18,Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the brass could not be found out. 
II Chronicles,4,19,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of G-d, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread; "
II Chronicles,4,20,"and the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; "
II Chronicles,4,21,"and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold; "
II Chronicles,4,22,"and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold. And as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, were of gold. "
II Chronicles,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of HaShem was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had hallowed; even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of G-d. "
II Chronicles,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of HaShem out of the city of David, which is Zion. "
II Chronicles,5,3,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. "
II Chronicles,5,4,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. "
II Chronicles,5,5,"And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests and the Levites bring up. "
II Chronicles,5,6,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. "
II Chronicles,5,7,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of HaShem unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. "
II Chronicles,5,8,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. "
II Chronicles,5,9,And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day. 
II Chronicles,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when HaShem made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. "
II Chronicles,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place--for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses; "
II Chronicles,5,12,"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets-- "
II Chronicles,5,13,"it came even to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking HaShem; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised HaShem: 'for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever'; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of HaShem, "
II Chronicles,5,14,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of HaShem filled the house of G-d. 
II Chronicles,6,1,Then spoke Solomon: HaShem hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness. 
II Chronicles,6,2,"But I have built Thee a house of habitation, and a place for Thee to dwell in for ever. "
II Chronicles,6,3,"And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel stood. "
II Chronicles,6,4,"And he said: 'Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hands fulfilled it, saying: "
II Chronicles,6,5,"Since the day that I brought forth My people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that My name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over My people Israel; "
II Chronicles,6,6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name might be there; and have chosen David to be over My people Israel. "
II Chronicles,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
II Chronicles,6,8,"But HaShem said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart; "
II Chronicles,6,9,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name. "
II Chronicles,6,10,"And HaShem hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as HaShem promised, and have built the house for the name of HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
II Chronicles,6,11,"And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of HaShem, which He made with the children of Israel.' "
II Chronicles,6,12,"And he stood before the altar of HaShem in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands-- "
II Chronicles,6,13,"for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven-- "
II Chronicles,6,14,"and he said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, there is no G-d like Thee, in the heaven, or in the earth; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; "
II Chronicles,6,15,"who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day. "
II Chronicles,6,16,"Now therefore, O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him, saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel; if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in My law as thou hast walked before Me. "
II Chronicles,6,17,"Now therefore, O HaShem, the G-d of Israel, let Thy word be verified, which Thou spokest unto Thy servant David. "
II Chronicles,6,18,"But will G-d in very truth dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house which I have builded! "
II Chronicles,6,19,"Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O HaShem my G-d, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee; "
II Chronicles,6,20,"that Thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said that thou wouldest put Thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place. "
II Chronicles,6,21,"And hearken Thou to the supplications of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou from Thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when Thou hearest, forgive. "
II Chronicles,6,22,"If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; "
II Chronicles,6,23,"then hear Thou from heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. "
II Chronicles,6,24,"And if Thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, when they sin against Thee, and shall turn again and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication before Thee in this house; "
II Chronicles,6,25,"then hear Thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest to them and to their fathers. "
II Chronicles,6,26,"When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, turning from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; "
II Chronicles,6,27,"then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou dost direct them on the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance. "
II Chronicles,6,28,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be; "
II Chronicles,6,29,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own pain, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house; "
II Chronicles,6,30,"then hear Thou from heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest--for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men-- "
II Chronicles,6,31,"that they may fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers. "
II Chronicles,6,32,"Moreover concerning the stranger, that is not of Thy people Israel, when be shall come out of a far country for Thy great name's sake, and Thy mighty hand, and Thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house; "
II Chronicles,6,33,"then hear Thou from heaven, even from Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, and fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built. "
II Chronicles,6,34,"If Thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Thee toward this city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; "
II Chronicles,6,35,"then hear Thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. "
II Chronicles,6,36,"If they sin against Thee--for there is no man that sinneth not--and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near; "
II Chronicles,6,37,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done iniquitously, and have dealt wickedly; "
II Chronicles,6,38,"if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; "
II Chronicles,6,39,"then hear Thou from heaven, even from Thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause; and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee. "
II Chronicles,6,40,"Now, O my G-d, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and let Thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place. "
II Chronicles,6,41,"Now therefore arise, O HaShem G-d, into Thy resting-place, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength; let Thy priests, O HaShem G-d, be clothed with salvation, and let Thy saints rejoice in good. "
II Chronicles,6,42,"O HaShem G-d, turn not away the face of Thine anointed; remember the good deeds of David Thy servant.' "
II Chronicles,7,1,"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of HaShem filled the house. "
II Chronicles,7,2,"And the priests could not enter into the house of HaShem, because the glory of HaShem filled HaShem'S house. "
II Chronicles,7,3,"And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of HaShem was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and gave thanks unto HaShem; 'for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.' "
II Chronicles,7,4,And the king and all the people offered sacrifice before HaShem. 
II Chronicles,7,5,"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of G-d. "
II Chronicles,7,6,"And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of HaShem, which David the king had made, to give thanks unto HaShem, for His mercy endureth for ever, with the praises of David by their hand; and the priests sounded trumpets over against them; and all Israel stood. "
II Chronicles,7,7,"Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of HaShem; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat. "
II Chronicles,7,8,"So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt. "
II Chronicles,7,9,"And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. "
II Chronicles,7,10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that HaShem had shown unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people. "
II Chronicles,7,11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of HaShem, and the king's house; and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of HaShem, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. "
II Chronicles,7,12,"And HaShem appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him: 'I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to Myself for a house of sacrifice. "
II Chronicles,7,13,"If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people; "
II Chronicles,7,14,"if My people, upon whom My name is called, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. "
II Chronicles,7,15,"Now Mine eyes shall be open, and Mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place. "
II Chronicles,7,16,"For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that My name may be there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. "
II Chronicles,7,17,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; "
II Chronicles,7,18,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. "
II Chronicles,7,19,"But if ye turn away, and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; "
II Chronicles,7,20,"then will I pluck them up by the roots out of My land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. "
II Chronicles,7,21,"And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say: Why hath HaShem done thus unto this land, and to this house? "
II Chronicles,7,22,"And they shall answer: Because they forsook HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath He brought all this evil upon them.' "
II Chronicles,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of HaShem, and his own house, "
II Chronicles,8,2,"that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. "
II Chronicles,8,3,"And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it. "
II Chronicles,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath. "
II Chronicles,8,5,"Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars; "
II Chronicles,8,6,"and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. "
II Chronicles,8,7,"As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel; "
II Chronicles,8,8,"of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. "
II Chronicles,8,9,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. "
II Chronicles,8,10,"And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people. "
II Chronicles,8,11,"And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said: 'No wife of mine shall dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of HaShem hath come.' "
II Chronicles,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto HaShem on the altar of HaShem, which he had built before the porch, "
II Chronicles,8,13,"even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed seasons, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles. "
II Chronicles,8,14,"And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate; for so had David the man of G-d commanded. "
II Chronicles,8,15,"And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. "
II Chronicles,8,16,"So all the work of Solomon was set in order from the day of the foundation of the house of HaShem, and until it was finished. So the house of HaShem was perfected. "
II Chronicles,8,17,"Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the sea-shore in the land of Edom. "
II Chronicles,8,18,"And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. "
II Chronicles,9,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices and gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. "
II Chronicles,9,2,And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not any thing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 
II Chronicles,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, "
II Chronicles,9,4,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of HaShem; there was no more spirit in her. "
II Chronicles,9,5,"And she said to the king: 'It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. "
II Chronicles,9,6,"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me; thou exceedest the fame that I heard. "
II Chronicles,9,7,"Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. "
II Chronicles,9,8,"Blessed be HaShem thy G-d, who delighted in thee, to set thee on His throne, to be king for HaShem thy G-d; because thy G-d loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made He thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.' "
II Chronicles,9,9,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones; neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. "
II Chronicles,9,10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon that brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-wood and precious stones. "
II Chronicles,9,11,"And the king made of the sandal-wood paths for the house of HaShem, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers; and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. "
II Chronicles,9,12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants. "
II Chronicles,9,13,Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
II Chronicles,9,14,beside that which the traffickers and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
II Chronicles,9,15,And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target; 
II Chronicles,9,16,three hundred shields of beaten gold also: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
II Chronicles,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. "
II Chronicles,9,18,"And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and arms on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. "
II Chronicles,9,19,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
II Chronicles,9,20,"And all king Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. "
II Chronicles,9,21,"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. "
II Chronicles,9,22,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
II Chronicles,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which G-d had put in his heart. "
II Chronicles,9,24,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. "
II Chronicles,9,25,"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,9,26,"And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. "
II Chronicles,9,27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. "
II Chronicles,9,28,"And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands. "
II Chronicles,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Jedo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? "
II Chronicles,9,30,And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
II Chronicles,9,31,And Solomon slept with his fathers; they buried him in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. 
II Chronicles,10,1,And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
II Chronicles,10,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it--for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon--that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. "
II Chronicles,10,3,"And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying: "
II Chronicles,10,4,"'Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.' "
II Chronicles,10,5,And he said unto them: 'Come again unto me after three days.' And the people departed. 
II Chronicles,10,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: 'What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?' "
II Chronicles,10,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying: 'If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.' "
II Chronicles,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. "
II Chronicles,10,9,"And he said unto them: 'What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?' "
II Chronicles,10,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. "
II Chronicles,10,11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.' "
II Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: 'Come to me again the third day.' "
II Chronicles,10,13,"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, "
II Chronicles,10,14,"and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: 'My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.' "
II Chronicles,10,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of G-d, that HaShem might establish His word, which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. "
II Chronicles,10,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: 'What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.' So all Israel departed unto their tents. "
II Chronicles,10,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. "
II Chronicles,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the levy; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,10,19,So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
II Chronicles,11,1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam. "
II Chronicles,11,2,"But the word of HaShem came to Shemaiah the man of G-d, saying: "
II Chronicles,11,3,"'Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying: "
II Chronicles,11,4,"Thus saith HaShem: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren; return every man to his house, for this thing is of Me.' So they hearkened unto the words of HaShem, and returned from going against Jeroboam. "
II Chronicles,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. "
II Chronicles,11,6,"He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, "
II Chronicles,11,7,"and Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam, "
II Chronicles,11,8,"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, "
II Chronicles,11,9,"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, "
II Chronicles,11,10,"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities. "
II Chronicles,11,11,"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and oil and wine. "
II Chronicles,11,12,"And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin adhered to him. "
II Chronicles,11,13,And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel presented themselves to him out of all their border. 
II Chronicles,11,14,"For the Levites left their open land and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office unto HaShem; "
II Chronicles,11,15,"and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the satyrs, and for the calves which he had made. "
II Chronicles,11,16,"And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek HaShem, the G-d of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon. "
II Chronicles,11,18,"And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; "
II Chronicles,11,19,"and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. "
II Chronicles,11,20,"And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. "
II Chronicles,11,21,"And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines--for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begot twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters. "
II Chronicles,11,22,"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, even the prince among his brethren; for he was minded to make him king. "
II Chronicles,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city; and he gave them victual in abundance. And he sought for them many wives. "
II Chronicles,12,1,"And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of HaShem, and all Israel with him. "
II Chronicles,12,2,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had dealt treacherously with HaShem, "
II Chronicles,12,3,"with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. "
II Chronicles,12,4,"And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,12,5,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem: Ye have forsaken Me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.' "
II Chronicles,12,6,Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said: 'The HaShem is righteous.' 
II Chronicles,12,7,"And when HaShem saw that they humbled themselves, the word of HaShem came to Shemaiah, saying: 'They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. "
II Chronicles,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.' "
II Chronicles,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of HaShem, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all away; he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. "
II Chronicles,12,10,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king's house. "
II Chronicles,12,11,"And it was so, that as oft as the king entered into the house of HaShem, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber. "
II Chronicles,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the anger of HaShem turned from him, that He would not destroy him altogether; and moreover in Judah there were good things found. "
II Chronicles,12,13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which HaShem had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there; and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. "
II Chronicles,12,14,"And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek HaShem. "
II Chronicles,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. "
II Chronicles,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,13,1,In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. 
II Chronicles,13,2,Three years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
II Chronicles,13,3,"And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour. "
II Chronicles,13,4,"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said: 'Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel; "
II Chronicles,13,5,"ought ye not to know that HaShem, the G-d of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? "
II Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. "
II Chronicles,13,7,"And there were gathered unto him vain men, base fellows that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted, and could not withstand them. "
II Chronicles,13,8,"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of HaShem in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods. "
II Chronicles,13,9,"Have ye not driven out the priests of HaShem, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same becometh a priest of them that are no gods. "
II Chronicles,13,10,"But as for us, HaShem is our G-d, and we have not forsaken Him; and we have priests ministering unto HaShem, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work; "
II Chronicles,13,11,"and they burn unto HaShem every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense; the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening; for we keep the charge of HaShem our G-d; but ye have forsaken Him. "
II Chronicles,13,12,"And, behold, G-d is with us at our head, and His priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against HaShem, the G-d of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.' "
II Chronicles,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. "
II Chronicles,13,14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto HaShem, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. "
II Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that G-d smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. "
II Chronicles,13,16,And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and G-d delivered them into their hand. 
II Chronicles,13,17,And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
II Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,13,19,"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. "
II Chronicles,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and HaShem smote him, and he died. "
II Chronicles,13,21,"But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begot twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. "
II Chronicles,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. "
II Chronicles,13,23,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his stead; in his days the land was quiet ten years. "
II Chronicles,14,1,And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of HaShem his G-d; 
II Chronicles,14,2,"for he took away the strange altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim; "
II Chronicles,14,3,"and commanded Judah to seek HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. "
II Chronicles,14,4,Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
II Chronicles,14,5,"And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years; because HaShem had given him rest. "
II Chronicles,14,6,"For he said unto Judah: 'Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought HaShem our G-d; we have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side.' So they built and prospered. "
II Chronicles,14,7,"And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand; all these were mighty men of valour. "
II Chronicles,14,8,"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. "
II Chronicles,14,9,"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephath at Mareshah. "
II Chronicles,14,10,"And Asa cried unto HaShem his G-d, and said: 'HaShem, there is none beside Thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength; help us, O HaShem our G-d; for we rely on Thee, and in Thy name are we come against this multitude. Thou art HaShem our G-d; let not man prevail against Thee.' "
II Chronicles,14,11,"So HaShem smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. "
II Chronicles,14,12,"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar; and there fell of the Ethiopians so that none remained alive; for they were shattered before HaShem, and before His host; and they carried away very much booty. "
II Chronicles,14,13,And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for a terror from HaShem came upon them; and they spoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. 
II Chronicles,14,14,"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,15,1,And the spirit of G-d came upon Azariah the son of Oded; 
II Chronicles,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him: 'Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: HaShem is with you, while ye are with Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; but if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you. "
II Chronicles,15,3,"Now for long seasons Israel was without the true G-d, and without a teaching priest, and without law; "
II Chronicles,15,4,"but when in their distress they turned unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and sought Him, He was found of them. "
II Chronicles,15,5,"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great discomfitures were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. "
II Chronicles,15,6,"And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for G-d did discomfit them with all manner of adversity. "
II Chronicles,15,7,"But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.' "
II Chronicles,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, even the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the detestable things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of HaShem, that was before the porch of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that HaShem his G-d was with him. "
II Chronicles,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. "
II Chronicles,15,11,"And they sacrificed unto HaShem in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. "
II Chronicles,15,12,"And they entered into the covenant to seek HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul; "
II Chronicles,15,13,"and that whosoever would not seek HaShem, the G-d of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. "
II Chronicles,15,14,"And they swore unto HaShem with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns. "
II Chronicles,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found of them; and HaShem gave them rest round about. "
II Chronicles,15,16,"And also Maacah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. "
II Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole all his days. 
II Chronicles,15,18,"And he brought into the house of G-d the things that his father had hallowed, and that he himself had hallowed, silver, and gold, and vessels. "
II Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa. 
II Chronicles,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasa king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. "
II Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of HaShem and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Aram, that dwelt at Damascus, saying: "
II Chronicles,16,3,"'There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.' "
II Chronicles,16,4,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali. "
II Chronicles,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasa heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease. "
II Chronicles,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. "
II Chronicles,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him: 'Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram, and hast not relied on HaShem thy G-d, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thy hand. "
II Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on HaShem, He delivered them into thy hand. "
II Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of HaShem run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is whole toward Him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.' "
II Chronicles,16,10,"Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time. "
II Chronicles,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. "
II Chronicles,16,12,"And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great; yet in his disease he sought not to HaShem, but to the physicians. "
II Chronicles,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. "
II Chronicles,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great burning for him.  "
II Chronicles,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. "
II Chronicles,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. "
II Chronicles,17,3,"And HaShem was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim; "
II Chronicles,17,4,"but sought to the G-d of his father, and walked in His commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. "
II Chronicles,17,5,Therefore HaShem established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. 
II Chronicles,17,6,And his heart was lifted up in the ways of HaShem; and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah. 
II Chronicles,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; "
II Chronicles,17,8,"and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. "
II Chronicles,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, having the book of the Law of HaShem with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people. "
II Chronicles,17,10,"And a terror from HaShem fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. "
II Chronicles,17,11,"And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats. "
II Chronicles,17,12,And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store. 
II Chronicles,17,13,"And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,17,14,"And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand; "
II Chronicles,17,15,"and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand; "
II Chronicles,17,16,"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto HaShem, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour; "
II Chronicles,17,17,"and of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; "
II Chronicles,17,18,"and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war. "
II Chronicles,17,19,These were they that waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. 
II Chronicles,18,1,Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance; and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 
II Chronicles,18,2,"And after a lapse of years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead. "
II Chronicles,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah: 'Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?' And he answered him: 'I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.' "
II Chronicles,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: 'Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of HaShem today.' "
II Chronicles,18,5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them: 'Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And they said: 'Go up; for G-d will deliver it into the hand of the king.' "
II Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here besides a prophet of HaShem, that we might inquire of him?' "
II Chronicles,18,7,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of HaShem; but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.' And Jehoshaphat said: 'Let not the king say so.' "
II Chronicles,18,8,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: 'Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.' "
II Chronicles,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they sat in a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. "
II Chronicles,18,10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: 'Thus saith HaShem: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.' "
II Chronicles,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: 'Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for HaShem will deliver it into the hand of the king.' "
II Chronicles,18,12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying: 'Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.' "
II Chronicles,18,13,"And Micaiah said: 'As HaShem liveth, what my G-d saith, that will I speak.' "
II Chronicles,18,14,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: 'Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And he said: 'Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.' "
II Chronicles,18,15,And the king said to him: 'How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of HaShem.' 
II Chronicles,18,16,"And he said: 'I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and HaShem said: These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.' "
II Chronicles,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: 'Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?' "
II Chronicles,18,18,"And he said: 'Therefore hear ye the word of HaShem: I saw HaShem sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left. "
II Chronicles,18,19,"And HaShem said: who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. "
II Chronicles,18,20,"And there came forth the spirit, and stood before HaShem, and said: I will entice him. And HaShem said unto him: Wherewith? "
II Chronicles,18,21,"And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so. "
II Chronicles,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, HaShem hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and HaShem hath spoken evil concerning thee.' "
II Chronicles,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the check, and said: 'Which way went the spirit of HaShem from me to speak unto thee?' "
II Chronicles,18,24,"And Micaiah said: 'Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.' "
II Chronicles,18,25,"And the king of Israel said: 'Take ye Micaiah; and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; "
II Chronicles,18,26,"and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I return in peace.' "
II Chronicles,18,27,"And Micaiah said: 'If thou return at all in peace, HaShem hath not spoken by me.' And he said: 'Hear, ye peoples, all of you.' "
II Chronicles,18,28,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the kind of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
II Chronicles,18,29,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.' So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. "
II Chronicles,18,30,"Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying: 'Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.' "
II Chronicles,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: 'It is the king of Israel.' Therefore they turned about to fight against him; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and HaShem helped him; and G-d moved them to depart from him. "
II Chronicles,18,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. "
II Chronicles,18,33,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot: 'Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.' "
II Chronicles,18,34,And the battle increased that day; howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Arameans until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.  
II Chronicles,19,1,And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat: 'Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate HaShem? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before HaShem. "
II Chronicles,19,3,"Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek G-d.' "
II Chronicles,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,19,5,"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, "
II Chronicles,19,6,"and said to the judges: 'Consider what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for HaShem; and He is with you in giving judgment. "
II Chronicles,19,7,"Now therefore let the fear of HaShem be upon you; take heed and do it; for there is no iniquity with HaShem our G-d, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.' "
II Chronicles,19,8,"Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel, for the judgment of HaShem, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,19,9,"And he charged them, saying: 'Thus shall ye do in the fear of HaShem, faithfully, and with a whole heart. "
II Chronicles,19,10,"And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards HaShem, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren; thus shall ye do, and ye shall not be guilty. "
II Chronicles,19,11,"And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of HaShem; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters; also the officers of the Levites before you. Deal courageously, and HaShem be with the good.' "
II Chronicles,20,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. "
II Chronicles,20,2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying: `There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Aram; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar' --the same is En-gedi. "
II Chronicles,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto HaShem; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. "
II Chronicles,20,4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of HaShem; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek HaShem. "
II Chronicles,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of HaShem, before the new court; "
II Chronicles,20,6,"and he said: 'O HaShem, the G-d of our fathers, art not Thou alone G-d in heaven? and art not Thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in Thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand Thee. "
II Chronicles,20,7,"Didst not Thou, O our G-d, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham Thy friend for ever? "
II Chronicles,20,8,"And they dwelt therein, and have built Thee a sanctuary therein for Thy name, saying: "
II Chronicles,20,9,"If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before Thee--for Thy name is in this house--and cry unto Thee in our affliction, and Thou wilt hear and save. "
II Chronicles,20,10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom Thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not; "
II Chronicles,20,11,"behold, they render unto us evil, to come to cast us out of Thy possession, which Thou hast given us to inherit. "
II Chronicles,20,12,"O our G-d, wilt Thou not execute judgment on them? for we have no might against this great multitude that cometh against us; neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon Thee.' "
II Chronicles,20,13,"And all Judah stood before HaShem, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. "
II Chronicles,20,14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of HaShem in the midst of the congregation; "
II Chronicles,20,15,"and he said: 'Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: thus saith HaShem unto you: Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but G-d's. "
II Chronicles,20,16,"To-morrow go ye down against them; behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. "
II Chronicles,20,17,"Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of HaShem with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed; to-morrow go out against them; for HaShem is with you.' "
II Chronicles,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before HaShem, worshipping HaShem. "
II Chronicles,20,19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise HaShem, the G-d of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice. "
II Chronicles,20,20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said: 'Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in HaShem your G-d, so shall ye be established; believe His prophets, so shall ye prosper.' "
II Chronicles,20,21,"And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto HaShem, and praise in the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and say: 'Give thanks unto HaShem, for His mercy endureth for ever.' "
II Chronicles,20,22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, HaShem set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. "
II Chronicles,20,23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. "
II Chronicles,20,24,"And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped. "
II Chronicles,20,25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much. "
II Chronicles,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed HaShem; therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah, unto this day. "
II Chronicles,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for HaShem had made them to rejoice over their enemies. "
II Chronicles,20,28,And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of HaShem. 
II Chronicles,20,29,"And a terror from G-d was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that HaShem fought against the enemies of Israel. "
II Chronicles,20,30,So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his G-d gave him rest round about. 
II Chronicles,20,31,And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah; he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
II Chronicles,20,32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,20,33,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the G-d of their fathers. 
II Chronicles,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel. "
II Chronicles,20,35,And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly; 
II Chronicles,20,36,and he joined him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. 
II Chronicles,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying: 'Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, HaShem hath made a breach in thy works.' And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.  "
II Chronicles,21,1,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,21,2,"And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariahu, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. "
II Chronicles,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born. "
II Chronicles,21,4,"Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. "
II Chronicles,21,5,Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,21,7,"Howbeit HaShem would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and as He promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway. "
II Chronicles,21,8,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. "
II Chronicles,21,9,"Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots. "
II Chronicles,21,10,"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand; because he had forsaken HaShem, the G-d of his fathers. "
II Chronicles,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, and drew Judah away. "
II Chronicles,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of David thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah; "
II Chronicles,21,13,"but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, like as the house of Ahab made Israel to go astray; and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, who were better than thyself; "
II Chronicles,21,14,"behold, HaShem will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance; "
II Chronicles,21,15,"and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.' "
II Chronicles,21,16,"And HaShem stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians; "
II Chronicles,21,17,"and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. "
II Chronicles,21,18,And after all this HaShem smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 
II Chronicles,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. "
II Chronicles,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed joyless; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. "
II Chronicles,22,1,And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
II Chronicles,22,2,Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
II Chronicles,22,3,He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. 
II Chronicles,22,4,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction. "
II Chronicles,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. "
II Chronicles,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. "
II Chronicles,22,7,"Now the downfall of Ahaziah was of G-d, in that he went unto Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom HaShem had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. "
II Chronicles,22,8,"And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them. "
II Chronicles,22,9,"And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him--now he was hiding in Samaria--and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said: 'He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought HaShem with all his heart.' And there was none of the house of Ahaziah that had power to hold the kingdom. "
II Chronicles,22,10,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. "
II Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bed-chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest--for she was the sister of Ahaziah--hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. "
II Chronicles,22,12,And he was with them hid in the house of G-d six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land. 
II Chronicles,23,1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. "
II Chronicles,23,2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,23,3,"And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of G-d. And he said unto them: 'Behold, the king's son shall reign, as HaShem hath spoken concerning the sons of David. "
II Chronicles,23,4,"This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; "
II Chronicles,23,5,and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of HaShem. 
II Chronicles,23,6,"But let none come into the house of HaShem, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the charge of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,23,7,"And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain; and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.' "
II Chronicles,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. "
II Chronicles,23,9,"And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of G-d. "
II Chronicles,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. "
II Chronicles,23,11,"Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown and the insignia, and made him king; and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said: 'Long live the king.' "
II Chronicles,23,12,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of HaShem; "
II Chronicles,23,13,"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood on his platform at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; the singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said: 'Treason, treason.' "
II Chronicles,23,14,"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them: 'Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword'; for the priest said: 'Slay her not in the house of HaShem.' "
II Chronicles,23,15,So they made way for her; and she went to the entry of the horse gate to the king's house; and they slew her there. 
II Chronicles,23,16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be HaShem'S people. "
II Chronicles,23,17,"And all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. "
II Chronicles,23,18,"And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of HaShem under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of HaShem, to offer the burnt-offerings of HaShem, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the direction of David. "
II Chronicles,23,19,"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of HaShem, that none that was unclean in any thing should enter in. "
II Chronicles,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of HaShem; and they came through the upper gate unto the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. "
II Chronicles,23,21,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; and they slew Athaliah with the sword. "
II Chronicles,24,1,Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
II Chronicles,24,2,And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 
II Chronicles,24,3,And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begot sons and daughters. 
II Chronicles,24,4,"And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,24,5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them: 'Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your G-d from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.' Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. "
II Chronicles,24,6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and unto him: 'Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of HaShem, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?' "
II Chronicles,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of G-d; and also all the hallowed things of the house of HaShem did they bestow upon the Baalim. "
II Chronicles,24,8,"So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,24,9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for HaShem the tax that Moses the servant of G-d laid upon Israel in the wilderness. "
II Chronicles,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. "
II Chronicles,24,11,"And it was so, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it back to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. "
II Chronicles,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of HaShem; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of HaShem, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set up the house of G-d in its state, and strengthened it. "
II Chronicles,24,14,"And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of HaShem, even vessels wherewith to minister, and buckets, and pans, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of HaShem continually all the days of Jehoiada. "
II Chronicles,24,15,"But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. "
II Chronicles,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward G-d and His house. "
II Chronicles,24,17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and prostrated themselves before the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. "
II Chronicles,24,18,"And they forsook the house of HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness. "
II Chronicles,24,19,"Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back unto HaShem; and they admonished them, but they would not give ear. "
II Chronicles,24,20,"And the spirit of G-d clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them: 'Thus saith G-d: Why transgress ye the commandments of HaShem, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken HaShem, He hath also forsaken you.' "
II Chronicles,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,24,22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said: 'The HaShem look upon it, and require it.' "
II Chronicles,24,23,"And it came to pass, when the year was come about, that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. "
II Chronicles,24,24,"For the army of the Arameans came with a small company of men; and HaShem delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash. "
II Chronicles,24,25,"And when they were departed from him--for they left him in great diseases--his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. "
II Chronicles,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. "
II Chronicles,24,27,"Now concerning his sons, and the multitude of the burdens against him, and the rebuilding of the house of G-d, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,25,1,Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,25,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, but not with a whole heart. "
II Chronicles,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants who had killed the king his father. "
II Chronicles,25,4,"But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as HaShem commanded, saying: 'The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.' "
II Chronicles,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. "
II Chronicles,25,6,He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
II Chronicles,25,7,"But there came a man of G-d to him, saying: 'O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for HaShem is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim. "
II Chronicles,25,8,"But if thou wilt go, and do engage never so valiantly in battle, G-d will cast thee down before the enemy; for G-d hath power to help, and to cast down.' "
II Chronicles,25,9,And Amaziah said to the man of G-d: 'But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?' And the man of G-d answered: 'The HaShem is able to give thee much more than this.' 
II Chronicles,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go back home; wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger. "
II Chronicles,25,11,"And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. "
II Chronicles,25,12,"And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the Rock, and cast them down from the top of the Rock, that they all were broken in pieces. "
II Chronicles,25,13,"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil. "
II Chronicles,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and prostrated himself before them, and offered unto them. "
II Chronicles,25,15,"Wherefore the anger of HaShem was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him: 'Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?' "
II Chronicles,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him: 'Have we made thee of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?' Then the prophet forbore, and said: 'I know that G-d hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.' "
II Chronicles,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: 'Come, let us look one another in the face.' "
II Chronicles,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying: 'The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there passed by the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle. "
II Chronicles,25,19,"Thou sayest--lo, thou hast smitten Edom; will thy heart therefore lift thee up to glory therein? abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle with evil, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?' "
II Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of G-d, that He might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom. "
II Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. "
II Chronicles,25,22,And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 
II Chronicles,25,23,"And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. "
II Chronicles,25,24,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of G-d with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. "
II Chronicles,25,25,And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
II Chronicles,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? "
II Chronicles,25,27,"Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following HaShem they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. "
II Chronicles,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. "
II Chronicles,26,1,"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. "
II Chronicles,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. "
II Chronicles,26,3,Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,26,4,"And he did that, which was right in the eyes of HaShem, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. "
II Chronicles,26,5,"And he set himself to seek G-d in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of G-d; and as long as he sought HaShem, G-d made him to prosper. "
II Chronicles,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines. "
II Chronicles,26,7,"And G-d helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim. "
II Chronicles,26,8,And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah; and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong. 
II Chronicles,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the Turning, and fortified them. "
II Chronicles,26,10,"And be built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the Lowland also, and in the table-land; and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry. "
II Chronicles,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. "
II Chronicles,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses, even the mighty men of valour, was two thousand and six hundred. "
II Chronicles,26,13,"And under their hand was a trained army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. "
II Chronicles,26,14,"And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging. "
II Chronicles,26,15,"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the corners, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong. "
II Chronicles,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against HaShem his G-d; for he went into the temple of HaShem to burn incense upon the altar of incense. "
II Chronicles,26,17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of HaShem, that were valiant men; "
II Chronicles,26,18,"and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him: 'It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto HaShem, but to the priests the sons of Aaron that are consecrated it pertaineth to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thy honour from HaShem G-d.' "
II Chronicles,26,19,"Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of HaShem, beside the altar of incense. "
II Chronicles,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself made haste also to go out, because HaShem had smitten him. "
II Chronicles,26,21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of HaShem; and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. "
II Chronicles,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. "
II Chronicles,26,23,So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said: 'He is a leper'; and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
II Chronicles,27,1,Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
II Chronicles,27,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; howbeit he entered not into the temple of HaShem. And the people did yet corruptly. "
II Chronicles,27,3,"He built the upper gate of the house of HaShem, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. "
II Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forest he built castles and towers. "
II Chronicles,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third. "
II Chronicles,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before HaShem his G-d. "
II Chronicles,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. "
II Chronicles,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, like David his father; "
II Chronicles,28,2,"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim. "
II Chronicles,28,3,"Moreover he offered in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom HaShem cast out before the children of Israel. "
II Chronicles,28,4,"And he sacrificed and offered in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. "
II Chronicles,28,5,"Wherefore HaShem his G-d delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. "
II Chronicles,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. "
II Chronicles,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. "
II Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of HaShem was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them: 'Behold, because HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, He hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up unto heaven. "
II Chronicles,28,10,And now ye purpose to bring the children of Judah and Jerusalem into subjection for bondmen and bondwomen unto you; but are there not even with you acts of guilt of your own against HaShem your G-d? 
II Chronicles,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of HaShem is upon you.' "
II Chronicles,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, "
II Chronicles,28,13,"and said unto them: 'Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; for ye purpose that which will bring upon us guilt against HaShem, to add unto our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.' "
II Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 
II Chronicles,28,15,"And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren; then they returned to Samaria. "
II Chronicles,28,16,At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 
II Chronicles,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. "
II Chronicles,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the Lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof; and they dwelt there. "
II Chronicles,28,19,"For HaShem brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had cast away restraint in Judah, and acted treacherously against HaShem. "
II Chronicles,28,20,"And Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. "
II Chronicles,28,21,"For Ahaz stripped the house of HaShem, and the house of the king and the princes, and gave thereof unto the king of Assyria; but it helped him not. "
II Chronicles,28,22,"And in the time of his distress did he act even more treacherously against HaShem, this same king Ahaz. "
II Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said: 'Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.' But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. "
II Chronicles,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of G-d, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of G-d, and shut up the doors of the house of HaShem; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,28,25,"And in every city of Judah he made high places to offer unto other gods, and provoked HaShem, the G-d of his fathers. "
II Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. "
II Chronicles,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,29,1,Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
II Chronicles,29,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, according to all that David his father had done. "
II Chronicles,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of HaShem, and repaired them. "
II Chronicles,29,4,"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east; "
II Chronicles,29,5,"and said unto them: `Hear me, ye Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of HaShem, the G-d of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. "
II Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers have acted treacherously, and done that which was evil in the sight of HaShem our G-d, and have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of HaShem, and turned their backs. "
II Chronicles,29,7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the G-d of Israel. "
II Chronicles,29,8,"Wherefore the wrath of HaShem was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He hath delivered them to be a horror, an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes. "
II Chronicles,29,9,"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. "
II Chronicles,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with HaShem, the G-d of Israel, that His fierce anger may turn away from us. "
II Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, be not now negligent; for HaShem hath chosen you to stand before Him, to minister unto Him, and that ye should be His ministers, and offer unto Him.' "
II Chronicles,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; "
II Chronicles,29,13,"and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; "
II Chronicles,29,14,"and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. "
II Chronicles,29,15,"And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of HaShem, to cleanse the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,29,16,"And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of HaShem, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of HaShem into the court of the house of HaShem. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron. "
II Chronicles,29,17,"Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of HaShem; and they sanctified the house of HaShem in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. "
II Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said: 'We have cleansed all the house of HaShem, even the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof. "
II Chronicles,29,19,"Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he acted treacherously, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of HaShem.' "
II Chronicles,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,29,21,"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,29,22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and dashed it against the altar; and they killed the rams, and dashed the blood against the altar; they killed also the lambs, and dashed the blood against the altar. "
II Chronicles,29,23,"And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands upon them; "
II Chronicles,29,24,"and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel. "
II Chronicles,29,25,"And he set the Levites in the house of HaShem with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of HaShem by His prophets. "
II Chronicles,29,26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. "
II Chronicles,29,27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of HaShem began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel. "
II Chronicles,29,28,"And all the congregation prostrated themselves, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished. "
II Chronicles,29,29,"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and prostrated themselves. "
II Chronicles,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto HaShem with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. "
II Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said: 'Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto HaShem, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of HaShem.' And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt-offerings. "
II Chronicles,29,32,"And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt-offering to HaShem. "
II Chronicles,29,33,And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 
II Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. "
II Chronicles,29,35,"And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of HaShem was firmly established. "
II Chronicles,29,36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which G-d had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly. "
II Chronicles,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of HaShem at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
II Chronicles,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. "
II Chronicles,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,30,4,And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the congregation. 
II Chronicles,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto HaShem, the G-d of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers according as it is written. "
II Chronicles,30,6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying: 'Ye children of Israel, turn back unto HaShem, the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that He may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. "
II Chronicles,30,7,"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who acted treacherously against HaShem, the G-d of their fathers, so that He delivered them to be an astonishment, as ye see. "
II Chronicles,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto HaShem, and enter into His sanctuary, which He hath sanctified for ever, and serve HaShem your G-d, that His fierce anger may turn away from you. "
II Chronicles,30,9,"For if ye turn back unto HaShem, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come back into this land; for HaShem your G-d is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you, if ye return unto Him.' "
II Chronicles,30,10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. "
II Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,30,12,"Also in Judah was the hand of G-d to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,30,13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. "
II Chronicles,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. "
II Chronicles,30,15,"Then they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of G-d; the priests dashed the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites. "
II Chronicles,30,17,"For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passover lambs for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto HaShem. "
II Chronicles,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying: 'The good HaShem pardon "
II Chronicles,30,19,"every one that setteth his heart to seek G-d, HaShem, the G-d of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification that pertaineth to holy things.' "
II Chronicles,30,20,"And HaShem hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. "
II Chronicles,30,21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised HaShem day by day, singing with loud instruments unto HaShem. "
II Chronicles,30,22,"And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that were well skilled in the service of HaShem. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and giving thanks to HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,30,23,And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness. 
II Chronicles,30,24,For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. 
II Chronicles,30,25,"And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. "
II Chronicles,30,26,So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard of HaShem, and their prayer came up to His holy habitation, even unto heaven. "
II Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. "
II Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priest and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,31,3,"He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointed seasons, as it is written in the Law of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. "
II Chronicles,31,6,"And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of hallowed things which were hallowed unto HaShem their G-d, and laid them by heaps. "
II Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. "
II Chronicles,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed HaShem, and His people Israel. "
II Chronicles,31,9,Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
II Chronicles,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said: 'Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of HaShem, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty; for HaShem hath blessed His people; and that which is left is this great store.' "
II Chronicles,31,11,Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of HaShem; and they prepared them. 
II Chronicles,31,12,"And they brought in the offerings and the tithes and the hallowed things faithfully; and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second. "
II Chronicles,31,13,"And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of G-d. "
II Chronicles,31,14,"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill-offerings of G-d, to distribute the offerings of HaShem, and the most holy things. "
II Chronicles,31,15,"And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small; "
II Chronicles,31,16,"beside them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of HaShem, for his daily portion, for their service in their charges according to their courses; "
II Chronicles,31,17,"and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; "
II Chronicles,31,18,"even to give to them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they administered the sacred gifts; "
II Chronicles,31,19,"also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the open land about their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites. "
II Chronicles,31,20,And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before HaShem his G-d. 
II Chronicles,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of G-d, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his G-d, he did it with all his heart, and prospered. "
II Chronicles,32,1,"After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to make a breach therein for himself. "
II Chronicles,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, "
II Chronicles,32,3,he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him. 
II Chronicles,32,4,"So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying: 'Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?' "
II Chronicles,32,5,"And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance. "
II Chronicles,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying: "
II Chronicles,32,7,"'Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a Greater with us than with him: "
II Chronicles,32,8,"with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is HaShem our G-d to help us, and to fight our battles.' And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. "
II Chronicles,32,9,"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem--now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him--unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying: "
II Chronicles,32,10,"`Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria: Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem? "
II Chronicles,32,11,"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying: HaShem our G-d will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? "
II Chronicles,32,12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye offer? "
II Chronicles,32,13,Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand? 
II Chronicles,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your G-d should be able to deliver you out of my hand? "
II Chronicles,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah beguile you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers; how much less shall your G-d deliver you out of my hand?' "
II Chronicles,32,16,"And his servants spoke yet more against HaShem G-d, and against His servant Hezekiah. "
II Chronicles,32,17,"He wrote also a letter, to taunt HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying: 'As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the G-d of Hezekiah deliver His people out of my hand.' "
II Chronicles,32,18,"And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to terrify them, and to affright them; that they might take the city. "
II Chronicles,32,19,"And they spoke of the G-d of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands. "
II Chronicles,32,20,"And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. "
II Chronicles,32,21,"And HaShem sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. "
II Chronicles,32,22,"Thus HaShem saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all, and guided them on every side. "
II Chronicles,32,23,"And many brought gifts unto HaShem to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. "
II Chronicles,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death; and he prayed unto HaShem; and He spoke unto him, and gave him a sign. "
II Chronicles,32,25,"But Hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,32,26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of HaShem came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. "
II Chronicles,32,27,"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour; and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels; "
II Chronicles,32,28,"store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds. "
II Chronicles,32,29,"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for G-d had given him very much substance. "
II Chronicles,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. "
II Chronicles,32,31,"Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, G-d left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart. "
II Chronicles,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. "
II Chronicles,32,33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,33,1,Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,33,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, after the abominations of the nations, whom HaShem cast out before the children of Israel. "
II Chronicles,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. "
II Chronicles,33,4,"And he built altars in the house of HaShem, whereof HaShem said: 'In Jerusalem shall My name be for ever.' "
II Chronicles,33,5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of HaShem. 
II Chronicles,33,6,"He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit; he wrought much evil in the sight of HaShem, to provoke Him. "
II Chronicles,33,7,"And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of G-d, of which G-d said to David and to Solomon his son: 'In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name for ever; "
II Chronicles,33,8,"neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers; if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.' "
II Chronicles,33,9,"And Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, so that they did evil more than did the nations, whom HaShem destroyed before the children of Israel. "
II Chronicles,33,10,"And HaShem spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed. "
II Chronicles,33,11,"Wherefore HaShem brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. "
II Chronicles,33,12,"And when he was in distress, he besought HaShem his G-d, and humbled himself greatly before the G-d of his fathers. "
II Chronicles,33,13,"And he prayed unto Him; and He was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that HaShem He was G-d. "
II Chronicles,33,14,"Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height; and he put captains of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah. "
II Chronicles,33,15,"And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of HaShem, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of HaShem, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. "
II Chronicles,33,16,"And he built up the altar of HaShem, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve HaShem, the G-d of Israel. "
II Chronicles,33,17,"Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, but only unto HaShem their G-d. "
II Chronicles,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his G-d, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of HaShem, the G-d of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel. "
II Chronicles,33,19,"His prayer also, and how G-d was entreated of him, and all his sin and his transgression, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself; behold, they are written in the history of the seers. "
II Chronicles,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead. "
II Chronicles,33,21,Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,33,22,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of HaShem, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them. "
II Chronicles,33,23,"And he humbled not himself before HaShem, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon became guilty more and more. "
II Chronicles,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house. "
II Chronicles,33,25,But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
II Chronicles,34,1,Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,34,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of HaShem, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. "
II Chronicles,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the G-d of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images. "
II Chronicles,34,4,"And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images, that were on high above them, he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. "
II Chronicles,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,34,6,"And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their axes round about. "
II Chronicles,34,7,"And he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of HaShem his G-d. "
II Chronicles,34,9,"And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of G-d, which the Levites, the keepers of the door, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,34,10,And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of HaShem; and the workmen that wrought in the house of HaShem gave it to mend and repair the house; 
II Chronicles,34,11,"even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. "
II Chronicles,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully; and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to preside over it; and other of the Levites, all that had skill with instruments of music. "
II Chronicles,34,13,"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and presided over all that did the work in every manner of service; and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters. "
II Chronicles,34,14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of HaShem, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the Law of HaShem given by Moses. "
II Chronicles,34,15,and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe: 'I have found the book of the Law in the house of HaShem.' And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. 
II Chronicles,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word unto the king, saying: 'All that was committed to thy servants, they do it. "
II Chronicles,34,17,"And they have poured out the money that was found in the house of HaShem, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.' "
II Chronicles,34,18,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying: 'Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.' And Shaphan read therein before the king. "
II Chronicles,34,19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Law, that he rent his clothes. "
II Chronicles,34,20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying: "
II Chronicles,34,21,"'Go ye, inquire of HaShem for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of HaShem that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of HaShem, to do according unto all that is written in this book.' "
II Chronicles,34,22,"So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe--now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter--and they spoke to her to that effect. "
II Chronicles,34,23,"And she said unto them: 'Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me: "
II Chronicles,34,24,"Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah; "
II Chronicles,34,25,"because they have forsaken Me, and have offered unto other gods, that they might provoke Me with all the works of their hands; therefore is My wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched. "
II Chronicles,34,26,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of HaShem, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard, "
II Chronicles,34,27,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before G-d, when thou heardest His words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before Me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me; I also have heard thee, saith HaShem. "
II Chronicles,34,28,"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof.' And they brought back word unto the king. "
II Chronicles,34,29,Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
II Chronicles,34,30,"And the king went up to the house of HaShem, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,34,31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before HaShem, to walk after HaShem, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. "
II Chronicles,34,32,"And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of G-d, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,34,33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve HaShem their G-d. All his days they departed not from following HaShem, the G-d of their fathers. "
II Chronicles,35,1,And Josiah kept a passover unto HaShem in Jerusalem; and they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
II Chronicles,35,2,"And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of HaShem. "
II Chronicles,35,3,"And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto HaShem: 'Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders; now serve HaShem your G-d, and His people Israel. "
II Chronicles,35,4,"And prepare ye after your fathers' houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. "
II Chronicles,35,5,"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brethren the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a father's house of the Levites. "
II Chronicles,35,6,"And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of HaShem by the hand of Moses.' "
II Chronicles,35,7,"And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks; these were of the king's substance. "
II Chronicles,35,8,"And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of G-d, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen. "
II Chronicles,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen. "
II Chronicles,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king's commandment. "
II Chronicles,35,11,"And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests dashed the blood, which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them. "
II Chronicles,35,12,"And they removed the portions that were to be burnt, that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to present unto HaShem, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen. "
II Chronicles,35,13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. "
II Chronicles,35,14,"And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. "
II Chronicles,35,15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate; they needed not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. "
II Chronicles,35,16,"So all the service of HaShem was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of HaShem, according to the commandment of king Josiah. "
II Chronicles,35,17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. "
II Chronicles,35,18,"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "
II Chronicles,35,19,In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept. 
II Chronicles,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him. "
II Chronicles,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying: 'What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and G-d hath given command to speed me; forbear thee from meddling with G-d, who is with me, that He destroy thee not.' "
II Chronicles,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco, from the mouth of G-d, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. "
II Chronicles,35,23,And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants: 'Have me away; for I am sore wounded.' 
II Chronicles,35,24,"So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. "
II Chronicles,35,25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations, unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel; and, behold, they are written in the lamentations. "
II Chronicles,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the Law of HaShem, "
II Chronicles,35,27,"and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. "
II Chronicles,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. "
