Genesis,18,26,And the LORde sayde: Yf I fynde in Sodome .l. rightwes within the cyte I will spare all the place for their sakes.
Genesis,18,27,And Abraham answered and sayde: beholde I haue taken vppon me to speake vnto ye LORde ad yet am but dust ad asshes.
Genesis,18,28,What though there lacke .v. of .l. rightwes wylt thou destroy all the cyte for lacke of .v? And he sayde: Yf I fynde there .xl. and .v. I will not destroy them.

Genesis,19,1,And there came .ij. angells to Sodome at euen. And Lot satt at the gate of the cyte. And Lot sawe the and rose vp agaynst them and he bowed hym selfe to he grounde with his face.
Genesis,19,2,And he sayde: Se lordes turne in I praye you in to youre servauntes house and tary all nyghte and wash youre fete and ryse vp early and go on youre wayes. And they sayde: nay but we will byde in the streates all nyghte.

Genesis,19,4,But before they went to rest the men of the cyte of Sodome compassed the house rownde aboute both olde and yonge all the people from all quarters.
Genesis,19,5,And they called vnto Lot and sayde vnto him: where are the men which came in to thy house to nyghte? brynge the out unto vs that we may do oure lust with them.
Genesis,19,6,And Lot went out at doores vnto them and shote the dore after him
Genesis,19,7,and sayde: nay for goddes sake brethren do not so wekedly.
Genesis,19,8,Beholde I haue two doughters which haue knowne no man the will I brynge out vnto you: do with them as it semeth you good: Only vnto these men do nothynge for therfore came they vnder the shadowe of my rofe.
Genesis,19,9,And they sayde: come hither. And they sayde: camest thou not in to sogeorne and wilt thou be now a iudge? we will suerly deale worse with the than with themAnd as they preased fore vppon Lot and beganne to breake vp the doore
Genesis,19,10,the men put forth their handes and pulled Lot in to the house to them and shott to the doore.
Genesis,19,11,And the men that were at the doore of the house they smote with blyndnesse both small and greate: so that they coude not fynde the doore.
Genesis,19,12,And the men sayde moreover vnto Lot: Yf thou have yet here any sonne in lawe or sonnes or doughters or what so euer thou hast in the cyte brynge it out of this place:
Genesis,19,13,for we must destroy this place because the crye of the is great before the LORde. Wherfore he hath sent vs to destroy it.
Genesis,19,14,And Lot went out and spake vnto his sonnes in lawe which shulde haue maried his doughters and sayde: stonde vpp and get yow out of this place for the LORde will destroy the cite. But he semed as though he had mocked vnto his sonnes in law.
Genesis,19,15,And as the mornynge arose the angells caused Lot to spede him saynge. Stonde vp take thy wyfe and thy two doughters and that that is at hande lest thou perish in the synne of the cyte.
Genesis,19,16,And as he prolonged the tyme the men caught both him his wife ad his two doughters by the handes because the LORde was mercyfull vnto him ad they brought him forth and sette him without the cyte.
Genesis,19,17,When they had brought them out they sayde: Saue thy lyfe and loke not behynde the nether tary thou in any place of the contre but saue thy selfe in the mountayne lest thou perisshe.
Genesis,19,18,Than sayde Lot vnto them: Oh nay my lorde:
Genesis,19,19,beholde in as moch as thy servaunte hath fownde grace in thy syghte now make thi mercy great which thou shewest vnto me in savinge my lyfe. For I can not saue my selfe in the mountayns lest some misfortune fall vpon me and I dye.
Genesis,19,20,Beholde here is a cyte by to flee vnto and it is a lytle one: let me saue my selfe therein: is it not a litle one that my soule may lyue?
Genesis,19,21,And he sayde to him: se I haue receaved thy request as concernynge this thynge that I will nott overthrowe this cytie for the which thou hast spoken.
Genesis,19,22,Haste the ad saue thy selfe there for I can do nothynge tyll thou be come in thyder. And therfore the name of the cyte is called Zoar.
Genesis,19,23,And the sone was vppon the erth when Lot was entred in to Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,Than the LORde rayned vpon Sodome and Gomorra brymstone and fyre from the LORde out of heaven
Genesis,19,25,and overthrewe those cyteis and all the region and all that dwelled in the cytes and that that grewe vpon the erth.
Genesis,19,26,And lots wyfe loked behynde her ad was turned in to a pillare of salte.
Genesis,19,27,Abraham rose vp early and got him to the place where he stode before the LORde
Genesis,19,28,and loked toward Sodome and Gomorra and toward all the londe of that contre. And as he loked: beholde the smoke of the contre arose as it had bene the smoke of a fornace.
Genesis,19,29,But yet whe God destroyed the cities of ye regio he thought a pon Abraha: and sent Lot out from the dager of the overthrowenge when he overthrewe the cyttes where Lot dwelled.
Genesis,19,30,And Lot departed out of Zoar and dwelled in the mountayns ad his .ij. doughters with him for he feared to tary in Zoar: he dweld therfore in a caue both he and his .ij. doughters also.
Genesis,19,31,Than sayde the elder vnto the yonger oure father is olde and there are no moo men in the erth to come in vnto vs after the maner of all the world.
Genesis,19,32,Come therfore let vs geue oure father wyne to dryncke and let vs lye with him that we may saue seed of oure father.
Genesis,19,33,And they gaue their father wyne to drynke that same nyghte. And the elder doughter went and laye with her father. And he perceaued it not nether when she laye doune nether when she rose vp.
Genesis,19,34,And on the morowe the elder sayde vnto the yonger: beholde yesternyghte laye I with my father. Let us geue hym wyne to drinke this nyghte also and goo thou and lye with him and let us saue seed of oure father.
Genesis,19,35,And they gaue their father wyne to drincke that nyghte also. And the yonger arose and laye with him. And he perceaved it not: nether when she laye downe nether when she rose vp.
Genesis,19,36,Thus were both the doughters of lot with childe by their father
Genesis,19,37,And the elder bare a sone and called hym Moab which is the father of the Moabytes vnto this daye.
Genesis,19,38,And the yonger bare a sonne and called hym Ben Ammi which is the father of the childern of Ammon vnto this daye.
Genesis,20,1,And Abraham departed thence towarde the southcontre and dwelled betwene Cades and Sur ad sogeorned in Gerar.
Genesis,20,2,And Abraham sayde of Sara his wyfe that she was his sister. Than Abimelech kynge of Gerar sent and fett Sara awaye.
Genesis,20,3,And God came to Abimelech by nyghte in a dreame and sayde to him: Se thou art but a deed man for the womas sake which thou hast taken awaye for she is a mans wyfe.
Genesis,20,4,But Abimelech had not yet come nye her and therfore sayde: lorde wilt thou sley rightewes people?
Genesis,20,5,sayde not he vnto me that she was hys sister? yee and sayde not she herself that he was hir brother? wyth a pure herte and innocent handes haue I done this.
Genesis,20,6,And God sayde vnto him in a dreame. I wot it well that thou dydest it in the purenesse of thi herte. And therfore I kepte ye that thou shuldest not synne agenst me nether suffred I the to come nygh her.
Genesis,20,7,Now therfore delyuer the ma his wyfe ageyne for he is a prophete. And let him praye for the that thou mayst lyue. But and yf thou delyuer her not agayne be sure that thou shalt dye the deth with all that thou hast.
Genesis,20,8,Than Abimelech rose vp be tymes in the mornynge and called all his servauntes and tolde all these thinges in their eares and the men were sore a frayde.
Genesis,20,9,And Abimelech called Abraham and sayde vnto him: What hast thou done vnto vs and what haue I offended the that thou shuldest brynge on me and on my kyngdome so greate a synne? thou hast done dedes vnto me that ought not to be done.
Genesis,20,10,And Abimelech sayde morouer vnto Abraham: What sawest thou that moved the to do this thinge?
Genesis,20,11,And Abraham Answered. I thought that peradveture the feare of God was not in this place and that they shulde sley me for my wyfes sake:
Genesis,20,12,yet in very dede she is my sister the doughter of my father but not of my mother: and became my wyfe.
Genesis,20,13,And after God caused me to wandre out of my fathers house I sayde vnto her: This kyndnesse shalt thou shewe vnto me in all places where we come that thou saye of me how that I am thy brother.
Genesis,20,14,Than toke Abimelech shepe and oxen menservauntes and wemenseruauntes and gaue them vnto Abraham and delyvered him Sara his wyfe agayne.
Genesis,20,15,And Abimelech sayde: beholde the lande lyeth be fore the dwell where it pleaseth ye best.
Genesis,20,16,And vnto Sara he sayde: Se I haue geuen thy brother a thousande peeces of syluer beholde he shall be a couerynge to thyne eyes vnto all that ar with the and vnto all men and an excuse.
Genesis,20,17,And so Abraham prayde vnto God and God healed Abimeleh and his wyfe and hys maydens so that they bare.
Genesis,20,18,For the LORde had closed to all the matryces of the house of Abimelech because of Sara Abrahams wyfe.
Genesis,21,1,The lorde visyted Sara as he had sayde and dyd vnto her acordynge as he had spoken.
Genesis,21,2,And Sara was with childe and bare Abraha a sonne in his olde age euen the same season which the LORde had appoynted.
Genesis,21,3,And Abraham called his sonnes name that was borne vnto him which Sara bare him Isaac:
Genesis,21,4,and Abra circucysed Isaac his sone whe he was .viij. dayes olde as God commaunded him
Genesis,21,5,And Abraha was an hundred yere olde when his sonne Isaac was borne vnto him.
Genesis,21,6,And Sara sayde: God hath made me a laughinge stocke: for all yt heare will laugh at me
Genesis,21,7,She sayde also: who wolde haue sayde vnto Abraham that Sara shulde haue geuen childern sucke or yt I shulde haue borne him a sonne in his olde age:

Genesis,21,9,Sara sawe the sonne of Hagar the Egiptian which she had borne vnto Abraham a mockynge.
Genesis,21,10,Then she sayde vnto Abraham: put awaye this bondemayde and hyr sonne: for the sonne of this bondwoman shall not be heyre with my sonne Isaac:
Genesis,21,11,But the wordes semed verey greavous in Abrahams syghte because of his sonne.
Genesis,21,12,Than the LORde sayde vnto Abraham: let it not be greavous vnto the because of the ladd and of thy bondmayde: But in all that Sara hath saide vnto the heare hir voyce for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Genesis,21,13,Moreouer of the sonne of the Bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seed.

Genesis,21,17,And God herde the voyce of the childe. And the angell of God called Hagar out of heaven and sayde vnto her: What ayleth the Hagar? Feare not for God hath herde the voyce of the childe where he lyeth.
Genesis,21,18,Aryse and lyfte vp the lad and take hym in thy hande for I will make off him a greate people.
Genesis,21,19,And God opened hir eyes and she sawe a well of water. And she went and fylled the bottell with water and gaue the boye drynke.
Genesis,21,20,And God was wyth the lad and he grewe and dweld in the wildernesse and became an archer.
Genesis,21,21,And he dweld in the wyldernesse of Pharan. And hys mother gott him a wyfe out of the land of Egypte.
Genesis,21,22,And it chaunced the same season that Abimelech and Phicoll his chefe captayne spake vnto Abraham saynge: God is wyth the in all that thou doist.
Genesis,21,23,Now therfore swere vnto me even here by God that thou wylt not hurt me nor my childern nor my childerns childern. But that thou shalt deale with me and the contre where thou art a straunger acordynge vnto the kyndnesse that I haue shewed the.
Genesis,21,24,Then sayde Abraham: I wyll swere.
Genesis,21,25,And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water which Abimelech servauntes had taken awaye.
Genesis,21,26,And Abimelech answered I wyst not who dyd it: Also thou toldest me not nether herde I of it but this daye.
Genesis,21,27,And Abraham toke shepe and oxen and gaue them vnto Abimelech. And they made both of them a bonde together.
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham sett vij. lambes by them selues.
Genesis,21,29,And Abimelech sayde vnto Abraham: what meane these .vij. lamdes which thou hast sett by them selues.

Genesis,21,31,Wherfore the place is called Berseba because they sware both of them.
Genesis,21,32,Thus made they a bonde to gether at Berseba.Than Abimelech and Phicoll his chefe captayne rose vp and turned agayne vnto the lande of the Philistines.
Genesis,21,33,And Abraham planted a wodd in Berseba and called there on the name of the LORde the everlastynge God:
Genesis,21,34,and dwelt in the Phelistinlade alonge season
Genesis,22,1,After these dedes God dyd proue Abraham and sayde vnto him: Abraham. And he answered: here am I.

Genesis,22,8,And Abraham sayde: my sonne God wyll prouyde him a shepe for sacrifyce. So went they both together.
Genesis,22,9,And when they came vnto the place which God shewed him Abraha made an aulter there and dressed the wodd ad bownde Isaac his sonne and layde him on the aulter aboue apon the wodd.

Genesis,27,34,Whe Esau herde the wordes of his father he cryed out greatly and bitterly aboue mesure and sayde vnto his father: blesse me also my father.

Genesis,27,40,And wyth thy swerde shalt thou lyue and shalt be thy brothers seruaunte But the tyme will come when thou shalt gett the mastrye and lowse his yocke from of thy necke.
Genesis,27,41,And Esau hated Iacob because of the blessynge yt his father blessed him with all and sayde in his harte: The dayes of my fathers sorowe are at hade for I will sley my brother Iacob.
Genesis,27,42,And these wordes of Esau hir eldest sonne were told to Rebecca. And she sente ad called Iacob hir yongest sonne and sayde vnto hi: beholde thy brother Esau threatneth to kyll the:

Genesis,27,46,And Rebecca spake to Isaac: I am wery of my life for feare of the doughters of Heth. Yf Iacob take a wife of the doughters of Heth soch one as these are or of the doughters of the lande what lust shulde I haue to lyue.
Genesis,28,1,Than Isaac called Iacob his sonne and blessed him ad charged him and sayde vnto him: se thou take not a wife of the doughters of Canaan
Genesis,28,2,but aryse ad gett the to Mesopotamia to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father: and there take the a wife of the doughters of Laban thi mothers brother.

Genesis,28,4,and geue the the blessynge of Abraham: both to the and to thy seed with the that thou mayst possesse the lade (wherein thou art a strangere) which God gaue vnto Abraham.

Genesis,28,9,Then went he vnto Ismael and toke vnto the wiues which he had Mahala the doughter of Ismael Abrahams sonne the sister of Nabaioth to be his wife.
Genesis,28,10,Iacob departed from Berseba and went toward Haran
Genesis,28,11,and came vnto a place and taried there all nyghte because the sonne was downe. And toke a stone of the place and put it vnder his heade and layde him downe in the same place to slepe.

Genesis,28,14,And thy seed shalbe as the dust of the erth: And thou shalt spreade abrode: west east north and south. And thorow the and thy seed shall all the kynreddes of the erth be blessed.
Genesis,28,15,And se I am with the and wylbe thy keper in all places whother thou goost and wyll brynge ye agayne in to this lande: Nether will I leaue the vntill I haue made good all that I haue promysed the.
Genesis,28,16,When Iacob was awaked out of his slepe he sayde: surely the LORde is in this place ad I was not aware.
Genesis,28,17,And he was afrayde and sayde how fearfull is this place? it is none other but euen the house of God and the gate of heaue.
Genesis,28,18,And Iacob stode vp early in the mornynge and toke the stone that he had layde vnder his heade and pitched it vp an ende and poured oyle on the topp of it.
Genesis,28,19,And he called the name of the place Bethell for in dede the name of the citie was called Lus before tyme.

Genesis,28,21,so that I come agayne vnto my fathers house in saftie: then shall the LORde be my God
Genesis,28,22,and this stone which I haue sett vp an ende shalbe godes house And of all that thou shalt geue me will I geue the tenth vnto the.
Genesis,29,1,Then Iacob lyfte vp his fete and wet toward the east countre.
Genesis,29,2,And as he loked aboute behold there was a well in the feld and .iij. flockes of shepe laye therby (for at that well were the flockes watered) and there laye a great stone at the well mouth
Genesis,29,3,And the maner was to brynge the flockes thyther and to roull the stone fro the welles mouth and to water the shepe and to put the stone agayne vppon the wells mouth vnto his place.

Genesis,29,15,And afterward Laban sayd vnto Iacob: though thou be my brother shuldest thou therfore serue me for nought?tell me what shall thi wages be?
Genesis,29,16,And Laban had .ij. doughters the eldest called Lea and the yongest Rahel.
Genesis,29,17,Lea was tender eyed: But Rahel was bewtifull ad well fauored.
Genesis,29,18,And Iacob loued her well and sayde: I will serue the .vij. yere for Rahel thy yongest doughter.

Genesis,29,26,Laban answered: it is not the maner of this place to marke the yongest before the eldest.
Genesis,29,27,Passe out this weke and tha shall this also be geuen the for ye seruyce which thou shalt serue me yet .vij. yeres more.

Genesis,30,29,But he sayde vnto hym thou knowest what seruyce I haue done ye and in what takynge thy catell haue bene vnder me:
Genesis,30,30,for it was but litle that thou haddest before I came and now it is encreased in to a multitude and the LORDE hath blessed the for my sake.But now when shall I make provysion for myne awne house also?
Genesis,30,31,And he sayde: what shall I geue the? And Iacob answerd: thou shalt geue me nothinge at all yf thou wilt do this one thinge for me: And then will I turne agayne and fede thy shepe and kepe them.
Genesis,30,32,I will go aboute all thy shepe this daye and separate fro the all the shepe that are spotted and of dyverse coloures and all blacke shepe amonge the lambes and the partie and spotted amonge the kyddes: And then such shalbe my rewarde.
Genesis,30,33,So shall my rightwesnes answere for me: when the tyme commeth that I shall receaue my rewarde of the: So that what soeuer is not speckeld and partie amonge the gootes and blacke amonge the lambes let that be theft with me.

Genesis,30,36,and sett thre dayes ourney ibetwixte hiselfe and Iacob. And so Iacob kepte ye rest of Labas shepe.
Genesis,30,37,Iacob toke roddes of grene popular hasell and of chestnottrees and pilled whyte strakes in the and made the white apere in the staues:
Genesis,30,38,And he put the staues which he had pilled eue before ye shepe in the gutters and watrynge troughes whe the shepe came to drynke: yt they shulde coceaue whe they came to drynke.
Genesis,30,39,And the shepe coceaued before the staues and brought forth straked spotted and partie.
Genesis,30,40,The Iacob parted the labes and turned the faces of the shepe toward spotted thinges and toward all maner of blacke thinges thorow out the flockes of Laba. And he made him flockes of his owne by the selfe which he put not vnto the flockes of Laba.
Genesis,30,41,And allwaye in the first buckinge tyme of the shepe Iacob put the staues before the shepe in the gutters yt they myghte conceaue before the staues
Genesis,30,42,But in the latter buckynge tyme he put them not there: so the last brode was Labas and the first Iacobs.
Genesis,30,43,And the man became excedynge ryche and had many shepe maydeseruauntes menseruauntes camels and asses.
Genesis,31,1,And Iacob herde the wordes of Labas sonnes how they sayde: Iacob hath take awaye all that was oure fathers and of oure fathers goodes hath he gote all this honoure.
Genesis,31,2,And Iacob behelde the countenauce of Laban that it was not toward him as it was in tymes past.
Genesis,31,3,And the LORde sayde vnto Iacob: turne agayne in to the lade of thy fathers and to thy kynred and I wilbe with ye.
Genesis,31,4,Tha Iacob sent and called Rahel and Lea to the felde vnto his shepe
Genesis,31,5,and sayde vnto the: I se youre fathers countenauce yt it is not toward me as in tymes past. Morouer ye God of my father hath bene with me.
Genesis,31,6,And ye knowe how that I haue serued youre father with all my myghte.
Genesis,31,7,And youre father hath disceaued me and chaunged my wages .x. tymes: But God suffred him not to hurte me.
Genesis,31,8,When he sayde the spotted shalbe thy wages tha all the shepe barespotted. Yf he sayde the straked shalbe thi rewarde tha bare all the shepe straked:
Genesis,31,9,thus hath God take awaye youre fathers catell and geue the me.
Genesis,31,10,For in buckynge tyme I lifted vp myne eyes and sawe in a dreame: and beholde the rammes that bucked the shepe were straked spotted and partie.
Genesis,31,11,And the angell of God spake vnto me in a dreame saynge: Iacob. And I answered: here am I.
Genesis,31,12,And he sayde: lyfte vp thyne eyes ad see how all therames that leape vpon the shepe are straked spotted and partie: for I haue sene all that Laban doth vnto ye.
Genesis,31,13,I am ye god of Bethell where thou anoynteddest the stone ad where thou vowdest a vowe vnto me. Now aryse and gett the out of this countre ad returne vnto the lade where thou wast borne.
Genesis,31,14,Than answered Rahel and Lea and sayde vnto him: we haue no parte nor enheritaunce in oure fathers house
Genesis,31,15,he cownteth us eue as straungers for he hath solde vs and hath euen eaten vp the price of vs.
Genesis,31,16,Moreouer all the riches which God hath take from oure father that is oures and oure childerns. Now therfore what soeuer God hath sayde vnto the that doo.
Genesis,31,17,Tha Iacob rose vp and sett his sones and wiues vp vpon camels
Genesis,31,18,and caried away all his catell and all his substace which he had gotte in Mesopotamia for to goo to Isaac his father vnto the lade of Canaan.
Genesis,31,19,Laba was gone to shere his shepe and Rahel had stolle hir fathers ymages.
Genesis,31,20,And Iacob went awaye vnknowynge to Laban the Sirie and tolde him not yt he fled.
Genesis,31,21,So fled he and all yt he had and made him self redy and passed ouer the ryuers and sett his face streyght towarde the mounte Gilead.
Genesis,31,22,Apo the thirde day after was it tolde Laba yt Iacob was fled.
Genesis,31,23,Tha he toke his brethre with him and folowed after him .vij. dayes iourney and ouer toke him at the mounte Gilead.
Genesis,31,24,And God came to Laba the Siria in a dreame by nyghte and sayde vnto him: take hede to thi selfe that thou speake not to Iacob oughte save good.
Genesis,31,25,And Laba ouer toke Iacob: and Iacob had pitched his tete in yt mounte. And Laban with his brethern pitched their tete also apon the mounte Gilead.
Genesis,31,26,Than sayde Laba to Iacob: why hast thou this done vnknowynge to me and hast caried awaye my doughters as though they had bene take captyue with swerde?
Genesis,31,27,Wherfore wentest thou awaye secretly vnknowne to me and didest not tell me yt I myghte haue broughte yt on the waye with myrth syngynge tymrells and harppes
Genesis,31,28,and hast not suffred me to kysse my childern and my doughters. Thou wast a fole to do
Genesis,31,29,it for I am able to do you evell. But the God of youre father spake vnto me yesterdaye saynge take hede tha thou speake not to Iacob oughte saue goode.
Genesis,31,30,And now though thou wetest thi waye because thou logest after thi fathers house yet wherfore hast thou stollen my goddes?
Genesis,31,31,Iacob answered and sayde to Laba: because I was afrayed and thought that thou woldest haue take awaye thy doughters fro me.
Genesis,31,32,But with whome soeuer thou fyndest thy goddes let him dye here before oure brethre. Seke that thine is by me and take it to the: for Iacob wist not that Rahel had stolle the.
Genesis,31,33,Tha wet Laba in to Iacobs tete and in to Leas tete and in to .ij. maydens tentes: but fownde the not. Tha wet he out of Leas tete and entred in to Rahels tete.
Genesis,31,34,And Rahel toke the ymages and put them in the camels strawe and sate doune apo the. And Laba serched all the tete: but fownde the not.
Genesis,31,35,Tha sayde she to hir father: my lorde be not angrye yt I ca not ryse vp before the for the disease of weme is come apon me. So searched he but foude the not.
Genesis,31,36,Iacob was wrooth and chode with Laba: Iacob also answered and sayde to him: what haue I trespaced or what haue I offended that thou foloweddest after me?
Genesis,31,37,Thou hast searched all my stuffe and what hast thou founde of all thy housholde stuffe? put it here before thi brethern and myne and let the iudge betwyxte vs both.
Genesis,31,38,This xx. yere yt I haue bene wyth the thy shepe and thy gootes haue not bene baren and the rammes of thi flocke haue I not eate.
Genesis,31,39,What soeuer was torne of beastes I broughte it not vnto ye but made it good mysilf: of my hade dydest thou requyre it whether it was stollen by daye or nyghte
Genesis,31,40,Moreouer by daye the hete consumed me and the colde by nyghte and my slepe departed fro myne eyes.
Genesis,31,41,Thus haue I bene .xx. yere in thi house and serued the .xiiij. yeres forthy .ij. doughters and vi. yere for thi shepe and thou hast changed my rewarde .x. tymes.
Genesis,31,42,And excepte the God of my father the God of Abraha and the God whome Isaac feareth had bene with me: surely thou haddest sent me awaye now all emptie. But God behelde my tribulation and the laboure of my handes: and rebuked the yester daye.
Genesis,31,43,Laban answered ad sayde vnto Iacob: the doughters are my doughters and the childern ar my childern and the shepe are my shepe ad all that thou seist is myne. And what can I do this daye vnto these my doughters or vnto their childern which they haue borne?
Genesis,31,44,Now therfore come on let us make a bonde I and thou together and let it be a wytnesse betwene the and me.
Genesis,31,45,Than toke Iacob a stone and sett it vp an ende
Genesis,31,46,ad sayde vnto his brethern gather stoones And they toke stoones ad made an heape and they ate there vpo the heape.
Genesis,31,47,And Laba called it Iegar Sahadutha but Iacob called it Gylead.
Genesis,31,48,Than sayde Laban: this heape be witnesse betwene the and me this daye (therfore is it called Gilead)
Genesis,31,49,and this totehill which the lorde seeth (sayde he) be wytnesse betwene me and the when we are departed one from a nother:
Genesis,31,50,that thou shalt not vexe my doughters nether shalt take other wyves vnto them. Here is no man with vs: beholde God is wytnesse betwixte the and me.
Genesis,31,51,And Laban sayde moreouer to Iacob: beholde this heape and this marke which I haue sett here betwyxte me and the:
Genesis,31,52,this heape be wytnesse and also this marcke that I will not come ouer this heape to the ad thou shalt not come ouer this heape ad this marke to do any harme.
Genesis,31,53,The God of Abraham the God of Nahor and the God of theyr fathers be iudge betwixte vs.And Iacob sware by him that his father Isaac feared.
Genesis,31,54,Then Iacob dyd sacrifyce vpon the mounte and called his brethern to eate breed. And they ate breed and taried all nyghte in the hyll.
Genesis,31,55,And early in the mornynge Laban rose vp and kyssed his childern and his doughters and blessed the and departed and wet vnto his place agayne.
Genesis,32,1,But Iacob went forth on his iourney. And the angells of God came and mett him.
Genesis,32,2,And when Iacob sawe them he sayde: this is godes hoost: and called the name of that same place Mahanaim.
Genesis,32,3,Iacob sente meessengers before him to Esau his brother vnto the lande of Seir and the felde of Edom.
Genesis,32,4,And he comaunded them saynge: se that ye speake after this maner to my lorde Esau: thy seruaunte Iacob sayth thus. I haue sogerned ad bene a straunger with Laban vnto this tyme:
Genesis,32,5,and haue gotten oxen asses and shepe menservauntes and wemanseruauntes and haue sent to shewe it mi lorde that I may fynde grace in thy syghte.
Genesis,32,6,And the messengers came agayne to Iacob sainge: we came vnto thi brother Esau and he cometh ageynst the and .iiij. hundred men with hi.
Genesis,32,7,Than was Iacob greatlye afrayde and wist not which waye to turne him selfe and devyded the people that was with him and the shepe oxen and camels in to .ij. companies
Genesis,32,8,and sayde: Yf Esau come to the one parte and smyte it the other may saue it selfe.
Genesis,32,9,And Iacob sayde: O god of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac: LORde which saydest vnto me returne vnto thy cuntre and to thy kynrede and I will deall wel with the.
Genesis,32,10,I am not worthy of the leaste of all the mercyes and treuth which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruaunte. For with my staf came I over this Iordane and now haue Igoten .ij. droves
Genesis,32,11,Delyver me from the handes of my brother Esau for I feare him: lest he will come and smyte the mother with the childeru.
Genesis,32,12,Thou saydest that thou woldest surely do me good and woldest make mi seed as the sonde of the see which can not be nombred for multitude.
Genesis,32,13,And he taried there that same nyghte and toke of that which came to hande a preasent vnto Esau his brother:

Genesis,38,21,Than asked he the men of the same place saynge: where is the whoore that satt at Enaim in the waye? And they sayde: there was no whoore here.
Genesis,38,22,And he came to Iuda agayne saynge: I can not fynde her and also the men of the place sayde: that there was no whoore there.
Genesis,38,23,And Iuda sayde: let her take it to her lest we be shamed: for I sente the kydd and thou coudest not fynde her.
Genesis,38,24,And it came to passe that after .iij. monethes one tolde Iuda saynge: Thamar thy doughter in lawe hath played the whoore and with playnge the whoore is become great with childe. And Iuda sayde: brynge her forth ad let her be brente.

Genesis,39,1,Ioseph was brought vnto Egipte ad Putiphar a lorde of Pharaos: ad his chefe marshall an Egiptian bought him of ye Ismaelites which brought hi thither
Genesis,39,2,And the LORde was with Ioseph and he was a luckie felowe and continued in the house of his master the Egiptian.
Genesis,39,3,And his master sawe that the ORde was with him and that the LORde made all that he dyd prosper in his hande:
Genesis,39,4,Wherfore he founde grace in his masters syghte and serued him. And his master made him ruelar of his house and put all that he had in his hande.
Genesis,39,5,And as soone as he had made him ruelar ouer his house ad ouer all that he had the LORde blessed this Egiptians house for Iosephs sake and the blessynge of the LORde was vpon all that he had: both in the house and also in the feldes.
Genesis,39,6,And therfore he left all that he had in Iosephs hande and loked vpon nothinge that was with him saue only on the bread which he ate. And Ioseph was a goodly persone and a well favored
Genesis,39,7,And it fortuned after this that his masters wife cast hir eyes vpon Ioseph and sayde come lye with me.
Genesis,39,8,But he denyed and sayde to her: Beholde my master woteth not what he hath in the house with me but hath commytted all that he hath to my hande
Genesis,39,9,He him selfe is not greatter in the house than I ad hath kepte nothige fro me but only the because thou art his wife. How than cam I do this great wykydnes for to synne agaynst God?
Genesis,39,10,And after this maner spake she to Ioseph daye by daye: but he harkened not vnto her to slepe nere her or to be in her company.
Genesis,39,11,And it fortuned aboute the same season that Ioseph entred in to the house to do his busynes: and there was none of the houshold by in the house.
Genesis,39,12,And she caught him by the garment saynge: come slepe with me. And he left his garment in hir hande ad fled and gott him out
Genesis,39,13,when she sawe that he had left his garmet in hir hande and was fled out
Genesis,39,14,she called vnto the men of the house and tolde them saynge: Se he hath brought in an Hebrewe vnto vs to do vs shame. for he came in to me for to haue slept myth me. But I cried with a lowde voyce.
Genesis,39,15,And when he harde that I lyfte vp my voyce and cryed he left his garment with me and fled awaye and got him out.
Genesis,39,16,And she layed vp his garment by her vntill hir lorde came home.

Genesis,39,18,But as soone as I lyft vp my voyce and cryed he left his garment with me and fled out.
Genesis,39,19,When his master herde the woordes of his wyfe which she tolde him saynge: after this maner dyd thy servaunte to me he waxed wrooth.
Genesis,39,20,And he toke Ioseph and put him in pryson: euen in the place where the kinges prisoners laye bounde. And there contynued he in preson.
Genesis,39,21,But the LORde was with Ioseph ad shewed him mercie and gott him fauoure in the syghte of the keper of ye preson
Genesis,39,22,which commytted to Iosephe hade all the presoners that were in the preson housse. And what soeuer was done there yt dyd he.
Genesis,39,23,And the keper of the preso loked vnto nothinge that was vnder his hande because the LORde was with him and because that what soeuer he dyd the LORde made it come luckely to passe.
Genesis,40,1,And it chaunced after this that the chefe butlar of the kynge of Egipte and his chefe baker had offended there lorde the kynge of Egypte.
Genesis,40,2,And Pharao was angrie with them and put the in warde in his chefe marshals house:
Genesis,40,3,euen in ye preson where Ioseph was bownd.
Genesis,40,4,And the chefe marshall gaue Ioseph a charge with them and he serued them. And they contynued a season in warde.
Genesis,40,5,And they dreamed ether of them in one nyghte: both the butlar and the baker of the kynge of Egipte which were bownde in the preson house ether of them his dreame and eche manes dreame of a sondrie interpretation
Genesis,40,6,When Ioseph came in vnto them in the mornynge and loked apon them: beholde they were sadd.
Genesis,40,7,And he asked them saynge wherfore loke ye so sadly to daye?
Genesis,40,8,They answered him we haue dreamed a dreame and haue no man to declare it. And Ioseph sayde vnto the. Interpretynge belongeth to God but tel me yet.
Genesis,40,9,And the chefe butlar tolde his dreame to Ioseph and sayde vnto him. In my dreame me thought there stode a vyne before me
Genesis,40,10,and in the vyne were .iij. braunches and it was as though it budded and her blossos shottforth: and ye grapes there of waxed rype.
Genesis,40,11,And I had Pharaos cuppe in my hande and toke of the grapes and wronge them in to Pharaos cuppe and delyvered Pharaos cuppe into his hande.
Genesis,40,12,And Ioseph sayde vnto him this is the interpretation of it.
Genesis,40,13,The .iij. braunches ar thre dayes: for within thre dayes shall Pharao lyft vp thine heade and restore the vnto thyne office agayne and thou shalt delyuer Pharaos cuppe in to his hade after the old maner even as thou dydest when thou wast his butlar.
Genesis,40,14,But thinke on me with the when thou art in good case and shewe mercie vnto me. And make mencion of me to Pharao and helpe to brynge me out of this house:
Genesis,40,15,for I was stollen out of the lande of the Hebrues and here also haue I done nothige at all wherfore they shulde haue put me in to this dongeon.
Genesis,40,16,When the chefe baker sawe that he had well interpretate it he sayde vnto Ioseph me thought also in my dreame yt I had. iij. wyker baskettes on my heade?
Genesis,40,17,And in ye vppermost basket of all maner bakemeates for Pharao. And the byrdes ate them out of the basket apon my heade
Genesis,40,18,Ioseph answered and sayde: this is the interpretation therof. The .iij. baskettes are .iij. dayes
Genesis,40,19,for this daye .iij. dayes shall Pharao take thy heade from the and shall hange the on a tree and the byrdes shall eate thy flesh from of the.
Genesis,40,20,And it came to passe the thyrde daye which was Pharaos byrth daye that he made a feast vnto all his servauntes. And he lyfted vpp the head of the chefe buttelar and of the chefe baker amonge his servauntes.
Genesis,40,21,And restored the chefe buttelar vnto his buttelarshipe agayne and he reched the cuppe in to Pharaos hande
Genesis,40,22,ad hanged the chefe baker: eue as Ioseph had interpretated vnto the.
Genesis,40,23,Notwithstonding the chefe buttelar remembred not Ioseph but forgat hym.
Genesis,41,1,And it fortuned at .ij. yeres end that Pharao dreamed and thought that he stode by a ryuers syde and that there came out of the ryver
Genesis,41,2,.vij. goodly kyne and fatt fleshed and fedd in a medowe.
Genesis,41,3,And him though that .vij. other kyne came vp after them out of the ryver euelfauored and leane fleshed and stode by the other vpon the brynke of the ryuer.
Genesis,41,4,And the evill favored and Ienefleshed kyne ate vp the .vij. welfauored and fatt kyne: and be awoke their with.
Genesis,41,5,And he slepte agayne and dreamed the second tyme that .vij. eares of corne grewe apon one stalke rancke and goodly.
Genesis,41,6,And that .vij. thynne eares blasted with the wynde spronge vp after them:
Genesis,41,7,and that the .vij. thynne eares deuowrerd the .vij. rancke and full eares. And than Pharao awaked: and se here is his dreame.
Genesis,41,8,When the mornynge came his sprete was troubled And he sent and casted for all the soythsayers of Egypte and all the wyse men there of and told them his dreame: but there was none of them that coude interpretate it vnto Pharao.
Genesis,41,9,Than spake the chefe buttelar vnto Pharao saynge. I do remembre my fawte this daye.
Genesis,41,10,Pharao was angrie with his servauntes and put in warde in the chefe marshals house both me and the chefe baker.
Genesis,41,11,And we dreamed both of vs in one nyght and ech mannes dreame of a sondrye interpretation.
Genesis,41,12,And there was with vs a yonge man an Hebrue borne servaunte vnto the chefe marshall. And we told him and he declared oure dreames to vs acordynge to ether of oure dreames.
Genesis,41,13,And as he declared them vnto vs euen so it came to passe. I was restored to myne office agayne and he was hanged.
Genesis,41,14,Than Pharao sent and called Ioseph. And they made him haste out of preson. And he shaued him self and chaunged his rayment and went in to Pharao.
Genesis,41,15,And Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: I haue dreamed a dreame and no man ca interpretate it but I haue herde saye of the yt as soon as thou hearest a dreame thou dost interpretate it.
Genesis,41,16,And Ioseph answered Pharao saynge: God shall geue Pharao an answere of peace without me.
Genesis,41,17,Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: in my dreame me thought I stode by a ryvers syde and there came out of the ryver
Genesis,41,18,vij fatt fleshed ad well fauored kyne and fedd in the medowe.
Genesis,41,19,And then .vij. other kyne came vp after them poore and very euell fauored ad leane fleshed: so that I neuer sawe their lyke in all the lande of Egipte in euell fauordnesse.
Genesis,41,20,And the .vij. leane and euell fauored kyne ate vpp the first .vij. fatt kyne
Genesis,41,21,And when they had eaten them vp a man cowde not perceaue that they had eate them: for they were still as evyll fauored as they were at the begynnynge. And I awoke.
Genesis,41,22,And I sawe agayne in my dreame .vij. eares sprynge out of one stalk full and good
Genesis,41,23,and .vij. other eares wytherd thinne and blasted with wynde sprynge vp after them.
Genesis,41,24,And the thynne eares deuowred the .vij. good cares. And I haue tolde it vnto the sothsayers but no man can tell me what it meaneth.
Genesis,41,25,Then Ioseph sayde vnto Pharao: both Pharaos dreames are one. And god doth shewe Pharao what he is aboute to do.
Genesis,41,26,The vij. good kyne are .vij yeare: and the .vij. good eares are .vij. yere also and is but one dreame.
Genesis,41,27,Lykewyse the .vij. thynne and euell fauored kyne that came out after them are .vij. yeares: and the .vij. emptie and blasted eares shalbe vij. yeares of hunger.
Genesis,41,28,This is that which I sayde vnto Pharao that God doth shewe Pharao what he is aboute to doo.
Genesis,41,29,Beholde there shall come .vij. yere of great plenteousnes through out all the lande of Egypte.
Genesis,41,30,And there shall aryse after them vij. yeres of hunger. So that all the plenteousnes shalbe forgeten in the lande of Egipte. And the hunger shall consume the lande:
Genesis,41,31,so that the plenteousnes shall not be once asene in the land by reason of that hunger that shall come after for it shalbe exceading great
Genesis,41,32,And as concernynge that the dreame was dubled vnto Pharao the second tyme it belokeneth that the thynge is certanly prepared of God ad that God will shortly brynge it to passe.
Genesis,41,33,Now therfore let Pharao provyde for a man of vnderstondynge and wysdome and sett him over the lande of Egipte.
Genesis,41,34,And let Pharao make officers ouer the lande and take vp the fyfte parte of the land of Egipte in the vij. plenteous yeres
Genesis,41,35,and let them gather all the foode of these good yeres that come ad lay vp corne vnder the power of Pharo: that there may be foode in the cities
Genesis,41,36,and there let them kepte it: that there may be foode in stoore in the lande agaynst the .vij. yeres of hunger which shall come in the lande of Egipte and that the lande perishe not thorow hunger.
Genesis,41,37,And the saynge pleased Pharao ad all his seruauntes.
Genesis,41,38,Than sayde Pharao vnto his seruavauntes: where shall we fynde soch a ma as this is that hath the sprete of God in him?
Genesis,41,39,wherfore Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: for as moch as God hath shewed the all this there is no man of vnderstondyng nor of wysdome lyke vnto the
Genesis,41,40,Thou therfore shalt be ouer my house and acordinge to thy worde shall all my people obey: only in the kynges seate will I be aboue the.
Genesis,41,41,And he sayde vnto Ioseph: beholde I haue sett the ouer all the lande of Egipte.
Genesis,41,42,And he toke off his rynge from his fyngre and put it vpon Iosephs fingre and arayed him in raymet of bisse and put a golden cheyne aboute his necke
Genesis,41,43,and set him vpon the best charett that he had saue one. And they cryed before him Abrech ad that Pharao had made him ruelar ouer all the lande of Egipte.
Genesis,41,44,And Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: I am Pharao without thi will shall no man lifte vp ether his hande or fote in all the lande of Egipte.
Genesis,41,45,And be called Iosephs name Zaphnath Paenea. And he gaue him to wyfe Asnath the doughter of Potiphara preast of On. Than went Ioseph abrode in the lade of Egipte.
Genesis,41,46,And he was .xxx. yere olde whe he stode before Pharao kynge of Egipte. And than Ioseph departed from Pharao and went thorow out all the lande of Egipte.

Genesis,41,49,And Ioseph layde vp corne in stoore lyke vnto the sande of the see in multitude out of mesure vntyll he left nombrynge: For it was with out nombre.
Genesis,41,50,And vnto Ioseph were borne .ij. sonnes before the yeres of hunger came which Asnath the doughter of Potiphara preast of On bare vnto him.
Genesis,41,51,And he called the name of the first sonne Manasse for God (sayde he) hath made me forgett all my laboure and all my fathers husholde.
Genesis,41,52,The seconde called he Ephraim for God (sayde he) hath caused me to growe in the lande of my trouble.
Genesis,41,53,And when the .vij. yeres plenteousnes that was in the lands of Egypte were ended
Genesis,41,54,than came the .vij. yeres of derth acordynge as Ioseph had sayde. And the derth was in all landes: but in the lade of Egipte was there yet foode.
Genesis,41,55,When now all the lande of Egipte began to hunger than cried the people to Pharao for bread. And Pharao sayde vnto all Egipte: goo vnto Ioseph and what he sayth to you that doo
Genesis,41,56,And when the derth was thorow out all the lande Ioseph opened all that was in the cities and solde vnto the Egiptias And hunger waxed fore in the land of Egipte.
Genesis,41,57,And all countrees came to Egipte to Ioseph for to bye corne: because that the hunger was so sore in all landes.
Genesis,42,1,When Iacob sawe that there was corne to be solde in Egipte he sayde vnto his sones: why are ye negligent?
Genesis,42,2,beholde I haue hearde that there is corne to be solde in Egipte. Gete you thither and bye vs corne fro thece that we maye lyue and not dye.
Genesis,42,3,So went Iosephs ten brethern doune to bye corne in Egipte
Genesis,42,4,for Ben Iamin Iosephs brother wold not Iacob sende with his other brethren: for he sayde: some mysfortune myght happen him

Genesis,42,7,When Ioseph sawe his brethern he knewe them: But made straunge vnto them and spake rughly vnto them saynge: Whence come ye? and they sayde: out of the lande of Canaan to bye vitayle.
Genesis,42,8,Ioseph knewe his brethern but they knewe not him.
Genesis,42,9,And Ioseph remembred his dreames which he dreamed of them and sayde vnto them: ye are spies and to se where the lande is weake is youre comynge.
Genesis,42,10,And they sayde vnto him: nay my lorde: but to bye vitayle thy seruauntes are come.

Genesis,42,16,Sende therfore one off you and lett him fett youre brother and ye shalbe in preason in the meane season. And thereby shall youre wordes be proued whether there be any trueth in you: or els by the lyfe of Pharao ye are but spies.
Genesis,42,17,And he put them in warde thre dayes.
Genesis,42,18,And Ioseph sayde vnto the the thryd daye: This doo and lyue for I feare Gode
Genesis,42,19,Yf ye meane no hurte let one of youre brethern be bounde in the preason and goo ye and brynge the necessarie foode vnto youre housholdes

Genesis,42,22,Ruben answered the saynge: sayde I not vnto you that ye shulde not synne agaynst the lad? but ye wolde not heare And now verely see his bloude is requyred.
Genesis,42,23,They were not aware that Ioseph vnderstode them for he spake vnto them by an interpreter.
Genesis,42,24,And he turned from them and wepte and than turned to them agayne ad comened with them and toke out Simeon from amonge the and bownde him before their eyes
Genesis,42,25,ad commaunded to fyll their saekes wyth corne and to put euery mans money in his sacke and to geue them vitayle to spende by the waye. And so it was done to them.
Genesis,42,26,And they laded their asses with the corne and departed thence.
Genesis,42,27,And as one of them opened his sacke for to geue his asse prauender in the Inne he spied his money in his sacks mouth
Genesis,42,28,And he sayde vnto his brethren: my money is restored me agayne and is eue in my sackes mouth Than their hartes fayled them and were astoynyed and sayde one to a nother: how cometh it that God dealeth thus with us?

Genesis,42,32,We be .xij. bretren sones of oure father one is awaye and the yongest is now with oure father in the lande of Canaan.
Genesis,42,33,And the lorde of the countre sayde vnto us: here by shall I knowe yf ye meane truely: leaue one of youre brethern here with me and take foode necessary for youre housholdes and get you awaye
Genesis,42,34,and brynge youre yongest brother vnto me And thereby shall I knowe that ye are no spyes but meane truely: So will I delyuer you youre brother agayne and ye shall occupie in the lande.
Genesis,42,35,And as they emptied their sackes beholde: euery mans bundell of money was in his sacke And when both they and their father sawe the bundells of money they were afrayde.
Genesis,42,36,And Iacob their father sayde vnto them: Me haue ye robbed of my childern: Ioseph is away and Simeon is awaye and ye will take Ben Iamin awaye. All these thinges fall vpon me.
Genesis,42,37,Ruben answered his father saynge: Slee my two sonnes yf I bringe him not to the agayne. Delyuer him therfore to my honde and I will brynge him to the agayne:

Genesis,43,6,And Israell sayde: wherfore delt ye so cruelly with me as to tell the man that ye had yet another brother?
Genesis,43,7,And they sayde: The man asked vs of oure kynred saynge: is youre father yet alyue? haue ye not another brother? And we tolde him acordynge to these wordes. How cowd we knowe that he wolde byd vs brynge oure brother downe with vs?
Genesis,43,8,Than sayde Iuda vnto Israell his father: Send the lad with me and we wyll ryse and goo that we maye lyue and not dye: both we thou and also oure childern.
Genesis,43,9,I wilbe suertie for him and of my handes requyre him. Yf I brynge him not to the and sett him before thine eyes than let me bere the blame for euer.
Genesis,43,10,For except we had made this tarieg: by this we had bene there twyse and come agayne.

Matthew,13,14,And in the is fulfilled ye Prophesie of Esayas which prophesie sayth: with the eares ye shall heare and shall not vnderstonde and with the eyes ye shall se and shall not perceave.
Matthew,13,15,For this peoples hertes are wexed grosse and their eares were dull of herynge and their eyes have they closed lest they shulde se with their eyes and heare with their eares and shuld vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld tourne that I myght heale them.
Matthew,13,16,But blessed are youre eyes for they se: and youre eares for they heare.
Matthew,13,17,Verely I say vnto you that many Prophetes and perfaicte me have desired to se tho thinges which ye se and have not sene the: and to heare tho thinges which ye heare and have not herde the.
Matthew,13,18,Heare ye therfore ye similitude of the sower.
Matthew,13,19,Whosoever heareth the worde of ye kingdome and vnderstondeth it not ther cometh the evyll ma and catcheth awaye yt which was sowne in his hert. And this is he which was sowne by the wayesyde.
Matthew,13,20,But he yt was sowne in ye stony groude is he which heareth the worde of God and anone wt ioye receaveth it
Matthew,13,21,yet hath he no rottes in him selfe and therfore dureth but a season: for assone as tribulacion or persecucion aryseth because of the worde by and by he falleth.
Matthew,13,22,He yt was sowne amoge thornes is he yt heareth ye worde of God: but the care of this worlde and the dissaytfulnes of ryches choke ye worde and so is he made vnfrutfull.
Matthew,13,23,He which is sowne in ye good grounde is he yt heareth ye worde and vnderstodeth it which also bereth frute and bringeth forth some an.C. folde some sixtie folde and some .xxx. folde.
Matthew,13,24,Another similitude put he forth vnto the sayinge: The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a man which sowed good seed in his felde.
Matthew,13,25,But whyll men slepte ther came his foo and sowed tares amoge ye wheate and wet his waye.
Matthew,13,26,When ye blade was sproge vp and had brought forth frute the appered ye tares also.
Matthew,13,27,The servauntes came to the housholder and sayde vnto him: Syr sowedest not thou good seed in thy closse fro whece the hath it tares?
Matthew,13,28,He sayde to the the envious ma hath done this. Then ye servauntes sayde vnto him: wilt thou then yt we go and gader them?
Matthew,13,29,But he sayde nay lest whill ye go aboute to wede out ye tares ye plucke vppe also wt them ye wheate by ye rottes:
Matthew,13,30,let bothe growe to gether tyll harvest come and in tyme of harvest I wyll saye to the repers gather ye fyrst ye tares and bind the in sheves to be bret: but gather the wheete into my barne.
Matthew,13,31,Another parable he put forthe vnto the sayinge. The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a grayne of mustard seed which a ma taketh and soweth in his felde
Matthew,13,32,which is ye leest of all seedes. But when it is groune it is the greatest amoge yerbes and it is a tree: so yt the bryddes of the ayer come and bylde in the brauches of it.
Matthew,13,33,Another similitude sayde he to them. The kyngdome of heven is lyke vnto leve which a woman taketh and hydeth in .iii. peckes of meele tyll all be levended.
Matthew,13,34,All these thynge spake Iesus vnto the people by similitudes and with oute similitudes spake he nothinge to them
Matthew,13,35,to fulfyll that which was spoke by the Prophet sayinge: I wyll ope my mouth in similitudes and wyll speake forth thinges which have bene kepte secrete from the begynninge of the worlde.
Matthew,13,36,Then sent Iesus ye people awaye and came to housse. And his disciples came vnto him sayinge: declare vnto vs the similitude of the tares of the felde.
Matthew,13,37,Then answered he and sayde to them. He that soweth the good seed is the sonne of man.
Matthew,13,38,And ye felde is the worlde. And the chyldre of the kingdome they are ye good seed. And the tares are the chyldren of ye wicked.
Matthew,13,39,And the enemye that soweth the is ye devell. The harvest is ye end of the worlde. And the repers be ye angels.
Matthew,13,40,For eve as the tares are gaddred and bret in ye fyre: so shall it be in ye ende of this worlde.
Matthew,13,41,The sonne of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kyngdome all thinges that offende and them which do iniquite
Matthew,13,42,and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre. There shalbe waylynge and gnasshing of teth.
Matthew,13,43,Then shall the iuste men shyne as bryght as the sunne in ye kyngdome of their father. Whosoever hath eares to heare let him heare.
Matthew,13,44,Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto treasure hidde in the felde ye which a man fyndeth and hideth: and for ioy therof goeth and selleth all that he hath and byeth that felde.
Matthew,13,45,Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a marchaunt that seketh good pearles
Matthew,13,46,which when he had founde one precious pearle wet and solde all that he had and bought it.
Matthew,13,47,Agayne the kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a neet cast into ye see yt gadereth of all kyndes of fysshes:
Matthew,13,48,which whe it is full men drawe to londe and sitte and gadre the good into vessels and cast the bad awaye.
Matthew,13,49,So shall it be at the ende of the worlde. The angels shall come oute and sever the bad from the good
Matthew,13,50,and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre: there shalbe waylinge and gnasshynge of teth.
Matthew,13,51,Iesus sayde vnto them: vnderstonde ye all these thynges? They sayde ye Lorde.
Matthew,13,52,The sayde he vnto them: Therfore every scribe which is taught vnto the kyngdome of heve is lyke an housholder which bryngeth forth out of hys treasure thynges bothe new and olde.
Matthew,13,53,And it came to passe when Iesus had finisshed these similitudes yt he departed thece
Matthew,13,54,and came in to his awne coutre and taught them in their synagoges in so moche yt they were astonyed and sayde: whece cometh all this wysdome and power vnto him?
Matthew,13,55,Is not this the carpeters sonne? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethre be called Iames and Ioses and Simo and Iudas?
Matthew,13,56,And are not his susters all here wt vs? Whece hath he all these thynge.
Matthew,13,57,And they were offended by him. The Iesus sayd to the a Prophet is not wt out honoure save in hys awne countre and amoge his awne kynne.
Matthew,13,58,And he dyd not many miracles there for there vnbelefes sake.
Matthew,14,1,At that tyme Herod the tetrarcha hearde of the fame of Iesu
Matthew,14,2,and sayde vnto his servautes: This is Ihon ye baptist. He is risen agayne from deeth and therfore are soche myracles wrought by him.
Matthew,14,3,For Herod had taken Ihon and bounde him and put him in preson for Herodias sake his brother Philips wyfe.
Matthew,14,4,For Ihon sayde vnto him: Yt is not lawfull for the to have her.
Matthew,14,5,And when he wold have put him to deeth he feared the people because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew,14,6,But when Herodes birth daye was come the doughter of Herodias daunsed before them and pleased Herod.
Matthew,14,7,Wherfore he promised wt an oth that he wolde geve hir whatsoever she wolde axe.
Matthew,14,8,And she beinge informed of her mother before sayde: geve me here Ihon baptistes heed in a platter.
Matthew,14,9,And ye kynge sorowed. Neverthelesse for his othes sake and for their sakis which sate also at ye table he comaunded yt to be geven hir:
Matthew,14,10,and sent and beheeded Ihon in the preson
Matthew,14,11,and his heed was brought in a platter and geven to the damsell and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew,14,12,And his disciples came and toke vp his body and buryed it: and went and tolde Iesus.
Matthew,14,13,When Iesus hearde that he departed thence by shippe in to a desert place out of ye waye. And when the people had hearde therof they folowed him afote out of their cities.
Matthew,14,14,And Iesus went forth and sawe moche people and his herte did melte vpon them and he healed of them those that were sicke.
Matthew,14,15,When even was come his disciples came to him sayinge. This is a deserte place and the daye is spent: let the people departe yt they maye go into ye tounes and bye them vytayllis.
Matthew,14,16,But Iesus sayde vnto them. They have no neade to go awaye. Geve ye the to eate.
Matthew,14,17,Then sayde they vnto him: we have here but .v. loves and two fysshes.
Matthew,14,18,And he sayde: bringe the hyther to me.
Matthew,14,19,And he comaunded ye people to syt downe on ye grasse: and toke ye .v. loves and the .ii. fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake and gave the loves to his disciples and the disciples gave them to ye people.
Matthew,14,20,And they dyd all eate and were suffised. And they gadered vp of ye gobbetes that remayned vii. basketes full.
Matthew,14,21,And they yt ate werein nobre about .v.M. men besyde wemen and chyldren.
Matthew,14,22,And strayght waye Iesus made his disciples enter into a shippe and to goo over before him whill he sent ye people awaye.
Matthew,14,23,And assone as he had sent the people awaye he went vp into a moutayne alone to praye. And when nyght was come he was there himsilf alone.
Matthew,14,24,And the shippe was now in the middes of the see and was toost with waves for it was a cotrary wynde.
Matthew,14,25,In the fourthe watche of ye night Iesus came vnto them walkynge on the see.
Matthew,14,26,And when his disciples sawe him walkynge on the see they were troubled sayinge: it is some spirite and cryed out for feare.
Matthew,14,27,And streyght waye Iesus spake vnto them sayinge: be of god cheare it is I be not afrayed.
Matthew,14,28,Peter answered him and sayde: master if thou be he bid me come vnto the on the water.
Matthew,14,29,And he sayde come. And when Peter was come doune out of ye shippe he walked on ye water to go to Iesus.
Matthew,14,30,But when he sawe a myghty wynde he was afrayed. And as he beganne to synke he cryed sayinge: master save me.
Matthew,14,31,And immediatly Iesus stretched forth his hode and caught him and sayde to him: O thou of lytell faith wherfore diddest thou dout?
Matthew,14,32,And assone as they were come in to ye shippe ye wynde ceassed.
Matthew,14,33,Then they that were in the shippe came and worshipped him sayinge: of a truth thou arte ye sonne of God.
Matthew,14,34,And when they were come over they went in to ye londe of Genazareth.
Matthew,14,35,And when ye men of yt place had knowledge of him they sent out in to all yt countre rounde about and brought vnto him all that were sicke
Matthew,14,36,and besought him that they myght touche the hemme of his vesture only. And as many as touched it were made safe.
Matthew,15,1,Then came to Iesus scribes and pharises from Ierusalem sayinge:
Matthew,15,2,why do thy disciples transgresse the tradicios of ye elders? for they wesshe not their hondes when they eate breed.
Matthew,15,3,He answered and sayde vnto them: why do ye also transgresse ye comaundment of God thorowe youre tradicions?
Matthew,15,4,For God comaunded sayinge: honoure thy father and mother and he that cursseth father or mother shall suffer deeth.
Matthew,15,5,But ye saye every ma shall saye to his father or mother: That which thou desyrest of me to helpe ye with: is geven God:
Matthew,15,6,and so shall he not honoure his father or his mother. And thus haue ye made yt the comaundment of God is with out effecte through youre tradicios.
Matthew,15,7,Ypocrites well prophesyed of you Esay sayinge:
Matthew,15,8,This people draweth nye vnto me with their mouthes and honoureth me with their lippes howbe it their hertes are farre from me:
Matthew,15,9,but in vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctrines whiche are nothing but mens precepts.
Matthew,15,10,And he called the people vnto him and sayde to them: heare and vnderstande.
Matthew,15,11,That which goeth into the mouth defyleth not ye man: but that which commeth out of the mouth defyleth the man.
Matthew,15,12,Then came his disciples and sayde vnto him. Perceavest thou not how that the pharises are offended in hearinge thys sayinge?
Matthew,15,13,He answered and sayde: all plantes which my hevely father hath not planted shalbe plucked vp by the rotes.
Matthew,15,14,Let them alone they be the blynde leaders of the blynde. If the blynde leede the blynde boothe shall fall into the dyche.
Matthew,15,15,Then answered Peter and sayd to him: declare vnto vs this parable.
Matthew,15,16,Then sayde Iesus: are ye yet with oute vnderstondinge?
Matthew,15,17,perceave ye not that what soever goeth in at the mouth descendeth doune in to the bely and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew,15,18,But those thingis which procede out of the mouth come from the herte and they defyle the man.
Matthew,15,19,For out of the herte come evyll thoughtis murder breakyng of wedlocke whordo theefte falce witnes berynge blasphemye.
Matthew,15,20,These are the thingis which defyle a man. But to eate with vnwesshen hondes defyleth not a man.
Matthew,15,21,And Iesus went thence and departed in to the costis of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,And beholde a woman which was a Cananite came out of ye same coostis and cryed vnto him sayinge: have mercy on me Lorde the sonne of David my doughter is pytiously vexed with a devyll.
Matthew,15,23,And he gave her never a worde to answer. Then came to him his disciples and besought him sayinge: sende her awaye for she foloweth vs cryinge.
Matthew,15,24,He answered and sayde: I am not sent but vnto ye loost shepe of ye housse of Israel.
Matthew,15,25,Then she came and worshipped him sayinge: master helpe me.
Matthew,15,26,He answered and sayde: it is not good to take the chyldrens breed and to cast it to whelpes.
Matthew,15,27,She answered and sayde: truthe Lorde: neverthelesse the whelpes eate of the cromes which fall from their masters table.
Matthew,15,28,Then Iesus answered and sayde vnto her. O woman greate is thy faith be it to the even as thou desyrest. And her doughter was made whole even at that same houre.
Matthew,15,29,Then Iesus went awaye from thence and came nye vnto the see of Galile and went vp in to a mountayne and sat doune there.
Matthew,15,30,And moche people came vnto him havinge with the halt blynde domme maymed and other many: and cast them doune at Iesus fete. And he healed them
Matthew,15,31,in so moche that the people wondred to se the dome speake the maymed whole the halt to go and ye blynde to se. And they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew,15,32,Then Iesus called his disciples to him and sayde: I have compassion on ye people becau se they have cotynued with me now .iii. dayes and have nought to eate: and I wyll not let them departe fastinge leste they perisshe in ye waye.
Matthew,15,33,And his disciples sayd vnto him: whece shuld we get so moche breed in ye wildernes as shuld suffise so greate a multitude?
Matthew,15,34,And Iesus sayde vnto them: how many loves have ye? And they sayde: seven and a feawe litle fysshes.
Matthew,15,35,And he comaunded ye people to syt doune on ye grounde:
Matthew,15,36,and toke the seven loves and the fysshes and gave thankes and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples gave them to the people.
Matthew,15,37,And they dyd all eate and were suffised. And they toke vp of the broke meate that was lefte .vii. basketes full.
Matthew,15,38,And yet they that ate were .iiii.M. men besyde wemen and chyldren.
Matthew,15,39,And he sent awaye the people and toke shippe and came into the parties of Magdala.
Matthew,16,1,Then came the pharises and saduces and did tempte him desyringe him to shewe them some signe from heve.
Matthew,16,2,He answered and sayde vnto the. At even ye saye we shall have fayre wedder and yt because ye skye is reed:
Matthew,16,3,and in the morninge ye saye to daye shalbe foule wedder and that because the skye is cloudy and reed. O ye ypocrites ye can discerne ye fassion of the skye: and can ye not discerne ye signes of the tymes?
Matthew,16,4,The frowarde nacion and advoutrous seketh a signe and there shall non other signe be geven vnto them but the signe of the prophet Ionas. So lefte he them and departed.
Matthew,16,5,And when his disciples were come to the other side of the water they had forgotte to take breed with the.
Matthew,16,6,Then Iesus sayd vnto them: Take hede and beware of the leve of ye Pharises and of ye Saduces.
Matthew,16,7,And they thought in them selves sayinge: because we have brought no breed with vs.
Matthew,16,8,When Iesus vnderstode that he sayd vnto the. O ye of lytell faith why are youre mindes cumbred because ye have brought no breed?
Matthew,16,9,Do ye not yet perceave nether remeber those .v. loves when there were .v.M. men and how many baskettes toke ye vp?
Matthew,16,10,Nether the .vii. loves when there were .iiiii.M. and how many baskettes toke ye vp?
Matthew,16,11,Why perceave ye not then yt I spake not vnto you of breed whe I sayde beware of the leven of the Pharises and of the Saduces?
Matthew,16,12,The vnderstode they how that he bad not them beware of the leven of breed: but of the doctrine of the Pharises and of the Saduces.
Matthew,16,13,When Iesus cam in to the costes of the cite which is called Cesarea Philippi he axed his disciples sayinge: whom do men saye yt I the sonne of ma am?
Matthew,16,14,They saide some saye yt thou arte Ihon Baptist some Helias some Ieremias or one of ye prophetes.
Matthew,16,15,He sayde vnto the: but who saye ye yt I am?
Matthew,16,16,Simo Peter answered and sayde: Thou arte Christ ye sonne of the lyvinge God.
Matthew,16,17,And Iesus answered and sayde to him: happy arte thou Simon the sonne of Ionas for fleshe and bloud hath not opened vnto the yt but my father which is in heve.
Matthew,16,18,And I saye also vnto the yt thou arte Peter: and apon this rocke I wyll bylde my congregacion. And the gates of hell shall not prevayle ageynst it.
Matthew,16,19,And I wyll geve vnto the the keyes of the kyngdom of heven: and whatsoever thou byndest vpon erth shall be bounde in heven: and whatsoever thou lowsest on erthe shalbe lowsed in heven.
Matthew,16,20,Then he charged his disciples yt they shulde tell no man yt he was Iesus Christ.
Matthew,16,21,From yt tyme forth Iesus began to shewe vnto his disciples how yt he must go vnto Ierusalem and suffer many thinges of ye Elders and of ye hye prestes and of the scribes and must be killed and ryse agayne ye thirde daye.
Matthew,16,22,But Peter toke him asyde and began to rebuke him sayinge: master faver thy sylfe this shall not come vnto the.
Matthew,16,23,Then tourned he aboute and sayde vnto Peter: come after me Satan thou offendest me because thou sauourest not godly thinges but wordly thinges
Matthew,16,24,Iesus then sayde to his disciples. If eny man wyll folowe me leet him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me.
Matthew,16,25,For who soever wyll save his lyfe shall loose it. And whosoever shall loose his lyfe for my sake shall fynde it.
Matthew,16,26,What shall it proffet a man though he shulde wynne all the whoole worlde: yf he loose his owne soule? Or els what shall a man geve to redeme his soule agayne with all?
Matthew,16,27,For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father wt his angels: and then shall he rewarde every man accordinge to his dedes.
Matthew,16,28,Verely I saye vnto you some ther be amonge them that here stonde which shall not taste of deeth tyll they shall have sene the sonne of man come in his kyngdomen.
Matthew,17,1,And after. vi. dayes Iesus toke Peter and Iames and Ihon his brother and brought them vp into an hye mountayne out of the waye
Matthew,17,2,and was transfygured before them: and his face did shyne as the sunne and his clothes were as whyte as the light.
Matthew,17,3,And beholde ther appered vnto the Moses and Helyas talkinge with him.
Matthew,17,4,Then answered Peter and sayde to Iesus: master here is good beinge for vs. If thou wylt leet vs make here .iii. tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas.
Matthew,17,5,Whyll he yet spake beholde a bright cloude shadowed them. And beholde there came a voyce out of ye cloude sayinge: this is my deare sonne in whom I delite heare him.
Matthew,17,6,And when the disciples hearde that they fell on their faces and were soore afrayed.
Matthew,17,7,And Iesus came and touched them and sayde: aryse and be not afrayed.
Matthew,17,8,And when they looked vp they saw no man saue Iesus onely.
Matthew,17,9,And as they came doune from the mountayne Iesus charged them sayinge: se yt ye shewe the vision to no man vntyll the sonne of man be rysen ageyne from deeth.
Matthew,17,10,And his disciples axed of him sayinge: Why then saye the scribes yt Helyas muste fyrst come?
Matthew,17,11,Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: Helyas shall fyrst come and restore all thinges.
Matthew,17,12,And I saye vnto you yt Helyas is come alredy and they knewe him not: but have done vnto him whatsoever they lusted. In lyke wyse shall also the sonne of man suffre of the.
Matthew,17,13,Then ye disciples perceaved that he spake vnto them of Ihon baptist.
Matthew,17,14,And when they were come to ye people ther cam to him a certayne man and kneled doune to him and sayde:
Matthew,17,15,Master have mercy on my sonne for he is franticke: and is sore vexed. And oft tymes he falleth into the fyre and oft into ye water
Matthew,17,16,And I brought him to thy disciples and they coulde not heale him.
Matthew,17,17,Iesus answered and sayde: O generacion faythles and croked: how longe shall I be with you? how longe shall I suffre you? bring him hidder to me.
Matthew,17,18,And Iesus rebuked the devyll and he ca out of him. And ye child was healed even yt same houre.
Matthew,17,19,Then came the disciples to Iesus secretly and sayde: Why could not we cast him out?
Matthew,17,20,Iesus sayd vnto the: Because of youre vnbelefe For I saye veryly vnto you: yf ye had faythe as a grayne of musterd seed ye shuld saye vnto this moutayne remove hence to yonder place and he shuld remove: nether shuld eny thinge be vnpossible for you to do.
Matthew,17,21,How be it this kynde goeth not oute but by prayer and fastinge.
Matthew,17,22,As they passed the tyme in Galile Iesus sayde vnto them: the sonne of man shalbe betrayed into the hondes of men
Matthew,17,23,and they shall kill him and the thyrd daye he shall ryse agayne. And they sorowed greatly.
Matthew,17,24,And when they were come to Capernau they yt were wont to gadre poll money came to Peter and sayde: Doth youre master paye tribute?
Matthew,17,25,He sayd: ye. And when he was come into the house Iesus spake fyrst to him saying What thinkest thou Simon? of whome do ye kynges of the erth take tribute or poll money? of their chyldren or of straungers?
Matthew,17,26,Peter sayde vnto him: of straungers. Then sayd Iesus vnto him agayne: Then are the chyldren fre.
Matthew,17,27,Neverthelesse lest we shuld offende the: goo to ye see and cast in thyne angle and take the fysshe yt fyrst cometh vp: and when thou hast opened his mouthe thou shalt fynde a pece of twentie pence: yt take and paye for me and the.
Matthew,18,1,The same tyme the disciples came vnto Iesus saying: who is ye greatest in the kyngdome of heve?
Matthew,18,2,Iesus called a chylde vnto him and set him in the middes of them:
Matthew,18,3,and sayd. Verely I say vnto you: except ye tourne and become as chyldren ye cannot enter into the kyngdom of heven.
Matthew,18,4,Whosoever therfore humble him sylfe as this chylde the same is the greatest in ye kyngdome of heve.
Matthew,18,5,And who soever receaveth suche a chylde in my name receaveth me.
Matthew,18,6,But whosoever offende one of these lytelons which beleve in me: it were better for him that a milstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were drouned in the depth of the see.
Matthew,18,7,Wo be vnto the world because of offences. How be it it cannot be avoided but yt offences shalbe geven. Neverthelesse woo be to ye man by who the offence cometh.
Matthew,18,8,Wherfore yf thy honde or thy fote offende the cut him of and cast him from the. It ys better for the to enter into lyfe halt or maymed rather then thou shuldest havinge two hondes or two fete be cast into everlasting fyre.
Matthew,18,9,And yf also thyne eye offende the plucke him oute and caste him from the. It is better for the to enter into lyfe with one eye then havyng two eyes to be cast into hell fyre.
Matthew,18,10,Se that ye despise not one of these litelons. For I saye vnto you yt in heven their angels alwayes behold the face of my father which is in heven.
Matthew,18,11,Ye and the sonne of man is come to saue that which is lost.
Matthew,18,12,How thinke ye? Yf a man have an hondred shepe and one of them be gone astray dothe he not leve nynty and nyne in ye moutains and go and seke that one which is gone astray?
Matthew,18,13,If it happen that he fynd him veryly I say vnto you: he reioyseth more of that shepe then of the nynty and nyne which went not astray.
Matthew,18,14,Even so it is not the wyll of youre father in heven that one of these lytelons shulde perishe.
Matthew,18,15,Moreover yf thy brother treaspace agenst the. Go and tell him his faute betwene him and the alone. Yf he heare the thou hast wone thy brother:
Matthew,18,16,But yf he heare the not then take yet with the one or two that in the mouth of two or thre witnesses all thinges maye be stablisshed.
Matthew,18,17,If he heare not them tell it vnto the congregacion. If he heare not ye congregacion take him as an hethen man and as a publican.
Matthew,18,18,Verely I say vnto you what soever ye bynde on erth shalbe bounde in heven. And what soever ye lowse on erth shalbe lowsed in heven.
Matthew,18,19,Agayn I say vnto you that yf two of you shall agre in erth apon eny maner thynge what soever they shall desyre: it shalbe geven them of my father which is in heven.
Matthew,18,20,For where two or thre are gathered togedder in my name there am I in the myddes of them.
Matthew,18,21,Then came Peter to him and sayde: master howe ofte shall I forgeve my brother yf he synne agaynst me seven tymes?
Matthew,18,22,Iesus sayd vnto him: I saye not vnto the seven tymes: but seventy tymes seven tymes.
Matthew,18,23,Therfore is ye kingdome of heven lykened vnto a certayne kynge which wolde take a countis of his servauntis.
Matthew,18,24,And when he had begone to recken one was broughte vnto him whiche ought him ten thousande talentis:
Matthew,18,25,whome be cause he had nought to paye his master commaunded him to be solde and his wyfe and his chyldren and all that he had and payment to be made.

Matthew,19,3,Then came vnto him the pharises temtinge him and sayinge to him: Ys it lawfull for a man to put awaye his wyfe for all maner of causes?
Matthew,19,4,He answered and sayd vnto them: Have ye not redde how that he which made man at the beginninge made them man and woman
Matthew,19,5,and sayde: for this thinge shall a ma leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they twayne shalbe one flesshe.

Matthew,19,7,The sayde they to him: why did Moses comaunde to geve a testimoniall of divorsemet and to put hyr awaye?
Matthew,19,8,He sayde vnto them: Moses because of the hardnes of youre hertes suffred you to put awaye youre wyfes: But from ye beginnynge it was not so.
Matthew,19,9,I saye therfore vnto you whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe (except it be for fornicacion) and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke. And whosoever maryeth her which is divorsed doeth commyt advoutry.
Matthew,19,10,Then sayde his disciples to him: yf the mater be so betwene man and wyfe then is it not good to mary.
Matthew,19,11,He sayde vnto them: all me can not awaye with that sayinge save they to whom it is geve.
Matthew,19,12,Ther are chaste which were so borne out of their mothers belly. And ther are chaste which be made of men. And ther be chaste which have made them selves chaste for the kyngdome of heves sake. He that can take it let him take it.

Matthew,19,14,But Iesus sayde: suffre the chyldren and forbid them not to come to me: for of suche is the kyngdome of heven.
Matthew,19,15,And when he had put his hondes on them he departed thence.
Matthew,19,16,And beholde one came and sayde vnto him: good master what good thinge shall I do that I maye have eternall lyfe?
Matthew,19,17,He sayde vnto him: why callest thou me good? there is none good but one and that is God. But yf thou wylt entre in to lyfe kepe the commaundementes.
Matthew,19,18,The other sayde to him Which? And Iesus sayde: breake no wedloke kill not steale not: beare not falce witnes:

Matthew,20,13,He answered to one of the sayinge: frende I do the no wronge: dyddest thou not agre wt me for a peny?
Matthew,20,14,Take that which is thy duty and go thy waye. I will geve vnto this last as moche as to the.
Matthew,20,15,Ys it not lawfull for me to do as me listeth with myne awne? Ys thyne eye evyll because I am good?
Matthew,20,16,Soo the laste shalbe fyrste and the fyrste shalbe laste. For many are called and feawe be chosen.
Matthew,20,17,And Iesus ascended to Ierusalem and toke the .xii. disciples a parte in the waye and sayde to the.

Matthew,20,24,And when the ten hearde this they disdayned at ye two brethre:
Matthew,20,25,But Iesus called them vnto him and sayde: Ye knowe yt the lordes of the gentyls have dominacio over them. And they that are great exercise power over the.
Matthew,20,26,It shall not be so amoge you. But whosoever wyll be greate amoge you let him be youre minister:
Matthew,20,27,and whosoever wil be chefe let him be youre servaut

Matthew,21,1,When they drewe neye vnto Ierusalem and were come to Betphage vnto mounte olivete: then sent Iesus two of his disciples

Matthew,21,5,Tell ye the doughter of Sion: beholde thy kynge cometh vnto the meke and sittinge vpon an asse and a colte the fole of an asse vsed to the yooke.
Matthew,21,6,The disciples went and dyd as Iesus comaunded them
Matthew,21,7,and brought ye asse and the colte and put on them their clothes and set him theron.
Matthew,21,8,And many of the people spreed their garmentes in ye waye. Other cut doune braunches fro the trees and strawed them in the waye.

Matthew,21,12,And Iesus went in to the temple of God and cast out all them that soulde and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the mony chaugers and the seates of them that solde doves

Matthew,21,14,And the blinde and the halt came to him in ye teple and he healed the.
Matthew,21,15,When the chefe prestes and scribes sawe the marveylles that he dyd and the chyldren cryinge in the teple and sayinge Hosanna to the sonne of David they disdayned
Matthew,21,16,and sayde vnto him: hearest thou what these saye? Iesus sayde vnto them yee: have ye never redde of the mouth of babes and suckelinges thou haste ordeyned prayse?
Matthew,21,17,And he lefte the and wet out of ye cite vnto Bethanie and had his abydige there.
Matthew,21,18,In the mornynge as he returned in to the cyte ageyne he hungred
Matthew,21,19,and spyed a fygge trre in the waye and came to it and founde nothinge theron but leves only and sayd to it never frute growe on the hence forwardes. And ano the fygge tree wyddered awaye.
Matthew,21,20,And when his disciples sawe that they marveled sayinge: Howe sone is the fygge tree wyddered awaye?
Matthew,21,21,Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: Verely I saye vnto you yf ye shall have faith and shall not dout ye shall not only do that which I have done to the fygge tree: but also yf ye shall saye vnto this moutayne take thy silfe awaye and cast thy silfe into the see it shalbe done.
Matthew,21,22,And whatsoever ye shall axe in prayer (if ye beleve) ye shall receave it.
Matthew,21,23,And when he was come into the teple the chefe prestes and the elders of the people came vnto him as he was teachinge and sayde: by what auctorite doest thou these thinges? and who gave the this power?
Matthew,21,24,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I also will axe of you a certayne question which if ye assoyle me I in lyke wyse wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
Matthew,21,25,The baptime of Iohn: whence was it? fro heve or of men? Then they reasoned amoge them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye fro heven he will saye vnto vs: why dyd ye not then beleve hym?
Matthew,21,26,But and if we shall saye of men then feare we the people. For all men helde Iohn as a Prophet.
Matthew,21,27,And they answered Iesus and sayde: we cannot tell. And he lyke wyse sayd vnto them: nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
Matthew,21,28,What saye ye to this? A certayne man had two sonnes and came to ye elder and sayde: sonne go and worke to daye in my vineyarde.
Matthew,21,29,He answered and sayde I will not: but afterwarde repented and went.
Matthew,21,30,Then came he to the second and sayde lyke wyse. And he answered and sayde: I will syr: yet wet not.

Matthew,21,33,Herken another similitude. Ther was a certayne housholder which planted a vineyarde and hedged it roude about and made a wynpresse in it and bilt a tower and let it out to husbandmen and wet in to a straunge coutre.
Matthew,21,34,And when the tyme of the frute drewe neare he sent his servauntes to the husbandmen to receave the frutes of it.
Matthew,21,35,And ye husbandme caught his servauntes and bet one kylled another and stoned another.
Matthew,21,36,Agayne he sent other servantes moo then the fyrst: and they served them lyke wyse.
Matthew,21,37,But last of all he sent vnto the his awne sonne sayinge: they will feare my sonne.
Matthew,21,38,But when the husbandmen sawe the sonne they sayde amoge the selves: This is the heyre: come let vs kyll him and let vs take his inheritaunce to oure selves.
Matthew,21,39,And they caught him and thrust him out of the vineyarde and slewe him.
Matthew,21,40,When the lorde of the vyneyarde commeth what will he do wt those husbandme?
Matthew,21,41,They sayde vnto him: he will cruellye destroye those evyll persons and wyll let out his vyneyarde vnto other husbandmen which shall delyver him the frute at tymes convenient
Matthew,21,42,Iesus sayde vnto the: dyd ye never redde in the scriptures? The stone which ye bylders refused ye same is set in ye principall parte of ye corner: this was the lordes doinge and yt is mervelous in oure eyes.
Matthew,21,43,Therfore saye I vnto you the kyngdome of God shalbe take from you and shalbe geve to the getyls which shall brynge forth the frutes of it.
Matthew,21,44,And whosoever shall fall on this stone he shalbe broken but on whosoever it shall fall vpon it will grynde him to powder.
Matthew,21,45,And when the chefe prestes and Pharises hearde these similitudes they perceaved yt he spake of the.
Matthew,21,46,And they wet about to laye hondes on him but they feared ye people because they tooke him as a Prophet.
Matthew,22,1,And Iesus answered and spake vnto them agayne in similitudes sayinge.
Matthew,22,2,The kingdome of heve is lyke vnto a certayne kynge which maryed his sonne
Matthew,22,3,and sent forth his servantes to call them that were byd to the weddinge and they wolde not come.
Matthew,22,4,Ageyne he sent forth other servauntes sayinge: Tell them which are bydden: beholde I have prepared my dynner myne oxen and my fatlinges are kylled and all thinges are redy come vnto the mariage.
Matthew,22,5,But they made light of it and went their wayes: one to his ferme place another about his marchaundise
Matthew,22,6,the remnaunt toke his seruantes and intreated them vngodly and slewe them.
Matthew,22,7,When the kinge hearde that he was wroth and send forth his warryers and distroyed those murtherers and brent vp their cyte.
Matthew,22,8,Then sayde he to his servauutes: the weddinge was prepared. But they which were bydden were not worthy.
Matthew,22,9,Go ye therfore out into ye hyewayes and as many as ye finde byd them to the mariage.
Matthew,22,10,The seruauntes wet out into the hiewayes and gaddered to gedder as many as they coulde fynde both good and bad and ye weddinge was furnysshed with gestes.
Matthew,22,11,Then the kynge came in to viset the gestes and spyed there a ma which had not on a weddinge garment
Matthew,22,12,and sayde vnto him: frende how fortuned it that thou camest in hither and hast not on a weddyng garment? And he was eve spechlesse.
Matthew,22,13,Then sayde the kynge to his ministers: take and bynde hym hand and fote and caste hym into vtter darcknes there shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth.
Matthew,22,14,For many are called and feawe be chosen.
Matthew,22,15,Then wet the Pharises and toke counsell how they might tagle him in his wordes.
Matthew,22,16,And they sent vnto him their disciples with Herodes servauntes sayinge: Master we knowe yt thou are true and teachest the waye of god trulie nether carest for eny man for thou consydrest not menes estate.
Matthew,22,17,Tell vs therfore: how thynkest thou? Is it lawfull to geve tribute vnto Cesar or not?
Matthew,22,18,Iesus perceaved their wikednes and sayde: Why tempte ye me ye ypocrites?
Matthew,22,19,Let me se ye tribute money. And they toke hym a peny.
Matthew,22,20,And he sayde vnto them: whose is this ymage and superscripcion?
Matthew,22,21,They sayde vnto him: Cesars. Then sayde he vnto them. Geve therfore to Cesar that which is Cesars: and geve vnto god that which is goddes.
Matthew,22,22,When they hearde that they marveled and lefte hym and went there waye.
Matthew,22,23,The same daye the Saduces came to him (which saye that there is no resurrcecion) and axed him
Matthew,22,24,sayinge: Master Moses bade yf a man dye havinge no chyldre that the brother mary his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother.
Matthew,22,25,Ther were wt vs seven brethre and the fyrste maried and deceased wt oute yssue and lefte his wyfe vnto his brother.
Matthew,22,26,Lykewise the seconde and ye thryd vnto the sevethe.
Matthew,22,27,Laste of all the woman dyed also.
Matthew,22,28,Now in the resurreccion whose wyfe shall she be of the seven? For all had her.
Matthew,22,29,Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: ye are deceaved and vnderstonde not the scriptures nor yet the power of God.
Matthew,22,30,For in the resurreccion they nether mary nor are maryed: but are as the angels of God in heven.
Matthew,22,31,As touchynge the resurreccion of the deed: have ye not redde what is sayde vnto you of God which sayeth:
Matthew,22,32,I am Abrahams God and Ysaacks God and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the deed: but of the lyvinge.
Matthew,22,33,And when the people hearde that they were astonyed at his doctrine.
Matthew,22,34,When the Pharises had hearde how yt he had put the Saduces to silence they drewe to gedder
Matthew,22,35,and one of them which was a doctoure of lawe axed a question teptinge h m and sayinge:
Matthew,22,36,Master which is ye chefe comaundment in the lawe?
Matthew,22,37,Iesus sayde vnto him: love the Lorde thy God wt all thine herte with all thy soule and with all thy mynde.
Matthew,22,38,This is the fyrst and the chefe comaundement.
Matthew,22,39,And ther is another lyke vnto this. Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe.
Matthew,22,40,In these two commaundemetes hange all the lawe and the Prophetes.
Matthew,22,41,Whyll the Pharises were gaddered togeder Iesus axed
Matthew,22,42,the sayinge: what thinke ye of Christ? Whose sonne is he? They sayde vnto him: the sonne of David.
Matthew,22,43,He sayde vnto the: how then doeth David in spirite call him Lorde sayinge?
Matthew,22,44,The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde: tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
Matthew,22,45,Yf David call him Lorde: how is he then his sonne?
Matthew,22,46,And none coulde answere him ageyne one worde: nether dueste eny from that daye forth axe him eny moo questions.
Matthew,23,1,Then spake Iesus to the people and to his disciples
Matthew,23,2,sayinge. The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate.
Matthew,23,3,All therfore whatsoever they byd you observe that observe and do: but after their workes do not:
Matthew,23,4,For they saye and do not. Ye and they bynde hevy burthes and grevous to be borne and ley the on menes shulders: but they themsylfes will not heave at them with one of their fyngers.
Matthew,23,5,All their workes they do for to be sene of me. They set abroade their philateries and make large borders on there garmetes
Matthew,23,6,and love to sit vppermooste at feastes and to have the chefe seates in the synagoges
Matthew,23,7,and gretinges in the marketes and to be called of men Rabi.
Matthew,23,8,But ye shall not suffre youre selves to be called Rabi. For one is youre master that is to wyt Christ and all ye are brethre.
Matthew,23,9,And call no man youre father vpon the erth for there is but one youre father and he is in heven.
Matthew,23,10,Be not called masters for there is but one youre master and he is Christ.
Matthew,23,11,He that is greatest amoge you shalbe youre seruaunte.
Matthew,23,12,But whosoever exalteth himsilfe shalbe brought lowe. And he yt hubleth himsilfe shalbe exalted.
Matthew,23,13,Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites for ye shutte vp the kyngdome of heve before men: ye youre selves goo not in nether suffre ye them that come to enter in.
Matthew,23,14,Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites: ye devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of praying longe prayers: wherfore ye shall receave greater damnacion.
Matthew,23,15,Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which compasse see and londe to bringe one in to youre belefe: and when he ys brought ye make him two folde more the chylde of hell then ye youre selves are.
Matthew,23,16,Wo be vnto you blynd gides which saye whosoever sweare by the teple it is no thinge: but whosoever sweare by the golde of the temple he offendeth.
Matthew,23,17,Ye foles and blinde? whether is greater the golde or the teple that sanctifieth ye golde.
Matthew,23,18,And whosoever sweareth by the aulter it is nothinge: but whosoever sweareth by ye offeringe yt lyeth on ye aultre offendeth.
Matthew,23,19,Ye foles and blinde: whether is greater ye offeringe or ye aultre which sanctifieth ye offeringe?
Matthew,23,20,Whosoever therfore sweareth by ye aultre sweareth by it and by all yt there on is.
Matthew,23,21,And whosoever sweareth by the teple sweareth by it and by hym yt dwelleth therin.
Matthew,23,22,And he that sweareth by heve swereth by the seate of God and by hym that sytteth theron.
Matthew,23,23,Wo be to you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which tythe mynt annyse and comen and leave the waygthtyer mattres of ye lawe vndone: iudgemet mercy and fayth. These ought ye to have done and not to have left the othre vndone.
Matthew,23,24,Ye blinde gydes which strayne out a gnat and swalowe a cammyll.
Matthew,23,25,Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites which make clene ye vtter syde of the cuppe and of the platter: but within they are full of brybery and excesse.
Matthew,23,26,Thou blinde Pharise clense fyrst the outsyde of the cup and platter that the ynneside of them maye be clene also.
Matthew,23,27,Wo be to you Scribe and Pharises ypocrite for ye are lyke vnto paynted tombes which appere beautyfull outwarde: but are wt in full of deed bones and of all fylthynes.
Matthew,23,28,So are ye for outwarde ye appere righteous vnto me when within ye are full of ypocrisie and iniquite.
Matthew,23,29,Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites: ye bylde the tombes of the Prophetes and garnisshe the sepulchres of the righteous
Matthew,23,30,and saye: Yf we had bene in the dayes of oure fathers we wolde not have bene parteners with them in the bloud of the Prophetes.
Matthew,23,31,So then ye be witnesses vnto youre selfes that ye are the chyldren of them which killed the prophetes.

Matthew,26,4,and heelde a counsell how they mygt take Iesus by suttelte and kyll him.

Matthew,26,22,And they were excedinge sorowfull and beganne every one of the to saye vnto him: is it I master?
Matthew,26,23,He answered and sayde: he yt deppeth his honde wt me in ye disshe the same shall betraye me.
Matthew,26,24,The sonne of ma goeth as it is written of him: but wo be to yt ma by whom ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed. It had bene good for that man yf he had never bene borne.
Matthew,26,25,Then Iudas wich betrayed him answered and sayde: is it I master? He sayde vnto him: thou hast sayde.
Matthew,26,26,As they dyd eate Iesus toke breed and gave thankes brake it and gave it to the disciples and sayde: Take eate this is my body.

Matthew,26,29,I saye vnto you: I will not drinke hence forth of this frute of the vyne tree vntyll that daye when I shall drinke it new with you in my fathers kyngdome.
Matthew,26,30,And when they had sayde grace they went out into mounte olyvete.
Matthew,26,31,Then sayd Iesus vnto them: all ye shall be offended by me this night. For it is wrytten. I will smyte ye shepe herde and the shepe of ye flocke shalbe scattered abroode.
Matthew,26,32,But after I am rysen ageyne I will goo before you into Galile.
Matthew,26,33,Peter answered and sayde vnto him: though all men shulde be offended by ye yet wolde I never be offended.
Matthew,26,34,Iesus sayde vnto him. Verely I saye vnto ye that this same night before the cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse.
Matthew,26,35,Peter sayde vnto him: Yf I shulde dye with ye yet wolde I not denye ye Lyke wyse also sayde all ye disciples.
Matthew,26,36,Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane and sayde vnto the disciples syt ye here whyll I go and praye yonder.
Matthew,26,37,And he toke with him Peter and the two sonnes of zebede and began to wexe sorowfull and to be in an agonye.
Matthew,26,38,Then sayd Iesus vnto them: my soule is hevy even vnto the deeth. Tary ye here and watche wt me.
Matthew,26,39,And he went a lytell aparte and fell flat on his face and prayed sayinge: O my father yf it be possible let this cuppe passe from me: neverthelesse not as I wyll but as thou wylt.
Matthew,26,40,And he came vnto the disciples and founde them a slepe and sayde to Peter: what coulde ye not watche with me one houre:
Matthew,26,41,watche and praye that ye fall not into temptacion. The spirite is willynge but the flesshe is weake.
Matthew,26,42,He went awaye once moare and prayed sayinge: O my father yf this cuppe can not passe away from me but yt I drinke of it thy wyll be fulfylled.
Matthew,26,43,And he came and founde the a slepe agayne. For their eyes were hevy.
Matthew,26,44,And he lefte them and went agayne and prayed ye thrid tyme sayinge ye same wordes.
Matthew,26,45,Then came he to his disciples and sayd vnto them: Slepe hence forth and take youre reest. Take hede the houre is at honde and ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed into ye hondes of synners.
Matthew,26,46,Ryse let vs be goinge: beholde he is at honde yt shall betraye me.
Matthew,26,47,Whyll he yet spake: lo Iudas one of ye xii. came and wt him a greate multitude wt sweardes and staves sent from the chefe prestes and elders of the people.
Matthew,26,48,And he that betrayed him had geven the a token sayinge: whosoever I kysse yt same is he ley hondes on him.
Matthew,26,49,And forth wt all he came to Iesus and sayde: hayle master and kyssed him.
Matthew,26,50,And Iesus sayde vnto him: frende wherfore arte thou come? Then came they and layed hondes on Iesus and toke him.
Matthew,26,51,And beholde one of them which were with Iesus stretched oute his honde and drue his swearde and stroke a servaunt of the hye preste and smote of his eare.
Matthew,26,52,Then sayde Iesus vnto him: put vp thy swearde into his sheathe. For all that ley hond on ye swearde shall perisshe with ye swearde.
Matthew,26,53,Ether thinkest thou that I cannot now praye to my father and he shall geve me moo then .xii. legions of angelles?
Matthew,26,54,But how then shuld the scriptures be fulfylled: for so must it be.
Matthew,26,55,The same tyme sayd Iesus to the multitude: ye be come out as it were vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves for to take me. I sate daylie teachinge in the temple amoge you and ye toke me not.
Matthew,26,56,All this was done that the scriptures of the Prophetes myght be fulfilled.
Matthew,26,57,Then all the disciples forsoke him and fleed. And they toke Iesus and leed him to Cayphas the hye preeste where the Scribes and the Elders where assembled.
Matthew,26,58,And Peter folowed him a farre of vnto the hye prestes place: and went in and sate with the servauntes to se the ende.
Matthew,26,59,The chefe prestes and the elders and all the counsell sought false witnes agenste Iesus for to put him to deeth
Matthew,26,60,but founde none: in somoche that when many false witnesses cam yet founde they none. At the last came two false witnesses
Matthew,26,61,and sayd: This felowe sayde: I can distroye the temple of God and bylde it agayne in .iii. dayes.
Matthew,26,62,And the chefe preste arose and sayde to him: answerest thou nothinge? How is it yt these beare witnes ageynst the?
Matthew,26,63,But Iesus helde his peace: And the chefe Preeste answered and sayd to him: I charge the in the name of the lyvinge God that thou tell vs whether thou be Christ the sonne of God.
Matthew,26,64,Iesus sayd to him: thou haste sayd. Neverthelesse I saye vnto you hereafter shall ye se the sonne of ma syttinge on the right honde of power and come in the clowddes of the skye.
Matthew,26,65,Then the hye preste rent his clothes sayinge: He hath blasphemed: what nede we of eny moo witnesses? Behold now ye have hearde his blasphemy:
Matthew,26,66,what thinke ye? They answered and sayd: he his worthy to dye.
Matthew,26,67,Then spat they in his face and boffeted him with fistes. And other smote him with the palme af their hondes
Matthew,26,68,on ye face sayinge: tell vs thou Christ who is he that smote the?
Matthew,26,69,Peter sate with out in the palice. And a damsell came to him sayinge: Thou also waste wt Iesus of Galilee:
Matthew,26,70,but he denyed before the all sayinge: I woot not what thou sayst.
Matthew,26,71,When he was goone out into the poorche another wenche sawe him and sayde vnto them that were there: This felowe was also with Iesus of Nazareth.
Matthew,26,72,And agayne he denyed with an oothe that he knew the man.
Matthew,26,73,And after a whyle came vnto him they yt stode bye and sayde vnto Peter: suerly thou arte even one of the for thy speache bewreyeth ye.
Matthew,26,74,Then beganne he to course and to sweare that he knewe not the man. And immedyatly the cocke krewe.
Matthew,26,75,And Peter remembred the wordes of Iesu which sayde vnto him: before the cocke crowe thou shalt deny me thryse: and went out at the dores and wepte bitterly.
Matthew,27,1,When the mornynge was come all ye chefe prestes and the elders of ye people helde a counsayle agenst Iesu to put him to deeth
Matthew,27,2,and brought him bounde and delivered him vnto Poncius Pilate the debite.
Matthew,27,3,Then when Iudas which betrayed him sawe that he was condempned he repented him sylfe and brought ageyne the .xxx. plattes of sylver to ye chefe prestes and elders
Matthew,27,4,sayinge: I have synned betrayinge the innocent bloud. And they sayde: what is that to vs? Se thou to that.
Matthew,27,5,And he cast doune the sylver plattes in the temple and departed and went and hounge him sylfe.
Matthew,27,6,And the chefe prestes toke the sylver plattes and sayd: it is not lawfull for to put them in to the treasury because it is the pryce of bloud.
Matthew,27,7,And they toke counsell and bought with them a potters felde to bury strangers in.
Matthew,27,8,Wherfore that felde is called the felde of bloud vntyll this daye.
Matthew,27,9,Then was fulfylled that which was spoken by Ieremy the Prophet sayinge: and they toke .xxx. sylver plattes the prise of him that was valued whom they bought of the chyldren of Israel
Matthew,27,10,and they gave them for the potters felde as the Lorde appoynted me.

Matthew,27,12,and when he was accused of ye chefe prestes and elders he answered nothinge.
Matthew,27,13,Then sayd Pilate vnto him: hearest thou not how many thinges they laye ageynste ye?
Matthew,27,14,And he answered him to never a worde: in so moche that the debite marveylled greatlie.
Matthew,27,15,At that feest the debite was wonte to deliver vnto ye people a presoner whom they wolde desyer.
Matthew,27,16,He had then a notable presoner called Barrabas.
Matthew,27,17,And when they were gadered together Pilate sayde vnto the: whether wyll ye that I geve losse vnto you Barrabas or Iesus which is called Christ?
Matthew,27,18,For he knewe well that for envie they had delivred him.
Matthew,27,19,When he was set doune to geve iudgemet his wyfe sent to him sayinge: have thou nothinge to do with that iuste man. For I have suffered many thinges this daye in a dreame about him.
Matthew,27,20,But the chefe preestes and the elders had parswaded the people that they shulde axe Barrabas and shulde destroye Iesus.
Matthew,27,21,Then the debite answered and sayde vnto them: whether of the twayne wyll ye that I let loosse vnto you? And they sayde Barrabas.
Matthew,27,22,Pilate sayde vnto them: what shall I do then with Iesus which is called Christ? They all sayde to him: let him be crucified.
Matthew,27,23,Then sayde the debite: what evyll hath he done? And they cryed the more sayinge: let him be crucified.
Matthew,27,24,When Pilate sawe that he prevayled nothinge but that moare busines was made he toke water and wasshed his hondes before ye people sayinge: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuste person and that ye shall se.
Matthew,27,25,Then answered all the people and sayde: his bloud be on vs and on oure chyldren.
Matthew,27,26,Then let he Barrabas loose vnto them and scourged Iesus and delivered him to be crucified.
Matthew,27,27,Then the soudeours of the debite toke Iesus vnto the comen hall and gaddered vnto him all the company.
Matthew,27,28,And they stripped him and put on him a purpyll roobe

Mark,3,23,And he called them vnto him and sayde vnto them in similitudes. How can Satan drive out Satan?
Mark,3,24,For yf a realme be devided ageynste it silfe that realme cannot endure.
Mark,3,25,Or yf a housse be devided agaynste it silfe that housse cannot continue:
Mark,3,26,So yf Sata make insurreccion agaynste himsilfe and be devided he cannot continue but is at an ende.

Mark,4,3,Herken to. Beholde There wet out a sower to sowe.
Mark,4,4,And it fortuned as he sowed that some fell by the waye syde and the fowles of the ayre came and devoured it vp.
Mark,4,5,Some fell on stony grounde where it had not moche erth: and by and by sprange vp because it had not deepth of erth:
Mark,4,6,but as sone as the sunne was vp it caught heet and because it had not rotynge wyddred awaye.
Mark,4,7,And some fell amonge the thornes and the thornes grewe vp and choked it so that it gave no frute.
Mark,4,8,And some fell vpon good grounde and dyd yelde frute that sproge and grewe and brought forthe: some thirty folde some sixtie folde and some an hundred folde.

Mark,4,11,And he sayde vnto the. To you it is geve to knowe the mistery of the kyngdome of God. But vnto them that are wt out shall all thinges be done in similitudes:
Mark,4,12,yt when they se they shall se and not discerne: and when they heare they shall heare and not vnderstonde: leste at any tyme they shulde tourne and their synnes shuld be forgeve the.
Mark,4,13,And he sayde vnto the: Perceave ye not this similitude? how then shulde ye vnderstonde all other similitudes?
Mark,4,14,The sower soweth ye worde.
Mark,4,15,And they that are by the wayes syde where the worde is sowen are they to whom assone as they have herde it Satha cometh immediatly and takith awaye the worde that was sowe in their hertes.
Mark,4,16,And likewise they that are sowen on the stonye groude are they: which when they have harde the worde at once receave it wt gladnes
Mark,4,17,yet have no rotes in them selves and so endure but a tyme: and anone as trouble and persecucion aryseth for ye wordes sake they fall immediatly.
Mark,4,18,And they that are sowe amoge the thornes are soche as heare ye worde:
Mark,4,19,and ye care of this worlde and ye disseytfulnes of ryches and the lustes of other thinges entre in and choocke ye worde and it is made vnfrutfull.
Mark,4,20,And those that weare sowe in good grounde are they that heare the worde and receave it and bringe forth frute some thirty folde some sixty folde some an hundred folde.
Mark,4,21,And he sayde vnto them: is ye candle lighted to be put vnder a busshell or vnder ye table and not rather to be put on a cadelstick?
Mark,4,22,For there is nothinge so prevy that shall not be opened: nether so secreet but that it shall come abroade.
Mark,4,23,Yf eny man have eares to heare let him heare.
Mark,4,24,And he sayde vnto them: take hede what ye heare. With what measure ye mete with the same shall it be measured vnto you agayne. And vnto you that heare shall more be geve.
Mark,4,25,For vnto him yt hath shall it be geven: and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath.
Mark,4,26,And he sayde: so is the kyngdome of God even as yf a man shuld sowe seed in ye groude
Mark,4,27,and shulde slepe and ryse vp night and daye: and the seede shuld springe and growe vp he not ware.
Mark,4,28,For ye erth bringeth forthe frute of her silfe: fyrst the blade then the eares after that full corne in the eares.
Mark,4,29,And as sone as the frute is brought forth anone he throusteth in ye sykell because the hervest is come.
Mark,4,30,And he sayde: where vnto shall we lyke the kyngdome of God? or with what copareson shall we copare it?
Mark,4,31,It is lyke a grayne of mustard seed which when it is sowe in the erth is the leest of all seedes that be in the erth:
Mark,4,32,but after that it is sowen it groweth vp and is greatest of all yerbes: and bereth greate brauches so that ye fowles of the ayre maye dwell vnder the shadowe of it.

Mark,4,37,And ther arose a great storme of wynde and dasshed ye waves into the ship so that it was full.
Mark,4,38,And he was in the sterne a slepe on a pelowe. And they awoke him and sayde to him: Master carest thou not yt we perisshe?
Mark,4,39,And he rose vp and rebuked the wynde and sayde vnto the see: peace and be still. And the winde alayed and ther folowed a greate calme.
Mark,4,40,And he sayde vnto them: why are ye so fearfull? How is it that ye have no fayth?
Mark,4,41,And they feared excedingly and sayde one to another: what felowe is this? For booth winde and see obey him.
Mark,5,1,And they cam over to the other syde of ye see in to the coutre of ye Gaderenites.
Mark,5,2,And when he was come out of ye shippe there met him out of the graves a man possessyd of an vncleane sprete
Mark,5,3,which had his abydinge amoge the graves. And no man coulde bynde him: no not with cheynes
Mark,5,4,because that when he was often bounde wt fetters and cheynes he plucked ye chaynes asundre and brake the fetters in peaces. Nether coulde eny man tame him.
Mark,5,5,And alwayes bothe nyght and daye he cryed in ye moutaynes and in ye graves and bet himsilfe wt stones.

Mark,5,18,And when he was come in to the shyppe he that had ye devyll prayed him that he myght be with him.
Mark,5,19,Howbeit Iesus wolde not suffre him but sayde vnto him: goo home in to thyne awne housse and to thy frendes and shewe the what great thinges ye Lorde hath done vnto the and how he had copassion on the.
Mark,5,20,And he departed and begane to publisshe in ye ten cyties what greate thinges Iesus had done vnto him and all me dyd merveyle.
Mark,5,21,And when Iesus was come over agayne by shyp vnto the other syde moche people gadered vnto him and he was nye vnto the see.

Mark,5,29,And streyght waye her foutayne of bloude was dryed vp aud she felt in her body that she was healed of the plage.

Mark,5,42,And streyght the mayden arose and went on her fete. For she was of the age of twelve yeres. And they were astonied at it out of measure.
Mark,5,43,And he charged the straytely that no man shuld knowe of it and comaunded to geve her meate.
Mark,6,1,And he departed thence and cam into his awne countre and his disciples folowed him.
Mark,6,2,And whe the saboth daye was come he beganne to teache in ye synagsge. And many that hearde him were astonyed and sayde: From whens hath he these thinges? and what wysdo is this that is geve vnto him? and suche vertues yt are wrought by his hondes?
Mark,6,3,Is not this that carpeter Maryes sonne ye brother of Iames and Ioses and of Iuda and Simon? and are not his systers here with vs? And they were offended by him.
Mark,6,4,And Iesus sayde vnto the: a prophet is not despysed but in his awne coutre and amonge his awne kynne and amonge the that are of the same housholde.

Mark,6,12,And they went out and preached that they shuld repent:
Mark,6,13,and they caste out many devylles. And they annoynted many that were sicke with oyle and healed them.
Mark,6,14,And kynge Herode herde of him (for his name was spreed abroade) and sayd: Iohn Baptiste is rysen agayne from deeth and therfore miracles are wrought by him.
Mark,6,15,Wother sayd it is Helyas: and some sayde: it is a Prophet or as one of ye Prophetes.
Mark,6,16,But when Herode hearde of him he sayd: it is Iohn whom I beheded he is rysen from deeth agayne.
Mark,6,17,For Herode him sylfe had sent forth and had taken Iohn and bounde him and cast him into preson for Herodias sake which was his brother Philippes wyfe. For he had maried her.
Mark,6,18,Iohn sayd vnto Herode: It is not laufull for the to have thy brothers wyfe.
Mark,6,19,Herodias layd wayte for him and wolde have killed him but she coulde not.
Mark,6,20,For Herode feared Iohn knowynge yt he was a iuste man and an holy: and gave him reverence: and when he hearde him he dyd many thinges and hearde him gladly.
Mark,6,21,But when a couenient daye was come: Herode on his birth daye made a supper to ye lordes captayns and chefe estates of Galile.
Mark,6,22,And ye doughter of ye sayde Herodias came in and daused and pleased Herode and them that sate at bourde also. Then ye kynge sayd vnto ye mayden: axe of me what thou wilt and I will geve it ye

Mark,6,26,And ye kynge was sory: howbe it for his othes sake and for their sakes which sate at supper also he wolde not put her besyde her purpose.
Mark,6,27,And immediatly ye kynge sent ye hangma and comaunded his heed to be brought in. And he went and beheeded him in the preson
Mark,6,28,and brought his heed in a charger and gave it to the mayden and the mayden gave it to her mother.
Mark,6,29,And when his disciples hearde of it they came and toke vp his body and put it in a toumbe.
Mark,6,30,And the apostels gaddered them selves to ggedre to Iesus and tolde him all thinges booth what they had done and what they had taught.
Mark,6,31,And he sayd vnto them: come ye aparte into the wyldernes and rest awhyle. For there were many comers and goers that they had no leasure so moche as to eate.
Mark,6,32,And he wet by ship out of the waye into a deserte place.
Mark,6,33,But the people spyed them when they departed: and many knewe him and ranne afote thyther out of all cities and cam thyther before them and came togedder vnto him.
Mark,6,34,And Iesus went out and sawe moche people and had compassion on them because they were lyke shepe which had no shepeherde. And he beganne to teache them many thinges.
Mark,6,35,And when ye daye was nowe farre spet his disciples came vnto him sayinge: this is a desert place and now the daye is farre passed
Mark,6,36,let the departe that they maye goo into the countrey rounde about and into the tounes and bye the breed: for they have nothinge to eate.
Mark,6,37,He answered and sayde vnto them: geve ye the to eate. And they sayde vnto him: shall we goo and bye ii.C. penyworth of breed and geve the to eate?
Mark,6,38,He sayde vnto the: how many loves have ye? Goo and loke. And when they had serched they sayde: v. and .ii. fysshes.
Mark,6,39,And he comaunded them to make them all syt doune by companyes apon the grene grasse.
Mark,6,40,And they sate doune here a rowe and there arowe by houndredes and by fyfties.
Mark,6,41,And he toke ye .v. loves and ye ii. fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake the loves and gave them to his disciples to put before the: and the .ii. fysshes he devyded amonge them all.
Mark,6,42,And they all dyd eate and were satisfied.
Mark,6,43,And they toke vp twelve baskettesfull of the gobbettes and of ye fysshes.
Mark,6,44,And they that ate were about fyve thousand men.
Mark,6,45,And streyght waye he caused his disciples to goo into the shipe and to goo over the water before vnto Bethsaida whyll he sent awaye the people.
Mark,6,46,And assone as he had sent them away he departed into a moutayne to praye.
Mark,6,47,And when even was come the ship was in the middes of the see and he alone on the londe
Mark,6,48,and he sawe the troubled in rowynge for the wynde was cotrary vnto them. And aboute ye fourth quartre of ye nyght he came vnto the walkinge apon the see and wolde have passed by the.
Mark,6,49,When they sawe him walkinge apon the see they supposed it had bene a sprete and cryed oute:
Mark,6,50,For they all sawe him and were afrayed. And anon he talked with them and sayde vnto them: be of good chere it is I be not afrayed.
Mark,6,51,And he went vp vnto them into the shippe and the wynde ceased and they were sore amased in them selves beyonde measure and marveyled.
Mark,6,52,For they remembred not of the loves because their hertes were blynded.
Mark,6,53,And they came over and went into the londe of Genezareth and drue vp into the haven.
Mark,6,54,And assone as they were come out of ye shippe streyght they knewe him
Mark,6,55,and ran forth throughout all ye region rounde about and began to cary aboute in beeddes all yt were sicke to the place where they heard tell yt he was.
Mark,6,56,And whyther soever he entred into tounes cities or villages they layde their sicke in the stretes and prayed him that they myght touche and it were but the edge of his vesture. And as many as touched him were safe.
Mark,7,1,And ye pharises came togedder vnto him and dyvers of ye scribes which came from Ierusalem.
Mark,7,2,And whe they sawe certayne of his disciples eate breed wt comen hondes (that is to saye wt vnwesshen hondes) they coplayned.
Mark,7,3,For the pharises and all the Iewes excepte they washe their hondes ofte eate not observinge the tradicions of the elders.
Mark,7,4,And whe they come from the market except they washe they eate not. And many other thinges ther be which they have taken apon them to observe as the wasshinge of cuppes and cruses and of brasen vessels and of tables.
Mark,7,5,Then axed him the pharises and sribes why walke not thy disciples accordinge to ye tradicions of the elders but eate breede with vnweshen hondes?
Mark,7,6,He answered and sayde vnto them: well prophesied Esaias of you ypocrites as it is writte: This people honoreth me with their lyppes but their hert is farre from me:
Mark,7,7,In vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctryns which are nothinge but ye comaundementes of men.
Mark,7,8,For ye laye the commaundement of God aparte and observe the tradicions of men as the wesshinge of cruses and of cuppes and many other suche lyke thinges ye do.
Mark,7,9,And he sayde vnto them: well ye cast asyde the comaundement of God to mayntayne youre owne tradicios.
Mark,7,10,For Moses sayde: Honoure thy father and thy mother: and whosoever cursseth father or mother let him dye for it.
Mark,7,11,But ye saye: a man shall saye to father or mother Corban: which is: that thou desyrest of me to helpe the with is geven God.
Mark,7,12,And so ye soffre him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
Mark,7,13,makinge the worde of God of none effecte through youre awne tradicions which ye have ordeyned. And many soche thinges ye do.
Mark,7,14,And he called all the people vnto him and sayde vnto them: Herken vnto me every one of you and vnderstonde.
Mark,7,15,There is no thinge with out a man that can defyle him when it entreth into him: but thoo thinges which procede out of him are those which defyle ye man.
Mark,7,16,If eny man have eares to heare let him heare
Mark,7,17,And whe he came to house awaye fro the people his disciples axed him of the similitude.
Mark,7,18,And he sayd vnto the: Are ye so without vnderstondinge? Do ye not yet perceave yt whatsoever thinge from wt out entreth into a man it can not defyle him
Mark,7,19,because it entrith not in to his hert but into ye belly: and goeth out into the draught that porgeth oute all meates.
Mark,7,20,And he sayde: yt defileth a ma which cometh oute of a man.
Mark,7,21,For fro wt in even oute of the herte of men proceade evill thoughtes: advantry fornicacion murder
Mark,7,22,theeft coveteousnes wickednes diceyte vnclennes and a wicked eye blasphemy pryde folysshnes:
Mark,7,23,all these evyll thinges come from with in and defile a man.
Mark,7,24,And from thence he rose and went into ye borders of Tyre and Sidon and entred into an housse and wolde that no man shnld have knowen: But he coulde not be hyd.
Mark,7,25,For a certayne woma whose doughter had a foule sprete hearde of him and came and fell at his fete.
Mark,7,26,The woman was a Greke oute of Syrophenicia and she besought him yt he wolde caste out ye devyll oute of her doughter.
Mark,7,27,And Iesus sayde vnto her: let the chyldren fyrst be feed. For it is not mete to take the chyldres breed and to caste it vnto whelppes.
Mark,7,28,She answered and sayde vnto him: even soo master neverthelesse the whelppes also eate vnder the table of the chyldrens cromes.
Mark,7,29,And he sayde vnto her: for this sayinge goo thy waye the devyll is gone out of thy doughter.
Mark,7,30,And when she was come home to her housse she founde the devyll departed and her doughter lyinge on the beed.
Mark,7,31,And he departed agayne from the coostes of Tyre and Sidon and came vnto the see of Galile thorowe ye middes of the coostos of ye .x. cities.
Mark,7,32,And they brought vnto him one yt was deffe and stambred in his speche and prayde him to laye his honde apon him.
Mark,7,33,And he toke him asyde from ye people and put his fyngers in his eares and dyd spyt and touched his tounge
Mark,7,34,and loked vp to heven and sygthed and sayde vnto him: ephatha that is to saye be openned.
Mark,7,35,And streyght waye his eares were openned and the stringe of his tounge was loosed and he spake playne.
Mark,7,36,And he comaunded them that they shuld tell no man. But the more he forbad them soo moche the more a greate deale they publesshed it:
Mark,7,37,and were beyonde measure astonyed sayinge: He hath done all thinges well and hath made booth the deffe to heare and the dome to speake.
Mark,8,1,In those dayes whe ther was a very greate companye and had nothinge to eate Iesus called his disciples to him and sayd vnto the:
Mark,8,2,I have copassion on this people because they have nowe bene with me .iii. dayes and have nothinge to eate:
Mark,8,3,And yf I shuld sende the awaye fastinge to their awne houses they shulde faynt by the waye. For dyvers of the came from farre.
Mark,8,4,And his disciples answered him: where shuld a man have breade here in the wildernes to satisfie these?
Mark,8,5,And he axed them: how many loves have ye? They sayde: seven.
Mark,8,6,And he commaunded the people to syt doune on the grounde. And he toke the .vii. loves gave thankes brake and gave to his disciples to set before them. And they dyd set the before the people.
Mark,8,7,And they had a feawe smale fysshes. And he blessed them and comaunded them also to be set before them.
Mark,8,8,And they ate and were suffysed: And they toke vp yf the broken meate that was lefte .vii. baskettes full.
Mark,8,9,And they yt ate were in nomber aboute fowre thousand. And he sent them awaye.
Mark,8,10,And a none he entred into a ship wt his disciples and came into the parties of Dalmanutha.
Mark,8,11,And the pharises cam forth and begane to dispute with him sekinge of him a signe fro heven and temptinge him.
Mark,8,12,And he sygthed in his sprete and sayde: why doth this generacion seke a signe? Verely I saye vnto you ther shall no signe be geven vnto this generacion.
Mark,8,13,And he lefte the and went into the ship agayne and departed over the water.
Mark,8,14,And they had forgotte to take breed wt the nether had they in the ship with them more then one loofe.
Mark,8,15,And he charged the sayinge. Take hede and beware of ye leven of ye pharises and of ye leve of Herode.
Mark,8,16,And they reasoned amonge the selves sayinge: we have no breed
Mark,8,17,And whe Iesus knewe yt he sayde vnto the: why take ye thought because ye have no bread? perceave ye not yet nether vnderstonde? Have ye youre hertes yet blynded?
Mark,8,18,Have ye eyes and se not? and have ye eares and heare not? Do ye not remember?
Mark,8,19,When I brake v. loves amonge .v.M. How many baskettes full of broke meate toke ye vp? They sayde vnto him twelve.
Mark,8,20,When I brake .vii. amonge .iiii. M. How many basketes of the levinges of broken meate toke ye vp? they sayde .vii.
Mark,8,21,And he sayde vnto the: how is it yt ye vnderstonde not?
Mark,8,22,And he came to Bethsaida and they brought a blynde man vnto him and desyred him to touche him.
Mark,8,23,And he caught the blynde by the honde and leade him out of the toune and spat in his eyes and put his hondes apon him and axed him whether he saw ought.
Mark,8,24,And he loked vp and sayde: I se ye men: For I se the walke as they were trees.
Mark,8,25,After that he put his hondes agayne apon his eyes and made him see. And he was restored to his sight and sawe every ma clerly.
Mark,8,26,And he sent him home to his housse sayinge: nether goo into the toune nor tell it to eny in the toune.
Mark,8,27,And Iesus went out and his disciples into the tounes that longe to the cite called Cesarea Philippi. Aud by the waye he axed his disciples sayinge: whom do men saye yt I am?
Mark,8,28,And they answered: some saye that thou arte Iohn Baptiste: some saye Helyas: and some one of the Prophetes.
Mark,8,29,And he sayde vnto the: But whom saye ye that I am? Peter answered and sayd vnto him: Thou arte very Christe.
Mark,8,30,And he charged them that they shuld tell no man of it.
Mark,8,31,And he beganne to teache them how that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and shuld be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be kylled and after thre dayes aryse agayne.
Mark,8,32,And he spake that sayinge openly. And Peter toke him asyde and began to chyde him.
Mark,8,33,Then he tourned aboute and looked on his disciples and rebuked Peter sayinge: Goo after me Satan. For thou saverest not ye thinges of God but the thinges of men.
Mark,8,34,And he called the people vnto him with his disciples also and sayd vnto them: Whosoever will folowe me let him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me.
Mark,8,35,For whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it But whosoever shall lose his lyfe for my sake and ye gospels ye same shall save it.
Mark,8,36,What shall it profet a ma yf he shuld wynne all ye worlde and loose his awne soule?
Mark,8,37,or els what shall a ma geve to redeme his soule agayne?
Mark,8,38,Whosoever therfore shall be asshamed of me and of my wordes amonge this advoutrous and sinfull generacion: of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father wt the holy angels.
Mark,9,1,And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you: There be some of the that stonde here which shall not taste of deeth tyll they have sene the kyngdome of God come wt power.
Mark,9,2,And after .vi. dayes Iesus toke Peter Iames and Iohn and leede them vp into an hye mountayne out of ye waye alone and he was transfigured before them.

Mark,9,5,And Peter answered and sayde to Iesu: Master here is good beinge for vs let vs make .iii. tabernacles one for the one for Moses and one for Helyas.
Mark,9,6,And yet he wist not what he sayde: for they were afrayde.
Mark,9,7,And ther was a cloude that shaddowed the. And a voyce came out of the cloude sayinge: This is my dere sonne here him.
Mark,9,8,And sodenly they loked rounde aboute them and sawe no man more then Iesus only wt the.
Mark,9,9,And as they came doune from the hyll he charged the that they shuld tell no ma what they had sene tyll the sonne of man were rysen fro deeth agayne.
Mark,9,10,And they kepte that sayinge with them and demaunded one of a nother what yt rysinge from deeth agayne shuld meane?
Mark,9,11,And they axed him sayinge: why then saye ye scribe that Helyas muste fyrste come?
Mark,9,12,He answered and sayde vnto them: Helyas verelye shall fyrst come and restore all thinges. And also ye sonne of ma as it is wrytte shall suffre many thinges and shall be set at nought.
Mark,9,13,Moreouer I saye vnto you that Helyas is come and they have done vnto him whatsoever pleased them as it is wrytten of him.
Mark,9,14,And he came to his disciples and sawe moche people aboute them and the scribes disputinge with them.
Mark,9,15,And streyght waye all the people when they behelde him were amased and ran to him and saluted him.
Mark,9,16,And he sayde vnto the Scribes: what dispute ye with them?
Mark,9,17,And one of the copanye answered and sayde: Master I have brought my sonne vnto the which hath a dome spirite.
Mark,9,18,And whensoever he taketh him he teareth him and he fometh and gnassheth with his tethe and pyneth awaye. And I spake to thy disciples that they shuld caste him out and they coulde not.
Mark,9,19,He answered him and sayd: O generacion wt out faith how longe shall I be with you? How longe shall I suffre you? Bringe him vnto me.
Mark,9,20,And they brought him vnto him. And assone as ye sprete sawe him he tare him. And he fell doune on the grounde walowinge and fomynge.
Mark,9,21,And he axed his father: how longe is it a goo sens this hath happened him? And he sayde of a chylde:
Mark,9,22,and ofte tymes casteth him into the fyre and also into the water to destroye him. But yf thou canste do eny thinge have mercy on vs and helpe vs.
Mark,9,23,And Iesus sayde vnto him: ye yf thou couldest beleve all thinges are possible to him yt belevith.
Mark,9,24,And streygth waye the father of the chylde cryed with teares sayinge: Lorde I beleve helpe myne vnbelefe.
Mark,9,25,When Iesus sawe that the people came runnynge togedder vnto him he rebuked the foule sprete sayinge vnto him: Thou domme and deffe sprete I charge the come out of him and entre no more into him.
Mark,9,26,And the sprete cryed and rent him sore and came out: And he was as one that had bene deed in so moche yt many sayde he is deed.
Mark,9,27,But Iesus caught his honde and lyfte him vp: and he roose.
Mark,9,28,And when he was come into the housse his disciples axed him secretly: why coulde not we caste him out?
Mark,9,29,And he sayde vnto them: this kynde can by no nother meanes come forth but by prayer and fastynge.
Mark,9,30,And they departed thens and toke their iorney thorow Galile and he wolde not that eny man shuld have knowen it.
Mark,9,31,For he taught his disciples and sayde vnto them: The sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of men and they shall kyll him and after that he is kylled he shall aryse agayne the thryd daye.
Mark,9,32,But they wiste not what that sayinge meat and were affrayed to axe him.
Mark,9,33,And he came to Capernaum. And when he was come to housse he axed the: what was it that ye disputed bytwene you by the waye?
Mark,9,34,And they helde their peace: for by the waye they reasoned amonge the selves who shuld be the chefest.
Mark,9,35,And he sate doune and called the twelve vnto him and sayd to them: yf eny man desyre to be fyrst the same shalbe last of all and servaunt vnto all.
Mark,9,36,And he toke a chylde and set him in ye middes of them and toke him in his armes and sayde vnto them.
Mark,9,37,Whosoever receave eny soche a chylde in my name receaveth me. And whosoever receaveth me receaveth not me but him that sent me.
Mark,9,38,Iohn answered him sayinge: Master we sawe one castynge out devyls in thy name which foloweth not vs and we forbade him because he foloweth vs not.
Mark,9,39,But Iesus sayde forbid him not. For ther is no ma that shall do a miracle in my name that can lightlyge speake evyll of me.
Mark,9,40,Whosoever is not agaynste you is on youre parte.
Mark,9,41,And whosoever shall geve you a cuppe of water to drinke for my names sake because ye belonge to Christe verely I saye vnto you he shall not loose his rewarde.
Mark,9,42,And whosoever shall offende one of these lytelons yt beleve in me it were better for him yt a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and yt he he were cast into ye see:
Mark,9,43,wherfore yf thy hande offende ye cut him of. It is better for ye to entre into lyffe maymed then havynge two hondes goo into hell into fire yt never shalbe quenched
Mark,9,44,where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.
Mark,9,45,Lykewyse yf thy fote offende the cut him of. For it is better for the to goo halt into lyfe then havynge two fete to be cast into hell into fyre that never shalbe quenched:
Mark,9,46,where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.
Mark,9,47,Even so yf thyne eye offende the plucke him oute. It is better for the to goo into the kyngdom of god with one eye then havynge two eyes to be caste into hell fyre:
Mark,9,48,where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.
Mark,9,49,Every man therfore shalbe salted wt fyre: And every sacrifise shalbe seasoned with salt.
Mark,9,50,Salt is good. But yf ye salt be vnsavery: what shall ye salte therwith? Se yt ye have salt in youre selves: and have peace amonge youre selves one with another.
Mark,10,1,And he rose from thence and went into ye coostes of Iurie through the region yt is beyonde Iordan. And ye people resorted vnto him afresshe: and as he was wont he taught them agayne.
Mark,10,2,And the pharises came and axed him a question: whether it were laufull for a ma to put awaye his wyfe: to prove him.
Mark,10,3,And he answered and sayd vnto the: what dyd Moses byd you do?
Mark,10,4,And they sayde: Moses suffred to wryte a testimoniall of devorsement and to put hyr awaye.
Mark,10,5,And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the: For ye hardnes of youre hertes he wrote this precept vnto you.
Mark,10,6,But at the fyrste creacion God made the man and woman.
Mark,10,7,And for this thinges sake shall ma leve his father and mother and bide by his wyfe
Mark,10,8,and they twayne shalbe one flesshe. So then are they now not twayne but one flesshe.
Mark,10,9,Therfore what God hath cuppled let not ma separat.
Mark,10,10,And in the housse his disciples axed him agayne of yt matter.
Mark,10,11,And he sayde vnto them: Whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke to her warde.
Mark,10,12,And yf a woman forsake her husband and be maryed to another she comitteth advoutrie.
Mark,10,13,And they brought chyldren to him that he should touche the. And his disciples rebuked thoose that brought the.
Mark,10,14,When Iesus sawe that he was displeased and sayd to the: Suffre the chyldre to come vnto me and forbid the not. For of suche is ye kyngdome of God.
Mark,10,15,Verely I saye vnto you whosoever shall not receave ye kyngdome of God as a chylde he shall not entre therin.
Mark,10,16,And he toke the vp in his armes and put his hondes vpon them and blessed the.
Mark,10,17,And when he was come in to the waye ther came one runninge and kneled to him and axed him: good master what shall I do that I maye enheret eternall lyfe?
Mark,10,18,Iesus sayde to him: why callest thou me good? There is no ma good but one which is God.
Mark,10,19,Thou knowest the comaundementes: breake not matrimony: kyll not: steale not: bere not falce wytnes: defraude no man: honoure thy father and mother.
Mark,10,20,He answered and sayde to him: master all these I have observed fro my youth.
Mark,10,21,Iesus behelde him and had a favour to him and sayde vnto him: one thynge is lackinge vnto the. Goo and sell all that thou hast and geve to the povre and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me and take vp thy crosse.
Mark,10,22,But he was discuforted with yt sayinge and wet awaye morninge for he had greate possessions.
Mark,10,23,And Iesus loked rounde aboute and sayde vnto his disciples: what an harde thinge is it for them that have riches to entre into the kyngdome of God.
Mark,10,24,And his disciples were astonneyd at his wordes. But Iesus answered agayne and sayde vnto them: chyldre how harde is it for them that trust in riches to entre in to the kyngdome of God.
Mark,10,25,It is easyer for a camell to go thorowe ye eye of an nedle then for a riche man to entre into the kyngdome of God.
Mark,10,26,And they were astonnyed out of measure sayinge betwene them selves: who then can be saved?
Mark,10,27,Iesus loked vpon them and sayde: with men it is vnpossible but not with God: for with God all thynges are possible.
Mark,10,28,And Peter begane to saye vnto him: Lo we have forsaken all and have folowed the.
Mark,10,29,Iesus answered and sayde: Verely I saye vnto you ther is no man that forsaketh housse or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wyfe other chyldren or londes for my sake and the gospelles
Mark,10,30,which shall not receave an houndred foolde nowe in this lyfe: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and chyldren and londes with persecucions: and in the worlde to come eternall lyfe.
Mark,10,31,Many that are fyrst shalbe last: and the last fyrst.
Mark,10,32,And they were in ye waye goinge vp to Ierusalem. And Iesus wet before them: and they were amased and as they folowed were affrayde. And Iesus toke ye .xii. agayne and begane to tell the what thinges shuld happe vnto him.
Mark,10,33,Beholde we goo vp to Ierusalem and the sonne of man shalbe delyvered vnto the hye preestes and vnto the Scribes: and they shall condempne him to deeth and shall delyvre him to the gentyls:
Mark,10,34,and they shall mocke hym and scourge him and spit vpo hym and kyll him. And the thirde daye he shall ryse agayne.
Mark,10,35,And then Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede came vnto him sayinge: master we wolde that thou shuldest do for vs what soever we desyre.
Mark,10,36,He sayde vnto them: what wolde ye I shuld do vnto you?
Mark,10,37,They sayd to him: graut vnto vs that we maye sitte one on thy right honde and the other on thy lyfte honde in thy glory.
Mark,10,38,But Iesus sayd vnto the: Ye wot not what ye axe. Can ye dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised in ye baptime that I shalbe baptised in?
Mark,10,39,And they sayde vnto him: that we can. Iesus sayde vnto them: ye shall dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised with the baptyme that I shalbe baptised in:
Mark,10,40,but to sit on my right honde and on my lyfte honde ys not myne to geve but to them for whom it is prepared.
Mark,10,41,And when the .x. hearde that they bega to disdayne at Iames and Iohn.
Mark,10,42,But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde to them: ye knowe that they which seme to beare rule amonge the gentyls raygne as lordes over the. And they that be greate amoge them exercyse auctorite over them.
Mark,10,43,So shall it not be amonge you but whosoever of you wilbe greate amoge you shalbe youre minister.
Mark,10,44,And whosoever wilbe chefe shalbe servaunt vnto all.
Mark,10,45,For eve the sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto: but to minister and to geve his lyfe for the redempcion of many.
Mark,10,46,And they came to Hierico. And as he went oute of Hierico with his disciples and a greate nobre of people: Barthimeus ye sonne of Thimeus which was blinde sate by ye hye wayes syde begginge.
Mark,10,47,And when he hearde that it was Iesus of Nazareth he began to crye and to saye: Iesus the sonne of David have mercy on me.
Mark,10,48,And many rebuked him yt he shuld holde is peace. But he cryed the moore a greate deale thou sonne of David have mercy on me.
Mark,10,49,And Iesus stode still and commaunded hym to be called. And they called the blinde sayinge vnto him: Be of good conforte: ryse he calleth the.
Mark,10,50,And he threwe awaye his clooke and roose and came to Iesus.
Mark,10,51,And Iesus answered and sayde vnto hym: what wilt thou that I do vnto the? The blynde sayde vnto hym: master that I myght see.
Mark,10,52,Iesus sayde vnto him: goo thy waye thy faith hath saved the. And by and by he receaved his sight and folowed Iesus in the waye.
Mark,11,1,And when they came nye to Hierusalem vnto Bethphage and Bethanie besydes mout olivete he sent forth two of his hisciples
Mark,11,2,and sayde vnto the: Goo youre wayes into the toune that is over agaynst you. And assone as ye be entred into it ye shall fynde a coolte bounde wheron never man sate: loose him and bringe him.
Mark,11,3,And if eny man saye vnto you: why do ye soo? Saye that the Lorde hath neade of him: and streight waye he will sende him hidder.
Mark,11,4,And they wet their waye and foud a coolte tyed by the dore with out in a place where two wayes met and they losed him.
Mark,11,5,And divers of the that stode there sayde vnto the: what do ye loosinge ye coolte?
Mark,11,6,And they sayd vnto them eve as Iesus had comaunded the. And they let them goo.
Mark,11,7,And they brought ye coolte to Iesus and caste their garmetes on him: and he sate vpo him.
Mark,11,8,And many sprede there garmetes in the waye. Other cut doune brauches of the trees and strawed them in ye waye.
Mark,11,9,And they yt went before and they that folowed cryed sayinge: Hos anna: blessed be he that cometh in ye name of ye Lorde.
Mark,11,10,Blessed be ye kingdome that cometh in ye name of him yt is Lorde of oure father David. Hos anna in ye hyest.
Mark,11,11,And ye Lorde entred in to Ierusalem and into the teple. And when he had loked roudabout vpon all thinges and now ye eve tyde was come he went out vnto Bethany with ye twelve.
Mark,11,12,And on the morowe when they were come out fro Bethany he hungred
Mark,11,13,and spyed a fygge tree a farre of havinge leves and wet to se whether he myght finde eny thinge ther on. But when he came therto he foude no thinge but leves: for the tyme of fygges was not yet.
Mark,11,14,And Iesus answered and sayde to it: never man eate frute of the here after whill ye worlde stondith. And his disciples hearde it.
Mark,11,15,And they came to Ierusalem. And Iesus wet into the teple and begane to cast out ye sellers and byers in the teple and overthrewe the tables of the money chaungers and the stoles of them that solde doves:
Mark,11,16,and wolde not suffre that eny man caried a vessell thorow the temple.
Mark,11,17,And he taught sayinge vnto them is it not written: my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer vnto all nacions? But ye have made it a deen of theves.
Mark,11,18,And the Scribes and hye prestes hearde yt and sought howe to distroye him. For they feared him because all the people marveled at his doctrine.
Mark,11,19,And when eve was come he went out of the cite.
Mark,11,20,And in the mornynge as they passed by they sawe the fygge tree dryed vp by ye rotes.
Mark,11,21,And Peter remembred and sayde vnto him: master beholde the fygge tree which thou cursedest is widdred awaye.
Mark,11,22,And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Have confides in God.
Mark,11,23,Verely I saye vnto you that whosoever shall saye vnto this mountayne: take awaye thy silfe and cast thy silfe in to the see and shall not waver in his herte but shall beleve yt those thinges which he sayeth shall come to passe what soever he sayeth shalbe done to him.
Mark,11,24,Therfore I saye vnto you what soever ye desyre when ye praye beleve yt ye shall have it and it shalbe done vnto you.
Mark,11,25,And when ye stod and praye forgeve yf ye have eny thinge agaynste eny man yt youre father also which is in heve maye forgeve you youre trespases.
Mark,11,26,
Mark,11,27,And they came agayne to Hierusalem. And as he walked in the teple ther came to him ye hye prestes and the Scribes and the elders
Mark,11,28,and sayd vnto him: by what auctorite doest thou these thinges? and who gave the this auctorite to do these thinges?
Mark,11,29,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I will also axe of you a certayne thinge: and answere ye me and I wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
Mark,11,30,The baptyme of Iohn was it from heven or of men? Answer me.
Mark,11,31,And they thought in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heven: he will saye why then dyd ye not beleve him?
Mark,11,32,but if we shall saye of me: then feare we ye people. For all men counted Iohn that he was a verie Prophete.
Mark,11,33,And they answered and sayd vnto Iesu: we cannot tell. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: nether wyll I tell you by what auctorite I do these thynges.
Mark,12,1,And he beganne to speake vnto them in similitudes. A certayne man planted a vineyarde and copased it with an hedge and ordeyned a wyne presse and bylt a toure in yt. And let yt out to hyre vnto husbandme and went into a straunge countre.
Mark,12,2,And when the tyme was come he sent to the tennauntes a servaunt that he myght receave of the tenauntes of the frute of the vyneyarde.
Mark,12,3,And they caught him and bet him and sent him agayne emptye.
Mark,12,4,And moreoever he sent vnto them another servaunt and at him they cast stones and brake his heed and sent him agayne all to revyled.
Mark,12,5,And agayne he sent another and him they kylled: and many other beetynge some and kyllinge some.
Mark,12,6,Yet had he one sonne whom he loved tenderly him also he sent at the last vnto them sayinge: they wyll feare my sonne.
Mark,12,7,But the tenauntes sayde amongest them selves: this is the heyre: come let vs kyll hym and ye inheritauce shalbe oures.
Mark,12,8,And they toke him and kyllid him and cast him out of the vyneyarde.
Mark,12,9,What shall then the lorde of the vyneyarde do? He will come and destroye ye tenauntes and let out the vyneyarde to other.
Mark,12,10,Have ye not redde this scripture? The stoone which ye bylders dyd refuse is made ye chefe stoone in ye corner:
Mark,12,11,this was done of ye Lorde and is mervelous in oure eyes.
Mark,12,12,And they went about to take him but they feared the people. For they perceaved that he spake that similitude agaynst them. And they left him and went their waye.
Mark,12,13,And they sent vnto him certayne of ye Pharises with Herodes servantes to take him in his wordes.
Mark,12,14,And assone as they were come they sayd vnto him: master we knowe yt thou arte true and carest for no man: for thou consyderest not the degre of men but teachest the waye of God truly: Ys it laufull to paye tribute to Cesar or not?
Mark,12,15,Ought we to geve or ought we not to geve? He vnderstode their simulacion and sayde vnto them: Why tepte ye me? Brynge me a peny that I maye se yt.
Mark,12,16,And they brought. And he sayde vnto them: Whose ys thys ymage and superscripcion? And they sayde vnto him Cesars.
Mark,12,17,And Iesus answered and saide vnto the: Then geve to Cesar that which belongeth to Cesar: and to God that which perteyneth to God. And they mervelled at him.
Mark,12,18,Then came the Saduces vnto him which saye ther is no resurreccion. And they axed hym sayinge:
Mark,12,19,Master Moses wroote vnto vs yf eny mans brother dye and leve his wyfe behinde him and leve no chyldren: that then hys brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother.
Mark,12,20,Ther were seven brethren: and the fyrst toke a wyfe and when he dyed leeft no seed behynde him.
Mark,12,21,And the seconde toke hir and dyed: nether leeft eny seed. And the thyrde lyke wyse.
Mark,12,22,And seve had her and leeft no seed behynde them. Last of all the wyfe dyed also.
Mark,12,23,In the resurreccio then when they shall ryse agayne: whose wyfe shall she be of them? For seven had her to wyfe.
Mark,12,24,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Are ye not therfore deceaved and vnderstonde not the scryptures nether the power of God?
Mark,12,25,For when they shall ryse agayne fro deeth they nether mary nor are maryed: but are as the angels which are in heven.
Mark,12,26,As touchynge the deed that they shall ryse agayne: have ye not redde in the boke of Moses howe in the busshe God spake vnto him sayinge: I am the God of Abraham and God of Ysaac and the God of Iacob?
Mark,12,27,He is not the God of the deed but the God of the livynge. Ye are therfore greatly deceaved.
Mark,12,28,And ther came one of the scribes that had hearde them disputynge to gedder and perceaved that he had answered them well and axed him: Which is the fyrste of all the commaundemetes?
Mark,12,29,Iesus answered him: the fyrste of all the comaundementes is. Heare Israel: The Lorde God is one Lorde.
Mark,12,30,And thou shalt love the Lorde thy God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy mynde and with all thy strength. This is the fyrste commaundement.
Mark,12,31,And the seconde is lyke vnto this: Thou shalt love thy neghbour as thy silfe. Ther is none other commaundement greater then these.
Mark,12,32,And the Scribe sayde vnto him: well master thou hast sayd ye truthe that ther ys one God and that ther is none but he.
Mark,12,33,And to love him with all the herte and with all the mynde and with all the soule and with all the stregth: and to love a mans neghbour as him silfe ys a greater thinge then all burntofferings and sacrifices.
Mark,12,34,And when Iesus sawe that he answered discretly he sayde vnto him: Thou arte not farre from the kyngdome of God. And no man after that durst axe him eny questio.
Mark,12,35,And Iesus answered and sayde teachynge in the temple: how saye the Scribes yt Christ is the sonne of David?
Mark,12,36,for David him selfe inspyred with the holy goost sayde: The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
Mark,12,37,Then David hym silfe calleth him Lorde: and by what meanes is he then his sonne? And moche people hearde him gladly.
Mark,12,38,And he sayde vnto them in his doctrine: beware of the Scribes which love to goo in longe clothinge: and love salutacions in ye market places
Mark,12,39,and the chefe seates in the synagoges and to syt in the vppermost roumes at feastes
Mark,12,40,and devoure widowes houses and that vnder coloure of longe prayinge. These shall receave greater dampnacion.
Mark,12,41,And Iesus sat over agaynst the treasury and behelde how the people put money in to the treasury. And many that were ryche cast in moch.
Mark,12,42,And ther cam a certayne povre widowe and she threwe in two mytes which make a farthynge.
Mark,12,43,And he called vnto him his disciples and sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you that this pover widowe hath cast moare in then all they which have caste into the treasury.
Mark,12,44,For they all dyd cast in of their superfluyte: but she of her poverte dyd cast in all that she had eve all her livynge.
Mark,13,1,And as he went out of the teple one of his disciples sayde vnto him: Master se what stones and what byldynges are here.
Mark,13,2,And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Seist thou these greate byldinges? There shall not be leefte one stone vpon a another that shall not be throwen doune.
Mark,13,3,And as he sate on moute olivete over agest the teple Peter and Iames and Iohn and Andrew axed him secretly:
Mark,13,4,tell vs when shall these thinges be? And what is ye signe whe all these thinges shalbe fulfilled?
Mark,13,5,And Iesus answered the and bega to saye: take hede lest eny man deceave you.
Mark,13,6,For many shall come in my name sayinge: I am Christ and shall deceave many.
Mark,13,7,When ye shall heare of warre and tydinges of warre be ye not troubled. For soche thinges muste nedes be. But the ende is not yet.
Mark,13,8,For ther shall nacion aryse agaynste nacion and kyngdome agaynst kyngdome. And ther shalbe erth quakes in all quarters and famyshment and troubles. These are the begynnynge of sorowes.
Mark,13,9,But take ye hede to youre selves. For they shall bringe you vp to ye counsels and into ye synagoges and ye shalbe beaten: ye and shalbe brought before rulers and kynges for my sake for a testimoniall vnto them.
Mark,13,10,And the gospell must fyrste be publysshed amoge all nacions.
Mark,13,11,But when they leade you and present you toke noo thought afore honde what ye shall saye nether ymagion: but whatsoever is geve you at the same tyme that speake. For it shall not be ye that shall speake but ye holy goost.
Mark,13,12,Ye and the brother shall delyvre the brother to deeth and the father the sonne and the chyldre shall ryse agaynste their fathers and mothers and shall put them to deeth.
Mark,13,13,And ye shalbe hated of all men for my names sake. But whosoever shall endure vnto the ende the same shalbe safe.
Mark,13,14,Moreover whe ye se the abhominacio that betokeneth desolacion wherof is spoken by Daniel the Prophet stonde where it ought not let him that redeth vnderstonde. Then let them that be in Iurie fle to the mountaynes.
Mark,13,15,And let him that is on the housse toppe not descende doune into the housse nether entre therin to fetche eny thinge oute of his housse.
Mark,13,16,And let hym that is in the felde not tourne backe agayne vnto the thinges which he leeft behynde him for to take his cloothes with him.
Mark,13,17,Woo is then to them that are wt chylde and to them that geve soucke in thoose dayes.
Mark,13,18,But praye that youre flyght be not in the wynter.
Mark,13,19,For ther shalbe in those dayes suche tribulacion as was not from the begynninge of creatures which God created vnto this tyme nether shalbe.
Mark,13,20,And excepte yt the Lorde shuld shorten those dayes no ma shuld be saved. But for the electes sake which he hath chosen he hath shortened those dayes.
Mark,13,21,And then yf eny man saye to you: loo here is Christ: loo he is there beleve not.
Mark,13,22,For falce Christes shall aryse and falce Prophetes and shall shewe myracles and wondres to deceave yf it were possible evyn the electe.
Mark,13,23,But take ye hede: beholde I have shewed you all thinges before.
Mark,13,24,Moreover in thoose dayes after that tribulacio the sunne shall wexe darke and the mone shall not geve her light
Mark,13,25,and the starres of heven shall fall: and the powers wich are in heven shall move.
Mark,13,26,And then shall they se the sonne of man comynge in the cloudes with greate power and glory.
Mark,13,27,And then shall he sende his angels and shall gaddre to gedder his electe from the fower wyndes and from the one ende of the worlde to the other.
Mark,13,28,Learne a similitude of ye fygge tree. When his braunches are yet tender and hath brought forthe leves ye knowe that sommer is neare.
Mark,13,29,So in lyke maner when ye se these thinges come to passe: vnderstond that it ys nye even at the dores.
Mark,13,30,Verely I saye vnto you yt this generacion shall not passe tyll all these thinges be done.
Mark,13,31,Heven and erth shall passe but my wordes shall not passe.
Mark,13,32,But of the daye and the houre knoweth no ma: no not the angels which are in heven: nether the sonne him silfe save the father only.
Mark,13,33,Take hede watche and praye for ye knowe not when the tyme ys.
Mark,13,34,As a man which is gone in to a straunge countrey and hath lefte hys housse and geven auctorite to his servautes and to every man hys worke and commaunded the porter to watche.
Mark,13,35,Watche therfore for ye knowe not when the master of ye housse will come whether at eve or at mydnyght whether at the cocke crowynge or in the daunynge:
Mark,13,36,lest yf he come sodenly he shuld fynde you slepynge.
Mark,13,37,And that I saye vnto you I saye vnto all men watche.
Mark,14,1,After two dayes folowed ester and the dayes of swete breed. And the hye prestes and the Scrybes sought meanes how they myght take hym by crafte and put him to deeth.
Mark,14,2,But they sayde: not in the feast daye leest eny busynes aryse amonge the people.
Mark,14,3,When he was in Bethania in the housse of Simon the leper even as he sate at meate ther came a woma hauynge an alablaster boxe of oyntment called narde that was pure and costly: and she brake the boxe and powred it on is heed.
Mark,14,4,And ther were some that were not content in them selves and sayde: what neded this waste of oyntment?
Mark,14,5,For it myght have bene soolde for more then thre hundred pens and bene geve vnto the poore. And they grudged agaynste hir.
Mark,14,6,And Iesus sayde: let hir be in reest why trouble ye hir? She hath done a good worke on me.
Mark,14,7,For ye shall have poore with you all wayes: and when soever ye will ye maye do them good: but me ye shall not have alwayes.
Mark,14,8,She hath done that she coulde: she came a fore honde to anoynt my boddy to his buryinge warde.

Mark,14,16,And his disciples went forth and came to the cyte and founde as he had sayd vnto them: and made ready the ester lambe.
Mark,14,17,And at even he came with the .xii.
Mark,14,18,And as they sate at borde and ate Iesus sayde: Verely I saye vnto you: that one of you shall betraye me which eateth with me.
Mark,14,19,And they begane to morne and to saye to him one by one: ys it I? And a nother sayde: ys it I?
Mark,14,20,He answered and sayde vnto them: It ys one of the .xii. and the same deppeth with me in the platter.
Mark,14,21,The sonne of man goeth as it ys written of him: but woo be to that man by whome the sonne of man is betrayed. Good were it for him if that man had never bene borne.
Mark,14,22,And as they ate Iesus toke breede blessed and brake and gave to them and sayde: Take eate this ys my body.
Mark,14,23,And he toke the cup gave thankes and gave it to them and they all dranke of it.
Mark,14,24,And he sayde vnto them: This is my bloude of the new testament which is sheed for many.
Mark,14,25,Verely I saye vnto you: I will drinke no moore of this frute of the vyne vntyll that daye that I drinke it new in the kyngdome of God.
Mark,14,26,And when they had sayd grace they went out to mount Olyvete.
Mark,14,27,And Iesus sayde vnto them: All ye shalbe offended thorow me this nyght. For it is wrytte: I will smyte ye shepeherd and the shepe shalbe scattered.
Mark,14,28,But after that I am rysen agayne I will goo into Galile before you.
Mark,14,29,Peter sayde vnto him: And though all men shuld be offended yet wolde not I.
Mark,14,30,And Iesus sayd vnto him: Verely I saye vnto ye this daye even in this nyght before ye cocke crowe twyse thou shalt denye me thryse.
Mark,14,31,And he spake boldlyer: no yf I shulde dye wt the I will not deny the. Lyke wyse also sayd they all.
Mark,14,32,And they came into a place named Gethsemani. And he sayde to his disciples: Syt ye here whyll I goo aparte and praye.
Mark,14,33,And he toke with him Peter Iames and Iohn and he began to waxe abasshed and to be in an agonye
Mark,14,34,and sayde vnto the: My soule is very hevy even vnto the deeth tary here and watche.
Mark,14,35,And he went forth a lytle and fell doune on ye grounde and prayed: that yf it were possible the houre myght passe from him.
Mark,14,36,And he sayd: Abba father all thinges are possible vnto the take awaye this cup from me. Neverthelesse not that I will but that thou wilt be done.
Mark,14,37,And he cam and founde the slepinge and sayd to Peter: Simon slepest thou? Couldest not thou watche with me one houre?
Mark,14,38,watche ye and praye leest ye entre into temptacion: ye sprete is redy but ye flessh is weeke.
Mark,14,39,And agayne he went awaye and prayde and spake ye same wordes.
Mark,14,40,And he returned and founde them a slepe agayne for their eyes were hevy: nether wist they what to answere him.
Mark,14,41,And he cam the thyrde tyme and sayd vnto the: slepe hens forth and take youre ease it is ynough. The houre is come beholde ye sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of synners.
Mark,14,42,Ryse vp let vs goo. Loo he that betrayeth me is at hande.
Mark,14,43,And immediatly whyll he yet spake came Iudas one of the twelve and with him a greate nomber of people with sweardes and staves from the hye prestes and scribes and elders.
Mark,14,44,And he that betrayed him had geven them a generall toke sayinge: whosoever I do kisse he it is: take him and leade him awaye warely.
Mark,14,45,And assone as he was come he went streyght waye to him and sayd vnto him: master master and kissed him.
Mark,14,46,And they layde their hondes on him and toke him.
Mark,14,47,And one of them that stode by drue out a swearde and smote a servaunt of the hye preste and cut of his eare.
Mark,14,48,And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the: ye be come out as vnto a thefe wt sweardes and with staves for to take me.
Mark,14,49,I was dayly with you in ye temple teachinge and ye toke me not: but yt the scriptures shuld be fulfilled.
Mark,14,50,And they all forsoke him and ranne awaye.
Mark,14,51,And ther folowed him a certeyne yonge man cloothed in lynnen apon ye bare and the yongemen caught him
Mark,14,52,and he lefte his lynnen and fleed from them naked.
Mark,14,53,And they leed Iesus awaye to ye hyest preste of all and to him came all the hye prestes and the elders and the scribes.
Mark,14,54,And Peter folowed him a greate waye of even into the pallys of the hye preste and sat with the servauntes and warmed him sylfe at the fyre.
Mark,14,55,And the hye prestes and all ye counsell sought for witnes agaynste Iesu to put him to death and founde noone.
Mark,14,56,Yet many bare falce witnes agaynste him but their witnes aggreed not to geder.
Mark,14,57,And ther aroose certayne and brought falce witnes agaynste him sayinge.
Mark,14,58,We herde him saye: I will destroye this temple made with hondes and with in thre dayes I will bylde another made with out hondes.
Mark,14,59,But their witnes agreed not to geder.
Mark,14,60,And the hyeste preste stode up amongest them and axed Iesus sayinge: answerest thou nothinge? How is it that these beare witnes agaynst the?
Mark,14,61,And he helde his peace and answered noothinge. Agayne the hyeste Preste axed him and sayde vnto him: Arte thou Christ the sonne of the blessed?
Mark,14,62,And Iesus sayde: I am. And ye shall se the sonne of man syt on the ryght honde of power and come in the cloudes of heven.
Mark,14,63,Then the hyest preste rent his cloothes and sayd: what nede we eny further of witnes?
Mark,14,64,Ye have herde the blasphemy what thinke ye? And they all gave sentence yt he was worthy of deeth.
Mark,14,65,And some begane to spit at him and to cover his face and to bete him with fistes and to saye vnto him arede vnto vs. And the servauntes boffeted him on the face.
Mark,14,66,And as Peter was beneeth in ye pallys ther came one of ye weches of ye hyest preste:
Mark,14,67,and whe she saw Petre warmynge him sylfe she loked on him and sayd: wast not thou also wt Iesus of Nazareth?
Mark,14,68,And he denyed it sayinge: I knowe him not nether wot I what thou sayest. And he went out into ye poorche and the cocke crewe.
Mark,14,69,And a damsell sawe him and agayne beganne to saye to the that stode by this is one of the.
Mark,14,70,And he denyed it agayne. And anone after they that stode by sayde agayne to Peter: suerly thou arte one of the for thou arte of Galile and thy speache agreth therto.
Mark,14,71,And he beganne to cursse and to sweare sayinge: I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.
Mark,14,72,And agayne the cocke krewe and Peter remembred the worde that Iesus sayd vnto him: before the cocke crowe twyse thou shalt deny me thryse and beganne to wepe.
Mark,15,1,And anone in ye dawnynge the hye prestes helde counsell wt ye elders and ye scribes and ye whoole cogregacion and bounde Iesus and ledde him awaye and delivered him to Pilate.
Mark,15,2,And Pilate axed him: arte thou the kynge of the Iewes? And he answered and sayde vnto him: thou sayest it.
Mark,15,3,And the hye prestes accused him of many thinges.
Mark,15,4,Wherfore Pilate axed him agayne sayinge: Answerest thou nothinge? Beholde how many thinges they lay vnto thy charge.
Mark,15,5,Iesus yet answered never aworde so that Pilate merveled.
Mark,15,6,At that feast Pilate was wont to delivre at their pleasure a presoner: whomsoever they wolde desyre.
Mark,15,7,And ther was one named Barrabas which laye bounde with the that made insurreccion and in the insurreccion comitted murther.
Mark,15,8,And ye people called vnto him and began to desyre accordinge as he had ever done vnto them.
Mark,15,9,Pylate answered them and sayd: Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of the Iewes?
Mark,15,10,For he knewe that the hye Prestes had delyvered him of envy.
Mark,15,11,But the hye prestes had moved the people that he shuld rather delyvre Barrabas vnto them.
Mark,15,12,And Pylate answered agayne and sayd vnto the: What will ye then that I do wt him whom ye call ye kynge of ye Iewes?
Mark,15,13,And they cryed agayne: crucifie him.
Mark,15,14,Pylate sayde vnto them: What evell hath he done? And they cryed ye moore fervently: crucifie him.
Mark,15,15,And so Pylate willinge to content the people lowsed them Barrabas and delyvered Iesus when he had scourged him for to be crucified.
Mark,15,16,And the souddeers ledde him awaye into ye commen hall and called togedder the whoole multitude
Mark,15,17,and they clothed him with purple and they platted a croune of thornes and crouned him with all
Mark,15,18,and beganne to salute him. Hayle kynge of the Iewes.
Mark,15,19,And they smoote him on the heed wt a rede and spat apon him and kneled doune and worsheped him.
Mark,15,20,And when they had moocked him they toke the purple of him and put his awne cloothes on him and ledde him oute to crucifie him.
Mark,15,21,And they compelled one that passed by called Symon of Cyrene (which cam oute of the felde and was father of Alexander and Rufus) to beare his crosse.
Mark,15,22,And they brought him to a place named Golgotha (which is by interpretacion the place of deed mens scoulles)
Mark,15,23,and they gave him to drinke wyne myngled with myrte but he receaved it not.
Mark,15,24,And when they had crucified him they parted his garmentes castinge loottes for them what every man shulde have.
Mark,15,25,And it was aboute ye thyrde houre and they crucified him.
Mark,15,26,And the tytle of his cause was wrytten: The kynge of the Iewes.
Mark,15,27,And they crucified with him two theves: the one on the ryght honde and the other on his lyfte.
Mark,15,28,And the scripture was fulfilled which sayeth: he was counted amonge the wicked.
Mark,15,29,And they that went by rayled on him: waggynge their heedes and sayinge: A wretche that destroyest the temple and byldest it in thre dayes:
Mark,15,30,save thy sylfe and come doune from the crosse.
Mark,15,31,Lyke wyse also mocked him ye hye preestes amonge them selves with the scribes and sayde: He saved other men him sylfe he cannot save.
Mark,15,32,Let Christ the kynge of Israel now descende from the crosse that we maye se and beleve. And they that were crucified with him checked him also.
Mark,15,33,And when the sixte houre was come darknes aroose over all the erth vntyll ye nynthe houre.
Mark,15,34,And at the nynthe houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce sayinge: Eloi Eloi lamaasbathani which is yf it be interpreted: my God my God why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark,15,35,And some of them that stode by when they hearde yt sayde: beholde he calleth for Helyas
Mark,15,36,And one ran and filled a sponge full of veneger and put it on a rede and gave him to drinke sayinge: let him alone let vs se whether Helyas will come and take him doune.
Mark,15,37,But Iesus cryed with aloude voyce and gave vp the gooste.
Mark,15,38,And the vayle of the temple dyd rent in two peces from the toppe to the boottome.
Mark,15,39,And when the Centurion which stode before him sawe that he so cryed and gave vp the gooste he sayd: truly this man was the sonne of God.
Mark,15,40,Ther were also wemen a good waye of beholdinge him: amonge whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Iames the lytle and of Ioses and Mary Salome
Mark,15,41,which also when he was in Galile folowed him and ministred vnto him and many other wemen which came vp with him to Hierusalem.
Mark,15,42,And now when nyght was come (because it was ye even that goeth before ye saboth)
Mark,15,43,Ioseph of Arimathia a noble councelour which also loked for ye kyngdome of God came and went in booldly vnto Pylate and begged ye boddy of Iesu.
Mark,15,44,And Pylate merveled that he was alredy deed and called vnto him ye Centurion and axed of him whether he had bene eny whyle deed.
Mark,15,45,And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion he gave ye body to Ioseph.
Mark,15,46,And he bought a lynnen cloothe and toke him doune and wrapped him in ye lynnen cloothe and layde him in a tombe yt was hewen oute of ye rocke and rolled a stone vnto the doze of the sepulcre.
Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalen and Mary Ioses beheld where he was layde.
Mark,16,1,And when ye saboth daye was past Mary Magdalen and Mary Iacobi and Salome bought odures that they myght come and anoynt him.
Mark,16,2,And erly in the morninge the nexte daye after the saboth day they came vnto the sepulcre when the sunne was rysen.
Mark,16,3,And they sayd one to another: who shall rolle vs awaye the stone from the dore of the sepulcre?
Mark,16,4,And when they looked they sawe how the stone was rolled awaye: for it was a very greate one.
Mark,16,5,And they went into the sepulcre and sawe a yonge man syttinge on the ryght syde cloothed in a longe whyte garmet and they were abasshed.
Mark,16,6,And he sayd vnto the be not afrayed: ye seke Iesus of Nazareth which was crucified. He is rysen he is not here. Beholde the place where they put him.
Mark,16,7,But go youre waye and tell his disciples and namely Peter: he will goo before you into Galile: there shall ye se him as he sayde vnto you.
Mark,16,8,And they went oute quickly and fleed from the sepulcre. For they trembled and were amased. Nether sayd they eny thinge to eny man for they were afrayed.
Mark,16,9,When Iesus was rysen the morow after ye saboth daye he appered fyrst to Mary Magdalen oute of whom he cast seven devyls.
Mark,16,10,And she wet and toolde them that were with him as they morned and weapte.
Mark,16,11,And when they herde that he was alyve and he had appered to hyr they beleved it not.
Mark,16,12,After that he appered vnto two of them in a straunge figure as they walked and went into the country.
Mark,16,13,And they went and toolde it to the remnaunt. And they beleved them nether.
Mark,16,14,After that he appered vnto the eleve as they sate at meate: and cast in their tethe their vnbelefe and hardnes of herte: be cause they beleued not them which had sene him after his resurreccio.
Mark,16,15,And he sayd vnto them: Goo ye in to all the worlde and preache the glad tyges to all creatures
Mark,16,16,he that beleueth and is baptised shall be saved. But he that beleveth not shalbe dampned.
Mark,16,17,And these signes shall folowe them that beleve: In my name they shall cast oute devyls and shall speake with newe tonges
Mark,16,18,and shall kyll serpentes. And yf they drinke eny dedly thinge yt shall not hurte the. They shall laye their hondes on ye sicke and they shall recover.
Mark,16,19,So then when the lorde had spoken vnto them he was receaued into heauen and is set doune on the ryght honde of God.
Mark,16,20,And they went forth and preached every where. And the Lorde wrought with them and confirmed the worde with miracles that folowed.
Luke,1,1,For as moche as many have take in hand to compyle a treates of thoo thinges which are surely knowen amonge vs
Luke,1,2,even as they declared them vnto vs which from the beginnynge sawe them their selves and were ministers at the doyng:
Luke,1,3,I determined also assone as I had searched out diligently all thinges from the beginnynge that then I wolde wryte vnto the good Theophilus:
Luke,1,4,that thou myghtest knowe the certente of thoo thinges wher of thou arte informed.
Luke,1,5,There was in the dayes of Herode kynge of Iurie a certayne prest named Zacharias of ye course of Abia. And his wyfe was of ye doughters of Aaron: And her name was Elizabeth.
Luke,1,6,Booth were perfect before God and walked in all the lawes and ordinaces of the Lorde that no man coulde fynde fawte with them.
Luke,1,7,And they had no chylde because that Elizabeth was barre and booth were well stricken in age.
Luke,1,8,And it cam to passe as he executed the prestes office before god as his course came
Luke,1,9,(accordinge to the custome of the prestes office) his lot was to bourne incece.
Luke,1,10,And wet into ye teple of ye Lorde and the whoale multitude of ye people were with out in prayer whill the incense was aburnynge.
Luke,1,11,And ther appered vnto him an angell of the lorde stondinge on the ryght syde of the altare of incense.
Luke,1,12,And when Zacharias sawe him he was abasshed and feare came on him.
Luke,1,13,And the angell sayde vnto him: feare not Zachary for thy prayer is hearde: And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall beare ye a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iohn
Luke,1,14,and thou shalt have ioye and gladnes and many shall reioyce at his birth.
Luke,1,15,For he shalbe greate in the sight of the lorde and shall nether drinke wyne ner stronge drinke. And he shalbe filled with the holy goost even in his mothers wombe:
Luke,1,16,and many of the chyldren of Israel shall he tourne to their Lorde God.
Luke,1,17,And he shall goo before him in the sprete and power of Helyas to tourne the hertes of the fathers to the chyldren and the vnbelevers to the wysdom of the iuste men: to make the people redy for the Lorde.
Luke,1,18,And Zacharias sayde vnto ye angell: Wher by shall I knowe this? seinge that I am olde and my wyfe well stricken in yeares.
Luke,1,19,And the angell answered and sayde vnto him: I am Gabriell that stonde in the presens of God and am sent to speake vnto the: and to shewe the these glad tydinges.
Luke,1,20,And beholde thou shalt be domme and not able to speake vntyll the tyme that these thinges be performed because thou belevedst not my wordes which shalbe fulfilled in their season.
Luke,1,21,And the people wayted for Zacharias and mervelled that he taryed in the temple.
Luke,1,22,And whe he cam oute he could not speake vnto them. Wherby they perceaved that he had sene some vision in the temple. And he beckened vnto them and remayned speachlesse.
Luke,1,23,And it fortuned assone as ye tyme of his office was oute he departed home into his awne housse.
Luke,1,24,And after thoose dayes his wyfe Elizabeth coceaved and hyd her sylfe .v. monethes sayinge:
Luke,1,25,This wyse hath God dealte wt me in ye dayes when he loked on me to take from me the rebuke yt I suffred amonge men.
Luke,1,26,And in ye .vi. moneth ye angell Gabriel was sent fro god vnto a cite of Galile named Nazareth
Luke,1,27,to a virgin spoused to a man whose name was Ioseph of ye housse of David and ye virgins name was Mary.
Luke,1,28,And ye angell went in vnto her and sayde: Hayle full of grace ye Lorde is with ye: blessed arte thou amonge wemen.
Luke,1,29,When she sawe him she was abasshed at his sayinge: and cast in her mynde what maner of salutacion yt shuld be.
Luke,1,30,And ye angell sayde vnto her: feare not Mary: for thou hast founde grace wt god.
Luke,1,31,Loo: thou shalt coceave in thy wombe and shalt beare a sonne and shalt call his name Iesus.
Luke,1,32,He shalbe greate and shalbe called the sonne of the hyest. And ye lorde God shall geve vnto him the seate of his father David
Luke,1,33,and he shall raygne over ye housse of Iacob forever and of his kyngdome shalbe none ende.
Luke,1,34,Then sayd Mary vnto ye angell: How shall this be seinge I knowe not a man?
Luke,1,35,And ye angell answered and sayd vnto her: The holy goost shall come apon the and ye power of ye hyest shall over shaddowe ye. Therfore also yt holy thinge which shalbe borne shalbe called ye sonne of god.
Luke,1,36,And beholde thy cosen Elizabeth she hath also conceaved a sonne in her age. And this is hyr sixte moneth though she be called barren:
Luke,1,37,for wt god can nothinge be vnpossible.
Luke,1,38,And Mary sayd: beholde ye honde mayden of ye lorde be it vnto me even as thou hast sayde. And the angell departed from her.
Luke,1,39,And Mary arose in thoose dayes and went into ye mountayns wt hast into a cite of Iurie
Luke,1,40,and entred into the housse of zachary and saluted Elizabeth.
Luke,1,41,And it fortuned as Elizabeth hearde ye salutacion of Mary the babe spronge in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled with the holy goost
Luke,1,42,and cryed with a loude voyce and sayde: Blessed arte thou amonge wemen and blessed is the frute of thy wombe.
Luke,1,43,And whence hapeneth this to me that the mother of my Lorde shuld come to me?
Luke,1,44,For loo assone as the voyce of thy salutacion sownded in myne eares the babe sprange in my belly for ioye.
Luke,1,45,And blessed arte thou that belevedst: for thoose thinges shalbe performed wich were tolde ye from the lorde.
Luke,1,46,And Mary sayde. My soule magnifieth the Lorde.
Luke,1,47,And my sprete reioyseth in god my savioure
Luke,1,48,For he hath loked on the povre degre of his honde mayde. Beholde now from hence forth shall all generacions call me blessed.
Luke,1,49,For he that is myghty hath done to me greate thinges and holye is his name.
Luke,1,50,And his mercy is on them that feare him thorow oute all generacions.
Luke,1,51,He sheweth strength with his arme he scattereth them that are proude in the ymaginacion of their hertes.
Luke,1,52,He putteth doune the myghty from their seates and exalteth them of lowe degre.
Luke,1,53,He filleth the hongry with good thinges: and sendeth awaye the ryche emptye.
Luke,1,54,He remenbreth mercy: and helpeth his servaunt Israel.
Luke,1,55,Even as he promised to oure fathers Abraham and to his seede for ever.
Luke,1,56,And mary aboode with hyr aboute a .iii. monethes and retourned agayne to hyr awne housse.
Luke,1,57,Elizabethes tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered and she brought forth a sonne.
Luke,1,58,And her neghboures and her cosins hearde tell how the lorde had shewed great mercy vpon her and they reioysed with her.
Luke,1,59,And it fortuned ye eyght daye: they cam to circumcise the chylde: and called his name zacharias after the name of his father.
Luke,1,60,How be it his mother answered and sayd: not so but he shalbe called Ihon.
Luke,1,61,And they sayd vnto hyr: Ther is none of thy kynne that is named wt this name.
Luke,1,62,And they made signes to his father how he wolde have him called.
Luke,1,63,And he axed for wrytynge tables and wroote saying: his name is Iohn. And they marvelled all.
Luke,1,64,And his mouthe was opened immediatly and his tonge also and he spake lawdynge God.
Luke,1,65,And feare came on all the that dwelt nye vnto them. And all these sayinges were noysed abroade throughout all ye hyll coutre of Iurie
Luke,1,66,and all they yt herde the layde them vp in their hertes saying: What maner chylde shall this be? And the honde of ye lorde was with him.
Luke,1,67,And his father zacharias was filled with the holy goost and prophisyed sayinge:
Luke,1,68,Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel for he hath visited and redemed his people.
Luke,1,69,And hath reysed vp an horne of salvacion vnto vs in the housse of his servaunt David.
Luke,1,70,Even as he promised by ye mouth of his holy prophetes which were sens ye worlde began
Luke,1,71,That we shuld be saved from oure enemies and from the hondis of all that hate vs:
Luke,1,72,To fulfill the mercy promised to oure fathers and to remember his holy covenaunt.
Luke,1,73,And to performe the oothe which he sware to oure father Adraham
Luke,1,74,for to geve vs. That we delyvered oute of ye hondes of oure enemyes myght serve him with oute feare
Luke,1,75,all the dayes of oure lyfe in suche holynes and ryghtewesnes that are accept before him.
Luke,1,76,And thou chylde shalt be called the Prophet of the hyest: for thou shalt goo before the face of the lorde to prepare his wayes:
Luke,1,77,And to geve knowlege of salvacion vnto his people for the remission of synnes:
Luke,1,78,Through the tender mercy of oure God wherby the daye springe from an hye hath visited vs.
Luke,1,79,To geve light to the that sate in darcknes and in shadowe of deth and to gyde oure fete into the waye of peace.
Luke,1,80,And the chylde grew and wexed stronge in sprete and was in wyldernes tyll the daye cam when he shuld shewe him sylfe vnto the Israhelites.
Luke,2,1,And it chaunced in thoose dayes: yt ther went oute a comaundment from Auguste the Emperour that all the woorlde shuld be taxed.
Luke,2,2,And this taxynge was ye fyrst and executed when Syrenius was leftenaut in Syria.
Luke,2,3,And every man went vnto his awne citie to be taxed.
Luke,2,4,And Ioseph also ascended from Galile oute of a cite called Nazareth into Iurie: vnto ye cite of David which is called Bethleem because he was of the housse and linage of David

Luke,6,5,And he sayde vnto them: The sonne of man is Lorde of the saboth daye.
Luke,6,6,And it fortuned in a nother saboth also that he entred in to ye sinagoge and taught. And ther was a ma whose right honde was dryed vp.

Luke,6,19,And all the people preased to touche him: for there went vertue out of him and healed them all.
Luke,6,20,And he lifted vp his eyes apon the disciples and sayde: Blessed be ye poore: for yours is the kyngdome of God.
Luke,6,21,Blessed are ye that honger now: for ye shalbe satisfied. Blessed are ye yt wepe now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke,6,22,Blessed are ye when men hate you and thrust you oute of their companye and rayle and abhorre youre name as an evyll thinge for the sonne of manes sake.

Luke,6,29,And vnto him that smyteth the on the one cheke offer also ye other. And him that taketh awaye thy goune forbid not to take thy coote also.
Luke,6,30,Geve to every man that axeth of the. And of him that taketh awaye thy goodes axe them not agayne.
Luke,6,31,And as ye wolde that men shuld doo to you: so do ye to them lyke wyse.

Luke,10,9,and heale the sicke yt are theare and saye vnto them: the kyngdome of God is come nye vpon you.

Luke,10,12,Ye and I saye vnto you: that it shalbe easier in that daye for Sodom then for yt cytie.
Luke,10,13,Wo be to the Chorazin: wo be to ye Bethsaida. For yf ye miracles had bene done in Tyre and Sido which have bene done in you they had a greate whyle agone repeted sitting in heere and asshes.
Luke,10,14,Neverthelesse it shalbe easier for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgement then for you.

Luke,10,21,That same tyme reioysed Iesus in ye sprete and sayde: I confesse vnto ye father Lorde of heaven and erth yt thou hast hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudent and hast opened them to the babes. Even so father for soo pleased it the.

Luke,10,23,And he turned to his disciples and sayde secretly: Happy are ye eyes which se yt ye se.
Luke,10,24,For I tell you that many prophetes and kynges have desired to se those thinges which ye se and have not sene them: and to heare those thinges which ye heare and have not hearde them.
Luke,10,25,And beholde a certayne Lawere stode vp and tempted him sayinge: Master what shall I do to inheret eternall life?
Luke,10,26,He sayd vnto him: What is written in the lawe? How redest thou?

Luke,10,30,Iesus answered and sayde: A certayne ma descended fro Hierusalem into Hierico and fell in to the hondes of theves which robbed him of his raymet and wounded him and departed levynge him halfe deed.
Luke,10,31,And by chaunce ther came a certayne preste that same waye and when he sawe him he passed by.
Luke,10,32,And lykewyse a Levite when he was come nye to the place wet and loked on him and passed by.
Luke,10,33,Then a certayne Samaritane as he iornyed came nye vnto him and when he sawe him had compassion on him
Luke,10,34,and went to and bounde vp his woundes and poured in oyle and wyne and put him on his awne beaste and brought him to a comen ynne and made provision for him.
Luke,10,35,And on the morowe when he departed he toke out two pece and gave them to the host and sayde vnto him. Take cure of him and whatsoever thou spedest moare when I come agayne I will recompence the.

Luke,11,4,And forgeve vs oure synnes: For eve we forgeve every man yt treaspaseth vs. And ledde vs not into teptacio. But deliver vs fro evill.
Luke,11,5,And he sayde vnto them: if any of you shuld have a frede and shuld goo to him at mid nyght and saye vnto him: frende lende me thre loves
Luke,11,6,for a frende of myne is come out of the waye to me and I have nothinge to set before him:
Luke,11,7,and he within shuld answere and saye trouble me not the dore is now sheet and my servautes are with me in the chamber I canot ryse and geve them to the.
Luke,11,8,I saye vnto you though he wold not aryse and geve him because he is his frede: yet because of his importunite he wold rise and geve him as many as he neded.

Luke,11,10,For every one that axeth receaveth: and he that seketh fyndeth: and to him that knocketh shall it be openned.
Luke,11,11,Yf the sonne shall axe breed of eny of you that is a father: wyll he geve him a stone? Or yf he axe fisshe wyll he for a fysshe geve him a serpent?
Luke,11,12,Or yf he axe an egge: wyll he offer him a scorpion?
Luke,11,13,Yf ye then which are evyll canne geve good giftes vnto youre chyldren how moche more shall the father of heaven geve an holy sprete to them that desyre it of him?
Luke,11,14,And he was a castynge out a devyll which was dome. And it folowed when the devyll was gone out the domme spake and the people wondred.
Luke,11,15,But some of the sayde: he casteth out devyls by the power of Belzebub the chefe of the devyls.
Luke,11,16,And other tempted him sekinge of him a signe fro heave.
Luke,11,17,But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde vnto them: Every kingdome devided with in it silfe shalbe desolate: and one housse shall fall vpon another.
Luke,11,18,So if Satan be devided with in him silfe: how shall his kyngdome endure? Because ye saye that I cast out devyls by the power of Belzebub.
Luke,11,19,Yf I by the power of Belzebub caste oute devyls: by whome do youre chyldren cast them out? Therfore shall they be youre iudges.
Luke,11,20,But if I with ye finger of God cast out devyls noo doute the kyngdome of God is come vpon you.
Luke,11,21,When a stronge man armed watcheth his housse: yt he possesseth is in peace.

Luke,11,26,Then goeth he and taketh to him seve other spretes worsse then himsilfe: and they enter in and dwell there. And the ende of that man is worsse then the begynninge.
Luke,11,27,And it fortuned as he spake those thinges a certayne woman of the copany lyfte vp her voyce and sayde vnto him: Happy is the wombe that bare the and the pappes which gave the sucke.
Luke,11,28,But he sayde: Ye happy are they that heare the worde of God and kepe it.
Luke,11,29,When the people were gadered thicke to geder: he began to saye. This is an evyll nacion: they seke a signe and ther shall no signe be geven them but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.

Luke,11,31,The quene of the southe shall ryse at iudgement with the men of this generacio and condempne them: for she came fro the ende of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon. And beholde a greater then Salomon is here.

Luke,11,33,Noo man lighteth a candell and putteth it in a previe place nether vnder a busshell: But on a candelsticke that they that come in maye se ye light.
Luke,11,34,The light of thy body is the eye. Therfore when thine eye is single: then is all thy body full of light. But if thine eye be evyll: then shall thy body also be full of darknes.
Luke,11,35,Take hede therfore that the light which is in the be not darknes.
Luke,11,36,For if all thy body shalbe light havynge noo parte darke: then shall all be full of light even as when a candell doeth light the with his brightnes.

Luke,11,39,And ye Lorde sayde to him: Now do ye Pharises make clene the out side of the cup and of the platter: but youre inwarde parties are full of raveninge and wickednes.
Luke,11,40,Ye foles dyd not he that made that which is without: make that which is within also?
Luke,11,41,Neverthelesse geve almose of that ye have and beholde all is clene to you.
Luke,11,42,But wo be to you Pharises for ye tithe the mynt and rewe and all manner erbes and passe over iudgment and the love of God. These ought ye to have done and yet not to have left the other vndone.
Luke,11,43,Wo be to you Pharises: for ye love the vppermost seates in the synagoges and gretinges in the markets.
Luke,11,44,Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites for ye are as graves which appere not and the men yt walke over the are not ware of the.
Luke,11,45,Then answered one of the lawears and sayd vnto him: Master thus sayinge thou puttest vs to rebuke also.
Luke,11,46,Then he sayde: Wo be to you also ye lawears: for ye lade men with burthens greveous to be borne and ye youre selves touche not ye packes wt one of youre fyngers.
Luke,11,47,Wo be to you: ye bylde the sepulchres of the Prophetes and youre fathers killed the:
Luke,11,48,truly ye beare witnes that ye alowe the dedes of youre fathers for they kylled them and ye bylde their sepulchres.
Luke,11,49,Therfore sayde ye wisdome of God: I will send them Prophetes and Apostles and of them they shall slee and persecute:
Luke,11,50,that the bloude of all Prophetes which was sheed fro the beginninge of the worlde maye be requyred of this generacion
Luke,11,51,from the bloud of Abell vnto the bloud of zachary which perisshed bitwene the aulter and the temple. Verely I saye vnto you: it shalbe requyred of this nacion.
Luke,11,52,Wo be to you lawears: for ye have taken awaye ye keye of knowledge ye entred not in youre selves and them that came in ye forbade.
Luke,11,53,When he thus spake vnto them the lawears and the Pharises began to wexe busye about him and to stop his mouth with many questions
Luke,11,54,layinge wayte for him and sekinge to catche somethinge of his mought wherby they might accuse him.
Luke,12,1,As ther gadered together an innumerable multitude of people (in so moche that they trood one another) he began to saye vnto his disciples: Fyrst of all beware of the leve of the Pharises which is ypocrisy.
Luke,12,2,For ther is no thinge covered that shall not be vncovered: nether hyd that shall not be knowen.
Luke,12,3,For whatsoever ye have spoken in in darknes: that same shalbe hearde in light. And that which ye have spoken in the the eare eve in secret places shalbe preached even on the toppe of the housses.
Luke,12,4,I saye vnto you my fredes: Be not afrayde of them that kyll the body and after that have no moare that they can do.
Luke,12,5,But I will shewe you whom ye shall feare. Feare him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell. Ye I saye vnto you him feare.
Luke,12,6,Are not five sparowes bought for two farthinges? And yet not one of them is forgotten of God.
Luke,12,7,Also even the very heres of youre heedes are nombred. Feare not therfore: ye are moare of value then many sparowes.
Luke,12,8,I saye vnto you: Whosoever confesseth me before men eve him shall ye sonne of man confesse also before ye angels of God.
Luke,12,9,And he that denyeth me before men: shalbe denyed before ye angels of God.
Luke,12,10,And whosoever speaketh a worde agaynst ye sonne of ma it shalbe forgeven him. But vnto him yt blasphemeth the holy goost it shall not be forgeven.
Luke,12,11,When they bringe you vnto the synagoges and vnto the rulers and officers take no thought how or what thinge ye shall answer or what ye shall speake.
Luke,12,12,For the holy goost shall teache you in the same houre what ye ought to saye.
Luke,12,13,One of the company sayde vnto hym: Master byd my brother devide the enheritauce with me.
Luke,12,14,And he sayde vnto him: Man who made me a iudge or a devider over you?
Luke,12,15,Wherfore he sayde vnto them: take hede and beware of covetousnes. For no mannes lyfe stondeth in the aboundaunce of the thinges which he possesseth.
Luke,12,16,And he put forth a similitude vnto them sayinge: The groude of a certayne riche ma brought forth frutes plenteously
Luke,12,17,and he thought in himsilfe sayinge: what shall I do? because I have noo roume where to bestowe my frutes?
Luke,12,18,And he sayde: This will I do. I will destroye my barnes and bilde greater and therin will I gadder all my frutes and my goodes:
Luke,12,19,and I will saye to my soule: Soule thou hast moch goodes layde vp in stoore for many yeares take thyne ease: eate drinke and be mery.
Luke,12,20,But God sayde vnto him: Thou fole this night will they fetche awaye thy soule agayne from the. Then whose shall thoose thinges be which thou hast provyded?
Luke,12,21,So is it with him that gadereth ryches and is not ryche in God.
Luke,12,22,And he spake vnto his disciples: Therfore I saye vnto you: take no thought for youre lyfe what ye shall eate nether for youre body what ye shall put on.
Luke,12,23,The lyfe is moare then meate and the bodye is moare then rayment.
Luke,12,24,Considre the ravens for they nether sowe nor repe which nether have stoorehousse ner barne and yet God fedeth them. How moche are ye better then the foules.
Luke,12,25,Which of you with takynge thought can adde to his stature one cubit?
Luke,12,26,Yf ye then be not able to do that thinge which is least: why take ye thought for the remmaunt?
Luke,12,27,Considre the lylies how they growe: They laboure not: they spyn not: and yet I saye vnto you that Salomon in all this royalte was not clothed lyke to one of these.
Luke,12,28,Yf the grasse which is todaye in the felde and tomorowe shalbe cast into the fornace God so clothe: how moche moore will he clothe you o ye endued wt litell faith?
Luke,12,29,And axe not what ye shall eate or what ye shall drinke nether clyme ye vp an hye
Luke,12,30,for all suche thinges the hethen people of the worlde seke for. Youre father knoweth that ye have nede of suche thinges.
Luke,12,31,Wherfore seke ye after the kyngedome of God and all these thinges shalbe ministred vnto you.
Luke,12,32,Feare not litell floocke for it is youre fathers pleasure to geve you a kingdome.
Luke,12,33,Sell that ye have and geve almes. And make you bagges which wexe not olde and treasure that fayleth not in heaven where noo these commeth nether moth corrupteth.
Luke,12,34,For where youre treasure is there will youre hertes be also.
Luke,12,35,Let youre loynes be gerdde about and youre lightes brennynge
Luke,12,36,and ye youre selves lyke vnto men that wayte for their master when he will returne fro a weddinge: that assone as he cometh and knocketh they maye ope vnto him.
Luke,12,37,Happy are those servauntes which the Lorde when he cometh shall fynde wakynge. Verely I saye vnto you he will gerdde him selfe about and make them sit doune to meate and walke by and minister vnto them.
Luke,12,38,And yf he come in the seconde watche ye if he come in the thyrde watche and shall fynde them soo happy are those servauntes.
Luke,12,39,This vnderstonde that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre ye these wolde come he wolde suerly watche: and not suffer his housse to be broken vp.
Luke,12,40,Be ye prepared therfore: for the sonne of man will come at an houre when ye thinke not.
Luke,12,41,Then Peter sayde vnto him: Master tellest thou this similitude vnto vs or to all men?
Luke,12,42,And the Lorde sayde: If there be any faith full servaut and wise whom his Lorde shall make ruler over his housholde to geve them their duetie of meate at due season:
Luke,12,43,happy is that servaunt whom his master when he cometh shall finde soo doinge.
Luke,12,44,Of a trueth I saye vnto you: that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
Luke,12,45,But and yf the evyll servaunt shall saye in his hert: My master wyll differre his cominge and shall beginne to smyte the servauntes and maydens and to eate and drinke and to be dronken:
Luke,12,46,the Lorde of that servaunt will come in a daye when he thinketh not and at an houre when he is not ware and will devyde him and will geve him his rewarde with the vnbelevers.
Luke,12,47,The servaut that knewe his masters will and prepared not him selfe nether dyd accordinge to his will shalbe bete with many strypes.
Luke,12,48,But he that knewe not and yet dyd committe thinges worthy of strypes shalbe beaten with feawe strypes. For vnto whom moche is geven of him shalbe moche requyred. And to whom men moche commyt the moare of him will they axe.
Luke,12,49,I am come to sende fyre on erth: and what is my dysyre but that it were all redy kyndled?
Luke,12,50,Not with stondinge I must de baptised with a baptyme: and how am I payned till it be ended?
Luke,12,51,Suppose ye that I am come to sende peace on erth? I tell you naye: but rather debate.
Luke,12,52,For fro hence forthe ther shalbe five in one housse devided thre agaynst two and two agaynst thre.
Luke,12,53,The father shalbe devided agaynst the sonne and the sonne agaynst the father. The mother agaynst the doughter and the doughter agaynst the mother. The motereleawe agaynst hir doughterelawe and the doughterelawe agaynst hir motherelawe.
Luke,12,54,Then sayde he to the people: when ye se a cloude ryse out of the west strayght waye ye saye: we shall have a shower and soo it is.
Luke,12,55,And when ye se the south wynde blow ye saye: we shall have heet and it cometh to passe.
Luke,12,56,Ypocrites ye can skyll of the fassion of the erth and of the skye: but what is ye cause that ye canot skyll of this time?
Luke,12,57,Ye and why iudge ye not of youre selves what is righte?
Luke,12,58,Whill thou goest with thyne adversary to the ruler: as thou arte in the waye geve diligence that thou mayst be delivered fro him least he bringe the to the iudge and the iudge delyver the to the iaylar and the iaylar cast the in to preson.
Luke,12,59,I tell ye thou departest not thence tyll thou have made good ye vtmost myte.
Luke,13,1,Ther were present at the same season that shewed him of ye Galileas whose bloude Pylate mengled with their awne sacrifice.
Luke,13,2,And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Suppose ye that these Galileans were greater synners then all the other Galileas because they suffred suche punisshmet?
Luke,13,3,I tell you naye: but except ye repent ye shall all in lyke wyse perysshe.
Luke,13,4,Or those .xviii. apon which ye toure in Syloe fell and slewe the thinke ye that they were synners above all men yt dwell in Ierusalem?
Luke,13,5,I tell you naye: But excepte ye repent ye all shall lykewyse perisshe.
Luke,13,6,He put forthe this similiiude A certayne man had a fygge tree planted in his veneyarde and he came and sought frute theron and founde none.
Luke,13,7,Then sayde he to ye dresser of his vyneyarde: Beholde this thre yeare have I come and sought frute in this fygge tree and fynde none: cut it doune: why combreth it the grounde?
Luke,13,8,And he answered and sayde vnto him: lorde let it alone this yeare also till I digge rounde aboute it and doge it to se
Luke,13,9,whether it will beare frute: and if it beare not then after yt cut it doune
Luke,13,10,And he taught in one of their sinagoges on ye saboth dayes.
Luke,13,11,And beholde ther was a woma which had a sprete of infirmite .xviii. yeares: and was bowed to gether and coulde not lifte vp hersilfe at all.

Luke,13,13,And he layde his hondes on her and immediatly she was made strayght and glorified God.

Luke,13,15,Then answered him the Lorde and sayd: Ypocrite doth not eache one of you on the saboth daye lowse his oxe or his asse from the stall and leade him to the water?
Luke,13,16,And ought not this doughter of Abraham whom Sathan hath bounde loo .xviii. yeares be lowsed from this bonde on the saboth daye?
Luke,13,17,And when he thus sayde all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people reioysed on all the excellent dedes that were done by him.
Luke,13,18,Then sayde he: What is the kyngdome of God lyke? or wherto shall I compare it?
Luke,13,19,It is lyke a grayne of mustard seede which a man toke and sowed in his garden: and it grewe and wexed a greate tree and the foules of the ayer made nestes in the braunches of it.
Luke,13,20,And agayne he sayde: wher vnto shall I lyken ye kyngdome of god?
Luke,13,21,it is lyke leve which a woman toke and hidde in thre busshels of floure tyll all was thorow levended.

Luke,13,24,stryve with youre selves to enter in at ye strayte gate: For many I saye vnto you will seke to enter in and shall not be able.
Luke,13,25,When the good man of ye housse is rysen vp and hath shett to the dore ye shall beginne to stonde with out and to knocke at the dore sayinge: Lorde lorde open vnto vs: and he shall answer and saye vnto you: I knowe you not whence ye are.

Luke,13,27,And he shall saye: I tell you I knowe you not whence ye are: departe from me all ye workers of iniquite.
Luke,13,28,There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth when ye shall se Abraham and Isaac and Iacob and all the prophetes in the kyngdom of God and youre selves thrust oute at dores.
Luke,13,29,And they shall come from the eest and from the weest and from the northe and from the southe and shall syt doune in the kyngdome of God.

Luke,14,5,and answered the sayinge whiche of you shall have an asse or an oxe fallen into a pitt and will not strayght waye pull him out on the Saboth daye?
Luke,14,6,And they coulde not answer him agayne to that.
Luke,14,7,He put forthe a similitude to ye gestes whe he marked how they preased to the hyest roumes and sayd vnto the:
Luke,14,8,When thou arte bidde to a weddynge of eny man syt not doune in ye hyest roume lest a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him
Luke,14,9,and he that bade bothe him and the come and saye to the: geve this man roume and thou then beginne with shame to take the lowest roume.
Luke,14,10,But rather when thou arte bidden goo and syt in the lowest roume that when he that bade the cometh he maye saye vnto the: frende syt vp hyer. Then shalt thou have worshippe in the presence of them that syt at meate with the.
Luke,14,11,For whosoever exalteth him sylfe shalbe brought lowe. And he yt hubleth him sylfe shalbe exalted
Luke,14,12,Then sayde he also to him that had desyred him to diner: When thou makest a diner or a supper: call not thy frendes nor thy brethre nether thy kinsmen nor yet ryche neghbours: lest they bidde the agayne and a recompence be made the.
Luke,14,13,But when thou makest afeast call the poore the maymed the lame and the blynde
Luke,14,14,and thou shalt be happy for they cannot recompence the. But thou shalt be recompensed at the resurreccion of the iuste men.
Luke,14,15,When one of them that sate at meate also hearde that he sayde vnto him: happy is he that eateth breed in the kyngdome of God.
Luke,14,16,Then sayd he to him. A certayne man ordened a greate supper and bade many
Luke,14,17,and sent his servaunt at supper tyme to saye to them that wer bidden come: for all thinges are now redy.
Luke,14,18,And they all atonce begane to make excuse. The fyrst sayd vnto him: I have bought a ferme and I must nedes goo and se it I praye the have me excused.
Luke,14,19,And another sayd: I hove bought fyve yooke of oxen and I goo to prove them I praye the have me excused.
Luke,14,20,The thyrde sayd: I have maried a wyfe and therfore I cannot come.
Luke,14,21,And the servaunt went and brought his master worde therof. Then was the good man of the housse displeased and sayd to his servaut: Goo out quickly into ye stretes and quarters of the cite and bringe in hidder the poore and the maymed and the halt and the blynde.
Luke,14,22,And the servaut sayd: lorde it is done as thou comaundedst and yet ther is roume.
Luke,14,23,And the lorde sayd to the servaunt: Go out into ye hye wayes and hedges and compell the to come in that my housse maye be filled.
Luke,14,24,For I saye vnto you that none of those men which were bidde shall tast of my supper.
Luke,14,25,Ther went agreate copany with him and he turned and sayde vnto them:
Luke,14,26,If a man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wyfe and chyldren and brethren and sisters more over and his awne lyfe he cannot be my disciple.
Luke,14,27,And whosoever beare not his crosse and come after me cannot be my disciple.
Luke,14,28,Which of you disposed to bilde a toure sytteth not doune before and counteth ye cost whether he have sufficient to performe it?
Luke,14,29,lest after he hath layde ye foundacion and is not able to performe it all yt beholde it beginne to mocke him
Luke,14,30,sayinge: this man beganne to bilde and was not able to make an ende.
Luke,14,31,Or what kynge goeth to make batayle agaynst another kinge and sitteth not doune fyrst and casteth in his mynde whether he be able wt ten thousande to mete him that cometh agaynst him wt .xx thousand.
Luke,14,32,Or els whyll ye other is yet a greate waye of he will sende embasseatours and desyre peace.
Luke,14,33,So lykewyse none of you yt forsaketh not all yt he hath can be my disciple.
Luke,14,34,Salt is good but yf salt have loste hyr saltnes what shall be seasoned ther with?
Luke,14,35,It is nether good for ye londe nor yet for ye donge hill but men cast it out at ye dores. He yt hath eares to heare let him heare.
Luke,15,1,Then resorted vnto him all ye publicas and synners for to heare him.
Luke,15,2,And the pharises and scribes murmured sayinge: He receaved to his copany synners and eateth with them.
Luke,15,3,Then put he forthe this similitude to the sayinge:
Luke,15,4,What man of you havynge an hundred shepe yf he loose one of thee doth not leve nynty and nyne in the wyldernes and goo after yt which is loost vntyll he fynde him?
Luke,15,5,And whe he hath founde him he putteth him on his shulders with ioye:
Luke,15,6,And assone as he cometh home he calleth to gedder his lovers and neghbours sayinge vnto them: reioyse with me for I have founde my shepe which was loost.
Luke,15,7,I say vnto you yt lyke wyse ioye shalbe in heven over one synner yt repenteth moore then over nynety and nyne iuste persons whiche nede noo repentauce.
Luke,15,8,Ether what woman havynge .x. grotes yf she loose one doth not lyght a candell and swepe ye housse and seke diligently tyll she fynde it?
Luke,15,9,And when she hath founde it she calleth her lovers and her neghbours sayinge: Reioyce wt me for I have founde the groate which I had loost.
Luke,15,10,Lykwyse I saye vnto you ioye is made in ye presence of ye angels of god over one synner yt repenteth.
Luke,15,11,And he sayde: a certayne man had two sonnes
Luke,15,12,and the yonger of them sayde to his father: father geve me my parte of the goodes yt to me belongeth. And he devided vnto them his substaunce.
Luke,15,13,And not longe after ye yonger sonne gaddered all that he had to gedder and toke his iorney into a farre countre and theare he wasted his goodes with royetous lyvinge.
Luke,15,14,And when he had spent all that he had ther rose a greate derth thorow out all yt same londe and he began to lacke.
Luke,15,15,And he went and clave to a citesyn of yt same countre which sent him to his felde to kepe his swyne.
Luke,15,16,And he wold fayne have filled his bely with the coddes that ye swyne ate: and noo man gave him.
Luke,15,17,Then he came to him selfe and sayde: how many hyred servauntes at my fathers have breed ynough and I dye for honger.
Luke,15,18,I will aryse and goo to my father and will saye vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and before ye
Luke,15,19,and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne make me as one of thy hyred servauntes.
Luke,15,20,And he arose and went to his father. And when he was yet a greate waye of his father sawe him and had compassion and ran and fell on his necke and kyssed him.
Luke,15,21,And the sonne sayd vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and in thy sight and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne.
Luke,15,22,But his father sayde to his servautes: bringe forth that best garment and put it on him and put a rynge on his honde and showes on his fete.
Luke,15,23,And bringe hidder that fatted caulfe and kyll him and let vs eate and be mery:
Luke,15,24,for this my sonne was deed and is alyve agayne he was loste and is now founde. And they began to be merye.
Luke,15,25,The elder brother was in the felde and when he cam and drewe nye to ye housse he herde minstrelcy and daunsynge
Luke,15,26,and called one of his servauntes and axed what thoose thinges meate.
Luke,15,27,And he sayd vnto him: thy brother is come and thy father had kylled ye fatted caulfe because he hath receaved him safe and sounde.
Luke,15,28,And he was angry and wolde not goo in. Then came his father out and entreated him.
Luke,15,29,He answered and sayde to his father: Loo these many yeares have I done the service nether brake at eny tyme thy commaundment and yet gavest thou me never soo moche as a kyd to make mery wt my lovers:
Luke,15,30,but assone as this thy sonne was come which hath devoured thy goodes with harlootes thou haste for his pleasure kylled ye fatted caulfe.
Luke,15,31,And he sayd vnto him: Sonne thou wast ever with me and all that I have is thyne:
Luke,15,32,it was mete that we shuld make mery and be glad: for this thy brother was deed and is a lyve agayne: and was loste and is founde.
Luke,16,1,And he sayd also vnto his disciples. Ther was a certayne rych man which had a stewarde that was acused vnto him that he had wasted his goodes.
Luke,16,2,And he called him and sayd vnto him: How is it that I heare this of the? Geve a comptes of thy steward shippe: For thou mayste be no longer stewarde.
Luke,16,3,The stewarde sayd wt in him selfe: what shall I do? for my master will take awaye fro me ye stewarde shippe. I canot digge and to begge I am ashamed.
Luke,16,4,I woote what to do yt when I am put out of ye stewardshippe they maye receave me into their houses.
Luke,16,5,Then called he all his masters detters and sayd vnto ye fyrst: how moche owest thou vnto my master?
Luke,16,6,And he sayd: an hondred tonnes of oyle. And he sayd to him: take thy bill and syt doune quickly and wryte fiftie.
Luke,16,7,Then sayd he to another: what owest thou? And he sayde: an hondred quarters of wheate. He sayd to him: Take thy bill and write foure scoore.
Luke,16,8,And the lorde comended the vniust stewarde because he had done wysly. For ye chyldren of this worlde are in their kynde wyser then ye chyldren of lyght.
Luke,16,9,And I saye also vnto you: make you frendes of the wicked mammon that when ye shall departe they may receave you into everlastinge habitacions.
Luke,16,10,He that is faithfull in that which is leste ye same is faithfull in moche. And he yt is vnfaithfull in ye least: is vnfaithfull also in moche.
Luke,16,11,So then yf ye have not ben faithfull in ye wicked mamon? who will beleve you in that which is true?
Luke,16,12,And yf ye have not bene faithfull in another manes busines: who shall geve you youre awne?
Luke,16,13,No servaunt can serve .ii. masters for other he shall hate ye one and love ye other or els he shall lene to the one and despyse the other. Ye can not serve God and mammon.
Luke,16,14,All these thinges herde the pharises also which were coveteous and they mocked him.
Luke,16,15,And he sayd vnto the: Ye are they which iustifie youre selves before me: but God knoweth youre hertes. For ye which is highlie estemed amoge me is abhominable in yt sight of god
Luke,16,16,The lawe and the Prophetes raygned vntyll the tyme of Iohn: and sence that tyme the kyngdom of God is preached and every man stryveth to goo in.
Luke,16,17,Soner shall heven and erth perisshe then one tytle of the lawe shall perisshe.
Luke,16,18,Whosoever forsaketh his wyfe and marieth another breaketh matrimony. And every man which marieth her that is devorsed from her husbande committeth advoutry also.
Luke,16,19,Ther was a certayne ryche man which was clothed in purple and fyne bysse and fared deliciously every daye.
Luke,16,20,And ther was a certayne begger named Lazarus whiche laye at his gate full of soores
Luke,16,21,desyringe to be refresshed with the cromes whiche fell from the ryche manes borde. Neverthelesse the dogges came and licked his soores.
Luke,16,22,And yt fortuned that the begger dyed and was caried by the angelles into Abrahas bosome. The riche man also died and was buried.
Luke,16,23,And beinge in hell in tormetes he lyfte vp his eyes and sawe Abraham a farre of and Lazarus in his bosome
Luke,16,24,and he cryed and sayd: father Abraham have mercy on me and sende Lazarus that he maye dippe the tippe of his fynger in water and cole my tonge: for I am tourmented in this flame.
Luke,16,25,But Abraha sayd vnto him Sonne remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme receavedst thy pleasure and contrary wyse Lazarus payne. Now therfore is he comforted and thou art punysshed.
Luke,16,26,Beyonde all this bitwene you and vs ther is a greate space set so that they which wolde goo from thence to you cannot: nether maye come from thence to vs.
Luke,16,27,Then he sayd: I praye the therfore father send him to my fathers housse.
Luke,16,28,For I have fyve brethren: for to warne the left they also come into this place of tourmet.
Luke,16,29,Abraha sayd vnto him: they have Moses and the Prophetes let them heare them.
Luke,16,30,And he sayd: naye father Abraham but yf one came vnto the from the ded they wolde repent.
Luke,16,31,He sayd vnto him: If they heare not Moses and ye prophetes nether will they beleve though one roose from deeth agayne.
Luke,17,1, Then sayde he to ye disciples it can not be avoyded but that offences will come. Neverthelesse wo be to him thorow whom they come.
Luke,17,2,It were better for him that a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were cast into ye see then that he shuld offende one of this lytleons.
Luke,17,3,Take hede to youre selves. If thy brother trespas agaynst the rebuke him:
Luke,17,4,and yf he repent forgeve him. And though he sinne agest ye .vii. tymes in a daye and seve tymes in a daye tourne agayne to ye sayinge: it repenteth me forgeve him
Luke,17,5,And the apostles sayde vnto the Lorde: increase oure faith.
Luke,17,6,And the Lorde sayde: yf ye had faith lyke a grayne of mustard sede and shuld saye vnto this sycamine tree plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes and plant thy selfe in the see: he should obey you.
Luke,17,7,Who is it of you yf he had a servaute plowinge or fedinge catell that wolde saye vnto him when he were come from the felde Goo quickly and syt doune to meate:
Luke,17,8,and wolde not rather saye to him dresse wherwith I maye sup and gyrde vp thy selfe and serve me tyll I have eaten and dronken: and afterwarde eate thou and drinke thou?
Luke,17,9,Doeth he thanke that servaunt because he dyd that which was commaunded vnto him? I trowe not.
Luke,17,10,Soo lyke wyse ye when ye have done all thoose thinges which are commaunded you: saye we are vnprofitable servautes. We have done: ye which was oure duetye to do.
Luke,17,11,And it chaunsed as he went to Ierusalem that he passed thorow Samaria and Galile.
Luke,17,12,And as he entred into a certayne toune ther met him ten men yt were lepers. Which stode a farre of
Luke,17,13,and put forth their voyces and sayde: Iesu master have mercy on vs.
Luke,17,14,When he sawe the he sayde vnto them: Goo and shewe youre selves to the prestes. And it chaunsed as they went they were clensed.
Luke,17,15,And one of them when he sawe that he was clensed turned backe agayne and with a loude voyce praysed God
Luke,17,16,and fell doune on his face at his fete and gave him thankes. And the same was a Samaritane.
Luke,17,17,And Iesus answered and sayde: are ther not ten clensed? But where are those nyne?
Luke,17,18,Ther are not founde that returned agane to geve God prayse save only this straunger.
Luke,17,19,And he sayde vnto him: aryse and goo thy waye thy faith hath made the whoale.
Luke,17,20,When he was demaunded of ye pharises when the kyngdome of God shuld come: he answered them and sayde: The kyngdome of God cometh not with waytinge for.
Luke,17,21,Nether shall men saye: Loo here loo there. For beholde the kyngdome of God is with in you.
Luke,17,22,And he sayde vnto the disciples: The dayes will come when ye shall desyre to se one daye of the sonne of man and ye shall not se it.
Luke,17,23,And they shall saye to you: Se here Se there. Goo not after them nor folowe them
Luke,17,24,for as the lyghtenynge that apereth out of the one parte of the heven and shyneth vnto the other parte of heven: Soo shall the sonne of man be in his dayes.
Luke,17,25,But fyrst must he suffre many thinges and be refused of this nacion.
Luke,17,26,As it happened in ye tyme of Noe: So shall it be in the tyme of the sonne of man.
Luke,17,27,They ate they dranke they maryed wyves and were maryed even vnto yt same daye yt Noe went into ye arke: and ye floud cam and destroyed the all.
Luke,17,28,Lykewyse also as it chaunsed in the dayes of Lot. They ate they dranke they bought they solde they planted they bilte.
Luke,17,29,And even the same daye that Lot went out of Zodom it rayned fyre and brymstone from heven and destroyed them all.
Luke,17,30,After these ensamples shall it be in the daye when the sonne of man shall appere.
Luke,17,31,At that daye he that is on the housse toppe and his stuffe in the housse: let him not come doune to take it out. And lykewyse let not him that is in the feldes turne backe agayne to that he lefte behynde.
Luke,17,32,Remember Lottes wyfe.
Luke,17,33,Whosoever will goo about to save his lyfe shall loose it: And whosoever shall loose his lyfe shall save it.
Luke,17,34,I tell you: In that nyght ther shalbe two in one beed the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe forsaken.
Luke,17,35,Two shalbe also a grindynge to gedder: the one shalbe receaved and the other forsaken.
Luke,17,36,And they answered and sayde to him: wheare Lorde? And he sayd vnto the: whersoever ye body shalbe thyther will the egles resoorte.
Luke,17,37,
Luke,18,1,And he put forth a similitude vnto the signifyinge that men ought alwayes to praye and not to be wery
Luke,18,2,sayinge: Ther was a Iudge in a certayne cite which feared not god nether regarded man.
Luke,18,3,And ther was a certayne wedowe in the same cite which came vnto him sayinge: avenge me of myne adversary.
Luke,18,4,And he wolde not for a whyle. But afterwarde he sayd vnto him selfe: though I feare not God nor care for man
Luke,18,5,yet because this wedowe troubleth me I will avenge her lest at the laste she come and hagge on me.
Luke,18,6,And the lorde sayd: heare what the vnrightewes Iudge sayeth.
Luke,18,7,And shall not god avenge his electe which crye daye and nyght vnto him ye though he differre them?
Luke,18,8,I tell you he will avenge them and that quickly. Neverthelesse when the sonne of man cometh suppose ye that he shall fynde faithe on the erthe.
Luke,18,9,And he put forthe this similitude vnto certayne which trusted in the selves yt they were perfecte and despysed other.
Luke,18,10,Two men went vp into ye teple to praye: ye one a pharise and the other a publican.
Luke,18,11,The pharise stode and prayed thus wt him selfe. God I thanke the yt I am not as other men are extorsioners vniuste advoutrers or as this publican.
Luke,18,12,I fast twyse in ye weke. I geve tythe of all that I possesse.
Luke,18,13,And the publican stode afarre of and wolde not lyfte vp his eyes to heven but smote his brest sayinge: God be mercyfull to me a synner.
Luke,18,14,I tell you: this ma departed hoe to his housse iustified moore then the other. For every man that exalteth him selfe shalbe brought low: And he yt hubleth him selfe shalbe exalted
Luke,18,15,They brought vnto him also babes yt he shuld touche the. When his disciples sawe that they rebuked the.
Luke,18,16,But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde: Suffre chyldren to come vnto me and forbidde the not. For of soche is ye kyngdome of God.
Luke,18,17,Verely I saye vnto you: whosoever receaveth not the kyngdome of God as a chylde: he shall not enter therin.
Luke,18,18,And a certayne ruler axed him sayinge: Good Master: what ought I to do to obtayne eternall lyfe?
Luke,18,19,Iesus sayd vnto him: Why callest thou me good? No man is good save God only.
Luke,18,20,Thou knowest ye comaundmentes: Thou shalt not commit advoutry: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honoure thy father and thy mother.
Luke,18,21,And he sayde: all these have I kept from my youthe.
Luke,18,22,When Iesus hearde that he sayde vnto him: Yet lackest thou one thinge. Sell all that thou hast and distribute it vnto the poore and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me.
Luke,18,23,When he heard that he was hevy: for he was very ryche.
Luke,18,24,When Iesus sawe him morne he sayde: with what difficulte shall they that have ryches enter into the kyngdome of God:
Luke,18,25,it is easyer for a camell to goo thorow a nedles eye then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God.
Luke,18,26,Then sayde they that hearde that: And who shall then be saved?
Luke,18,27,And he sayde: Thinges which are vnpossible with men are possible with God.
Luke,18,28,Then Peter sayde: Loo we have lefte all and have folowed the.
Luke,18,29,And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you ther is noo man that leaveth housse other father and mother other brethren or wyfe or chyldren for the kyngdome of Goddes sake
Luke,18,30,which same shall not receave moche moore in this worlde: and in the worlde to come lyfe everlastinge.
Luke,18,31,He toke vnto him twelve and sayde vnto them. Beholde we go vp to Ierusalem and all shalbe fulfilled that are written by ye Prophetes of the sonne of man.
Luke,18,32,He shalbe delivered vnto the gentils and shalbe mocked and shalbe despytfully entreated and shalbe spetted on:
Luke,18,33,and when they have scourged him they will put him to deeth and the thyrde daye he shall aryse agayne.
Luke,18,34,But they vnderstode none of these thinges. And this sayinge was hid fro them. And they perceaved not the thinges which were spoken.
Luke,18,35,And it came to passe as he was come nye vnto Hierico a certayne blynde man sate by the waye syde begginge.
Luke,18,36,And when he hearde the people passe by he axed what it meant.
Luke,18,37,And they sayde vnto him yt Iesus of Nazareth passed by.
Luke,18,38,And he cryed sayinge: Iesus ye sonne of David have thou mercy on me.
Luke,18,39,And they which went before rebuked him that he shuld holde his peace. But he cryed so moche the moare thou sonne of David have mercy on me.
Luke,18,40,And Iesus stode styll and commaunded him to be brought vnto him. And when he was come neare he axed him
Luke,18,41,sayinge: What wilt thou that I do vnto the? And he sayde: Lorde yt I maye receave my sight.
Luke,18,42,Iesus sayde vnto him: receave thy sight: thy faith hath saved the.
Luke,18,43,And immediatly he sawe and folowed him praysinge God. And all the people when they sawe it gave laude to God.
Luke,19,1,And he entred in and went thorow Hierico.
Luke,19,2,And beholde ther was a ma named Zacheus which was a ruler amoge the Publicans and was riche also.
Luke,19,3,And he made meanes to se Iesus what he shuld be: and coulde not for the preace because he was of a lowe stature.
Luke,19,4,Wherfore he ran before and asceded vp into a wilde fygge tree to se him: for he shulde come that same waye.
Luke,19,5,And when Iesus cam to the place he loked vp and sawe him and sayd vnto him: zache attonce come doune for to daye I must abyde at thy housse.
Luke,19,6,And he came doune hastelye and receaved him ioyfully.
Luke,19,7,And when they sawe that they all groudged sayinge: He is gone in to tary with a man that is a synner.
Luke,19,8,And zache stode forth and sayd vnto ye Lorde: beholde Lorde ye haulfe of my gooddes I geve to the povre and if I have done eny ma wroge I will restore him fower folde.
Luke,19,9,And Iesus sayd to him: this daye is healthe come vnto this housse for as moche as it also is become the chylde of Abraha.
Luke,19,10,For the sonne of ma is come to seke and to save that which was looste.
Luke,19,11,As they hearde these thinges he added ther to a similitude be cause he was nye to Hierusalem and because also they thought that the kyngdome of God shuld shortely appere.
Luke,19,12,He sayde therfore: a certayne noble man wet into a farre countre to receave him a kyngdome and then to come agayne.
Luke,19,13,And he called his ten servauntes and delyvered them ten pounde sayinge vnto them: by and sell till I come.
Luke,19,14,But his citesens hated him and sent messengers after him sayinge: We will not have this man to raygne over vs.
Luke,19,15,And it came to passe when he was come agayne and had receaved his kyngdome he comaunded these servautes to be called to him (to whom he gave his money) to witt what every man had done.
Luke,19,16,Then came ye fyrst sayinge: Lorde thy pounde hath encreased ten poude.
Luke,19,17,And he sayde vnto him: Well good servaute because thou wast faithfull in a very lytell thynge take thou auctorite over ten cities.
Luke,19,18,And the other came sayinge: Lorde thy poude hath encreased fyve pounde.
Luke,19,19,And to ye same he sayde: and be thou also ruler ouer fyve cities.
Luke,19,20,And the thyrde came and sayde: Lorde beholde here thy pounde which I have kepte in a napkyn
Luke,19,21,for I feared the because thou arte a strayte man: thou takest vp that thou laydest not doune and repest that thou dyddest not sowe.
Luke,19,22,And he sayde vnto him: Of thine awne mouth iudge I the thou evyll servaunt. knewest thou that I am a strayte man takinge vp that I layde not doune and repinge that I dyd not sowe?
Luke,19,23,Wherfore then gavest not thou my money into the banke that at my cominge I might have required myne awne with vauntage?
Luke,19,24,And he sayde to them that stode by: take fro him that pounde and geve it him that hath ten poude.
Luke,19,25,And they sayd vnto him: Lorde he hath ten pounde.
Luke,19,26,I saye vnto you that vnto all the that have it shalbe geve: and from him yt hath not eve that he hath shalbe taken from him.
Luke,19,27,Moreover those myne enemys which wolde not that I shuld raigne over them bringe hidder and slee them before me.
Luke,19,28,And when he had thus spoken he proceded forthe before a ssendinge vp to Ierusalem.
Luke,19,29,And it fortuned when he was come nye to Bethphage and Bethany besydes moute olivete he sent two of his disciples
Luke,19,30,sayinge: Goo ye in to the toune which is over agaynste you. In the which assone as ye are come ye shall finde a colte tyed wheron yet never man sate. Lowse him and bringe him hider.
Luke,19,31,And if eny man axe you why that ye loowse him: thus saye vnto him ye lorde hath nede of him.
Luke,19,32,They that were sent went their waye and founde eve as he had sayde vnto the.
Luke,19,33,And as they were aloosinge ye coolte the owners sayde vnto the: why lowse ye ye coolte?
Luke,19,34,And they sayde: for ye Lorde hath nede of him.
Luke,19,35,And they brought him to Iesus. And they cast their raymet on ye colte and set Iesus thero.
Luke,19,36,And as he wet they spredde their clothes in ye waye.
Luke,19,37,And when he was now come wheare he shuld goo doune fro the moute olivete ye whole multitude of ye disciples began to reioyce and to lawde God with a loude voyce for all ye miracles yt they had sene
Luke,19,38,sayinge: Blessed be the kynge that cometh in the name of the Lorde: peace in heave and glory in the hyest.
Luke,19,39,And some of ye Pharises of the copany sayde vnto him: Master rebuke thy disciples.
Luke,19,40,He answered and sayde vnto the: I tell you yf these shuld holde their peace the stones wold crye.
Luke,19,41,And when he was come neare he behelde the citie and wept on it
Luke,19,42,sayinge: Yf thou haddest dest knowen those thinges which belonge vn thy peace eve at this thy tyme. But now are they hydde from thyne eyes.
Luke,19,43,For the dayes shall come vpo the that thy enemys shall cast a banke aboute the and copasse the rounde and kepe the in on every syde
Luke,19,44,and make the even with the grounde with thy chyldren which are in the. And they shall not leve in the one stone vpo another because thou knewest not the tyme of thy visitacion.
Luke,19,45,And he went in to the temple and begane to cast out them that solde therin and them that bought
Luke,19,46,sayinge vnto them yt is written: my housse is the housse of prayer: but ye have made it a den of theves.
Luke,19,47,And he taught dayly in the temple. The hye Prestes and the Scribes and the chefe of the people went about to destroye him:
Luke,19,48,but coulde not finde what to do. For all the people stacke by him and gave him audience.
Luke,20,1,And yt fortuned in one of those dayes as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospell: the hye prestes and the scribes came with the elders
Luke,20,2,and spake vnto him sayinge. Tell vs by what auctorite thou doest these thinges? Ether who is he yt gave ye this auctorite?
Luke,20,3,He answered and saide vnto the: I also will axe you a questio and answer me.
Luke,20,4,The baptyme of Iohn: was it from heaven or of men?
Luke,20,5,And they thought with in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heave: he will saye: why then beleved ye him not?
Luke,20,6,But and yf we shall saye of men all ye people will stone vs. For they be persuaded that Ihon is a Prophet.
Luke,20,7,And they answered that they coulde not tell whence it was.
Luke,20,8,And Iesus sayde vnto them: nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
Luke,20,9,Then begane he to put forthe to the people this similitude. A certayne man planted a vyneyarde and let it forthe to fermers and went him selfe into a straunge countre for a greate season.
Luke,20,10,And when the tyme was come he sent a servaut to his tennauntes that they shuld geve him of the frutes of the vyneyarde. And the tennauntes dyd bet him and sent him awaye empty.
Luke,20,11,And agayne he sent yet another servaunt. And they dyd bet him and foule entreated him also and sent him awaye emptye.
Luke,20,12,Moreover he sent the thyrde to and him they wouded and cast out.
Luke,20,13,Then sayde the lorde of the vyneyarde: what shall I do? I will sende my deare sonne him peradventure they will reverence when they se him.
Luke,20,14,But when the fermers sawe him they thought in them selves sayinge: this is the heyre come let vs kyll him that the inheritaunce maye be oures.
Luke,20,15,And they cast him out of the vyneyarde and kylled him. Now what shall the Lorde of the vyneyarde do vnto them?
Luke,20,16,He will come and destroye those fermers and will let out his vyneyarde to other. When they hearde that they sayde: God forbyd.
Luke,20,17,And he behelde them and sayde: what meaneth this then yt is wrytten: The stone that the bylders refused the same is made ye heed corner stone?
Luke,20,18,whosoever stomble at that stone shalbe broken: but on whosoever it faul vpon it wyll grynde him to powder.
Luke,20,19,And the hye Prestes and the Scribes the same howre went about to laye hondes on him but they feared the people. For they perceaved that he had spoken this similitude agaynst them.
Luke,20,20,And they watched him and sent forth spies which shuld fayne them selves perfecte to take him in his wordes and to delyvre him vnto the power and auctorite of the debite.
Luke,20,21,And they axed him sayinge: Master we knowe that thou sayest and teachest ryght nother cosiderest thou eny manes degre but teachest the waye of God truly.
Luke,20,22,Ys it laufull for vs to geve Cesar tribute or no?
Luke,20,23,He perceaved their craftynes and sayde vnto them: why tept ye me?
Luke,20,24,Shewe me a peny. Whose ymage and superscripcio hath it? They answered and sayde: Cesars.
Luke,20,25,And he sayde vnto them: Geve then vnto Cesar that which belongeth vnto Cesar: and to God that which pertayneth to God.
Luke,20,26,And they coulde not reprove his sayinge before the people. But they marvayled at his answer and helde their peace.
Luke,20,27,Then came to him certayne of the Saduces which denye that ther is eny resurreccio. And they axed him
Luke,20,28,sayinge: Master Moses wrote vnto vs if eny mannes brother dye havinge a wyfe and the same dye with out yssue: that then his brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seede vnto his brother.
Luke,20,29,Ther were seven brethren and the fyrste toke a wyfe and dyed with out children.
Luke,20,30,And the seconde toke the wyfe and he dyed chyldlesse.
Luke,20,31,And the thyrde toke her and in lyke wyse the resydue of the seven and leeft no chyldren be hynde them and dyed.
Luke,20,32,Last of all the woma dyed also.
Luke,20,33,Now at the resurreccio whose wyfe of them shall she be? For seven had her to wyfe.
Luke,20,34,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them. The chyldre of this worlde mary wyves and are maryed
Luke,20,35,but they which shalbe made worthy to enioye that worlde and the resurreccion from deeth nether mary wyves nether are maryed
Luke,20,36,nor yet can dye eny moare. For they are equall vnto the angels: and are the sonnes of God in as moche as they are the chyldre of the resurreccion.
Luke,20,37,And that the deed shall ryse agayne even Moses signified besydes the busshe when he sayde: the Lorde God of Adraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Iacob.
Luke,20,38,For he is not the God of the deed but of them which live. For all live in him.
Luke,20,39,Then certayne of the Pharises answered and sayde: Master thou hast well sayde.
Luke,20,40,And after that durst they not axe him eny question at all.
Luke,20,41, Then sayde he vnto them: how saye they that Christ is Davids sonne?
Luke,20,42,And David him selfe sayth in the boke of the Psalmes: The Lorde sayde vnto my Lorde syt on my right honde
Luke,20,43,tyll I make thine enemys thy fothe stole.
Luke,20,44,Seinge David calleth him Lorde: How is he then his sonne.
Luke,20,45,Then in the audience of all the people he sayde vnto his disciples
Luke,20,46,beware of the Scribes which desyre to goo in longe clothinge: and love gretynges in the markets and the hyest seates in the synagoges and chefe roumes at feastes
Luke,20,47,which devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of longe prayinge: the same shall receave greater damnacion.
Luke,21,1,As he behelde he sawe the ryche men how they cast in their offeringes into the treasury.
Luke,21,2,And he sawe also a certayne povre widdowe which cast in thyther two mites.
Luke,21,3,And he sayde: of a trueth I saye vnto you this poore wyddowe hath put in moare then they all.
Luke,21,4,For they all have of their superfluyte added vnto the offerynge of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the substaunce that she had.
Luke,21,5,As some spake of the teple how it was garnesshed with goodly stones and iewels he sayde.
Luke,21,6,The dayes will come whe of these thynges which ye se shall not be lefte stone apon stone that shall not be throwen doune.
Luke,21,7,And they axed him sayinge: Master whe shall these thinges be and what signe will therbe whe suche thinges shall come to passe.
Luke,21,8,And he sayd: take hede that ye be not deceaved. For many will come in my name saying: I am he: and the tyme draweth neare. Folowe ye not them therfore.
Luke,21,9,But when ye heare of warre and of dissencion: be not afrayd. For these thinges must fyrst come: but the ende foloweth not by and by.
Luke,21,10,Then sayd he vnto the: Nacion shall ryse agaynst nacion and kingdom agaynst kyngdome
Luke,21,11,and greate erthquakes shall be in all quarters and honger and pestilence: and fearfull thinges. And greate signes shall therbe from heven.
Luke,21,12,But before all these they shall laye their hondes on you and persecute you delyueringe you vp to the sinagoges and into preson and bringe you before kynges and rulers for my names sake.
Luke,21,13,And this shall chaunce you for a testimoniall.
Luke,21,14,Let it sticke therfore faste in youre hertes not once to stody before what ye shall answere:
Luke,21,15,for I will geve you a mouth and wisdome where agaynste all youre adversarys shall not be able to speake nor resist.
Luke,21,16,Ye and ye shalbe betrayed of youre fathers and mothers and of youre brethren and kynsmen and lovers aud some of you shall they put to deeth.
Luke,21,17,And hated shall ye be of all men for my names sake.
Luke,21,18,Yet ther shall not one heer of youre heedes perisshe.
Luke,21,19,With youre pacience possesse youre soules.
Luke,21,20, And when ye se Ierusalem beseged with an hoste then vnderstonde that the desolacio of the same is nye.
Luke,21,21,Then let them which are in Iewrye flye to the mountaynes. And let them which are in the middes of it departe oute. And let not them that are in other countreis enter ther in.
Luke,21,22,For these be the dayes of vengeance to fulfill all that are writte.
Luke,21,23,But wo be to them that be with chylde and to them that geve sucke in those dayes: for ther shalbe greate trouble in the londe and wrath over all this people.
Luke,21,24,And they shall fall on the edge of the swearde and shalbe leed captive into all nacions. And Ierusalem shalbe trooden vnder fote of the gentyls vntyll the tyme of the gentyls be fulfilled.
Luke,21,25, And ther shalbe signes in the sunne ad in the mone and in the starres: and in ye erth the people shalbe in soche perplexite yt they shall not tell which waye to turne them selves. The see and the waters shall roore
Luke,21,26,and menes hertes shall fayle them for feare and for lokinge after thoose thinges which shall come on the erth. For the powers of heve shall move.
Luke,21,27,And then shall they se the sonne of ma come in a clowde with power and greate glory.
Luke,21,28,When these thinges begyn to come to passe: then loke vp and lifte vp youre heddes for youre redemcion draweth neye.
Luke,21,29,And he shewed the a similitude: beholde ye fygge tree and all other trees
Luke,21,30,when they shute forth their buddes ye se and knowe of youre awne selves that sommer is then nye at hod.
Luke,21,31,So lyke wyse ye (when ye se these thinges come to passe) vnderstonde that the kyngdome of God is neye.
Luke,21,32,Verely I saye vnto you: this generacion shall not passe tyll all be fulfilled.
Luke,21,33,Heaven and erth shall passe: but my wordes shall not passe.
Luke,21,34, Take hede to youre selves lest youre hertes be overcome with surfettinge and dronkennes and cares of this worlde: and that that daye come on you vnwares.
Luke,21,35,For as a snare shall it come on all them that sit on the face of the erthe.
Luke,21,36,Watche therfore continually and praye that ye maye obtayne grace to flye all this that shall come and that ye maye stonde before the sonne of man.
Luke,21,37,In the daye tyme he taught in the temple and at night he went out and had abydinge in the mount olivete.
Luke,21,38,And all the people came in the morninge to him in the temple for to heare him.
Luke,22,1,The feaste of swete breed drue nye whiche is called ester
Luke,22,2,and the hye prestes and Scribes sought how to kyll him but they feared the people.
Luke,22,3,Then entred Satan into Iudas whose syr name was Iscariot (which was of the nombre of the twelve)
Luke,22,4,and he went his waye and comuned with the hye Prestes and officers how he might betraye him to them.
Luke,22,5,And they were glad: and promysed to geve him money.
Luke,22,6,And he consented and sought oportunite to betraye him vnto them when the people were awaye.
Luke,22,7,Then came ye daye of swete breed when of necessite the esterlambe must be offered.
Luke,22,8,And he sent Peter and Iohn sayinge: Goo and prepare vs the ester lambe that we maye eate.
Luke,22,9,They sayde to him. Where wilt thou yt we prepare?
Luke,22,10,And he sayd vnto them. Beholde when ye be entred into the cite ther shall a man mete you bearinge a pitcher of water him folowe into the same housse yt he entreth in
Luke,22,11,and saye vnto ye good ma of ye housse. The master sayeth vnto ye: where is ye gest chamber where I shall eate myne ester lambe wt my disciples?
Luke,22,12,And he shall shew you a greate parloure paved. Ther make redy.
Luke,22,13,And they wet and foude as he had sayd vnto the: and made redy ye ester lambe.
Luke,22,14, And when the houre was come he sate doune and the twelve Apostles with him.
Luke,22,15,And he sayde vnto them: I have inwardly desyred to eate this ester lambe with you before yt I suffre.
Luke,22,16,For I saye vnto you: hence forthe I will not eate of it eny moore vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God.
Luke,22,17,And he toke the cup and gave thankes and sayde. Take this and devyde it amonge you.
Luke,22,18,For I saye vnto you: I will not drinke of the frute of the vyne vntill the kingdome of God be come.
Luke,22,19,And he toke breed gave thankes and gave to them sayinge: This is my body which is geven for you. This do in the remembraunce of me.
Luke,22,20,Lykewyse also when they had supped he toke the cup sayinge: This cup is the newe testament in my bloud which shall for you be shedde.
Luke,22,21,Yet beholde the honde of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
Luke,22,22,And ye sonne of man goeth as it is appoynted: But wo be to yt man by whom he is betrayed.
Luke,22,23,And they began to enquyre amoge them selves which of them it shuld be that shuld do that.
Luke,22,24, And ther was a stryfe amoge the which of them shuld be taken for the greatest.
Luke,22,25,And he sayde vnto them: the kynges of the getyls raygne over them and they that beare rule over them are called gracious lordes.
Luke,22,26,But ye shall not be so. But he that is greatest amonge you shalbe as the yongest: and he that is chefe shalbe as the minister.
Luke,22,27,For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate: or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meate? And I am amoge you as he that ministreth.
Luke,22,28,Ye are they which have bidden with me in my temptacions.
Luke,22,29,And I apoynt vnto you a kyngdome as my father hath appoynted to me:
Luke,22,30,that ye maye eate and drynke at my table in my kyngdome and sit on seates and iudge the twelve tribes of Israell.
Luke,22,31,And the Lorde sayde: Simon Simon beholde Satan hath desired you to sifte you as it were wheate:
Luke,22,32,bnt I have prayed for the that thy faith fayle not. And when thou arte converted strengthe thy brethre.
Luke,22,33,And he sayd vnto him. Lorde I am redy to go with the in to preson and to deth.
Luke,22,34,And he sayde: I tell the Peter the cocke shall not crowe this daye tyll thou have thryse denyed yt thou knewest me.
Luke,22,35, And he sayde vnto them: when I sent you with out wallet and scripe and shoes? lacked ye eny thinge? And they sayd no.
Luke,22,36,And he sayde to them: but nowe he that hath a wallet let him take it vp and lykewyse his scrippe. And he that hath no swearde let him sell his coote and bye one.
Luke,22,37,For I saye vnto you that yet that which is written must be performed in me: even with the wycked was he nombred. For those thinges which are written of me have an ende.
Luke,22,38,And they sayde: Lorde beholde here are two sweardes. And he sayde vnto them: it is ynough.
Luke,22,39,And he came out and went as he was wote to mounte olivete. And the disciples folowed him.
Luke,22,40,And when he came to the place he sayde to the: praye lest ye fall into temptacio.
Luke,22,41,And he gate him selfe from them about a stones cast and kneled doune and prayed
Luke,22,42,sayinge: Father yf thou wilt withdrawe this cup fro me. Neverthelesse not my will but thyne be be fulfilled.
Luke,22,43,And ther appered an angell vnto him from heaven confortinge him.
Luke,22,44,And he was in an agonye and prayed somwhat longer. And hys sweate was lyke droppes of bloud tricklynge doune to the grounde.
Luke,22,45,And he rose vp from prayer and came to his disciples and foude them slepinge for sorowe
Luke,22,46,and sayde vnto them: Why slepe ye? Ryse and praye lest ye fall into temptacion.
Luke,22,47,Whill he yet spake: beholde ther came a company and he that was called Iudas one of the twelve wet before them and preased nye vnto Iesus to kysse him.
Luke,22,48,And Iesus sayd vnto him: Iudas betrayest thou ye sonne of man with a kysse?
Luke,22,49,When they which were about him sawe what wolde folow they sayde vnto him. Lorde shall we smite with swearde.
Luke,22,50,And one of them smote a servaut of ye hiest preste of all and smote of his right eare.
Luke,22,51,And Iesus answered and sayd: Soffre ye thus farre forthe. And he touched his eare and healed him.
Luke,22,52,Then Iesus sayde vnto the hye prestes and rulers of the temple and the elders which were come to him. Be ye come out as vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves?
Luke,22,53,When I was dayly with you in the teple ye stretched not forth hondes agaynst me. But this is even youre very houre and the power of darcknes.
Luke,22,54,Then toke they him and ledde him and brought him to the hye prestes housse. And peter folowed a farre of.
Luke,22,55,When they had kyndled a fyre in the middes of the palys and were set doune to geder Peter also sate doune amonge them.
Luke,22,56,And wone of the wenches behelde him as he sate by the fyer and set good eyesight on him and sayde: this same was also with him.
Luke,22,57,Then he denyed hym sayinge: woman I knowe him not
Luke,22,58,And after a lytell whyle another sawe him and sayde: thou arte also of them. And Peter sayd man I am not.
Luke,22,59,And aboute the space of an houre after another affirmed sayinge: verely even this felowe was with hym for he is of Galile
Luke,22,60,and Peter sayde: ma I woote not what thou sayest. And immediatly whyll he yet spake the cocke crewe.
Luke,22,61,And the Lorde tourned backe and loked apon Peter. And Peter remembred the wordes of the Lorde how he sayde vnto him before ye cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse.
Luke,22,62,And Peter went out and wepte bitterly.
Luke,22,63,And the men that stode about Iesus mocked him and smoote him
Luke,22,64,and blyndfolded him and smoote his face. And axed him sayinge: arede who it is that smoote ye?
Luke,22,65,And many other thinges despytfullye sayd they agaynst him.
Luke,22,66,And assone as it was daye the elders of the people and the hye prestes and scribes came to gedder and ledde him into their counsell sayinge:
Luke,22,67,arte thou very Christ? tell vs. And he sayde vnto the: yf I shall tell you ye will not beleve
Luke,22,68,And yf also I axe you ye will not answere me or let me goo.
Luke,22,69,Herafter shall the sonne of man sit on the ryght honde of the power of God.
Luke,22,70,Then sayde they all: Arte thou then the sonne of God? He sayd to them: ye saye yt I am.
Luke,22,71,Then sayde they: what nede we eny further witnes? We oure selves have herde of his awne mouthe.
Luke,23,1,And the whole multitude of them arose and ledde him vnto Pylate.
Luke,23,2,And they beganne to accuse him sayinge: We have founde this felowe pervertynge the people and forbiddynge to paye tribute to Cesar: sayinge that he is Christ a kynge.
Luke,23,3,And Pylate apposed him sayinge: arte thou the kynge of the iewes? He answered him and sayde: thou sayest it.
Luke,23,4,Then sayde Pylate to the hye prestes and to the people: I fynde noo faute in this man.
Luke,23,5,And they were the moore fearce sayinge. He moveth the people teachynge thorowout all Iewry and beganne at Galile even to this place.
Luke,23,6,When Pilate hearde mencion of Galile he axed whether the ma were of Galile.
Luke,23,7,And assone as he knewe that he was of Herodes iurisdiccion he sent him to Herode which was also at Ierusalem in those dayes.
Luke,23,8,And when Herode sawe Iesus he was excedinglie gladde. For he was desyrous to se him of a longe season because he had hearde many thinges of him and trusted to have sene some myracle done by him.
Luke,23,9,Then questeoned he with him of many thinges. But he answered him not one worde.
Luke,23,10,The hye prestes and scribes stode forthe and accused him straytly.
Luke,23,11,And Herod wt his men of warre despysed him and mocked him and arayed him in whyte and sent him agayne to Pylate.
Luke,23,12,And the same daye Pylate and Herod were made frendes togeder. For before they were at variaunce.
Luke,23,13,And Pylate called to geder the hye prestes and the rulers and the people
Luke,23,14,and sayde vnto them: Ye have brought this man vnto me as one that perverted the people. And beholde I have examined him before you and have founde no faute in this man of those thinges where of ye accuse him.
Luke,23,15,No nor yet Herode. For I sent you to him: and lo no thinge worthy of deeth is done to him.
Luke,23,16,I will therfore chasten him and let him lowsse.
Luke,23,17,For of necessite he must have let one lowse vnto them at that feast.
Luke,23,18,And all the people cryed at once sayinge: awaye with him and delyvre to vs Barrabas:
Luke,23,19,which for insurrccion made in the cite and morther was cast into preson.
Luke,23,20,Pylate spake agayne to them willynge to let Iesus lowse.
Luke,23,21,And they cryed sayinge: Crucify him Crucify him
Luke,23,22,He sayde vnto them the thyrde tyme. What evyll hath he done? I fynde no cause of deeth in him. I will therfore chasten him and let him lowse.
Luke,23,23,And they cryed with loude voyce and required that he myght be crucifyed. And the voyce of them and of the hye Prestes prevayled.
Luke,23,24,And Pylate gave sentence that it shuld be as they required
Luke,23,25,and let lowse vnto them him that for insurreccion and morther was cast into preson whom they desyred: and delyvered Iesus to do with him what they wolde.
Luke,23,26,And as they ledde him awaye they caught one Symon of Syrene commynge out of the felde: and on him layde they the crosse to beare it after Iesus.
Luke,23,27,And ther folowed him a greate company of people and of wemen which weme bewayled and lamented him.
Luke,23,28,But Iesus turned backe vnto them and sayde: Doughters of Ierusalem wepe not for me: but wepe for youre selves and for youre chyldren.
Luke,23,29,For beholde the dayes will come when men shall saye: happy are the baren and the wombes that never bare and the pappes which never gave sucke.
Luke,23,30,Then shall they beginne to saye to the mountaynes fall on vs: and to the hilles cover vs.
Luke,23,31,For yf they do this to a grene tree what shalbe done to the drye?
Luke,23,32,And ther were two evyll doers ledde with him to be slayne.
Luke,23,33,And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the evyll doers one on ryght honde and the other on the lefte.
Luke,23,34,Then sayde Iesus: father forgeve them for they woot not what they do. And they parted his rayment and cast loottes.
Luke,23,35,And the people stode and behelde. And the rulers mocked him with thee saying: he holpe other men let him helpe him selfe yf he be Christ the chosen of god.
Luke,23,36,The soudiers also mocked him and came and gave him veneger
Luke,23,37,and sayde: yf thou be that kynge of ye Iewes save thy silfe.
Luke,23,38,And his superscripcio was writte over him in greke in latine and Ebreu: This is the kynge of the Iewes.
Luke,23,39,And one of the evyll doers which hanged rayled on him sayinge: If thou be Christ save thy selfe and vs.
Luke,23,40,The other answered and rebuked him sayinge. Net herfearest thou god because thou arte in the same damnacion?
Luke,23,41,We are ryghteously punesshed for we receave accordynge to oure dedes: But this man hath done nothinge amysse.
Luke,23,42,And he sayde vnto Iesus: Lorde remember me when thou comest into thy kyngdome.
Luke,23,43,And Iesus sayde vnto him: Verely I saye vnto the to daye shalt thou be with me in Paradyse.
Luke,23,44,And it was about the sixt houre. And ther came a darcknes over all the londe vntyll ye nynth houre
Luke,23,45,and the sonne was darckened. And the vayle of the temple dyd rent even thorow the myddes.
Luke,23,46,And Iesus cryed with a greate voyce and sayd: Father into thy hondes I comende my sprete. And when he thus had sayd he gave vp the goost.
Luke,23,47,When ye Centurion sawe what had happened he glorified God sayinge: Of a surtie this man was perfecte.
Luke,23,48,And all the people that came to geder to that sight beholdynge the thinges which were done: smoote their bestes and returned home.
Luke,23,49,And all his acquayntaunce and the wemen that folowed him from Galile stode a farre of beholdynge these thinges.
Luke,23,50,And beholde ther was a man named Ioseph a councelloure and was a good man and a iuste
Luke,23,51,and dyd not consent to the counsell and dede of them which was of Aramathia a cite of the Iewes: which same also wayted for ye kyngdome of God:
Luke,23,52,he went vnto Pilate and begged the boddy of Iesus
Luke,23,53,and toke it doune and wrapped it in a lynnen clooth and layed it in an hewen toumbe wherin was never man before layed.
Luke,23,54,And that daye was ye Saboth even and the Saboth drue on.
Luke,23,55,The wemen that folowed after which came with him from Galile behelde the sepulcre and how his body was layed.
Luke,23,56,And they returned and prepared odoures and oyntmetes: but rested the Saboth daye accordynge to the commaundement.
Luke,24,1,On the morowe after the saboth erly in the morninge they came vnto the toumbe and brought the odoures which they had prepared and other wemen with them
Luke,24,2,And they founde the stone rouled awaye fro the sepulcre
Luke,24,3,and went in: but founde not the body of the Lorde Iesu.
Luke,24,4,And it happened as they were amased therat: Beholde two men stode by them in shynynge vestures.
Luke,24,5,And as they were a frayde and bowed doune their faces to the erth: they sayd to them: why seke ye the lyvinge amonge the deed?
Luke,24,6,He is not here: but is rysen. Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet with you in Galile
Luke,24,7,sayinge: that the sonne of man must be delyvered into the hondes of synfull men and be crucified and the thyrde daye ryse agayne.
Luke,24,8,And they remembred his wordes
Luke,24,9,and returned from the sepulcre and tolde all these thinges vnto the eleven and to all the remanaunt.
Luke,24,10,It was Mary Magdalen and Ioanna and Mary Iacobi and other that were with the which tolde these thinges vnto the Apostles
Luke,24,11,and their wordes semed vnto them fayned thinges nether beleved they them.
Luke,24,12,Then aroose Peter and ran vnto the sepulcre and stouped in and sawe the lynnen cloothes layde by them selfe and departed wondrynge in him selfe at that which had happened.
Luke,24,13,And beholde two of them went that same daye to a toune which was fro Ierusalem about thre scoore for longes called Emaus:
Luke,24,14,and they talked togeder of all these thinges that had happened.
Luke,24,15,And it chaunsed as they comened togeder and reasoned that Iesus him selfe drue neare and went with them.
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were holden that they coulde not knowe him.
Luke,24,17,And he sayde vnto them: What maner of comunicacions are these that ye have one to another as ye walke and are sadde.
Luke,24,18,And the one of them named Cleophas answered and sayd vnto him: arte thou only a straunger in Ierusalem and haste not knowen the thinges which have chaunsed therin in these dayes?
Luke,24,19,To whom he sayd: what thinges? And they sayd vnto him: of Iesus of Nazareth which was a Prophet myghtie in dede and worde before god and all the people.
Luke,24,20,And how the hye prestes and oure rulers delyvered him to be condempned to deeth: and have crucified him.
Luke,24,21,But we trusted that it shuld have bene he that shuld have delyvered Israel. And as touchynge all these thinges to daye is even the thyrd daye that they were done.
Luke,24,22,Ye and certayne wemen also of oure company made vs astonyed which came erly vnto the sepulcre
Luke,24,23,and founde not his boddy: and came sayinge that they had sene a vision of angels which sayde that he was alyve.
Luke,24,24,And certayne of them which were with vs went their waye to the sepulcre and founde it even so as the wemen had sayde: but him they sawe not.
Luke,24,25,And he sayde vnto the: O foles and slowe of herte to beleve all yt the prophetes have spoken.
Luke,24,26,Ought not Christ to have suffred these thinges and to enter into his glory?
Luke,24,27,And he began at Moses and at all the prophetes and interpreted vnto them in all scriptures which were wrytten of him.
Luke,24,28,And they drue neye vnto the toune wich they went to. And he made as though he wolde have gone further.
Luke,24,29,But they constrayned him sayinge: abyde with vs for it draweth towardes nyght and the daye is farre passed. And he went in to tary with the.
Luke,24,30,And it came to passe as he sate at meate wt them he toke breed blessed it brake and gave to them.
Luke,24,31,And their eyes were openned and they knewe him: and he vnnisshed out of their syght.
Luke,24,32,And they sayde betwene them selves: dyd not oure hertes burne with in vs whyll he talked with vs by the waye and as he opened to vs the scriptures?
Luke,24,33,And they roose vp the same houre and returned agayne to Ierusalem and founde the eleven gadered to geder and them that were with them which
Luke,24,34,sayde: the Lorde is rysen in dede and hath apered to Simon.
Luke,24,35,And they tolde what thinges was done in the waye and how they knewe him in breakynge of breed.
Luke,24,36,As they thus spake Iesus him selfe stode in ye myddes of them and sayde vnto them: peace be with you.
Luke,24,37,And they were abasshed and afrayde supposinge yt they had sene a sprete
Luke,24,38,And he sayde vnto the: Why are ye troubled and why do thoughtes aryse in youre hertes?
Luke,24,39,Beholde my hondes and my fete that it is even my selfe. Handle me and se: for spretes have not flesshe and bones as ye se me have.
Luke,24,40,And when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hondes and his fete.
Luke,24,41,And whyll they yet beleved not for ioye and wondred he sayde vnto the: Have ye here eny meate?
Luke,24,42,And they gave him a pece of a broyled fisshe and of an hony combe.
Luke,24,43,And he toke it and ate it before them.
Luke,24,44,And he sayde vnto the. These are the wordes which I spake vnto you whyll I was yet with you: that all must be fulfilled which were written of me in the lawe of Moses and in the Prophetes and in the Psalmes.
Luke,24,45,Then openned he their wyttes that they myght vnderstond the scriptures
Luke,24,46,and sayde vnto them. Thus is it written and thus it behoved Christ to suffre and to ryse agayne from deeth the thyrde daye
Luke,24,47,and that repentaunce and remission of synnes shuld be preached in his name amonge all nacions and must beginne at Ierusalem.
Luke,24,48,And ye are witnesses of these thinges.
Luke,24,49,And beholde I will sende the promes of my father apon you. But tary ye in ye cite of Ierusalem vntyll ye be endewed with power from an hye.
Luke,24,50,And he ledde the out into Bethany and lyfte vp his hondes and blest them.
Luke,24,51,And it cam to passe as he blessed the he departed from the and was caryed vp in to heven.
Luke,24,52,And they worshipped him and returned to Ierusalem with greate ioye
Luke,24,53,and were continually in the temple praysinge and laudinge God. Amen.
John,1,1,In the beginnynge was the worde and the worde was with God: and the worde was God.
John,1,2,The same was in the beginnynge with God.
John,1,3,All thinges were made by it and with out it was made nothinge that was made.
John,1,4,In it was lyfe and the lyfe was ye lyght of men
John,1,5,and the lyght shyneth in the darcknes but the darcknes comprehended it not.
John,1,6,There was a man sent from God whose name was Iohn.
John,1,7,The same cam as a witnes to beare witnes of the lyght that all men through him myght beleve.
John,1,8,He was not that lyght: but to beare witnes of the lyght.
John,1,9,That was a true lyght which lyghteth all men that come into the worlde.
John,1,10,He was in ye worlde and the worlde was made by him: and yet the worlde knewe him not.
John,1,11,He cam amonge his (awne) and his awne receaved him not.
John,1,12,But as meny as receaved him to them he gave power to be the sonnes of God in yt they beleved on his name:
John,1,13,which were borne not of bloude nor of the will of the flesshe nor yet of the will of man: but of God.
John,1,14,And the worde was made flesshe and dwelt amonge vs and we sawe the glory of it as the glory of the only begotten sonne of ye father which worde was full of grace and verite.
John,1,15,Iohn bare witnes of him and cryed sayinge: This was he of whome I spake he that cometh after me was before me because he was yer then I.
John,1,16,And of his fulnes have all we receaved even (grace) for grace.
John,1,17,For the lawe was geven by Moses but grace and truthe came by Iesus Christ.
John,1,18,No ma hath sene God at eny tyme. The only begotte sonne which is in ye bosome of ye father he hath declared him.
John,1,19,And this is the recorde of Iohn: When the Iewes sent Prestes and Levites from Ierusalem to axe him what arte thou?
John,1,20,And he confessed and denyed not and sayde playnly: I am not Christ.
John,1,21,And they axed him: what then? arte thou Helyas? And he sayde: I am not. Arte thou a Prophete? And he answered no.
John,1,22,Then sayd they vnto him: what arte thou that we maye geve an answer to them that sent vs: What sayest thou of thy selfe?
John,1,23,He sayde: I am the voyce of a cryar in the wyldernes make strayght the waye of the Lorde as sayde the Prophete Esaias.
John,1,24,And they which were sent were of the pharises.
John,1,25,And they axed him and sayde vnto him: why baptisest thou then yf thou be not Christ nor Helyas nether a Prophet?
John,1,26,Iohn answered them sayinge: I baptise with water: but one is come amonge you whom ye knowe not
John,1,27,he it is that cometh after me whiche was before me whose sho latchet I am not worthy to vnlose.
John,1,28,These thinges were done in Bethabara beyonde Iordan where Iohn dyd baptyse.
John,1,29,The nexte daye Iohn sawe Iesus commyge vnto him and sayde: beholde the lambe of God which taketh awaye the synne of the worlde.
John,1,30,This is he of whom I sayde. After me cometh a man which was before me for he was yer then I
John,1,31,and I knew him not: but that he shuld be declared to Israell therfore am I come baptisynge with water.
John,1,32,And Iohn bare recorde sayinge: I sawe the sprete descende from heven lyke vnto a dove and abyde apon him
John,1,33,and I knewe him not. But he that sent me to baptise in water the same sayde vnto me: apon whom thou shalt se the sprete descende and tary styll on him the same is he which baptiseth with the holy goost.
John,1,34,And I sawe and bare recorde that this is the sonne of God.
John,1,35,The next daye after Iohn stode agayne and two of his disciples.
John,1,36,And he behelde Iesus as he walked by and sayde: beholde the lambe of God.
John,1,37,And the two disciples hearde him speake and folowed Iesus.
John,1,38,And Iesus turned about and sawe them folowe and sayde vnto them: what seke ye? They sayde vnto him: Rabbi (which is to saye by interpretacion Master) where dwellest thou?
John,1,39,He sayde vnto them: come and se. They came and sawe where he dwelt: and abode with him that daye. For it was about the tenthe houre.
John,1,40,One of the two which hearde Iohn speake and folowed Iesus was Andrew Simon Peters brother.
John,1,41,The same founde his brother Simon fyrst and sayde vnto him: we have founde Messias which is by interpretacion annoynted:
John,1,42,and brought him to Iesus. And Iesus behelde him and sayde: thou arte Simon the sonne of Ionas thou shalt be called Cephas: which is by interpretacion a stone.
John,1,43,The daye folowynge Iesus wolde goo into Galile and founde Philip and sayde vnto him folowe me.
John,1,44,Philip was of Bethsaida the cite of Andrew and Peter.
John,1,45,And Philip founde Nathanael and sayde vnto him. We have founde him of whom Moses in the lawe and the prophetes dyd wryte. Iesus the sonne of Ioseph of Nazareth.
John,1,46,And Nathanael sayde vnto him: can ther eny good thinge come out of Nazareth? Philip sayde to him: come and se.
John,1,47,Iesus sawe Nathanael commynge to him and sayde of him. Beholde a ryght Israelite in who is no gyle.
John,1,48,Nathanael sayd vnto him: where knewest thou me? Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Before that Philip called the when thou wast vnder ye fygge tree I sawe the.
John,1,49,Nathanael answered and sayde vnto him: Rabbi thou arte the sonne of God thou arte the kynge of Israel.
John,1,50,Iesus answered and sayd vnto him: Because I sayde vnto the I sawe the vnder the fygge tree thou belevest. Thou shalt se greater thinges then these.
John,1,51,And he sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto you: herafter shall ye se heven open and the angels of God ascendynge and descendynge over the sonne of man.
John,2,1,And the thryde daye was ther a mariage in Cana a cite of Galile: and the mother of Iesus was there.
John,2,2,And Iesus was called also and his disciples vnto the mariage.
John,2,3,And when the wyne fayled the mother of Iesus sayde vnto him: they have no wyne.
John,2,4,Iesus sayde vnto her: woman what have I to do with the? myne houre is not yet come.
John,2,5,His mother sayde vnto the ministres: whatsoever he sayeth vnto you do it.
John,2,6,And therwere stondynge theare sixe water pottes of stone after ye maner of the purifyinge of ye Iewes contaynynge two or thre fyrkins a pece.
John,2,7,And Iesus sayde vnto them: fyll the water pottes with water. And they fylled them vp to the brym.
John,2,8,And he sayde vnto them: drawe out now and beare vnto the governer of the feaste. And they bare it.
John,2,9,When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was turned vnto wyne and knewe not whence it was (but the ministres which drue the water knew). He called the brydegrome
John,2,10,and sayde vnto him. All men at the beginnynge set forth good wyne and when men be dronke then that which is worsse. But thou hast kept backe the good wyne vntyll now.
John,2,11,This beginnynge of miracles dyd Iesus in Cana of Galile and shewed his glory and his disciples beleved on him.
John,2,12,After that he descended in to Capernaum and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: but contynued not manye dayes there.
John,2,13,And the Iewes ester was even at honde and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem
John,2,14,and founde syttynge in the temple those that solde oxen and shepe and doves and chaungers of money.
John,2,15,And he made a scourge of small cordes and drave them all out of the temple with the shepe and oxen and powred oute the changers money and overthrue the tables
John,2,16,and sayde vnto them that solde doves: Have these thinges hence and make not my fathers housse an housse of marchaundyse.
John,2,17,And his disciples remembred how yt it was wrytten: the zele of thyne housse hath even eaten me.
John,2,18,Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him: what token shewest thou vnto vs seynge that thou dost these thinges?
John,2,19,Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: destroye this temple and in thre dayes I will reare it vp agayne.
John,2,20,Then sayde the Iewes: xlvi. yeares was this temple abuyldinge: and wylt thou reare it vp in thre dayes?
John,2,21,But he spake of the temple of his body.
John,2,22,Assone therfore as he was rysen from deeth agayne his disciples remembred that he thus sayde. And they beleved the scripture and the wordes which Iesus had sayde.
John,2,23,When he was at Ierusalem at ester in the feaste many beleved on his name when they sawe his miracles which he dyd.
John,2,24,But Iesus put not him selfe in their hondes because he knewe all men
John,2,25,and neded not that eny man shuld testify of man. For he knewe what was in man.
John,3,1,Ther was a man of the pharises named Nicodemus a ruler amonge ye Iewes.
John,3,2,The same cam to Iesus by nyght and sayde vnto him: Rabbi we knowe that thou arte a teacher whiche arte come from God. For no man coulde do suche miracles as thou doest except God were with him.
John,3,3,Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto the: except a man be boren a newe he cannot se the kyngdom of God.
John,3,4,Nicodemus sayde vnto him: how can a man be boren when he is olde? can he enter into his moders wombe and be boren agayne?
John,3,5,Iesus answered: verely verely I saye vnto the: except that a man be boren of water and of ye sprete he cannot enter into the kyngdome of god.
John,3,6,That which is boren of the flesshe is flesshe: and that which is boren of the sprete is sprete.
John,3,7,Marvayle not that I sayd to the ye must be boren a newe.
John,3,8,The wynde bloweth where he listeth and thou hearest his sounde: but canst not tell whence he cometh and whether he goeth. So is every man that is boren of the sprete.
John,3,9,And Nicodemus answered and sayde vnto him: how can these thinges be?
John,3,10,Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: arte thou a master in Israel and knowest not these thinges?
John,3,11,Verely verely I saye vnto the we speake that we knowe and testify that we have sene: and ye receave not oure witnes.
John,3,12,Yf when I tell you erthely thinges ye beleve not: how shuld ye beleve yf I shall tell you of hevenly thinges?
John,3,13,And no man ascendeth vp to heaven but he that came doune from heaven that is to saye the sonne of man which is in heaven.
John,3,14,And as Moses lifte vp the serpent in the wyldernes even so must the sonne of man be lifte vp
John,3,15,that none that beleveth in him perisshe: but have eternall lyfe.
John,3,16,For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe.
John,3,17,For God sent not his sonne into the worlde to condepne the worlde: but that the worlde through him might be saved.
John,3,18,He that beleveth on him shall not be condepned. But he that beleveth not is condempned all redy be cause he beleveth not in the name of the only sonne of God.
John,3,19,And this is the condempnacion: that light is come into the worlde and the me loved darcknes more then light because their dedes were evill.
John,3,20,For every man that evyll doeth hateth the light: nether commeth to light lest his dedes shuld be reproved.
John,3,21,But he that doth truth commeth to the light that his dedes might be knowen how that they are wrought in God.
John,3,22,After these thinges cam Iesus and his disciples into the Iewes londe and ther he haunted with them and baptised.
John,3,23,And Iohn also baptised in Enon besydes Salim because ther was moche water there and they came and were baptised.
John,3,24,For Iohn was not yet cast into preson.
John,3,25,And ther arose a questio bitwene Iohns disciples and the Iewes about purifiynge.
John,3,26,And they came vnto Iohn and sayde vnto him: Rabbi he that was with the beyonde Iordan to whom thou barest witnes. Beholde the same baptyseth and all me come to him.
John,3,27,Iohn answered and sayde: a man can receave no thinge at all except it be geve him fro heaven.
John,3,28,Ye youre selves are witnesses how that I sayde: I am not Christ but am sent before him.
John,3,29,He that hath the bryde is the brydegrome. But the frende of the brydegrome which stondeth by and heareth him reioyseth greately of the brydgromes voyce. Tis my ioye is fulfilled.
John,3,30,He must increace: and I muste decreace.
John,3,31,He that commeth from an hye is above all: He that is of ye erth is of the erth and speaketh of the erth. He that cometh from heaven is above all
John,3,32,and what he hath sene and hearde: that he testifieth: but no man receaveth his testimonye.
John,3,33,How be it he that hath receaved hys testimonye hath set to his seale that God is true.
John,3,34,For he whom God hath sent speaketh the wordes of God. For God geveth not the sprete by measure.
John,3,35,The father loveth the sonne and hath geven all thinges into his honde.
John,3,36,He that beleveth on the sonne hath everlastynge lyfe: and he that beleveth not the sonne shall not se lyfe but the wrathe of God abydeth on him.
John,4,1,Assone as the Lorde had knowledge how the Pharises had hearde that Iesus made and baptised moo disciples then Iohn
John,4,2,(though that Iesus him selfe baptised not: but his disciples)
John,4,3,he lefte Iewry and departed agayne into Galile.
John,4,4,And it was so that he must nedes goo thorowe Samaria.
John,4,5,Then came he to a cyte of Samaria called Sichar besydes the possession that Iacob gave to his sonne Ioseph.
John,4,6,And there was Iacobs well. Iesus then weryed in his iorney sate thus on the well. And it was about the sixte houre:
John,4,7,and there came a woman of Samaria to drawe water. And Iesus sayde vnto her: geve me drynke.
John,4,8,For his disciples were gone awaye vnto the toune to bye meate.
John,4,9,Then sayde the woman of Samaria vnto him: how is it that thou beinge a Iewe axest drinke of me which am a Samaritane? for the Iewes medle not with the Samaritans.
John,4,10,Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir: yf thou knewest the gyfte of God and who it is that sayeth to the geve me drynke thou woldest have axed of him and he wolde have geven the water of lyfe.
John,4,11,The woman sayde vnto him. Syr thou hast no thinge to drawe with and the well is depe: from whence then hast thou yt water of lyfe?
John,4,12,Arte thou greater then oure father Iacob which gave vs the well and he him silfe dranke therof and his chyldren and his catell?
John,4,13,Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir: whosoever drinketh of this water shall thurst agayne.
John,4,14,But whosoever shall drinke of ye water yt I shall geve him shall never be more a thyrst: but the water that I shall geve him shalbe in him a well of water springinge vp in to everlastinge lyfe.
John,4,15,The woma sayd vnto him: Syr geve me of that water that I thyrst not nether come hedder to drawe.
John,4,16,Iesus sayde vnto her. Go and call thy husband and come hydder.
John,4,17,The woman answered and sayde to him: I have no husband.
John,4,18,Iesus sayde to her. Thou hast well sayd I have no husbande. For thou haste had five husbandes and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. That saydest thou truely.
John,4,19,The woman sayde vnto him: Syr I perceave yt thou arte a prophet.
John,4,20,Oure fathers worshipped in this mountayne: and ye saye that in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worshippe.
John,4,21,Iesus sayde vnto her: woman beleve me the houre cometh when ye shall nether in this moutayne nor yet at Ierusalem worshippe the father.
John,4,22,Ye worshippe ye wot not what: we knowe what we worshippe. For salvacion cometh of the Iewes.
John,4,23,But the houre commeth and nowe is when the true worshippers shall worshippe the father in sprete and in trouthe. For verely suche the father requyreth to worshippe him.
John,4,24,God is a sprete and they that worshippe him must worshippe him in sprete and trouthe.
John,4,25,The woman sayde vnto him: I wot well Messias shall come which is called Christ. When he is come he will tell vs all thinges.
John,4,26,Iesus sayde vnto hir: I that speake vnto the am he.
John,4,27,And eve at that poynte came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man sayde vnto him: what meanest thou or why talkest thou with her?
John,4,28,The woma then lefte her waterpot and went her waye into the cite and sayde to the men.
John,4,29,Come se a man which tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd. Is not he Christ?
John,4,30,Then they went ont of the cite and came vnto him.
John,4,31,And in ye meane while his disciples prayed him sayinge: Master eate.
John,4,32,He sayde vnto the: I have meate to eate that ye knowe not of.
John,4,33,Then sayd ye disciples bitwene them selves: hath eny ma brought him meate?
John,4,34,Iesus sayde vnto them: my meate is to doo the will of him that sent me. And to fynnysshe his worke.
John,4,35,Saye not ye: there are yet foure monethes and then cometh harvest? Beholde I saye vnto you lyfte vp youre eyes and loke on ye regios: for they are whyte all redy vnto harvest.
John,4,36,And he ye repeth receaveth rewarde and gaddereth frute vnto life eternall: that bothe he that soweth and he yt repeth myght reioyse to gether.
John,4,37,And herin is the sayinge true yt one soweth and another repeth.
John,4,38,I sent you to repe yt whero ye bestowed no laboure. Other men laboured and ye are entred into their labours.
John,4,39,Many of the Samaritas of that cyte beleved on him for ye sayinge of the woma which testified: he tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd.
John,4,40,Then when the Samaritas were come vnto him they besought him yt he wolde tary wt the. And he aboode there two dayes.
John,4,41,And many moo beleved because of his awne wordes
John,4,42,and sayd vnto the woman: Now we beleve not because of thy sayinge. For we have herde him oure selves and knowe that this is even in dede Christ the savioure of the worlde.
John,4,43,After two dayes he departed thence and wet awaye into Galile.
John,4,44,And Iesus him selfe testified that a Prophete hath none honoure in his awne countre.
John,4,45,Then assone as he was come into Galile the Galileans receaved him which had sene all the thinges yt he dyd at Ierusalem at ye feast. For they wet also vnto ye feast daye.
John,4,46,And Iesus came agayne into Cana of Galile wher he turned water into wyne. And ther was a certayne ruler whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum.
John,4,47,Assone as the same herde that Iesus was come out of Iewry into Galile he wet vnto him and besought him yt he wolde descende and heale his sonne: For he was eve readie to dye.
John,4,48,Then sayde Iesus vnto him: excepte ye se signes and wodres ye canot beleve.
John,4,49,The ruler sayd vnto him: Syr come awaye or ever yt my chylde dye.
John,4,50,Iesus sayde vnto him goo thy waye thy sonne liveth. And the ma beleved ye wordes yt Iesus had spoke vnto him and wet his waye.
John,4,51,And anone as he went on his waye his servantes met him and tolde him sayinge: thy chylde liveth.
John,4,52,Then enquyred he of the the houre when he begane to amende. And they sayde vnto him: Yester daye the sevethe houre the fever lefte him.
John,4,53,And the father knew that it was the same houre in which Iesus sayde vnto him: Thy sonne liveth. And he beleved and all his housholde.
John,4,54,Thys is agayne the seconde myracle yt Iesus dyd after he was come oute of Iewry into Galile.
John,5,1,After that ther was a feast of the Iewes and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem.
John,5,2,And ther is at Ierusalem by ye slaughterhousse a pole called in ye Ebrue toge Bethseda havinge five porches
John,5,3,in which laye a greate multitude of sicke folke of blinde halt and wyddered waytinge for the movinge of the water.
John,5,4,For an angell wet doune at a certayne ceason into ye pole and troubled ye water. Whosoever then fyrst after the steringe of the water stepped in was made whoale of what soever disease he had.
John,5,5,And a certayne ma was theare which had bene diseased .xxxviii. yeares
John,5,6,When Iesus sawe him lye and knewe that he now longe tyme had bene diseased he sayde vnto him. Wilt thou be made whoale?
John,5,7,The sicke answered him: Syr I have no man whe the water is troubled to put me into the pole. But in the meane tyme whill I am about to come another steppeth doune before me.
John,5,8,And Iesus sayde vnto him: ryse take vp thy beed and walke.
John,5,9,And immediatly the man was made whole and toke vp his beed and went. And the same daye was the Saboth daye
John,5,10,The Iewes therfore sayde vnto him that was made whole. It is ye Saboth daye it is not laufull for the to cary thy beed
John,5,11,He answered them: he that made me whole sayde vnto me: take vp thy beed and get the hence.
John,5,12,Then axed they him: what man is that which sayde vnto the take vp thy beed and walke.
John,5,13,And he yt was healed wist not who it was. For Iesus had gotte him selfe awaye be cause yt ther was preace of people in ye place.
John,5,14,And after that Iesus founde him in the teple and sayd vnto him: beholde thou arte made whole synne no moore lest a worsse thinge happe vnto the.
John,5,15,The man departed and tolde ye Iewes that yt was Iesus whiche had made him whole.
John,5,16,And therfore the Iewes dyd persecute Iesus and sought the meanes to slee him because he had done these thinges on the Saboth daye.
John,5,17,And Iesus answered them: my father worketh hidder to and I worke.
John,5,18,Therfore the Iewes sought the moare to kill him not only because he had broken the Saboth: but sayde also that God was his father and made him selfe equall with God.
John,5,19,Then answered Iesus and sayde vnto them: verely verely I saye vnto you: the sonne can do no thinge of him selfe but that he seeth ye father do. For whatsoever he doeth yt doeth the sonne also.
John,5,20,For the father loveth ye sonne and sheweth him all thinges whatsoever he him selfe doeth. And he will shewe him greter workes then these because ye shoulde marvayle.
John,5,21,For lykwyse as the father rayseth vp ye deed and quickeneth them even so the sonne quyckeneth whom he will.
John,5,22,Nether iudgeth ye father eny ma: but hath comitted all iudgemet vnto the sonne
John,5,23,because that all men shuld honoure the sonne eve as they honoure the father. He that honoureth not ye sonne the same honoureth not the father which hath sent him.
John,5,24,Verely verely I saye vnto you: He that heareth my wordes and beleveth on him that sent me hath everlastinge lyfe and shall not come into damnacion: but is scaped fro deth vnto lyfe.
John,5,25,Verely verely I saye vnto you: the tyme shall come and now is when the deed shall heare the voyce of the sonne of God. And they yt heare shall live.
John,5,26,For as the father hath life in him silfe: so lyke wyse hath he geven to ye sonne to have lyfe in him silfe:
John,5,27,and hath geven him power also to iudge in that he is the sonne of man.
John,5,28,Marvayle not at this ye houre shall come in the which all yt are in the graves shall heare his voice
John,5,29,and shall come forthe: they that have done good vnto the resurreccion of lyfe: and they that have done evyll vnto the resurreccion of dampnacion.
John,5,30,I can of myne awne selfe do nothinge at all. As I heare I iudge and my iudgemet is iust because I seke not myne awne will but the will of ye father which hath sent me.
John,5,31,Yf I beare witnes of my selfe my witnes is not true.
John,5,32,Ther is a nother that beareth witnes of me and I am sure that the witnes whiche he beareth of me is true.
John,5,33,Ye sent vnto Iohn and he bare witnes vnto the truthe.
John,5,34,But I receave not the recorde of man. Neverthelesse these thinges I saye that ye might be safe.
John,5,35,He was a burninge and a shyninge light and ye wolde for a season have reioysed in his light.
John,5,36,But I have greater witnes then the witnes of Iohn. For ye workes which ye father hath geve me to fynisshe: the same workes which I do beare witnes of me that ye father sent me.
John,5,37,And the father him silfe which hath sent me beareth witnes of me. Ye have not hearde his voyce at eny tyme nor ye have sene his shape:
John,5,38,therto his wordes have ye not abydinge in you. For whome he hath sent: him ye beleve not.
John,5,39,Searche the scriptures for in them ye thinke ye have eternall lyfe: and they are they which testify of me.
John,5,40,And yet will ye not come to me that ye might have lyfe.
John,5,41,I receave not prayse of men.
John,5,42,But I knowe you that ye have not the love of God in you
John,5,43,I am come in my fathers name and ye receave me not. Yf another shall come in his awne name him will ye receave.
John,5,44,How can ye beleve which receave honoure one of another and seke not the honoure that commeth of God only?
John,5,45,Doo not thinke that I wyll accuse you to my father. Ther is one that accuseth you eve Moses in whom ye trust.
John,5,46,For had ye beleved Moses ye wold have beleved me: for he wrote of me.
John,5,47,But now ye beleve not his writinge: how shall ye beleve my wordes.
John,6,1,After these thinges Iesus wet his waye over the see of Galile nye to a cyte called Tiberias.
John,6,2,And a greate multitude folowed him because they had sene his myracles which he dyd on them that were diseased.
John,6,3,And Iesus went vp into a mountayne and there he sate with his disciples.
John,6,4,And ester a feast of ye Iewes was nye.
John,6,5,Then Iesus lifte vp his eyes and sawe a greate copany come vnto him and sayde vnto Philip: whence shall we bye breed yt these might eate.
John,6,6,This he sayde to prove him: for he him sylfe knewe what he wolde do.
John,6,7,Philip answered him two hondred peny worthe of breed are not sufficient for them yt every ma have a litell.
John,6,8,Then sayde vnto him one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother.
John,6,9,There ys a lad here which hath fyve barly loves and two fisshes: but what is that amoge so many?
John,6,10,And Iesus sayde. Make the people sit doune: Ther was moche grasse in the place. And the men sate doune in nombre about five thousande.
John,6,11,And Iesus toke the breed and gave thankes and gave to the disciples and his disciples to them that were set doune. And lykwyse of the fysshes as moche as they wolde.
John,6,12,When they had eate ynough he sayd vnto his disciples: gadder vp the broke meate that remayneth: that nothinge be loost.
John,6,13,And they gadered it to geder and fylled twelve baskettes with the broken meate of the five barly loves which broken meate remayned vnto the that had eaten.
John,6,14,Then the men when they had sene the myracle that Iesus dyd sayde: This is of a trueth the Prophet that shuld come into the worlde.
John,6,15,When Iesus perceaved that they wolde come and take him vp to make him kinge he departed agayne into a mountayne him silfe a lone.
John,6,16,And when eve was come his disciples wet vnto the see
John,6,17,and entred into a shyppe and went over the see vnto Capernaum. And anone it was darcke and Iesus was not come to them.
John,6,18,And ye see arose with a greate winde yt blew.
John,6,19,And when they had rowe aboute a .xxv. or a xxx. furlonges they sawe Iesus walke on ye see and drawe nye vnto the shyp and they were afrayed.
John,6,20,And he sayde vnto them: It is I be not a frayde.
John,6,21,Then wolde they have receaved him into the shyp and the ship was by and by at the londe whyther they went.
John,6,22,The daye folowynge the people which stode on the other syde of the see sawe that ther was none other shyp theare save yt one wher in his disciples were entred and that Iesus went not in with his disciples into the ship: but that his disciples were gone awaye alone.
John,6,23,How be it ther came other shippes from Tiberias nye vnto the place where they ate breed when the Lorde had blessed.
John,6,24,Then whe the people sawe that Iesus was not there nether his disciples they also toke shippinge and came to Caparnaum sekinge for Iesus.
John,6,25,And when they had founde him on ye other syde of ye see they sayd vnto him: Rabbi whe camest thou hidder?
John,6,26,Iesus answered them and sayde: verely verely I saye vnto you: ye seke me not because ye sawe the myracles: but because ye ate of the loves and were filled.
John,6,27,Laboure not for ye meate which perissheth but for ye meate that endureth vnto everlastynge lyfe whiche meate ye sonne of ma shall geve vnto you. For him hath god ye father sealed.
John,6,28,Then sayd they vnto him: what shall we do that we myght worke ye workes of God?
John,6,29,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them. This is ye worke of God that ye beleve on him who he hath sent.
John,6,30,They sayde vnto him: what signe shewest thou then that we maye se and beleve the? What doest thou worke?
John,6,31,Oure fathers dyd eate Manna in the desert as yt is writte: He gave them breed fro heaven to eate.
John,6,32,Iesus sayde vnto the: verely verely I saye vnto you: Moses gave you breed fro heave: but my father geveth you the true breed fro heave.
John,6,33,For the breed of God is he which cometh doune from heave and geveth lyfe vnto the worlde.
John,6,34,Then sayde they vnto him: Lorde ever moore geve vs this breed.
John,6,35,And Iesus sayde vnto them: I am that breed of life. He that cometh to me shall not honger: and he that beleveth on me shall never thurst.
John,6,36,But I sayed vnto you: that ye have sene me aud yet beleve not.
John,6,37,All that the father geveth me shall come to me: and him yt cometh to me I cast not awaye.
John,6,38,For I came doune fro heaven: not to do myne awne will but his will which hath sent me.
John,6,39,And this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath geven me I shuld loose no thinge: but shuld rayse it vp agayne at the last daye.
John,6,40,And this is the wyll of him yt sent me: yt every man which seith ye sonne and beleveth on him have everlastinge lyfe. And I will rayse him vp at ye last daye.
John,6,41,The Iewes then murmured at him because he sayde: I am that breed which is come doune from heaven.
John,6,42,And they sayde: Is not this Iesus ye sonne of Ioseph whose father and mother we knowe? How ys yt then that he sayeth I came doune from heave?
John,6,43,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them. Murmur not betwene youre selves.
John,6,44,No man can come to me except the father which hath sent me drawe him. And I will rayse him vp at the last daye.
John,6,45,It is written in the Prophetes yt they shall all be taught of God. Every man therfore that hath hearde and hath learned of the father commeth vnto me.
John,6,46,Not that eny man hath sene ye father save he which is of God: the same hath sene the father.
John,6,47,Verely verely I saye vnto you he that beleveth on me hath everlastinge lyfe.
John,6,48,I am that breed of lyfe.
John,6,49,Youre fathers dyd eate Mana in ye wildernes and are deed.
John,6,50,This is that breed which cometh fro heave yt he which eateth of it shuld also not dye.
John,6,51,I am that lyvinge breed which came doune from heave. Yf eny man eate of this breed he shall live forever. And the breed that I will geve is my flesshe which I will geve for the lyfe of ye worlde
John,6,52,And the Iewes strove amoge them selves sayinge: How can this felowe geve vs his flesshe to eate?
John,6,53,Then Iesus sayde vnto them: Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye eate ye flesshe of ye sonne of man and drinke his bloude ye shall not have lyfe in you
John,6,54,Whosoever eateth my flesshe and drinketh my bloude hath eternall lyfe: and I will rayse him vp at the last daye.
John,6,55,For my flesshe is meate in dede: and my bloude is drynke in dede.
John,6,56,He that eateth my flesshe and drynketh my bloude dwelleth in me and I in him.
John,6,57,As the lyvinge father hath sent me even so lyve I by my father: and he that eateth me shall live by me.
John,6,58,This is the breed which cam from heave: not as youre fathers have eaten Manna and are deed. He that eateth of this breed shall live ever.
John,6,59,These thinges sayd he in the synagoge as he taught in Capernaum.
John,6,60,Many of his disciples when they had herde this sayde: this is an herde sayinge: who can abyde the hearinge of it?
John,6,61,Iesus knew in him selfe that his disciples murmured at it and sayde vnto them: Doth this offende you?
John,6,62,What and yf ye shall se the sonne of man ascede vp where he was before?
John,6,63,It is the sprete that quyckeneth the flesshe proffeteth nothinge. The wordes that I speake vnto you are sprete and lyfe.
John,6,64,But ther are some of you that beleve not. For Iesus knewe from the begynnynge which they were that beleved not and who shuld betraye him.
John,6,65,And he sayde: Therfore sayde I vnto you: that no man can come vnto me except it were geven vnto him of my father.
John,6,66,From that tyme many of his disciples wet backe and walked no moore with him.
John,6,67,Then sayde Iesus to the twelve: will ye alsoo goo awaye?
John,6,68,Then Simon Peter answered: Master to whom shall we goo? Thou haste the wordes of eternall lyfe
John,6,69,and we beleve and knowe yt thou arte Christ the sonne of the lyvinge God.
John,6,70,Iesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve and yet one of you is the devyll?
John,6,71,He spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon. For he it was yt shuld betraye him and was one of the twelve.
John,7,1,After that Iesus wet about in Galile and wolde not go about in Iewry for the Iewes sought to kill him.
John,7,2,The Iewes tabernacle feast was at honde.
John,7,3,His brethren therfore sayde vnto him: get ye hence and go into Iewry yt thy disciples maye se thy workes yt thou doest.
John,7,4,For ther is no man yt doeth eny thing secretly and he him selfe seketh to be knowen. Yf thou do soche thinges shewe thy selfe to the worlde.
John,7,5,For as yet his brethre beleved not in him.
John,7,6,Then Iesus sayd vnto them: My tyme is not yet come youre tyme is all waye redy.
John,7,7,The worlde canot hate you. Me it hateth: because I testify of it that the workes of it are evyll.
John,7,8,Go ye vp vnto this feast. I will not go vp yet vnto this feast for my tyme is not yet full come.
John,7,9,These wordes he sayde vnto them and abode still in Galile.
John,7,10,But assone as his brethren were goone vp then went he also vp vnto the feast: not openly but as it were prevely.
John,7,11,Then sought him the Iewes at ye feast and sayde: Where is he?
John,7,12,And moche murmurynge was ther of him amonge the people. Some sayde: He is good. Wother sayde naye but he deceaveth the people.
John,7,13,How be it no ma spake openly of him for feare of the Iewes
John,7,14,In ye middes of the feast Iesus went vp into the temple and taught.
John,7,15,And the Iewes marveylled sayinge: How knoweth he ye scriptures seynge yt he never learned?
John,7,16,Iesus answered them and sayde: My doctrine is not myne: but his that sent me.
John,7,17,If eny man will do his will he shall knowe of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speake of my selfe.
John,7,18,He that speaketh of him selfe seketh his awne prayse. But he that seketh his prayse that sent him the same is true and no vnrightewesnes is in him.
John,7,19,Dyd not Moses geve you a lawe and yet none of you kepeth ye lawe? Why goo ye aboute to kyll me?
John,7,20,The people answered and sayde: thou hast the devyll: who goeth aboute to kyll the?
John,7,21,Iesus answered and sayde to them: I have done one worke and ye all marvayle.
John,7,22,Moses therfore gave vnto you circumcision: not because it is of Moses but of the fathers. And yet ye on the Saboth daye circumcise a man.
John,7,23,If a man on the Saboth daye receave circumcision without breakinge of the lawe of Moses: disdayne ye at me because I have made a man every whit whoale on the saboth daye?
John,7,24,Iudge not after the vtter aperaunce: but iudge rightewes iudgement.
John,7,25,Then sayd some of them of Ierusalem: Is not this he who they goo aboute to kyll?
John,7,26,Beholde he speaketh boldly and they saye nothinge to him. Do the rulars knowe in dede that this is very Christ?
John,7,27,How be it we knowe this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh no man shall knowe whence he is.
John,7,28,Then cryed Iesus in ye temple as he taught sayinge: ye knowe me and whence I am ye knowe. And yet I am not come of my selfe but he yt sent me is true whom ye knowe not.
John,7,29,I knowe him: for I am of him and he hath sent me.
John,7,30,Then they sought to take him: but no ma layde hondes on him because his tyme was not yet come.
John,7,31,Many of the people beleved on him and sayde: when Christ cometh will he do moo miracles then this man hath done?
John,7,32,The pharises hearde that the people murmured suche thinges about him. Wherfore ye pharises and hye prestes sent ministres forthe to take him.
John,7,33,Then sayde Iesus vnto the: Yet am I a lytell whyle with you and then goo I vnto him that sent me.
John,7,34,Ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me: and where I am thyther can ye not come.
John,7,35,Then sayde the Iewes bitwene the selves: whyther will he goo that we shall not fynde him? Will he goo amonge the gentyls which are scattered all a broade and teache the gentyls?
John,7,36,What maner of sayinge is this that he sayde: ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me: and where I am thyther can ye not come?
John,7,37,In the last daye that great daye of the feaste Iesus stode and cryed sayinge: If eny man thyrst let him come vnto me and drinke.
John,7,38,He that beleveth on me as sayeth the scripture out of his belly shall flowe ryvers of water of lyfe.
John,7,39,This spak he of the sprete which they that beleved on him shuld receave. For the holy goost was not yet there because that Iesus was not yet glorifyed.
John,7,40,Many of the people when they hearde this sayinge sayd: of a truth this is a prophet
John,7,41,Other sayde: this is Christ. Some sayde: shall Christ come out of Galile?
John,7,42,Sayeth not the scripture that Christ shall come of the seed of David: and out of the toune of Bethleem where David was?
John,7,43,So was ther dissencion amonge the people aboute him.
John,7,44,And some of them wolde have taken him: but no man layed hondes on him.
John,7,45,Then came ye ministres to ye hye prestes and pharises. And they sayde vnto the: why have ye not brought him?
John,7,46,The servautes answered never man spake as this man doeth.
John,7,47,Then answered the the pharises: are ye also disceaved?
John,7,48,Doth eny of the rulers or of the pharises beleve on him?
John,7,49,But the comen people whiche knowe not ye lawe are cursed.
John,7,50,Nicodemus sayde vnto them: He that came to Iesus by nyght and was one of them.
John,7,51,Doth oure lawe iudge eny man before it heare him and knowe what he hath done?
John,7,52,They answered and sayde vnto him: arte thou also of Galile? Searche and loke for out of Galile aryseth no Prophet.
John,7,53,And every man went vnto his awne housse.
John,8,1,And Iesus went vnto mounte Olivete
John,8,2,and erly in ye mornynge came agayne into ye temple and all the people came vnto him and he sate doune and taught them.
John,8,3,And the scribes and ye pharises brought vnto him a woman taken in advoutry and set hyr in the myddes
John,8,4,and sayde vnto him: Master this woman was taken in advoutry even as the dede was a doyng.
John,8,5,Moses in the lawe comaunded vs yt suche shuld be stoned. What sayest thou therfore?
John,8,6,And this they sayde to tempt him: that they myght have wherof to accuse him. Iesus stouped doune and with his fynger wrote on the grounde.
John,8,7,And whyll they continued axynge him he lyfte him selfe vp and sayde vnto them: let him yt is amoge you wt out synne cast the fyrst stone at her.
John,8,8,And agayne he stouped doune and wrote on ye grounde.
John,8,9,And assone as they hearde that they went out one by one the eldest fyrst. And Iesus was lefte a lone and the woman stondynge in ye myddes.
John,8,10,When Iesus had lyfte vp him selfe agayne and sawe no man but the woman he sayde vnto hyr. Woman where are those thyne accusars? Hath no man condempned the?
John,8,11,She sayde: No man Lorde. And Iesus sayde: Nether do I condempne the. Goo and synne no moare.
John,8,12,Then spake Iesus agayne vnto them sayinge: I am the light of the worlde. He that foloweth me shall not walke in darcknes: but shall have the light of lyfe.
John,8,13,The pharises sayde vnto him: thou bearest recorde of thy sylfe thy recorde is not true.
John,8,14,Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Though I beare recorde of my selfe yet my recorde is true: for I knowe whece I came and whyther I goo. But ye cannot tell whece I come and whyther I goo.
John,8,15,Ye iudge after ye flesshe. I iudge no man
John,8,16,though I iudge yet is my iudgmet true. For I am not alone: but I and the father that sent me.
John,8,17,It is also written in youre lawe that the testimony of two men is true.
John,8,18,I am one yt beare witnes of my selfe and the father that sent me beareth witnes of me.
John,8,19,Then sayde they vnto him: where is thy father? Iesus answered: ye nether knowe me nor yet my father. Yf ye had knowen me ye shuld have knowen my father also.
John,8,20,These wordes spake Iesus in the tresury as he taught in the temple and no man layde hondes on him for his tyme was not yet come.
John,8,21,Then sayde Iesus agayne vnto them. I goo my waye and ye shall seke me and shall dye in youre synnes. Whyther I goo thyther can ye not come.
John,8,22,Then sayde the Iewes: will he kyll him selfe because he sayth: whyther I goo thyther can ye not come?
John,8,23,And he sayde vnto the: ye are fro beneth I am from above. Ye are of this worlde I am not of this worlde.
John,8,24,I sayde therfore vnto you that ye shall dye in youre synnes. For except ye beleve that I am he ye shall dye in youre synnes.
John,8,25,Then sayde they vnto him who arte thou? And Iesus sayde vnto them: Even ye very same thinge yt I saye vnto you.
John,8,26,I have many thinges to saye and to iudge of you. But he yt sent me is true. And I speake in ye worlde those thinges which I have hearde of him.
John,8,27,They understode not that he spake of his father.
John,8,28,Then sayde Iesus vnto them: when ye have lyft vp an hye the sonne of man then shall ye knowe that I am he and that I do nothinge of my selfe: but as my father hath taught me even so I speake:
John,8,29,and he that sent me is with me. The father hath not lefte me alone for I do alwayes those thinges that please him.
John,8,30,As he spake these wordes many beleved on him.
John,8,31,Then sayde Iesus to those Iewes which beleved on him. If ye cotinue in my wordes then are ye my very disciples
John,8,32,and shall knowe the trueth: and the trueth shall make you free.
John,8,33,They answered him: We be Abrahams seede and were never bonde to eny man: why sayest thou then ye shalbe made fre.
John,8,34,Iesus answered them: verely verely I saye vnto you that whosoever committeth synne is the servaunt of synne.
John,8,35,And the servaunt abydeth not in the housse for ever: But ye sonne abydeth ever.
John,8,36,If the sonne therfore shall make you fre then are ye fre in dede.
John,8,37,I knowe that ye are Abrahams seed: But ye seke meanes to kyll me because my sayinges have no place in you.
John,8,38,I speake that I have sene with my father: and ye do that which ye have sene with youre father.
John,8,39,They answered and sayde vnto him: Abraham is oure father. Iesus sayde vnto them. If ye were Abrahams chyldren ye wolde do the dedes of Abraham.
John,8,40,But now ye goo about io kyll me a man that have tolde you the truthe which I have herde of god: this dyd not Abraham.
John,8,41,Ye do the dedes of youre father. Then sayde they vnto him: we were not borne of fornicacion. We have one father which is God.
John,8,42,Iesus sayde vnto them: yf God were youre father then wolde ye love me. For I proceaded forthe and come from God. Nether came I of my selfe but he sent me.
John,8,43,Why do ye not knowe my speache? Even because ye cannot abyde the hearynge of my wordes.
John,8,44,Ye are of youre father the devyll and the lustes of youre father ye will folowe. He was a murtherer from the beginnynge and aboode not in the trueth because ther is no trueth in him. When he speaketh a lye then speaketh he of his awne. For he is a lyar and the father therof.
John,8,45,And because I tell you ye trueth therfore ye beleve me not.
John,8,46,Which of you can rebuke me of synne? If I saye ye trueth why do not ye beleve me?
John,8,47,He that is of God heareth goddes wordes Ye therfore heare them not because ye are not of God.
John,8,48,Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him: Saye we not well that thou arte a Samaritane and hast the devyll?
John,8,49,Iesus answered: I have not the devyll: but I honour my father and ye have dishonoured me.
John,8,50,I seke not myne awne prayse: but ther is one that seketh and iudgeth.
John,8,51,Verely verely I saye vnto you yf a man kepe my sayinges he shall never se deeth.
John,8,52,Then sayde the Iewes to him: Now knowe we that thou hast the devyll. Abraha is deed and also the Prophetes: and yet thou sayest yf a man kepe my sayinge he shall never tast of deeth.
John,8,53,Arte thou greater then oure father Abraham which is deed? and the Prophetes are deed. Whome makest thou thy selfe?
John,8,54,Iesus answered: Yf I honoure my selfe myne honoure is nothinge worth. It is my father that honoureth me which ye saye is youre God
John,8,55,and ye have not knowen him: but I knowe him. And yf I shuld saye I knowe him not I shuld be a lyar lyke vnto you. But I knowe him and kepe his sayinge.
John,8,56,Youre father Abraham was glad to se my daye and he sawe it and reioysed.
John,8,57,Then sayde the Iewes vnto him: thou arte not yet.l. yere olde and hast thou sene Abraham?
John,8,58,Iesus sayd vnto them: Verely verely I saye vnto you: yer Abraham was I am.
John,8,59,Then toke they vp stones to caste at him. But Iesus hid him selfe and went out of ye temple.
John,9,1,And as Iesus passed by he sawe a man which was blynde from his birth.
John,9,2,And his disciples axed him sayinge. Master who dyd synne: this man or his father and mother that he was borne blynde?
John,9,3,Iesus answered: Nether hath this man synned nor yet his father and mother: but that the workes of God shuld be shewed on him.
John,9,4,I must worke the workes of him that sent me whyll it is daye. The nyght cometh when no man can worke.
John,9,5,As longe as I am in the worlde I am the lyght of the worlde.
John,9,6,Assone as he had thus spoken he spate on the grounde and made claye of the spetle and rubbed the claye on the eyes of the blynde
John,9,7,and sayde vnto him: Goo wesshe the in ye pole of Syloe which by interpretacion signifieth sent. He went his waye and wasshed and cam agayne seinge.
John,9,8,The neghboures and they that had sene him before how that he was a begger sayde: is not this he that sate and begged?
John,9,9,Some sayde: this is he. Other sayd: he is lyke him. But he him selfe sayde: I am even he.
John,9,10,They sayde vnto him: How are thyne eyes opened then?
John,9,11,He answered and sayde. The ma that is called Iesus made claye and anoynted myne eyes and sayd vnto me: Goo to the pole Syloe and wesshe. I went and wesshed and receaved my syght.
John,9,12,They sayde vnto him: where is he? He sayde: I cannot tell.
John,9,13,Then brought they to ye pharises him that a lytell before was blynde:
John,9,14,for it was the Saboth daye when Iesus made the claye and opened his eyes.
John,9,15,Then agayne the pharises also axed him how he had receaved his syght. He sayde vnto the: He put claye apon myne eyes and I wasshed and do se.
John,9,16,Then sayde some of the pharises: this man is not of God because he kepeth not the saboth daye. Other sayde: how can a man yt is a synner do suche myracles? And ther was stryfe amonge the.
John,9,17,Then spake they vnto the blynde agayne: What sayst thou of him because he hath openned thyne eyes? And he sayd: He is a Prophet.
John,9,18,But the Iewes dyd not beleve of the felowe how that he was blynde and receaved his syght vntyll they had called the father and mother of him that had receaved his syght.
John,9,19,And they axed the saying: Is this youre sonne whome ye saye was borne blynde? How doth he now se then?
John,9,20,His father and mother answered them and sayde: we wote well that this is oure sonne and that he was borne blynde:
John,9,21,but by what meanes he now seith that can we not tell or who hath opened his eyes can we not tell. He is olde ynough axe him let him answer for him selfe.
John,9,22,Suche wordes spake his father and mother because they feared the Iewes. For the Iewes had conspyred all redy that yf eny man dyd confesse that he was Christ he shuld be excommunicat out of the synagoge.
John,9,23,Therefore sayde his father and mother: he is olde ynough axe him.
John,9,24,Then agayne called they the man that was blynde and sayd vnto him: Geve God the prayse: we knowe that this man is a synner.
John,9,25,He answered and sayde: Whyther he be a synner or noo I cannot tell: One thinge I am sure of that I was blynde and now I se.
John,9,26,Then sayde they to him agayne. What dyd he to the? How opened he thyne eyes?
John,9,27,He answered them I tolde you yerwhyle and ye dyd not heare. Wherfore wolde ye heare it agayne? Will ye also be his disciples?
John,9,28,Then rated they him and sayde: Thou arte his disciple. We be Moses disciples.
John,9,29,We are sure that God spake with Moses. This felowe we knowe not from whence he is.
John,9,30,The man answered and sayde vnto them: this is a merveleous thinge that ye wote not whence he is seinge he hath opened myne eyes.
John,9,31,For we be sure that God heareth not synners. But yf eny man be a worshipper of God and do his will him heareth he.
John,9,32,Sence ye worlde beganne was it not hearde yt eny man opened the eyes of one that was borne blynd.
John,9,33,If this man were not of God he coulde have done no thinge.
John,9,34,They answered and sayd vnto him: thou arte altogeder borne in synne: and dost thou teache vs? And they cast him out.
John,9,35,Iesus hearde that they had excommunicate him: and assone as he had founde him he sayd vnto him: doest thou beleve on the sonne of God?
John,9,36,He answered and sayde: Who is it Lorde that I myght beleve on him?
John,9,37,And Iesus sayde vnto him: Thou hast sene him and he it is that talketh with the.
John,9,38,And he sayde: Lorde I beleve: and worshipped him.
John,9,39,Iesus sayde: I am come vnto iudgement into this worlde: that they which se not myght se and they which se myght be made blynde.
John,9,40,And some of the pharises which were with him hearde these wordes and sayde vnto him: are we then blynde?
John,9,41,Iesus sayde vnto them: yf ye were blynde ye shuld have no synne. But now ye saye we se therfore youre synne remayneth.
John,10,1,Verely verely I saye vnto you: he that entreth not in by ye dore into the shepefolde but clymeth vp some other waye: the same is a thefe and a robber.
John,10,2,He that goeth in by ye dore is the shepeherde of ye shepe:
John,10,3,to him the porter openeth and the shepe heare his voyce and he calleth his awne shepe by name and leadeth them out.
John,10,4,And when he hath sent forthe his awne shepe he goeth before them and the shepe folowe him: for they knowe his voyce.
John,10,5,A straunger they will not folowe but will flye from him: for they knowe not the voyce of straungers.
John,10,6,This similitude spake Iesus vnto them. But they vnderstode not what thinges they were which he spake vnto them.
John,10,7,Then sayde Iesus vnto them agayne. Verely verely I saye vnto you: I am the dore of the shepe.
John,10,8,All even as many as came before me are theves and robbers: but the shepe dyd not heare them.
John,10,9,I am the dore: by me yf eny man enter in he shalbe safe and shall goo in and out and fynde pasture.
John,10,10,The thefe cometh not but forto steale kyll and destroye. I am come that they myght have lyfe and have it more aboundantly.
John,10,11,I am ye good shepeheerd. The good shepeheerd geveth his lyfe for ye shepe.
John,10,12,An heyred servaut which is not ye shepeherd nether ye shepe are his awne seith the wolfe comynge and leveth the shepe and flyeth and the wolfe catcheth them and scattereth ye shepe.
John,10,13,The heyred servaut flyeth because he is an heyred servaunt and careth not for the shepe.
John,10,14,I am that good shepeheerd and knowe myne and am knowe of myne.
John,10,15,As my father knoweth me: even so knowe I my father. And I geve my lyfe for the shepe:
John,10,16,and other shepe I have which are not of this folde. Them also must I bringe that they maye heare my voyce and that ther maye be one flocke and one shepeherde.
John,10,17,Therfore doth my father love me because I put my lyfe from me that I myght take it agayne.
John,10,18,No man taketh it from me: but I put it awaye of my selfe. I have power to put it from me and have power to take it agayne: This comaundment have I receaved of my father.
John,10,19,And ther was a dissencion agayne amoge the Iewes for these sayinges
John,10,20,and many of them sayd. He hath the devyll and is mad: why heare ye him?
John,10,21,Other sayde these are not the wordes of him that hath the devyll. Can the devyll open the eyes of the blynde?
John,10,22,And it was at Ierusalem ye feaste of the dedicacion and it was wynter:
John,10,23,and Iesus walked in Salomons porche.
John,10,24,Then came the Iewes rounde aboute him and sayde vnto him: How longe dost thou make vs doute? Yf thou be Christ tell vs playnly.
John,10,25,Iesus answered them: I tolde you and ye beleve not. The workes yt I do in my fathers name they beare witnes of me.
John,10,26,But ye beleve not because ye are not of my shepe. As I sayde vnto you:
John,10,27,my shepe heare my voyce and I knowe them and they folowe me
John,10,28,and I geve vnto the eternall lyfe and they shall never perisshe nether shall eny man plucke the oute of my honde.
John,10,29,My father which gave the me is greatter then all and no man is able to take them out of my fathers honde.
John,10,30,And I and my father are one.
John,10,31,Then the Iewes agayne toke up stones to stone him with all.
John,10,32,Iesus answered them: many good workes have I shewed you from my father: for which of them will ye stone me?
John,10,33,The Iewes answered him sayinge. For thy good workes sake we stone ye not: but for thy blasphemy and because that thou beinge a man makest thy selfe God.
John,10,34,Iesus answered them: Is it not written in youre lawe: I saye ye are goddes?
John,10,35,If he called the goddes vnto whom the worde of God was spoken (and the scripture can not be broken)
John,10,36,saye ye then to him whom the father hath sainctified and sent into the worlde thou blasphemest because I sayd I am the sonne of God?
John,10,37,If I do not the workes of my father beleve me not.
John,10,38,But if I do though ye beleve not me yet beleve the workes that ye maye knowe and beleve that the father is in me and I in him.
John,10,39,Agayne they went aboute to take him: but he escaped out of their hondes
John,10,40,and went awaye agayne beyonde Iordan into the place where Iohn before had baptised and there aboode.
John,10,41,And many resorted vnto him and sayd. Iohn dyd no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man are true.
John,10,42,And many beleved on him theare.
John,11,1,A certayne man was sicke named Lazarus of Bethania the toune of Mary and her sister Martha.
John,11,2,It was that Mary which annoynted Iesus with oyntment and wyped his fete with her heere whose brother Lazarus was sicke
John,11,3,and his sisters sent vnto him sayinge. Lorde behold he whom thou lovest is sicke.
John,11,4,When Iesus hearde yt he sayd: this infirmite is not vnto deth but for ye laude of God that the sonne of God myght be praysed by the reason of it.
John,11,5,Iesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John,11,6,After he hearde that he was sicke then aboode he two dayes still in the same place where he was.
John,11,7,Then after that sayd he to his disciples: let us goo into Iewry agayne.
John,11,8,His disciples sayde vnto him. Master the Iewes lately sought meanes to stone the and wilt thou goo thyther agayne?
John,11,9,Iesus answered: are ther not twelve houres in ye daye? Yf a man walke in ye daye he stombleth not because he seith the lyght of this worlde.
John,11,10,But yf a ma walke in ye nyght he stombleth because ther is no lyght in him.
John,11,11,This sayde he and after yt he sayde vnto the: oure frende Lazarus slepeth but I goo to wake him out of slepe.
John,11,12,Then sayde his disciples: Lorde yf he slepe he shall do well ynough.
John,11,13,How be it Iesus spake of his deeth: but they thought yt he had spoke of ye naturall slepe.
John,11,14,Then sayde Iesus vnto the playnly Lazarus is deed
John,11,15,and I am glad for youre sakes yt I was not there because ye maye beleve. Neverthelesse let vs go vnto him.
John,11,16,Then sayde Thomas which is called Dydimus vnto ye disciples: let vs also goo that we maye dye wt him
John,11,17,Then went Iesus and founde that he had lyne in his grave foure dayes already.
John,11,18,Bethanie was nye vnto Ierusalem aboute. xv. furlonges of
John,11,19,and many of the Iewes were come to Martha and Mary to comforte them over their brother.
John,11,20,Martha assone as she hearde yt Iesus was comynge went and met him: but Mary sate still in the housse.
John,11,21,Then sayde Martha vnto Iesus: Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed:
John,11,22,but neverthelesse I knowe that whatsoever thou axest of God God will geve it the.
John,11,23,Iesus sayde vnto her: Thy brother shall ryse agayne.
John,11,24,Martha sayde vnto him: I knowe that he shall ryse agayne in the resurreccion at the last daye.
John,11,25,Iesus sayde vnto her: I am the resurreccion and the lyfe: He that beleveth on me ye though he were deed yet shall he lyve.
John,11,26,And whosoever lyveth and belevest on me shall never dye. Beleveth thou this?
John,11,27,She sayde vnto him: ye Lorde I beleve that thou arte Christ the sonne of god which shuld come into the worlde.
John,11,28,And assone as she had so sayde she went her waye and called Marie her sister secretly sayinge: The master is come and calleth for the
John,11,29,And she assone as she hearde that arose quickly and came vnto him.
John,11,30,Iesus was not yet come into the toune: but was in the place where Martha met him.
John,11,31,The Iewes then which were with her in the housse and comforted her when they sawe Mary that she rose vp hastely and went out folowed her saying: She goeth vnto the grave to wepe there.
John,11,32,Then when Mary was come where Iesus was and sawe him she fell doune at his fete sayinge vnto him: Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed.
John,11,33,When Iesus sawe her wepe and ye Iewes also wepe which came wt her he groned in ye sprete and was troubled in him selfe
John,11,34,and sayde: Where have ye layed him? They sayde vnto him: Lorde come and se.
John,11,35,And Iesus wept.
John,11,36,Then sayde the Iewes: Beholde howe he loved him.
John,11,37,And some of the sayde: coulde not he which openned the eyes of the blynde have made also that this man shuld not have dyed?
John,11,38,Iesus agayne groned in him selfe and came to the grave. It was a caue and a stone layde on it.
John,11,39,And Iesus sayd: take ye awaye the stone. Martha the sister of him that was deed sayd vnto him: Lorde by this tyme he stinketh. For he hath bene deed foure dayes:
John,11,40,Iesus sayde vnto her: Sayde I not vnto the yt if thou didest beleve thou shuldest se ye glory of God.
John,11,41,Then they toke awaye ye stone from ye place where the deed was layde. And Iesus lyfte vp his eyes and sayde: Father I thanke the because that thou hast hearde me.
John,11,42,I wot that thou hearest me all wayes: but because of the people that stonde by I sayde it yt they maye beleve that thou hast sent me.
John,11,43,And when he thus had spoken he cryed wt a loud voyce. Lazarus come forthe.
John,11,44,And he that was deed came forth bounde hand and fote with grave bondes and his face was bounde with a napkin. Iesus sayde vnto the: loowse him and let him goo.
John,11,45,Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary and had sene the thinges which Iesus dyd beleved on him.
John,11,46,But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises and tolde them what Iesus had done.
John,11,47,Then gadered the hye prestes and the Pharises a counsell and sayde: what do we? This ma doeth many miracles.
John,11,48,Yf we let him scape thus all men will beleve on him and ye Romaynes shall come and take awaye oure countre and the people.
John,11,49,And one of them named Cayphas which was the hieprest yt same yeare sayde vnto them: Ye perceave nothinge at all
John,11,50,nor yet consider that it is expedient for vs that one man dye for the people and not that all the people perisshe.
John,11,51,This spake he not of him selfe but beinge hye preste that same yeare he prophesied that Iesus shulde dye for the people
John,11,52,and not for the people only but that he shuld gader to geder in one the chyldren of God which were scattered abroode.
John,11,53,From that daye forth they held a counsell to geder for to put him to deeth.
John,11,54,Iesus therfore walked no more opely amoge the Iewes: but wet his waye thence vnto a coutre nye to a wildernes into a cite called Ephraim and there hauted with his disciples.
John,11,55,And the Iewes ester was nye at hand and many went out of the countre vp to Ierusalem before the ester to purify them selves.
John,11,56,Then sought they for Iesus and spake bitwene the selves as they stode in the teple: What thinke ye seynge he cometh not to the feast.
John,11,57,The hye prestes and Pharises had geven a comaundemet that yf eny man knew where he were he shuld shewe it that they myght take him.
John,12,1,Then Iesus sixe dayes before ester came to Bethany where Lazarus was which was deed and who Iesus raysed from deeth.
John,12,2,There they made him a supper and Martha served: But Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him.
John,12,3,Then toke Mary a pounde of oyntmet called Nardus perfecte and precious and anoynted Iesus fete and wipt his fete with her heer and the housse was filled of the savre of the oyntmet.
John,12,4,Then sayde one of his disciples name Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne which afterwarde betrayed him:
John,12,5,why was not this oyntmet solde for thre hondred pence and geve to the poore?
John,12,6,This sayde he not that he cared for the pooer: but because he was a thefe and kept the bagge and bare that which was geven.
John,12,7,Then sayde Iesus: Let her alone agaynst the daye of my buryinge she kept it.
John,12,8,The poore all wayes shall ye have with you but me shall ye not all wayes have.
John,12,9,Moche people of the Iewes had knowledge that he was there. And they came not for Iesus sake only but yt they myght se Lazarus also whom he raysed from deeth.
John,12,10,The hye prestes therfore held a counsell that they myght put Lazarus to deeth also
John,12,11,because that for his sake many of the Iewes went awaye and beleved on Iesus.
John,12,12,On the morowe moche people that were come to the feast when they hearde yt Iesus shuld come to Ierusalem
John,12,13,toke braunches of palme trees and went and met him and cryed: Hosanna blessed is he that in the name of the Lorde commeth kynge of Israel.
John,12,14,And Iesus got a yonge asse and sate thero accordinge to that which was writte:
John,12,15,feare not doughter of Sio beholde thy kynge cometh sittinge on an asses coolte.
John,12,16,These thinges vnderstode not his disciples at ye fyrst: but when Iesus was gloryfied then remembryd they that soche thinges were written of him and that soche thinges they had done vnto him.
John,12,17,The people that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raysed him from deeth bare recorde.
John,12,18,Therfore met him the people be cause they hearde yt he had done soche a myracle.
John,12,19,The Pharises therfore sayde amonge them selves: perceave ye how we prevayle no thinge? beholde the worlde goth awaye after him.
John,12,20,Ther were certayne Grekes amoge them that came to praye at the feast:
John,12,21,the same cam to Philip which was of Bethsayda a cyte in Galile and desired him sayinge: Syr we wolde fayne se Iesus.
John,12,22,Philip came and tolde Andrew. And agayne Andrew and Philip tolde Iesus.
John,12,23,And Iesus answered them sayinge: the houre is come yt the sonne of ma must be glorified.
John,12,24,Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye wheate corne fall into the grounde and dye it bydeth alone. Yf it dye it brengeth forth moche frute.
John,12,25,He that loveth his lyfe shall destroye it: and he yt hateth his lyfe in this worlde shall kepe it vnto lyfe eternall.
John,12,26,If eny man mynister vnto me let him folowe me and where I am there shall also my minister be. And yf eny man minister vnto me him will my father honoure.
John,12,27,Now is my soule troubled and what shall I saye? Father delyver me from this houre: but therfore came I vnto this houre
John,12,28,Father glorify thy name. Then came ther a voyce fro heaven: I have glorified it and will glorify it agayne.
John,12,29,Then sayd the people yt stode by and hearde: it thoundreth. Other sayde an angell spake to him.
John,12,30,Iesus answered and sayde: this voyce cam not because of me but for youre sakes.
John,12,31,Now is the iudgement of this worlde: now shall ye prince of this worlde be cast out.
John,12,32,And I yf I were lifte vp from the erthe will drawe all men vnto me.
John,12,33,This sayde Iesus signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye.
John,12,34,The people answered him: We have hearde of ye lawe yt Christ bydeth ever: and how sayest thou then that the sonne of man must be lifte vp? who is yt sonne of ma?
John,12,35,Then Iesus sayde vnto them: yet a lytell whyle is the light wt you. Walke whill ye have light lest the darcknes come on you. He that walketh in the darke wotteth not whither he goeth.
John,12,36,Whyll ye have light beleve on the light that ye maye be the chyldren of light.  These thinges spake Iesus and departed and hyd him silfe fro them.
John,12,37,And though he had done so many myracles before them yet beleved not they on him
John,12,38,yt the sayinge of Esayas the Prophet myght be fulfilled yt he spake. Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinge? And to whom ys the arme of ye Lorde opened?
John,12,39,Therfore coulde they not beleve because yt Esaias sayth agayne:
John,12,40,he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hertes that they shuld not se with their eyes and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shuld heale the.
John,12,41,Soche thinges sayde Esaias when he sawe his glory and spake of him.
John,12,42,Neverthelesse amoge ye chefe rulers many beleved on him. But because of the pharises they wolde not be a knowen of it lest they shuld be excommunicate.
John,12,43,For they loved the prayse yt is geven of men more then the prayse that cometh of God.
John,12,44,And Iesus cryed and sayde: he that beleveth on me beleveth not on me but on him yt sent me.
John,12,45,And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
John,12,46,I am come a light into the worlde that whosoever beleveth on me shuld not byde in darcknes.
John,12,47,And yf eny man heare my wordes and beleve not I iudge him not. For I came not to iudge the worlde: but to save ye worlde.
John,12,48,He that refuseth me and receaveth not my wordes hath one that iudgeth him. The wordes that I have spoken they shall iudge him in ye last daye.
John,12,49,For I have not spoken of my selfe: but the father which sent me he gave me a commaundemet what I shuld saye and what I shuld speake.
John,12,50,And I knowe that this comaundement is lyfe everlastinge. Whatsoever I speake therfore eve as the father bade me so I speake.
John,13,1,Before the feast of ester whe Iesus knewe that his houre was come that he shuld departe out of this worlde vnto the father. When he loved his which were in the worlde vnto the ende he loved the.
John,13,2,And when supper was ended after that the devyll had put in the hert of Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne to betraye him:
John,13,3,Iesus knowinge that the father had geve all thinges into his hondes. And that he was come from God and went to God
John,13,4,he rose from supper and layde a syde his vpper garmentes and toke a towell and gyrd him selfe.
John,13,5,After that poured he water into a basyn and beganne to wash his disciples fete and to wype them with the towell wherwith he was gyrde.
John,13,6,Then came he to Simon Peter. And Peter sayde to him: Lorde shalt thou wesshe my fete?
John,13,7,Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: what I do thou wotest not now but thou shalt knowe herafter.
John,13,8,Peter sayd vnto him: thou shalt not wesshe my fete whill ye worlde stondeth. Iesus answered him: yf I wasshe ye not thou shalt have no part with me.
John,13,9,Simon Peter sayde vnto him: Lorde not my fete only: but also my handes and my heed.
John,13,10,Iesus sayde to him: he that is wesshed nedeth not save to wesshe his fete and is clene every whit. And ye are clene: but not all.
John,13,11,For he knewe his betrayer. Therfore sayde he: ye are not all clene.
John,13,12,After he had wesshed their fete and receaved his clothes and was set doune agayne he sayde vnto them? wot ye what I have done to you?
John,13,13,Ye call me master and Lorde and ye saye well for so am I.
John,13,14,If I then youre Lorde and master have wesshed youre fete ye also ought to wesshe one anothers fete.
John,13,15,For I have geven you an ensample that ye shuld do as I have done to you.
John,13,16,Verely verely I saye vnto you the servaunt is not greater then his master nether the messenger greater then he that sent him.
John,13,17,If ye vnderstonde these thinges happy are ye yf ye do them.
John,13,18,I speake not of you all I knowe whom I have chosen. But that ye scripture be fulfilled: he that eateth breed wt me hath lyfte vp his hele agaynste me.
John,13,19,Now tell I you before it come: that when it is come to passe ye might beleve that I am he.
John,13,20,Verely verely I saye vnto you. He that receaveth who soever I sende receaveth me. And he that receaveth me receaveth him that sent me.
John,13,21,When Iesus had thus sayd he was troubled in the sprete and testified sayinge: verely verely I saye vnto you that one of you shall betraye me.
John,13,22,And then the disciples loked one on another doutinge of who he spake.
John,13,23,Ther was one of his disciples which leaned on Iesus bosome whom Iesus loved.
John,13,24,To him beckened Simo Peter that he shuld axe who it was of whom he spake.
John,13,25,He then as he leaned on Iesus brest sayde vnto him: Lorde who ys it?
John,13,26,Iesus answered he yt ys to whom I geve a soppe when I have dept it. And he wet a soppe and gave it to Iudas Iscarioth Simons sonne.
John,13,27,And after the soppe Satan entred into him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him: that thou dost do quickly.
John,13,28,That wist no ma at the table for what intent he spake vnto him.
John,13,29,Some of the thought because Iudas had the bagge that Iesus had sayd vnto him bye those thinges that we have nede af agaynst ye feast: or that he shulde geve some thinge to the poore.
John,13,30,Assone then as he had receaved the soppe he wet immediatly out. And it was night.
John,13,31,Whe he was gone out Iesus sayde: now is the sonne of man glorified. And God is glorified by him.
John,13,32,Yf God be glorified by him God shall also glorify him in him selfe: and shall strayght waye glorify him.
John,13,33,Deare chyldren yet a lytell whyle am I with you. Ye shall seke me and as I sayde vnto the Iewes whither I goo thither can ye not come. Also to you saye I nowe.
John,13,34,A newe commaundment geve I vnto you that ye love to gedder as I have loved you that even so ye love one another
John,13,35,By this shall all me knowe yt ye are my disciples yf ye shall have love one to another.
John,13,36,Simon Peter sayd vnto him: Lorde whither goest thou? Iesus answered him: whither I goo thou canst not folowe me now but thou shalt folowe me afterwardes.
John,13,37,Peter sayd vnto him: Lorde why canot I folowe the now? I will geve my lyfe for thy sake?
John,13,38,Iesus answered him: wilt thou geve thy lyfe for my sake? Verely verely I saye vnto the the cocke shall not crowe tyll thou have denyed me thryse.
John,14,1,And he sayd vnto his disciples: Let not youre hertes be troubled. Beleve in god and beleve in me.
John,14,2,In my fathers housse are many mansions. If it were not so I wolde have tolde you. I go to prepare a place for you.
John,14,3,And yf I go to prepare a place for you I will come agayne and receave you eve vnto my selfe yt where I am there maye ye be also.
John,14,4,And whither I go ye knowe and ye waye ye knowe.
John,14,5,Thomas sayde vnto him: Lorde we knowe not whyther thou goest. Also how is it possible for vs to knowe the waye?
John,14,6,Iesus sayd vnto him: I am ye waye ye truthe and ye life. And no man cometh vnto the father but by me.
John,14,7,Yf ye had knowe me ye had knowe my father also. And now ye knowe him and have sene him.
John,14,8,Philip sayd vnto him: Lorde shew vs the father and it suffiseth vs.
John,14,9,Iesus sayde vnto him: have I bene so longe tyme wt you: and yet hast thou not knowen me? Philip he yt hath sene me hath sene ye father. And how sayest thou then: shew vs the father?
John,14,10,Belevest thou not that I am in ye father and the father in me? The wordes that I speake vnto you I speakee not of my selfe: but ye father that dwelleth in me is he that doeth ye workes.
John,14,11,Beleve me that I am the father and ye father in me. At the leest beleve me for the very workes sake.
John,14,12,Verely verely I saye vnto you: he that beleveth on me the workes that I doo the same shall he do and greater workes then these shall he do because I go vnto my father.
John,14,13,And what soever ye axe in my name yt will I do yt the father might be glorified by the sonne.
John,14,14,Yf ye shall axe eny thige in my name I will do it
John,14,15,If ye love me kepe my comaundementes
John,14,16,and I will praye the father and he shall geve you a nother comforter yt he maye byde with you ever
John,14,17,which is the sprete of truthe whome the worlde canot receave because the worlde seyth him not nether knoweth him. But ye knowe him. For he dwelleth with you and shalbe in you.
John,14,18,I will not leave you comfortlesse: but will come vnto you.
John,14,19, Yet a litell whyle and the worlde seith me no moare: but ye shall se me. For I live and ye shall live.
John,14,20,That daye shall ye knowe that I am in my father and you in me and I in you
John,14,21,He that hath my comaundemetes and kepeth them the same is he that loveth me. And he yt loveth me shall be loved of my father: and I will love him and will shewe myne awne selfe vnto him.
John,14,22,Iudas sayde vnto him (not Iudas Iscarioth) Lorde what is the cause that thou wilt shewe thy selfe vnto vs and not vnto the worlde?
John,14,23,Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: yf a man love me and wyll kepe my sayinges my father also will love him and we will come vnto him and will dwelle with him.
John,14,24,He that loveth me not kepeth not my sayinges. And the wordes which ye heare are not myne but the fathers which sent me.
John,14,25, This have I spoken vnto you beynge yet present with you.
John,14,26,But that coforter which is the holy gost (whom my father will sende in my name) he shall teache you all thinges and bringe all thinges to youre remembraunce whatsoever I have tolde you.
John,14,27,Peace I leve with you my peace I geve vnto you. Not as the worlde geveth geve I vnto you. Let not youre hertes be greved nether feare ye.
John,14,28,Ye have hearde how I sayde vnto you: I go and come agayne vnto you. If ye loved me ye wolde verely reioyce because I sayde I go vnto ye father. For ye father is greater then I
John,14,29,And now have I shewed you before it come yt whe it is come to passe ye might beleve.
John,14,30,Here after will I not talke many mordes vnto you. For the rular of this worlde commeth and hath nought in me.
John,14,31,But that the worlde maye knowe that I love the father: therfore as the father gave me comaundment even so do I. Ryse let vs go hence.
John,15,1,I am the true vyne and my father ys an husbande man.
John,15,2,Every braunche that beareth not frute in me he will take awaye. And every braunche that beareth frute will he pourge yt it maye bringe moare frute.
John,15,3,Now are ye cleane thorow ye wordes which I have spoke vnto you.
John,15,4,Byde in me and let me byde in you. As ye braunche canot beare frute of it sylfe excepte it byde in the vyne: no more can ye excepte ye abyde in me.
John,15,5,I am the vyne and ye are the braunches. He that abydeth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth moche frute. For with out me can ye do nothinge.
John,15,6,Yf a man byde not in me he ys cast forthe as a braunche and is wyddered: and men gadder it and cast it into the fyre and it burneth.
John,15,7,Yf ye byde in me and my wordes also byde in you: axe what ye will and it shalbe done to you .
John,15,8,Heare in is my father glorified that ye beare moche frute and be made my disciples.
John,15,9,As the father hath loved me eve so have I leved you. Continue in my love.
John,15,10,Yf ye shall kepe my comaudemetes ye shall byde in my love eve as I have kept my fathers comaundementes and byde in his love.
John,15,11,These thinges have I spoken vnto you yt my ioye myght remayne in you and that youre ioye might be full.
John,15,12,This is my commaundement that ye love togedder as I have loved you.
John,15,13,Gretter love then this hath no man then that a man bestowe his lyfe for his frendes.
John,15,14,Ye are my fredes yf ye do whatsoever I commaunde you.
John,15,15,Hence forth call I you not servauntes: for the servaunt knoweth not what his Lorde doeth. But you have I called frendes: for all thinges that I have hearde of my father I have opened to you.
John,15,16,Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordeyned you that ye go and bringe forthe frute and that youre frute remayne that whatsoever ye shall axe of the father in my name he shulde geve it you.
John,15,17,This comaunde I you that ye love to gedder.
John,15,18,Yf ye worlde hate you ye knowe that he hated me before he hated you.
John,15,19,Yf ye were of the worlde ye worlde wolde love his awne. How be it because ye are not of ye worlde but I have chosen you out of the worlde therfore hateth you the worlde.
John,15,20,Remember the sayinge that I sayde vnto you: the servaute is not greater then his lorde. Yf they have persecuted me so will they persecute you Yf they have kept my sayinge so will they kepe youres.
John,15,21,But all these thinges will they do vnto you for my names sake because they have not knowen him that sent me.
John,15,22,If I had not come and spoken vnto them they shulde not have had synne: but now have they nothinge to cloke their synne with all.
John,15,23,He that hateth me hateth my father.
John,15,24,If I had not done workes amoge the which none other ma dyd they had not had synne. But now have they sene and yet have hated bothe me and my father:
John,15,25,eve that the sayinge myght be fulfilled that is written in theyr lawe: they hated me wtout a cause.
John,15,26,But when the comforter is come whom I will sende vnto you fro the father which is the sprete of truthe which proceadeth of the father he shall testifie of me.
John,15,27,And ye shall beare witnes also because ye have bene with me from the begynninge.
John,16,1,These thinges have I sayde vnto you because ye shuld not be offended.
John,16,2,They shall excomunicat you: ye ye tyme shall come that whosoever killeth you will thinke that he doth God service.
John,16,3,And suche thinges will they do vnto you because they have not knowen the father nether yet me.
John,16,4,But these thinges have I tolde you that when that houre is come ye myght remember them that I tolde you so. These thinges sayde I not unto you at the begynninge because I was present with you.
John,16,5,But now I goo my waye to him that sent me and none of you axeth me: whither goest thou?
John,16,6,But because I have sayde suche thinges vnto you youre hertes are full of sorowe.
John,16,7,Neverthelesse I tell you the trueth it is expedient for you that I goo awaye. For yf I goo not awaye that comforter will not come vnto you. But yf I departe I will sende him vnto you.
John,16,8,And when he is come he will rebuke ye worlde of synne and of rightwesnes and of iudgement.
John,16,9,Of synne because they beleve not on me:
John,16,10,Of rightwesnes because I go to my father and ye shall se me no moare:
John,16,11,and of iudgement because the chefe ruler of this worlde is iudged all ready.
John,16,12,I have yet many thinges to saye vnto you: but ye canot beare them awaye now.
John,16,13,How be it when he is come (I meane the sprete of truthe) he will leade yon into all trueth. He shall not speake of him selfe: but whatsoever he shall heare that shall he speake and he will shewe you thinges to come.
John,16,14,He shall glorify me for he shall receave of myne and shall shewe vnto you.
John,16,15,All thinges that ye father hath aremyne. Therfore sayd I vnto you that he shall take of myne and shewe vnto you.
John,16,16,After a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me: For I goo to the father.
John,16,17,Then sayd some of his disciples bitwene them selves: what is this yt he sayth vnto vs after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me: and that I go to the father.
John,16,18,They sayd therfore: what is this that he sayth after a whyle? we canot tell what he sayth.
John,16,19,Iesus perceaved yt they wolde axe him and sayd vnto them: This is it that ye enquyre of bitwene youre selves that I sayd after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me.
John,16,20,Verely verely I saye vnto you: ye shall wepe and lamet and the worlde shall reioyce. Ye shall sorowe: but youre sorowe shalbe tourned to ioye.
John,16,21,A woman when she traveyleth hath sorowe because her houre is come: but assone as she is delivered of the chylde she remembreth no moare the anguysshe for ioye that a man is borne in to the worlde
John,16,22,And ye now are in sorowe: but I will se you agayne and youre hertes shall reioyce and youre ioye shall no ma take fro you.
John,16,23,And in that daye shall ye axe me no question. Verely verely I saye vnto you whatsoever ye shall axe the father in my name he will geve it you
John,16,24,Hitherto have ye axed nothinge in my name. Axe and ye shall receave it: that youre ioye maye be full.
John,16,25, These thinges have I spoken vnto you in proverbes. The tyme will come when I shall no moare speake to you in proverbes: but I shall shewe you playnly from my father.
John,16,26,At that daye shall ye axe in myne name. And I saye not vnto you that I will speake vnto my father for you
John,16,27,For ye father him selfe loveth you because ye have loved me and have beleved that I came out from God.
John,16,28,I went out from the father and came into the worlde: and I leve the worlde agayne and go to ye father.
John,16,29,His disciples sayd vnto him: loo now speakest thou playnly and thou vsest no proverbe.
John,16,30,Nowe knowe we that thou vnderstondest all thinges and nedest not yt eny man shuld axe the eny question. Therfore beleve we that thou camst fro god.
John,16,31,Iesus answered them: Now ye do beleve.
John,16,32,Beholde ye houre draweth nye and is already come yt ye shalbe scatered every man his wayes and shall leave me alone. And yet am I not alone. For ye father is with me.
John,16,33,These wordes have I spoke vnto you yt in me ye might have peace. For in ye worlde shall ye have tribulacio: but be of good cheare I have over come the worlde.
John,17,1,These wordes spake Iesus and lyfte vp his eyes to heven and sayde: father the houre is come: glorify thy sonne that thy sonne maye glorify the:
John,17,2,as thou hast geve him power over all fleshe that he shuld geve eternall lyfe to as many as thou hast geven him.
John,17,3,This is lyfe eternall that they myght knowe the that only very God and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.
John,17,4,I have glorified ye on the erth. I have fynysshed ye worke which thou gavest me to do.
John,17,5,And now glorify me thou father wt thyn awne selfe with the glory which I had with ye yerre ye worlde was.
John,17,6,I have declared thy name vnto ye men which thou gavest me out of the worlde. Thyne they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy sayinges.
John,17,7,Now they knowe that all thinges whatsoever thou hast geven me are of the.
John,17,8,For I have geven vnto them the wordes which thou gavest me and they have receaved them and knowe surely that I came out from the: and doo beleve that thou dyddest send me.
John,17,9,I praye for them and praye not for the worlde: but for the which thou hast geve me for they are thyne.
John,17,10,And all myne are thyne and thyne are myne and I am glorified in the.
John,17,11,And now am I no moare in the worlde but they are in the worlde and I come to ye. Wholy father kepe in thyne awne name the which thou hast geven me that they maye be one as we are.
John,17,12,Whyll I was with the in ye worlde I kepte the in thy name. Those yt thou gavest me have I kepte and none of the is lost but that lost chylde that the scripture myght be fulfilled.
John,17,13,Now come I to the and these wordes speake I in the worlde that they myght have my ioye full in the.
John,17,14,I have geven them thy wordes and the worlde hath hated them because they are not of the worlde even as I am not of the worlde.
John,17,15,I desyre not that thou shuldest take the out of the worlde: but that thou kepe them from evyll.
John,17,16,They are not of the worlde as I am not of the worlde.
John,17,17,Sanctify the wt thy truth. Thy sayinge is truth.
John,17,18,As thou dyddest send me into the worlde even so have I sent them into the worlde
John,17,19,and for their sakes sanctify I my selfe that they also myght be sanctified thorowe the trueth.
John,17,20,I praye not for them alone: but for them also which shall beleve on me thorowe their preachynge
John,17,21,that they all maye be one as thou father arte in me and I in the that they maye be also one in vs that the worlde maye beleve that thou hast sent me.
John,17,22,And that glory that thou gavest me I have geven them that they maye be one as we are wone.
John,17,23,I in them and thou in me that they maye be made perfecte in one and that the worlde maye knowe that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.
John,17,24,Father I will that they which thou hast geven me be with me where I am that they maye se my glory which thou hast geven me. For thou lovedest me before the makynge of the worlde.
John,17,25,O ryghteous father ye very worlde hath not knowen the: but I have knowen the and these have knowen that thou hast sent me.
John,17,26,And I have declared vnto them thy name and will declare it that the love wher wt thou hast loved me be in them and that I be in them.
John,18,1,When Iesus had spoken these wordes he wet forth with his disciples over the broke Cedron where was a garden into the which he entred with his disciples.
John,18,2,Iudas also which betrayed him knewe the place: for Iesus ofte tymes resorted thyther with his disciples.
John,18,3,Iudas then after he had receaved abonde of men and ministres of the hye Prestes and Pharises came thyther with lanterns and fyerbrondes and wepens.
John,18,4,Then Iesus knowynge all thinges that shuld come on him went forth and sayde vnto them: whom seke ye?
John,18,5,They answered him: Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayde vnto them: I am he. Iudas also which betrayed him stode with them.
John,18,6,But assone as he had sayd vnto them I am he they went backe wardes and fell to the grounde.
John,18,7,And he axed the agayne: whome seke ye? They sayde:Iesus of Nazareth.
John,18,8,Iesus answered I sayde vnto you I am he. If ye seke me let these goo their waye.
John,18,9,That ye sayinge might be fulfilled which he spake: of the which thou gavest me have I not lost one.
John,18,10,Simon Peter had a swearde and drue it and smote the hye prestes servaunt and cut of his ryght eare. The servauntes name was Malchas.
John,18,11,Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter: put vp thy swearde into ye sheath: shall I not drinke of ye cup which my father hath geven me?
John,18,12,Then the copany and the captayne and the ministres of of the Iewes toke Iesus and bounde him
John,18,13,and led him awaye to Anna fyrst: For he was fatherelawe vnto Cayphas which was ye hye preste that same yeare.
John,18,14,Cayphas was he that gave counsell to ye Iewes that it was expediet that one man shuld dye for the people.
John,18,15,And Simon Peter folowed Iesus and another disciple: that disciple was knowen of ye hye preste and went in with Iesus into the pallys of the hye preste.
John,18,16,But Peter stode at the dore with out. Then went out that other disciple which was knowen vnto the hye preste and spake to the damsell that kept the dore and brought in Peter.
John,18,17,Then sayde ye damsell that kept the dore vnto Peter: Arte not thou one of this mannes disciples? He sayde: I am not.
John,18,18,The servauntes and the ministres stode there and had made a fyre of coles: for it was colde: and they warmed them selves. Peter also stode amonge them and warmed him selfe.
John,18,19,The hye preste axed Iesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.
John,18,20,Iesus answered him: I spake openly in ye worlde. I ever taught in ye synagoge and in the temple whyther all ye Iewes resorted and in secrete have I sayde nothynge:
John,18,21,Why axest thou me? Axe them whiche hearde me what I sayde vnto the. Beholde they can tell what I sayde.
John,18,22,Whe he had thus spoken one of ye ministres which stode by smote Iesus on the face sayinge: answerest thou the hyepreste so?
John,18,23,Iesus answered him. If I have evyll spoke beare witnes of ye evyll: yf I have well spoke why smytest thou me?
John,18,24,And Annas sent him bounde vnto Caiphas ye hye preste.
John,18,25,Simon Peter stode and warmed him selfe. And they sayde vnto him: arte not thou also one of his disciples? He denyed it and sayde: I am not.
John,18,26,One of the servauntes of the hye preste (his cosyn whose eare Peter smote of) sayde vnto him: dyd not I se the in the garden with him?
John,18,27,Peter denyed it agayne: and immediatly the cocke crewe.
John,18,28,Then led they Iesus fro Cayphas into the hall of iudgement. It was in the mornynge and they them selves went not into the iudgement hall lest they shuld be defyled but that they myght eate the paschall lambe.
John,18,29,Pylate then went out vnto the and sayde: what accusacion bringe ye agaynste this man?
John,18,30,They answered and sayd vnto him. If he were not an evyll doar we wolde not have delyvered him vnto the.
John,18,31,Then sayd Pylate vnto the: take ye him and iudge him after youre awne lawe. Then the Iewes sayde vnto him. It is not lawfull for vs to put eny ma to deeth.
John,18,32,That ye wordes of Iesus myght be fulfilled which he spake signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye.
John,18,33,Then Pylate entred into the iudgemet hall agayne and called Iesus and sayd vnto him: arte thou the kynge of ye Iewes?
John,18,34,Iesus answered: sayst thou that of thy selfe or dyd other tell it the of me?
John,18,35,Pylate answered: Am I a Iewe? Thyne awne nacion and hye prestes have delyvered ye vnto me. What hast thou done?
John,18,36,Iesus answered: my kyngdome is not of this worlde. Yf my kyngdome were of this worlde then wolde my ministres suerly fight yt I shuld not be delyvered to ye Iewes but now is my kyngdome not fro hence.
John,18,37,Pylate sayde vnto him: Arte thou a kynge then? Iesus answered: Thou sayst yt I am a kynge. For this cause was I borne and for this cause came I into ye worlde yt I shuld beare witnes vnto the trueth. And all that are of ye trueth heare my voyce.
John,18,38,Pilate sayde vnto him: what thinge is trueth? And when he had sayd yt he went out agayne vnto the Iewes and sayde vnto them: I fynde in him no cause at all.
John,18,39,Ye have a custome that I shuld delyver you one lowsse at ester. Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of ye Iewes.
John,18,40,Then cryed they all agayne sayinge: Not him but Barrabas that Barrabas was a robber.
John,19,1,Then Pylate toke Iesus and scourged him.
John,19,2,And ye soudiers wounde a croune of thornes and put it on his heed. And they dyd on him a purple garment
John,19,3,and sayd: hayll kynge of the Iewes: and they smote him on the face.
John,19,4,Pylate went forthe agayne and sayde vnto them: beholde I bringe him forth to you that ye maye knowe that I fynde no faute in him.
John,19,5,Then came Iesus forthe wearynge a croune of thorne and a robe of purple. And Pylate sayd vnto them: beholde ye man.
John,19,6,When the hye Prestes and ministres sawe him they cryed sayinge: crucify him crucify him. Pylate sayde vnto them. Take ye him and crucify him: for I fynde no cause in him.
John,19,7,The Iewes answered him. We have a lawe and by oure lawe he ought to dye: because he made him selfe the sonne of God.
John,19,8, When Pylate hearde that sayinge he was the moare afrayde
John,19,9,and went agayne into ye iudgment hall and sayde vnto Iesus: whence arte thou? But Iesus gave him none answere.
John,19,10,Then sayde Pylate vnto him. Speakest thou not vnto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify the and have power to lowse the?
John,19,11,Iesus answered: Thou couldest have no power at all agaynst me except it were geven the from above. Therfore he yt delyvered me vnto the is moare in synne.
John,19,12,And from thence forthe sought Pylate meanes to lowse him: but the Iewes cryed sayinge: yf thou let him goo thou arte not Cesars frende. For whosoever maketh hi selfe a kynge is agaynst Cesar
John,19,13,When Pylate hearde yt sayinge he brought Iesus forthe and sate doune to geve sentece in a place called the pavement: but in the Hebrue tonge Gabbatha.
John,19,14,It was the Saboth even which falleth in the ester fest and aboute the sixte houre. And he sayde vnto the Iewes: beholde youre kynge.
John,19,15,They cryed awaye with him awaye with him crucify him. Pylate sayde vnto them. Shall I crucify youre kynge? The hye Prestes answered: we have no kynge but Cesar.
John,19,16,Then delyvered he him vnto them to be crucified. And they toke Iesus and led him awaye.
John,19,17,And he bare his crosse and went forthe into a place called the place of deed mens sculles which is named in Hebrue Golgatha.
John,19,18,Where they crucified him and two other with him on ether syde one and Iesus in the myddes.
John,19,19,And Pylate wrote his tytle and put it on the crosse. The writynge was Iesus of Nazareth kynge of the Iewes.
John,19,20,This tytle reed many of the Iewes. For the place where Iesus was crucified was nye to the cite. And it was written in Hebrue Greke and Latyn.
John,19,21,Then sayde the hye prestes of ye Iewes to Pylate: wryte not kynge of the Iewes: but that he sayde I am kynge of the Iewes.
John,19,22,Pylate answered: what I have written that have I written.
John,19,23,Then the soudiers when they had crucified Iesus toke his garmentes and made foure partes to every soudier a parte and also his coote. The coote was with out seme wrought vpon thorowe out.
John,19,24,And they sayde one to another. Let vs not devyde it: but cast loostes who shall have it That the scripture myght be fulfilled which sayth. They parted my rayment amonge them and on my coote dyd cast lottes. And the soudiers dyd soche thinges in dede.
John,19,25,Ther stode by the crosse of Iesus his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wyfe of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene.
John,19,26,When Iesus sawe his mother and the disciple stondynge whom he loved he sayde vnto his mother: woman beholde thy sonne.
John,19,27,Then sayde he to ye disciple: beholde thy mother. And fro that houre the disciple toke her for his awne.
John,19,28,After that when Iesus perceaved that all thinges were performed: that the scripture myght be fulfilled he sayde: I thyrst.
John,19,29,Ther stode a vessell full of veneger by. And they filled a sponge with veneger and wounde it about with ysope and put it to his mouth.
John,19,30,Assone as Iesus had receaved of the veneger he sayd: It is fynesshed and bowed his heed and gaue vp the goost.
John,19,31,The Iewes then because it was the saboth eve that ye bodyes shuld not remayne apon ye crosse on ye saboth daye (for that saboth daye was an hye daye) besought Pylate that their legges myght be broken and that they myght be taken doune.
John,19,32,Then came the soudiers and brake the legges of the fyrst and of the other which was crucified with Iesus.
John,19,33,But when they came to Iesus and sawe that he was deed already they brake not his legges:
John,19,34,but one of the soudiers with a speare thrust him into the syde and forthwith came ther out bloud and water.
John,19,35,And he that sawe it bare recorde and his recorde is true. And he knoweth that he sayth true that ye myght beleve also.
John,19,36,These thinges were done that the scripture shuld be fulfilled: Ye shall not breake a boone of him.
John,19,37,And agayne another scripture sayth: They shall looke on him whom they pearsed.
John,19,38,After that Ioseph of Aramathia (which was a disciple of Iesus: but secretly for feare of ye Iewes) besought Pylate that he myght take doune the body of Iesus. And Pylate gave him licence.
John,19,39,And ther cam also Nicodemus which at the beginnynge came to Iesus by nyght and brought of myrre and aloes mingled to gether aboute an hundred pounde wayght
John,19,40,Then toke they the body of Iesu and wounde it in lynnen clothes with the odoures as ye maner of the Iewes is to bury.
John,19,41,And in the place where Iesus was crucified was a garden and in ye garden a newe sepulchre wherin was never man layd.
John,19,42,There layde they Iesus because of the Iewes saboth even for the sepulcre was nye at honde.
John,20,1,The morow after the saboth daye came Mary Magdalene erly when it was yet darcke vnto ye sepulcre and sawe the stone taken awaye from ye toumbe.
John,20,2,Then she ranne and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whome Iesus loved and sayde vnto them. They have taken awaye the Lorde out of the toumbe and we cannot tell where they have layde him.
John,20,3,Peter went forth and that other disciple and came vnto the sepulcre.
John,20,4,They ranne bothe to gether and that other disciple dyd out runne Peter and came fyrst to the sepulcre.
John,20,5,And he stouped doune and sawe the lynnen clothes lyinge yet wet he not in.
John,20,6,Then came Simon Peter folowynge him and went into ye sepulcre and sawe the lynnen clothes lye
John,20,7,and the napkyn that was aboute his heed not lyinge with the lynnen clothe but wrapped togeder in a place by it selfe.
John,20,8,Then went in also that other disciple which came fyrst to the sepulcre and he sawe and beleved.
John,20,9,For as yet they knew not the scriptures that he shuld ryse agayne from deeth.
John,20,10,And the disciples wet awaye agayne vnto their awne home.
John,20,11,Mary stode with out at the sepulcre wepynge. And as she wept she bowed her selfe into the sepulcre
John,20,12,and sawe two angels in whyte sittyng the one at the heed and the other at the fete where they had layde the body of Iesus.
John,20,13,And they sayde vnto her: woman why wepest thou? She sayde vnto the: For they have taken awaye my lorde and I wote not where they have layde him.
John,20,14,When she had thus sayde she turned her selfe backe and sawe Iesus stondynge and knewe not that it was Iesus.
John,20,15,Iesus sayde vnto her: woman why wepest thou? Whom sekest thou? She supposynge that he had bene the gardener sayde vnto him. Syr yf thou have borne him hece tell me where thou hast layde him that I maye fet him.
John,20,16,Iesus sayde vnto her: Mary. She turned her selfe and sayde vnto him: Rabboni which is to saye master.
John,20,17,Iesus sayde vnto her touche me not for I am not yet ascended to my father. But goo to my brethren and saye vnto them I ascende vnto my father and youre father to: my god and youre god.
John,20,18,Mary Magdalene came and tolde the disciples yt she had sene the lorde and yt he had spoken soche thinges vnto her.
John,20,19,The same daye at nyght which was the morowe after ye saboth daye when the dores were shut where the disciples were assembled to geder for feare of the Iewes came Iesus and stode in the myddes and sayd to the: peace be with you.
John,20,20,And when he had so sayde he shewed vnto them his hondes and his syde. Then were the disciples glad when they sawe the Lorde.
John,20,21,Then sayde Iesus to them agayne: peace be with you. As my father sent me even so sende I you.
John,20,22,And when he had sayde that he brethed on them and sayde vnto the: Receave ye holy goost.
John,20,23,Whosoevers synnes ye remyt they are remitted vnto the. And whosoevers synnes ye retayne they are retayned.
John,20,24, But Thomas one of ye twelve called Didymus was not with the when Iesus came.
John,20,25,The other disciples sayd vnto him: we have sene ye lorde. And he sayde vnto the: except I se in his hondes the prent of the nayles and put my fynger in the holes of the nayles and thrust my honde into his syde I will not beleve.
John,20,26,And after .viii. dayes agayne his disciples were with in and Thomas with them. Then came Iesus when the dores were shut and stode in the myddes and sayde: peace be with you.
John,20,27,After that sayde he to Thomas: bringe thy fynger hether and se my hondes and bringe thy honde and thrust it into my syde and be not faythlesse but belevynge.
John,20,28,Thomas answered and sayde vnto him: my Lorde and my God.
John,20,29,Iesus sayde vnto him. Thomas because thou hast sene me therfore thou belevest: Happy are they that have not sene and yet beleve.
John,20,30,And many other signes dyd Iesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this boke.
John,20,31,These are written that ye myght beleve that Iesus is Christ the sonne of God and that in belevynge ye myght have lyfe thorowe his name.
John,21,1,After that Iesus shewed him selfe agayne at the see of Tyberias. And on this wyse shewed he him selfe.
John,21,2,There were to geder Simon Peter and Thomas which is called Didymus: and Nathanael of Cana a citie of Galile and the sonnes of Zebedei and two other of the disciples.
John,21,3,Simon Peter sayde vnto them: I goo a fysshynge. They sayde vnto him: we also will goo with the. They wet their waye and entred into a shippe strayght waye and that nyght caught they nothinge.
John,21,4,But when the mornynge was now come Iesus stode on the shore: neverthelesse the disciples knewe not yt it was Iesus.
John,21,5,Iesus sayde vnto the: syrs have ye eny meate? They answered him no.
John,21,6,And he sayde vnto them: cast out ye net on the ryght syde of the ship and ye shall fynde. They cast out and anone they were not able to drawe it for ye multitude of fysshes
John,21,7,Then sayde the disciple whom Iesus loved vnto Peter: It is the Lorde. When Simon Peter hearde that it was ye lorde he gyrde his mantell to him (for he was naked) and sprange into the see
John,21,8,The other disciples came by ship: for they were not farre from londe but as it were two hondred cubites and they drewe the net with fysshes.
John,21,9,Assone as they were come to londe they sawe hoot coles and fysshe layd ther on and breed.
John,21,10,Iesus sayde vnto them: bringe of the fysshe which ye have now caught.
John,21,11,Simon Peter stepped forthe and drewe the net to londe full of greate fysshes an hondred and .liii. And for all ther were so many yet was not the net broken.
John,21,12,Iesus sayde vnto them: come and dyne. And none of the disciples durste axe him: what arte thou? For they knewe that it was the lorde.
John,21,13,Iesus then came and toke breed and gave them and fysshe lykwyse
John,21,14,And this is now the thyrde tyme that Iesus appered to his disciples after that he was rysen agayne from deeth.

John,21,19,That spake he signifyinge by what deeth he shuld glorify God.And whe he had sayde thus he sayd to him folowe me.
John,21,20,Peter turned about and sawe that disciple who Iesus loved folowynge: which also lened on his brest at supper and sayde: Lorde which is he yt shall betraye the?

John,21,23,Then went this sayinge a broode amonge the brethren that that disciple shulde not dye. Yet Iesus sayde not to him he shall not dye: but yf I will that he tary tyll I come what is that to the?

Acts,17,29,For as moche then as we are the generacion of God we ought not to thynke that the godhed is lyke vnto golde silver or stone graven by crafte and ymaginacion of man.
Acts,17,30,And the tyme of this ignoraunce God regarded not: but now he byddeth all men every where repent
Acts,17,31,because he hath apoynted a daye in the which he will iudge the worlde acordynge to ryghtewesses by that man whom he hath apoynted and hath offered faith to all men after that he had raysed him from deeth.

Acts,18,16,and he drave them from the seate.
Acts,18,17,Then toke all the Grekes Sostenes the chefe rular of the synagoge and smote him before the iudges seate. And Gallio cared for none of tho thinges.

Acts,19,21,After these thinges were ended Paul purposed in the sprete to passe over Macedonia and Achaia and to goo to Ierusalem saying: After I have bene there I must also se Rome.
Acts,19,22,So sent he into Macedonia two of the that ministred vnto him Timotheus and Erastus: but he him selfe remayned in Asia for a season.
Acts,19,23,The same tyme ther arose no lytell a do aboute that waye.
Acts,19,24,For a certayne man named Demetrius a silvermyth which made silver schrynes for Diana was not a lytell beneficiall vnto the craftes men.
Acts,19,25,Which he called to geder with the worke men of lyke occupacion and sayd: Syrs ye knowe that by this crafte we have vauntage.
Acts,19,26,Moreover ye se and heare that not alone at Ephesus but almost thorowe oute all Asia this Paul hath persuaded and turned awaye moche people saying yt they be not goddes which are made wt hondes.
Acts,19,27,So that not only this oure crafte cometh into parell to be set at nought: but also that ye temple of ye greate goddas Diana shuld be despysed and her magnificence shuld be destroyed which all Asia and the worlde worshippeth.
Acts,19,28,When they hearde these sayinges they were full of wrathe and cryed out saying: Greate is Diana of the Ephesians.

Acts,19,32,Some cryed one thinge and some another and the congregacion was all out of quiet and ye moare parte knewe not wherfore they were come togeder.
Acts,19,33,Some of the company drue forth Alexander the Iewes thrustynge him forwardes. Alexander beckened with the honde and wolde have geven ye people an answer.
Acts,19,34,When they knewe ye he was a Iewe ther arose a shoute almost for the space of two houres of all men cryinge greate is Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts,19,35,When the toune clarcke had ceased the people he sayd: ye men of Ephesus what man is it that knoweth not how that the cite of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddas Diana and of ye ymage which came fro heven.
Acts,19,36,Seinge then yt no man sayth here agaynst ye ought to be content and to do nothinge rasshly:
Acts,19,37,For ye have brought hyther these me whiche are nether robbers of churches nor yet despisers of youre goddes.
Acts,19,38,Wherfore yf Demetrius and the craftes men which are wt him have eny sayinge to eny man the lawe is open and ther are ruelars let the accuse one another.
Acts,19,39,Yf ye goo about eny other thinge it maye be determined in a lawfull cogregacion
Acts,19,40,For we are in ieoperdy to be accused of this dayes busines: for as moche as ther is no cause wherby we maye geve a rekenynge of this concourse of people.
Acts,19,41,And when he had thus spoken he let the congregacion departe.

Acts,20,4,Ther acompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berrea and of Thessalonia Aristarcus and Secundus and Gayus of Derba and Timotheus: and out of Asia Tychicus and Trophimos.
Acts,20,5,These went before and taryed vs at Troas.

Acts,20,7,And on the morowe after the saboth daye the disciples came to geder for to breake breed and Paul preached vnto them (redy to departe on the morowe) and cotinued the preachynge vnto mydnyght.
Acts,20,8,And there were many lyghtes in the chamber where thy were gaddered to geder

Acts,20,15,And we sayled thence and came the nexte daye over agaynst Chios. And the nexte daye we aryved at Samos and taryed at Trogilion. The nexte daye we came to Myleton:
Acts,20,16,for Paul had determined to leave Ephesus as they sayled because he wolde not spende ye tyme in Asia. For he hasted to be (yf he coulde possible) at Ierusalem at the daye of pentecoste.
Acts,20,17,Wherfore from Myleton he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the cogregacion.
Acts,20,18,And when they were come to him he sayde vnto the: Ye knowe fro the fyrst daye yt I came vnto Asia after what maner I have bene wt you at all ceasons
Acts,20,19,servynge the lorde with all humblenes of mynde and with many teares and temptacions which happened vnto me by the layinges awayte of the Ieues
Acts,20,20,and how I kept backe no thinge that was profitable: but that I have shewed you and taught you openly and at home in youre houses
Acts,20,21,witnessinge bothe to the Iewes and also to the Grekes the repentaunce toward God and faith towarde oure Lorde Iesu.
Acts,20,22,And now beholde I goo bounde in the sprete vnto Ierusalem and knowe not what shall come on me there
Acts,20,23,but that the holy goost witnesseth in every cite sayinge: yt bondes and trouble abyde me.

Acts,20,28,Take hede therfore vnto youre selves and to all the flocke wherof the holy goost hath made you oversears to rule the congregacion of God which he hath purchased with his bloud.
Acts,20,29,For I am sure of this that after my departynge shall greveous wolves entre in amonge you which will not spare the flocke.
Acts,20,30,Moreover of youre awne selves shall men aryse speakinge perverse thinges to drawe disciples after the.
Acts,20,31,Therfore awake and remember that by the space of .iii. yeares I ceased not to warne every one of you both nyght and daye with teares.

Acts,21,9,The same man had fower doughters virges which dyd prophesy.
Acts,21,10,And as we taried there a good many dayes there came a certayne prophete from Iurie named Agabus.
Acts,21,11,When he was come vnto vs he toke Pauls gerdell and bounde his hondes and fete and sayde: thus saith the holy goost: so shall ye Iewes at Ierusalem bynde the man yt oweth this gerdell and shall delyver him into the hondes of the gentyls.
Acts,21,12,When we hearde this both we and other of the same place besought him that he wolde not goo vp to Ierusalem.
Acts,21,13,Then Paul answered and sayde: what do ye wepynge and breakinge myne hert? I am redy not to be bound only but also to dye at Ierusalem for ye name of ye Lorde Iesu.
Acts,21,14,When we coulde not turne his mynde we ceased sayinge: the will of ye Lorde be fulfilled.
Acts,21,15,After those dayes we made oure selfes redy and went vp to Ierusalem.
Acts,21,16,There went with vs also certayne of his disciples of Cesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus an olde disciple with whom we shuld lodge.
Acts,21,17,And when we were come to Ierusalem the brethren receaved vs gladly.

Acts,21,21,And they are informed of the that thou teachest all the Iewes which are amoge the gentyls to forsake Moses and sayst that they ought not to circumcise their chyldren nether to live after the customes.
Acts,21,22,What is it therfore? The multitude must nedes come togeder. For they shall heare that thou arte come.
Acts,21,23,Do therfore this that we saye to the. We have .iiii. men which have a vowe on them.
Acts,21,24,Them take and purifye thy selfe with them and do cost on them that they maye shave their heeddes and all shall knowe yt tho thinges which they have hearde concerninge the are nothinge: but that thou thy selfe also walkest and kepest the lawe.
Acts,21,25,For as touchinge the gentyls which beleve we have written and concluded yt they observe no soche thinges: but that they kepe them selves from thinges offred to ydoles from bloud fro strangled and fro fornicacion.
Acts,21,26,Then the nexte daye Paul toke the men and purified him selfe with them and entred into the teple declaringe that he observed the dayes of ye purificacio vntyll that an offeringe shuld be offred for every one of them.
Acts,21,27,And as the seven dayes shuld have bene ended ye Iewes which were of Asia when they sawe him in the teple they moved all the people and layde hondes on him
Acts,21,28,cryinge: men of Israel helpe. This is the man that teacheth all men every where agaynst the people and the lawe and this place. Moreover also he hath brought Grekes into the teple and hath polluted this holy place.
Acts,21,29,For they sawe one Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the cyte. Him they supposed Paul had brought into the teple.
Acts,21,30,And all the cyte was moved and the people swarmed to geder. And they toke Paul and drue him out of the teple and forthwith the dores were shut to.
Acts,21,31,As they went about to kyll him tydinges came vnto the hye captayne of the soudiers that all Ierusalem was moved.
Acts,21,32,Which immediatly toke soudiers and vndercaptaynes and ranne doune vnto them. When they sawe ye vpper captayne and the soudiers they lefte smytinge of Paul.
Acts,21,33,Then the captayne came neare and toke him and comaunded him to be bounde with two chaynes and demaunded what he was and what he had done.
Acts,21,34,And one cryed this another that amoge the people. And whe he coulde not knowe the certayntie for ye rage he comaunded him to be caryed into the castle.
Acts,21,35,And whe he came vnto a grece it fortuned that he was borne of the soudiers of the violence of the people.
Acts,21,36,For the multitude of the people folowed after cryinge: awaye wt him.
Acts,21,37,And as Paul shuld have bene caryed into the castle he sayde vnto the hye Captayne: maye I speake vnto the? Which sayde: canst thou speake Greke?
Acts,21,38,Arte not thou that Egypcian which before these dayes made an vproure and ledde out into the wildernes .iiii. thousande men that were mortherers?
Acts,21,39,But Paul sayde: I am a ma which am a Iewe of Tharsus a cite in Cicill a Citesyn of no vyle cite I beseche ye soffre me to speake vnto ye people.

Acts,22,1,Ye men brethre and fathers heare myne answere which I make vnto you.
Acts,22,2,Whe they hearde that he spake in ye Ebrue tonge to them they kept the moore silence. And he sayde:
Acts,22,3,I am verely aman which am a Iewe borne in Tharsus a cite in Cicill: neverthelesse yet brought vp in this cite at ye fete of Gamaliel and informed diligently in the lawe of the fathers and was fervent mynded to Godwarde as ye all are this same daye
Acts,22,4,and I persecuted this waye vnto the deeth byndynge and delyveringe into preson bothe men and wemen
Acts,22,5,as the chefe prest doth beare me witnes and all the elders: of whom also I receaved letters vnto the brethren and wet to Damasco to bringe them which were there bounde vnto Ierusalem for to be punysshed.
Acts,22,6,And it fortuned as I made my iorney and was come nye vnto Damasco aboute none yt sodenly ther shone fro heaven a greate lyght rounde aboute me
Acts,22,7,and I fell vnto the erth and hearde a voyce sayinge vnto me: Saul Saul why persecutest thou me?
Acts,22,8,And I answered: what arte thou Lorde? And he sayd vnto me: I am Iesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest.
Acts,22,9,And they that were with me sawe verely a lyght and were a frayde: but they hearde not the voyce of him that spake with me.
Acts,22,10,And I sayde: what shall I do Lorde? And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Aryse and goo into Damasco and there it shalbe tolde the of all thinges which are apoynted for the to do.
Acts,22,11,And when I sawe nothynge for the brightnes of that light I was ledde by the honde of them that were with me and came into Damasco.
Acts,22,12,And one Ananias a perfect man and as pertayninge to the lawe havinge good reporte of all the Iewes which there dwelt
Acts,22,13,came vnto me and stode and sayd vnto me: Brother Saul loke vp. And that same houre I receaved my sight and sawe him.
Acts,22,14,And he sayde the God of oure fathers hath ordeyned the before that thou shuldest knowe his will and shuldest se that which is rightfull and shuldest heare the voyce of his mouth:
Acts,22,15,for thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men of tho thinges which thou thou hast sene and hearde.
Acts,22,16,And now: why tariest thou? Aryse and be baptised and wesshe awaye thy synnes in callinge on ye name of ye Lorde.
Acts,22,17,And it fortuned when I was come agayne to Ierusalem and prayde in the teple yt I was in a trauce
Acts,22,18,and sawe him sayinge vnto me. Make haste and get the quickly out of Ierusalem: for they will not receave thy witnes yt thou bearest of me.
Acts,22,19,And I sayde: Lorde they knowe that I presoned and bet in every synagoge them that beleved on the.
Acts,22,20,And when the bloud of thy witnes Steven was sheed I also stode by and consented vnto his deeth and kept the rayment of them that slewe him.
Acts,22,21,And he sayde vnto me: departe for I will sende the a farre hence vnto the Gentyls.
Acts,22,22,They gave him audience vnto this worde and then lifte vp their voyces and sayde: a waye wt soche a felowe fro the erth: yt is pitie that he shuld live.
Acts,22,23,And as they cryed and cast of their clothes and thrue dust into ye ayer
Acts,22,24,ye captayne bade him to be brought into the castle and commaunded him to be scourged and to be examined that he myght knowe wherfore they cryed on him.
Acts,22,25,And as they bounde him with thoges Paul sayde vnto the Centurion that stode by: Ys it laufull for you to scourge a man that is a Romain and vncondempned?
Acts,22,26,When the Centurion hearde that he went and tolde the vpper captayne sayinge: What intendest thou to do? This man is a Romayne.
Acts,22,27,Then the vpper captayne came and sayde to him: tell me art thou a Romayne? He sayde: Yee.
Acts,22,28,And the captayne answered: with a greate some obtayned I this fredome. And Paul sayde: I was fre borne.
Acts,22,29,Then strayght waye departed from him they which shuld have examyned him. And the hye captayne also was a frayde after he knewe that he was a Romayne: because he had bounde him.
Acts,22,30,On the morowe because he wolde have knowen the certayntie wherfore he was accused of the Iewes he lowsed him from his bondes and commaunded the hye Prestes and all the counsell to come together and brought Paul and set him before them.
Acts,23,1,Paul behelde the counsell and sayde: men and brethre I have lived in all good coscience before God vntill this daye.
Acts,23,2,The hye prest Ananias comaunded the that stode by to smyte him on the mouth.
Acts,23,3,Then sayde Paul to him: God smyte the thou payntyd wall. Sittest thou and iudgest me after the lawe: and commaundest me to be smytten contrary to the lawe?
Acts,23,4,And they that stode by sayde: revylest thou Goddes hye preste?
Acts,23,5,Then sayd Paul: I wist not brethren that he was the hye preste. For it is writte thou shalt not curse the rular of thy people.
Acts,23,6,When Paul perceaved that the one parte were Saduces and the other Pharises: he cryed oute in the counsell. Men and brethren I am a Pharisaye the sonne of a Pharisaye. Of the hope and resurreccion fro deeth I am iudged.
Acts,23,7,And when he had so sayde ther arose a debate bitwene the Pharisayes and ye Saduces and the multitude was devided.
Acts,23,8,For ye Saduces saye that ther is no resurreccio nether angell nor sprete. But the Pharisayes graunt bothe.
Acts,23,9,And ther arose a great crye and the Scribes which were of the Pharisayes parte arose and strove sayinge: we fynde none evyll in this man. Though a sprete or an angell hath apered to him let vs not stryve agaynst God.
Acts,23,10,And when ther arose greate debate the captayne fearynge lest Paul shuld have bene pluckt asondre of them comaunded the soudiers to goo doune and to take him from amonge them and to bringe him into the castle.
Acts,23,11,The nyght folowyng God stode by him and sayde: Be of good cheare Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Ierusalem so must thou beare witnes at Rome.
Acts,23,12,When daye was come certayne of the Iewes gaddered them selves to geder and made a vowe sayinge that they wolde nether eate nor drinke till they had killed Paul.
Acts,23,13,They were aboute .xl. which had made this conspiracio.
Acts,23,14,And they cam to ye chefe prestes and elders and sayde: we have boude oure selves with a vowe that we will eate nothinge vntill we have slayne Paul.
Acts,23,15,Now therfore geve ye knowlege to the vpper captayne and to the counsell that he bringe him forth vnto vs to morow as though we wolde knowe some thinge more perfectly of him. But we (or ever he come neare) are redy in ye meane season to kill him.
Acts,23,16,When Pauls sisters sonne hearde of their layinge awayte he wet and entred into the castle and tolde Paul.
Acts,23,17,And Paul called one of ye vnder captaynes vnto him and sayde: bringe this younge man vnto ye hye captayne: for he hath a certayne thinge to shewe him.
Acts,23,18,And he toke him and sayd: Paul ye presoner called me vnto him and prayed me to brige this youge ma vnto ye which hath a certayne matter to shewe ye.
Acts,23,19,The hye captayne toke him by the hond and wet a parte with him out of the waye: and axed him: what hast thou to saye vnto me?
Acts,23,20,And he sayd: the Iewes are determined to desyre the yt thou woldest brynge forth Paul to morowe into the counsell as though they wolde enquyre somwhat of him more parfectly.
Acts,23,21,But folowe not their mindes: for ther lyein wayte for him of the moo then .xl. men which have boude the selves wt a vowe that they will nether eate ner drinke till they have killed him. And now are they redy and loke for thy promes.
Acts,23,22,The vpper captayne let ye yoge man departe and charged: se thou tell it out to no man that thou hast shewed these thinges to me.
Acts,23,23,And he called vnto him two vnder captaynes sayinge: make redy two hondred soudiers to goo to Cesarea and horsmen threscore and ten and speare men two houndred at the thyrde houre of the nyght.
Acts,23,24,And delyvre them beastes that they maye put Paul on and bringe him safe vnto Felix the hye debite
Acts,23,25,and wrote a letter in this maner.
Acts,23,26,Claudius Lisias vnto ye most mighty rular Felix sendeth gretinges.
Acts,23,27,This man was take of the Iewes and shuld have bene killed of them. Then cam I with soudiers and rescued him and perceaved that he was a Romayne.
Acts,23,28,And when I wolde have knowen the cause wherfore they accused him I brought him forth into their cousell.
Acts,23,29,There perceaved I yt he was accused of questios of their lawe: but was not giltye of eny thinge worthy of deeth or of bondes.
Acts,23,30,Afterwarde when it was shewed me how that ye Iewes layde wayte for ye man I sent him strayght waye to the and gave commaundmet to his accusars yf they had ought agaynst him to tell it vnto ye: fare well.
Acts,23,31,Then ye soudiers as it was comaunded the toke Paul and brought him by nyght to Antipatras.
Acts,23,32,On the morowe they lefte horsmen to goo with him and returned vnto the castle.
Acts,23,33,Which when they cam to Cesarea they delivered the epistle to the debite and presented Paul before him.
Acts,23,34,When the debite had redde the letter he axed of what countre he was and when he vnderstode that he was of Cicill
Acts,23,35,I will heare the (sayde he) whe thyne accusars are come also: and commaunded him to be kepte in Herodes pallys.
Acts,24,1,After .v. dayes Ananias the hye preste descended with elders and with a certayne Oratour named Tartullus and enformed the ruelar of Paul.
Acts,24,2,When Paul was called forth Tartullus beganne to accuse him saying: Seynge yt we live in great quyetnes by the meanes of the and that many good thinges are done vnto this nacion thorow thy providence:
Acts,24,3,that alowe we ever and in all places most myghty Felix with all thankes.
Acts,24,4,Notwithstondinge that I be not tedeous vnto the I praye the that thou woldest heare vs of thy curtesy a feawe wordes.
Acts,24,5,We have founde this ma a pestilent felowe and a mover of debate vnto all the Iewes thorowe out the worlde and a mayntayner of ye secte of the Nazarites
Acts,24,6,and hath also enforsed to pollute the temple. Whom we toke and wolde have iudged acordinge to oure lawe:
Acts,24,7,but the hye captayne Lisias came vpon vs and with great violence toke him awaye out of oure hodes
Acts,24,8,comaundinge his accusars to come vnto the. Of who thou mayst (yf thou wilt enquyre) knowe the certayne of all these thinges where of we accuse him.
Acts,24,9,The Iewes lyke wyse affermed sayinge that it was even so.
Acts,24,10,Then Paul (after that the rular him selfe had beckened vnto him that he shuld speake) answered: I shall with a moare quyet minde answere for my selfe for as moche as I vnderstonde yt thou hast bene of many yeares a iudge vnto this people
Acts,24,11,because that thou mayst knowe yt there are yet .xii. dayes sence I went vp to Ierusalem for to praye
Acts,24,12,and that they nether founde me in the teple disputinge with eny man other raysinge vp the people nether in the Synagoges nor in the cite.
Acts,24,13,Nether can they prove ye thinges wher of they accuse me.
Acts,24,14,But this I confesse vnto ye that after that waye (which they call heresy) so worshippe I the God of my fathers belevinge all thinges which are writte in the lawe and ye Prophetes
Acts,24,15,and have hope towardes God that ye same resurreccion from deeth (which they them selves loke for also) shalbe both of iust and vniust.
Acts,24,16,And therfore stody I to have a cleare consciece towarde God and toward man also.
Acts,24,17,But after many yeres I came and brought almes to my people and offeringes
Acts,24,18,in the which they founde me purified in the teple nether with multitude nor yet wt vnquyetnes How beit there were certayne Iewes out of Asia
Acts,24,19,which ought to be here present before the and accuse me yf they had ought agaynst me:
Acts,24,20,or els let these same here saye if they have founde eny evyll doinge in me whill I stonde here in ye counsell:
Acts,24,21,except it be for this one voyce yt I cryed stondinge amoge the of the resurreccion fro deeth am I iudged of you this daye.
Acts,24,22,When Felix hearde these thinges he deferde them for he knewe very well of yt waye and sayde: when Lisias the captayne is come I will know the vtmost of youre matters.
Acts,24,23,And he commaunded an vndercaptayne to kepe Paul and that he shuld have rest and that he shuld forbyd none of his aquayntauce to minister vnto him or to come vnto him.
Acts,24,24,And after a certayne dayes ca Felix and his wyfe Drusilla which was a Iewas and called forth Paul and hearde him of the fayth which is toward Christ.
Acts,24,25,And as he preached of righteousnes temperauce and iudgement to come Felix trembled and answered: thou hast done ynough at this tyme departe when I have a conveniet tyme I will sende for the.
Acts,24,26,He hoped also that money shuld have bene geven him of Paul that he myght lowse him: wherfore he called him ye oftener and comened with him.
Acts,24,27,But after two yeare Festus Porcius came into Felix roume. And Felix willinge to shewe ye Iewes a pleasure lefte Paul in preson bounde.
Acts,25,1,When Festus was come into the province after thre dayes he ascended fro Cesarea vnto Ierusalem.
Acts,25,2,Then enformed him the hye prestes and the chefe of the Iewes of Paul. And they besought him
Acts,25,3,and desired faveour agaynst him that he wold sende for him to Ierusalem: and layde awayte for him in the waye to kill him.
Acts,25,4,Festus answered that Paul shuld be kept at Cesarea: but that he him selfe wold shortly departe thither.
Acts,25,5,Let the therfore (sayd he) which amoge you are able to do it come doune with vs and accuse him if ther be eny faute in the man.
Acts,25,6,When he had taried there moare then ten dayes he departed vnto Cesarea and the nexte daye sate doune in the iudgemet seate and commaunded Paul to be brought.
Acts,25,7,When he was come the Iewes which were come fro Ierusalem came aboute him and layde many and greveous complayntes agaynst Paul which they coulde not prove
Acts,25,8,as longe as he answered for him selfe that he had nether agaynst the lawe of the Iewes nether agaynst the temple nor yet agaynst Cesar offended eny thinge at all.
Acts,25,9,Festus willinge to do the Iewes a pleasure answered Paul and sayde: wilt thou goo to Ierusalem and there be iudged of these thinges before me?
Acts,25,10,Then sayd Paul: I stonde at Cesars iudgemet seate where I ought to be iudged. To ye Iewes have I no harme done as thou verely well knowest.
Acts,25,11,If I have hurte them or comitted eny thinge worthy of deeth I refuse not to dye. If none of these thinges are where of they accuse me no man owght to delyver me to them. I appeale vnto Cesar.
Acts,25,12,Then spake Festus with deliberacion and answered. Thou hast appealed vnto Cesar: vnto Cesar shalt thou goo.
Acts,25,13,After a certayne dayes kinge Agrippa and Bernice came vnto Cesarea to salute Festus.
Acts,25,14,And when they had bene there a good ceason Festus rehersed Paules cause vnto ye kynge sayinge: ther is a certayne man left in preson of Felix
Acts,25,15,about whom when I came to Ierusalem the hye prestes and elders of the Iewes enformed me and desyred to have iudgement agaynst him.
Acts,25,16,To whom I answered: It is not the maner of the Romayns to delyver eny man that he shuld perisshe before that he which is accused have the accusars before him and have licence to answer for him selfe concerninge ye cryme layde agaynst him:
Acts,25,17,whe they were come hidder wt out delaye on the morowe I sate to geve iudgement and comaunded ye ma to be brought forthe.
Acts,25,18,Agaynst who when ye accusers stode vp they brought none accusacion of soche thinges as I supposed:
Acts,25,19,but had certayne questions agaynst him of their awne supersticion and of one Iesus which was ded: whom Paul affirmed to be alyve.
Acts,25,20,And be cause I douted of soche maner questions I axed him whyther he wolde goo to Ierusalem and there be iudged of these matters.
Acts,25,21,Then when Paul had appealed to be kept vnto the knowledge of Cesar I commaunded him to be kept tyll I myght sende him to Cesar.
Acts,25,22,Agrippa sayd vnto Festus: I wolde also heare ye man my selfe. To morowe (sayde he) thou shalt heare him.
Acts,25,23,And on ye morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with greate pompe and were entred into the counsell housse with the captaynes and chefe men of the cite at Festus commaundement Paul was brought forth.
Acts,25,24,And Festus sayde: kynge Agrippa and all men which are heare present wt vs: ye se this man about whom all the multitude of the Iewes have bene with me both at Ierusalem and also here cryinge that he ought not to lyve eny lenger.
Acts,25,25,Yet founde I nothinge worthy of deeth that he had comitted. Neverthelesse seinge that he hath appealed to Cesar I have determined to sende him.
Acts,25,26,Of whom I have no certayne thinge to wryte vnto my lorde. Wherfore I have brought him vnto you and specially vnto the kynge Agrippa that after examinacion had I myght have sumwhat to wryte.
Acts,25,27,For me thynketh it vnreasonable for to sende a presoner and not to shewe the causes which are layde agaynst him.
Acts,26,1,Agrippa sayde vnto Paul: thou arte permitted to speake for thy selfe. Then Paul stretched forth the honde and answered for him selfe.
Acts,26,2,I thynke my selfe happy kynge Agrippa because I shall answere this daye before the of all the thinges wherof I am accused of ye Iewes
Acts,26,3,namely because thou arte experte in all customes and questions which are amonge the Iewes. Wherfore I beseche the to heare me paciently.
Acts,26,4,My lyvynge of a chylde which was at the fyrst amoge myne awne nacion at Ierusalem knowe all the Iewes
Acts,26,5,which knew me from ye beginnynge yf they wolde testifie it. For after the most straytest secte of oure laye lyved I a pharisaye.
Acts,26,6,And now I stond and am iudged for the hope of the promes made of God vnto oure fathers:
Acts,26,7,vnto which promes oure .xii. tribes instantly servynge God daye and nyght hope to come. For which hopes sake kynge Agrippa am I accused of the Iewes.
Acts,26,8,Why shuld it be thought a thinge vncredible vnto you that god shuld rayse agayne the deed?
Acts,26,9,I also verely thought in my selfe that I ought to do many cotrary thinges clene agaynst the name of Iesus of Nazareth:
Acts,26,10,which thinge I also dyd in Ierusalem. Where many of the sainctes I shut vp in preson and had receaved auctorite of ye hye prestes. And whe they were put to deeth I gave the sentence.
Acts,26,11,And I punysshed them ofte in every synagoge and compelled them to blaspheme: and was yet more mad apon them and persecuted the even vnto straunge cities.
Acts,26,12,About the which thinges as I went to Damasco with auctorite and licence of the hye Prestes
Acts,26,13,even at myddaye (o kynge) I sawe in ye waye a lyght from heven above the brightnes of the sunne shyne rounde about me and them which iorneyed with me.
Acts,26,14,When we were all fallen to the erth I hearde a voyce speakynge vnto me and sayinge in ye Hebrue tonge: Saul Saul why persecutest thou me? It is harde for the to kicke agaynste the pricke.
Acts,26,15,And I sayde: Who arte thou lorde? And he sayde I am Iesus whom thou persecutest.
Acts,26,16,But ryse and stond vp on thy fete. For I have apered vnto the for this purpose to make the a minister and a witnes both of tho thinges which thou hast sene and of tho thinges in the which I will appere vnto the
Acts,26,17,delyverynge the from the people and from ye gentyls vnto which nowe I sende the
Acts,26,18,to open their eyes that they myght turne from darcknes vnto lyght and from the power of Satan vnto God that they maye receave forgevenes of synnes and inheritauce amonge the which are sanctified by fayth in me.
Acts,26,19,Wherfore kynge Agrippa I was not disobedient vnto the hevenly vision:
Acts,26,20,but shewed fyrst vnto them of Damasco and at Ierusalem and thorow out all the costes of Iewry and to the gentyls that they shuld repent and turne to God and do the ryght workes of repentaunce.
Acts,26,21,For this cause the Iewes caught me in the temple and went about to kyll me.
Acts,26,22,Neverthelesse I obtayned helpe of God and cotynew vnto this daye witnessyng bothe to small and to greate saying none other thinges then those which the prophetes and Moses dyd saye shuld come
Acts,26,23,that Christ shulde suffre and that he shuld be the fyrst that shulde ryse from deeth and shuld shewe lyght vnto the people and the gentyls.
Acts,26,24,As he thus answered for him selfe: Festus sayde with a lowde voyce: Paul thou arte besides thy selfe. Moche learnynge hath made the mad.
Acts,26,25,And Paul sayde: I am not mad most dere Festus: but speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes.
Acts,26,26,The kynge knoweth of these thinges before whom I speke frely: nether thynke I that eny of these thinges are hydden fro him. For this thinge was not done in a corner.
Acts,26,27,Kynge Agrippa belevest thou ye prophetes? I wote well thou belevest.
Acts,26,28,Agrippa sayde vnto Paul: Sumwhat thou bringest me in mynde for to be come a Christen.
Acts,26,29,And Paul sayd: I wolde to God that not only thou: but also all that heare me to daye were not sumwhat only but altogeder soche as I am except these bondes.
Acts,26,30,And when he had thus spoken the kynge rose vp and the debite and Bernice and they that sate with them.
Acts,26,31,And when they were gone aparte they talked betwene them selves sayinge: This man doeth nothinge worthy of deeth nor of bondes.
Acts,26,32,Then sayde Agrippa vnto Festus: This man myght have bene lowsed yf he had not appealed vnto Cesar.
Acts,27,1,When it was cocluded that we shuld sayle into Italy they delivered Paul and certayne other presoners vnto one named Iulius an vnder captayne of Cesars soudiars.
Acts,27,2,And we entred into a ship of Adramicium and lowsed from lond apoynted to sayle by the costes of Asia one Aristarcus out of Macedonia of the contre of Thessalia beinge with vs.
Acts,27,3,And the nexte daye we came to Sidon. And Iulius courteously entreated Paul and gave him liberte to goo vnto his frendes and to refresshe him selfe.
Acts,27,4,And from thence lanched we and sayled harde by Cypers because the wyndes were contrarye.
Acts,27,5,Then sayled we over the see of Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Myra a cite in Lycia.
Acts,27,6,And there ye vnder captayne founde a shippe of Alexander redy to sayle into Italy and put vs therin.
Acts,27,7,And when we had sayled slowly many dayes and scace were come over agaynst Gnydon (because the wynde with stode vs) we sayled harde by the costes of Candy over agaynste Salmo
Acts,27,8,and with moche worke sayled beyonde yt and came vnto a place called good porte. Nye whervnto was a citie called Lasea.
Acts,27,9,When moche tyme was spent and saylinge was now ieoperdeous because also that we had overlonge fasted Paul put them in remembraunce
Acts,27,10,and sayde vnto them Syrs I perceave that this vyage wilbe with hurte and moche domage not of the ladynge and ship only: but also of oure lyves.
Acts,27,11,Neverthelather the vndercaptayne beleved the governer and the master better then tho thinges which were spoken of Paul.
Acts,27,12,And because the haven was not comodius to wynter in many toke counsell to departe thence yf by eny meanes they myght attayne to Phenices and there to wynter which is an haven of Candy and servith to the southwest and northwest wynde.
Acts,27,13,When the south wynde blewe they supposynge to obtayne their purpose lowsed vnto Asson and sayled paste all Candy.
Acts,27,14,But anone after ther arose agaynste their purpose a flawe of wynde out of the northeeste.
Acts,27,15,And when the ship was caught and coulde not resist the wynde we let her goo and drave with the wether.
Acts,27,16,And we came vnto an yle named Clauda and had moche worke to come by abote
Acts,27,17,which they toke vp and vsed helpe vndergerdynge the shippe fearynge lest we shuld have fallen into Syrtes and we let doune a vessell and so were caryed.
Acts,27,18,The nexte daye when we were tossed wt an exceadynge tempest they lyghtened ye ship
Acts,27,19,and the thyrde daye we cast out with oure awne hondes the tacklynge of the shippe.
Acts,27,20,When at the last nether sunne nor starre in many dayes appered and no small tempest laye apon vs all hope that we shuld be saved was then taken awaye.
Acts,27,21,Then after longe abstinence Paul stode forth in the myddes of them and sayde: Syrs ye shulde have harkened to me and not have lowsed from Candy nether to have brought vnto vs this harme and losse.
Acts,27,22,And nowe I exhorte you to be of good chere. For ther shalbe no losse of eny mas lyfe amonge you save of the ship only.
Acts,27,23,For ther stode by me this nyght the angell of God whose I am and whom I serve
Acts,27,24,sayinge: feare not Paul for thou must be brought before Cesar. And lo God hath geven vnto the all that sayle with ye.
Acts,27,25,Wherfore Syrs be of good chere: for I beleve God that so it shalbe even as it was tolde me.
Acts,27,26,How be it we must be cast into a certayne ylonde.
Acts,27,27,But when ye fourtethe nyght was come as we were caryed in Adria about mydnyght the shipmen demed that ther appered some countre vnto the:
Acts,27,28,and sounded and founde it .xx. feddoms. And when they had gone a lytell further they sounded agayne and founde .xv. feddoms.
Acts,27,29,Then fearinge lest they shuld have fallen on some Rocke they cast .iiii. ancres out of the sterne and wysshed for ye daye.
Acts,27,30,As the shipmen were about to fle out of the ship and had let doune the bote into the see vnder a coloure as though they wolde have cast ancres out of the forshippe:
Acts,27,31,Paul sayd vnto ye vnder captayne and the soudiers: excepte these abyde in the ship ye cannot be safe.
Acts,27,32,Then the soudiers cut of the rope of the bote and let it fall awaye.
Acts,27,33,And in ye meane tyme betwixt that and daye Paul besought them all to take meate sayinge: this is ye fourtenthe daye that ye have taried and continued fastynge receavinge nothinge at all.
Acts,27,34,Wherfore I praye you to take meate: for this no dout is for youre helth: for ther shall not an heere fall fro the heed of eny of you.
Acts,27,35,And when he had thus spoke he toke breed and gave thankes to God in presence of the all and brake it and begane to eate.
Acts,27,36,Then were they all of good cheare and they also toke meate.
Acts,27,37,We were all together in ye ship two hundred thre score and sixtene soules.
Acts,27,38,And whe they had eate ynough they lightened ye ship and cast out the wheate into the see.
Acts,27,39,Whe yt was daye they knew not ye lande but they spied a certayne haven with a banke into ye which they were mynded (yf yt were possible) to thrust in the ship.
Acts,27,40,And when they had taken vp the ancres they comytted them selves vnto the see and lowsed the rudder bondes and hoysed vp ye mayne sayle to the wynde and drue to londe.
Acts,27,41,But they chaunsed on a place which had the see on bothe the sydes and thrust in the ship. And the foore parte stucke fast and moved not but ye hynder brake with the violence of the waves.
Acts,27,42,The soudears counsell was to kyll ye presoners lest eny of them when he had swome out shulde fle awaye.
Acts,27,43,But the vndercaptayne willinge to save Paul kept the from their purpose and commaunded that they yt could swyme shulde cast the selves first in to ye see and scape to londe.
Acts,27,44,And the other he comaunded to goo some on bordes and some on broken peces of the ship. And so it came to passe that they came all safe to londe.
Acts,28,1,And when they were scaped then they knewe that the yle was called Milete.
Acts,28,2,And the people of the countre shewed vs no lytell kyndnes: for they kyndled a fyre and receaved vs every one because of the present rayne and because of colde.
Acts,28,3,And when Paul had gaddered a boundle of stickes and put them into the fyre ther came a viper out of the heet and lept on his honde.
Acts,28,4,When the men of the contre sawe the worme hange on his honde they sayde amonge the selves: this man must nedes be a mortherer. Whome (though he have escaped the see) yet vengeaunce suffreth not to lyve.
Acts,28,5,But he shouke of the vermen into the fyre and felt no harme.
Acts,28,6,Howbeit they wayted when he shuld have swolne or fallen doune deed sodenly. But after they had loked a greate whyle and sawe no harme come to him they chaunged their myndes and sayde that he was a God.
Acts,28,7,In the same quarters the chefe man of the yle whose name was Publius had a lordshippe: the same receaved vs and lodged vs thre dayes courteously.
Acts,28,8,And it fortuned that the father of Publius laye sicke of a fiever and of a bluddy flixe. To who Paul entred in and prayde and layde his hondes on him and healed him.
Acts,28,9,When this was done other also which had diseases in the yle came and were healed.
Acts,28,10,And they dyd vs gret honoure. And when we departed they laded vs with thinges necessary.
Acts,28,11,After thre monethes we departed in a ship of Alexandry which had wyntred in the yle whose badge was Castor and Pollux.
Acts,28,12,And whe we came to Cyracusa we taryed there .iii. dayes.
Acts,28,13,And from thence we set a compasse and came to Regium. And after one daye the south wynde blewe and we came the next daye to Putiolus:
Acts,28,14,where we founde brethren and were desyred to tary with them seven dayes and so came to Rome.
Acts,28,15,And from thence when ye brethren hearde of vs they came agaynst vs to Apiphorum and to ye thre taverns. When Paul sawe the he thanked God and wexed bolde.
Acts,28,16,And when he came to Rome ye vnder captayne delyvered ye presoners to ye chefe captayne of ye host: but Paul was suffered to dwell by him selfe with one soudier that kept him.
Acts,28,17,And it fortuned after thre dayes that Paul called ye chefe of ye Iewes together. And whe they were come he sayde vnto the: Men and brethren though I have comitted nothinge agaynst the people or lawes of oure fathers: yet was I delyvered presoner from Ierusalem in to the hondes of ye Romayns.
Acts,28,18,Which when they had examined me wolde have let me goo because they founde no cause of deeth in me.
Acts,28,19,But when ye Iewes cryed cotrary I was constrayned to appeale vnto Cesar: not because I had ought to accuse my people of.
Acts,28,20,For this cause have I called for you eve to se you and to speake with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bounde with this chayne.
Acts,28,21,And they sayde vnto him: We nether receaved letters out of Iewry pertayninge vnto ye nether came eny of the brethren that shewed or spake eny harme of the.
Acts,28,22,But we will heare of the what thou thynkest. For we have hearde of this secte that every wheare it is spoken agaynst.
Acts,28,23,And when they had apoynted him a daye ther came many vnto him into his lodgynge. To whom he expounded and testifyed the kyngdome of God and preached vnto the of Iesu: both out of the lawe of Moses and also out of the prophetes even from mornynge to nyght.
Acts,28,24,And some beleved ye thinges which were spoken and some beleved not.
Acts,28,25,When they agreed not amonge the selves they departed after that Paul had spoken one worde. Well spake the holy goost by Esay ye prophet vnto oure fathers
Acts,28,26,sayinge: Goo vnto this people and saye: with youre eares shall ye heare and shall not vnderstonde: and with youre eyes shall ye se and shall not perceave.
Acts,28,27,For the hert of this people is wexed grosse and their eares were thycke of hearynge and their eyes have they closed: lest they shuld se with their eyes and heare with their eares and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shulde heale them.
Acts,28,28,Be it knowen therfore vnto you that this salvacion of God is sent to the gentyls and they shall heare it.
Acts,28,29,And when he had sayde that the Iewes departed and had grete despicios amonge them selves.
Acts,28,30,And Paul dwelt two yeares full in his lodgynge and receaved all that came to him
Acts,28,31,preachyng the kyngdome of God and teachynge those thinges which concerned the lorde Iesus with all confidence vnforboden.
Romans,1,1,Paul the seruaut of Iesus Christ called to be an Apostle put a parte to preache the Gospell of God
Romans,1,2,which he promysed afore by his Prophetes in the holy scriptures
Romans,1,3,that make mension of his sonne the which was begotte of the seed of David as pertayninge to the flesshe:
Romans,1,4,and declared to be the sonne of God with power of the holy goost that sanctifieth sence ye tyme that Iesus Christ oure Lorde rose agayne from deeth
Romans,1,5,by whom we have receaved grace and apostleshyppe to bringe all maner hethe people vnto obedience of the fayth that is in his name:
Romans,1,6,of the which hethen are ye a part also which are Iesus christes by vocacio.
Romans,1,7,To all you of Rome beloved of God and saynctes by callinge. Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
Romans,1,8,Fyrst verely I thanke my God thorow Iesus Christ for you all because youre fayth is publisshed through out all the worlde.
Romans,1,9,For God is my witnes whom I serve with my sprete in the Gospell of his sonne that with out ceasinge I make mencion of you alwayes in my prayers
Romans,1,10,besechinge that at one tyme or another a prosperous iorney (by ye will of god) myght fortune me to come vnto you.
Romans,1,11,For I longe to see you that I myght bestowe amoge you some spirituall gyfte to strength you with all:
Romans,1,12,that is that I myght have consolacion together with you through the commen fayth which bothe ye and I have.
Romans,1,13,I wolde that ye shuld knowe brethre how that I have often tymes purposed to come vnto you (but have bene let hitherto) to have some frute amonge you as I have amonge other of ye Gentyls.
Romans,1,14,For I am detter both to the Grekes and to them which are no Grekes vnto the learned and also vnto the vnlearned.
Romans,1,15,Lykewyse as moche as in me is I am redy to preache the Gospell to you of Rome also.
Romans,1,16,For I am not ashamed of the Gospell of Christ because it is ye power of God vnto salvacio to all yt beleve namely to the Iewe and also to ye getyle.
Romans,1,17,For by it ye rightewesnes which cometh of god is opened fro fayth to fayth. As it is written: The iust shall live by fayth.
Romans,1,18,For the wrath of God apereth from heven agaynst all vngodlynes and vnrightewesnes of me which withholde ye trueth in vnrightewesnes
Romans,1,19,seynge what maye be knowen of God that same is manifest amoge them. For God dyd shewe it vnto them.
Romans,1,20,So that his invisible thinges: that is to saye his eternall power and godhed are vnderstonde and sene by the workes from the creacion of the worlde. So that they are without excuse
Romans,1,21,in as moche as when they knewe god they glorified him not as God nether were thakfull but wexed full of vanities in their imaginacions and their folisshe hertes were blynded.
Romans,1,22,
Romans,1,23,When they couted them selves wyse they became foles and turned the glory of the immortall god vnto the similitude of the ymage of mortall man and of byrdes and foure foted beastes and of serpentes.
Romans,1,24,Wherfore god lykewyse gave the vp vnto their hertes lustes vnto vnclennes to defyle their awne boddyes bitwene them selves:
Romans,1,25,which tourned his truthe vnto a lye and worshipped and served the creatures more then ye maker which is blessed for ever. Ame.
Romans,1,26,For this cause god gave them vp vnto shamfull lustes. For even their wemen did chaunge the naturall vse vnto the vnnaturall.
Romans,1,27,And lyke wyse also the men lefte the naturall vse of the woma and bret in their lustes one on another. And man with man wrought filthynes and receaved in them selves the rewarde of their erroure as it was accordinge.
Romans,1,28,And as it semed not good vnto them to be aknowen of God even so God delivered them vp vnto a leawde mynd yt they shuld do tho thinges which were not comly
Romans,1,29,beinge full of all vnrighteous doinge of fornicacio wickednes coveteousnes maliciousnes full of envie morther debate disseyte evill codicioned whisperers
Romans,1,30,backbyters haters of God doers of wroge proude bosters bringers vp of evyll thinges disobedient to father and mother
Romans,1,31,with out vnderstondinge covenaunte breakers vnlovinge trucebreakers and merciles.
Romans,1,32,Which me though they knew the rightewesnes of God how that they which soche thinges commyt are worthy of deeth yet not only do the same but also have pleasure in them that do them.
Romans,2,1,Therfore arte thou inexcusable o man whosoever thou be yt iudgest. For in ye same wherin thou iudgest another thou condemnest thy selfe. For thou that iudgest doest eve the same selfe thinges
Romans,2,2,But we are sure that the iudgement of God is accordinge to trueth agaynst them which commit soche thinges.
Romans,2,3,Thikest thou this O thou ma that iudgest them which do soche thinges and yet doest eve the very same yt thou shalt escape ye iudgemet of God?
Romans,2,4,Ether despisest thou the riches of his goodnes paciece and longe sufferaunce? and remembrest not how that the kyndnes of God ledith the to repentaunce?
Romans,2,5,But thou after thyne harde herte yt canot repet heapest ye togedder the treasure of wrath agaynste the daye of vengeauce when shalbe opened ye rightewes iudgemet of god
Romans,2,6,which will rewarde every ma accordinge to his dedes:
Romans,2,7,that is to saye prayse honoure and immortalite to them which cotinue in good doynge and seke eternall lyfe.
Romans,2,8,But vnto them that are rebellious and disobey the trueth yet folowe iniquytie shall come indignacion and wrath
Romans,2,9,tribulacion and anguysshe vpon the soule of every man that doth evyll: of the Iewe fyrst and also of the gentyll.
Romans,2,10,To every man that doth good shall come prayse honoure and peace to ye Iewe fyrst and also to the gentyll.
Romans,2,11,For ther is no parcialyte with god. But whosoever hath synned with out lawe shall perisshe wt out lawe.
Romans,2,12,And as many as haue synned vnder the lawe shalbe iudged by the lawe.
Romans,2,13,For before god they are not ryghteous which heare ye lawe: but the doers of the lawe shalbe iustified.
Romans,2,14,For if the gentyls which have no lawe do of nature the thynges contayned in the lawe: then they havynge no lawe are a lawe vnto them selves
Romans,2,15,which shewe the dede of the lawe wrytten in their hertes: whyll their conscience beareth witnes vnto them and also their thoughtes accusynge one another or excusynge
Romans,2,16,at the daye when god shall iudge the secretes of men by Iesus Christ accordinge to my Gospell.
Romans,2,17, Beholde thou arte called a Iewe and trustest in the lawe and reioysist in God
Romans,2,18,and knowest his will and hast experience of good and bad in that thou arte informed by the lawe:
Romans,2,19,and belevest that thou thy silfe arte a gyde vnto the blynde a lyght to them which are in darcknes
Romans,2,20,an informer of them which lacke discrecio a teacher of vnlearned which hast the ensample of that which ought to be knowen and of the truth in the lawe.
Romans,2,21,But thou which teachest another teachest not thy selfe. Thou preachest a man shuld not steale: and yet thou stealest.
Romans,2,22,Thou sayst a man shuld not commit advoutry: and thou breakest wedlocke. Thou abhorrest ymages and robbest God of his honoure.
Romans,2,23,Thou reioysest in the lawe and thorow breakinge the lawe dishonourest God.
Romans,2,24,For the name of god is evyll spoken of amonge the Gentyls thorowe you as it is written.
Romans,2,25,Circumcisio verely avayleth if thou kepe the lawe. But if thou breake the lawe thy circumcision is made vncircumcision.
Romans,2,26,Therfore if the vncircumcised kepe the ryght thinges contayned in the lawe: shall not his vncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
Romans,2,27,And shall not vncircumcision which is by nature (yf it kepe the lawe) iudge the which beynge vnder the letter and circumcision dost transgresse the lawe?
Romans,2,28,For he is not a Iewe which is a Iewe out warde. Nether is that thynge circumcision which is outwarde in the flesshe.
Romans,2,29,But he is a Iewe which is hid wythin and the circucisio of ye herte is the true circumcision which is in the sprete and not in ye letter whose prayse is not of men but of god.
Romans,3,1,What preferment then hath the Iewe? other what a vauntageth circumcision?
Romans,3,2,Surely very moche. Fyrst vnto them was committed the worde of God
Romans,3,3,What then though some of them did not beleve? shall their vnbeleve make the promes of god with out effecte?
Romans,3,4,God forbid. Let god be true and all men lyars as it is written: That thou myghtest be iustifyed in thy sayinge and shuldest overcome when thou arte iudged.
Romans,3,5,Yf oure vnrightewesnes make the rightewesnes of God more excellent: what shall we saye? Is God vnrighteous which taketh vengeauce? I speake after the maner of me.
Romans,3,6,God forbid. For how then shall God iudge the worlde?
Romans,3,7,Yf the veritie of God appere moare excellent thorow my lye vnto his prayse why am I hence forth iudged as a synner?
Romans,3,8,and saye not rather (as men evyll speake of vs and as some affirme that we saye) let vs do evyll that good maye come therof. Whose damnacion is iuste.
Romans,3,9,What saye we then? Are we better then they? No in no wyse. For we have all ready proved how that both Iewes and Gentils are all vnder synne
Romans,3,10,as it is writte: There is none righteous no not one:
Romans,3,11,There is none that vnderstondith there is none yt seketh after God
Romans,3,12,they are all gone out of ye waye they are all made vnprofytable ther is none that doeth good no not one.
Romans,3,13,Their throte is an open sepulchre with their tounges they have disceaved: the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes.
Romans,3,14,Whose mouthes are full of coursynge and bitternes.
Romans,3,15,Their fete are swyfte to sheed bloud.
Romans,3,16,Destruccion and wretchednes are in their wayes.
Romans,3,17,And the waye of peace they have not knowen.
Romans,3,18,There is no feare of God before their eyes.
Romans,3,19,Ye and we knowe that whatsoever ye lawe sayth he sayth it to them which are vnder the lawe. That all mouthes maye be stopped and all the worlde be subdued to god
Romans,3,20,because that by ye dedes of the lawe shall no flesshe be iustified in the sight of God. For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of synne.
Romans,3,21, Now verely is ye rigtewesnes that cometh of God declared without the fulfillinge of ye lawe havinge witnes yet of ye lawe and of the Prophetes.
Romans,3,22,The rightewesnes no dout which is good before God cometh by ye fayth of Iesus Christ vnto all and vpon all that beleve.Ther is no differece:
Romans,3,23,for all have synned and lacke the prayse yt is of valoure before God:
Romans,3,24,but are iustified frely by his grace through the redemcion that is in Christ Iesu
Romans,3,25,whom God hath made a seate of mercy thorow faith in his bloud to shewe ye rightewesnes which before him is of valoure in yt he forgeveth ye synnes yt are passed which God dyd suffre
Romans,3,26,to shewe at this tyme ye rightewesnes yt is alowed of him yt he myght be couted iuste and a iustifiar of him which belevith on Iesus.
Romans,3,27,Where is then thy reioysinge? It is excluded. By what lawe? by ye lawe of workes? Naye: but by the lawe of fayth.
Romans,3,28,For we suppose that a man is iustified by fayth without the dedes of ye lawe.
Romans,3,29,Is he the God of the Iewes only? Is he not also the God of the Gentyls? Yes eve of the Gentyles also.
Romans,3,30,For it is God only which iustifieth circumcision which is of fayth and vncircumcision thorow fayth.
Romans,3,31,Do we then destroye the lawe thorow fayth? God forbid. But we rather mayntayne the lawe.
Romans,4,1,What shall we saye then that Abraham oure father as pertayninge to ye flesshe dyd finde?
Romans,4,2,If Abraham were iustified by dedes the hath he wherin to reioyce: but not with god.
Romans,4,3,For what sayth the scripture? Abraham beleved god and it was counted vnto him for rightewesnes.
Romans,4,4,To him that worketh is the rewarde not reckened of favour: but of duty.
Romans,4,5,To him that worketh not but beleveth on him that iustifieth the vngodly is his fayth counted for rightewesnes.
Romans,4,6,Even as David describeth the blessedfulnes of the man vnto whom god ascribeth rihgtewesnes without dedes.
Romans,4,7,Blessed are they whose vnrightewesnes are forgeven and whose synnes are covered.
Romans,4,8,Blessed is that ma to whom the Lorde imputeth not synne.
Romans,4,9, Came this blessednes then vpon the circumcised or vpon the vncircucised? We saye verely how that fayth was rekened to Abraham for rightewesnes.
Romans,4,10,How was it rekened? in the tyme of circumcision? or in the tyme before he was circumcised? Not in tyme of circucision: but when he was yet vncircumcised.
Romans,4,11,And he receaved the signe of circumcision as a seale of yt rightewesnes which is by fayth which fayth he had yet beynge vncircucised: that he shuld be the father of all them that beleve though they be not circumcised that rightewesnes myght be imputed to them also:
Romans,4,12,and that he myght be the father of the circumcised not because they are circumcised only: but because they walke also in the steppes of that fayth yt was in oure father Abraham before the tyme of circumcision.
Romans,4,13,For the promes that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde was not geven to Abraha or to his seed thorow the lawe: but thorow ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.
Romans,4,14,For yf they which are of the lawe be heyres then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte.
Romans,4,15,Because the lawe causeth wrathe. For where no lawe is there is no trasgression.
Romans,4,16,Therfore by fayth is the inheritauce geven that it myght come of faveour: and the promes myght be sure to all the seed. Not to them only which are of the lawe: but also to them which are of the fayth of Abraham which is the father of vs all.
Romans,4,17,As it is wrytten: I have made the a father to many nacions even before god whom thou hast beleved which quyckeneth the deed and called those thinges which be not as though they were.
Romans,4,18, Which Abraham contrary to hope beleved in hope that he shuld be the father of many nacions accordynge to that which was spoken:
Romans,4,19,So shall thy seed be. And he faynted not in the fayth nor yet consydered hys awne body which was now deed even when he was almost an hondred yeare olde: nether yet that Sara was past chyldeberinge.
Romans,4,20,He stackered not at the promes of God thorow vnbelefe: but was made stronge in the fayth and gave honour to God
Romans,4,21,full certifyed that what he had promised that he was able to make good.
Romans,4,22,And therfore was it reckened to him for rightewesnes.
Romans,4,23,It is not written for him only that it was reckened to him for rightewesnes:
Romans,4,24,but also for vs to whom it shalbe counted for rightewesnes so we beleve on him that raysed vp Iesus oure Lorde from deeth.
Romans,4,25,Which was delivered for oure synnes and rose agayne forto iustifie vs.
Romans,5,1,Because therfore that we are iustified by fayth we are at peace with god thorow oure Lorde Iesue Christ:
Romans,5,2,by who we have awaye in thorow fayth vnto this grace wherin we stonde aud reioyce in hope of the prayse that shalbe geven of God.
Romans,5,3,Nether do we so only: but also we reioyce in tribulacion. For we know that tribulacion bringeth pacience
Romans,5,4,pacience bringeth experience experience bringeth hope.
Romans,5,5,And hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God is sheed abrod in oure hertes by the holy goost which is geven vnto vs.
Romans,5,6,For when we were yet weake accordynge to ye tyme: Christ dyed for vs which were vngodly.
Romans,5,7,Yet scace will eny man dye for a rightewes man. Paraventure for a good ma durst a man dye.
Romans,5,8,But God setteth out his love that he hath to vs seinge that whyll we were yet synners Christ dyed for vs.
Romans,5,9,Moche more then now (seynge we are iustifyed in his bloud) shall we be saved from wrath thorow him.
Romans,5,10,For yf when we were enemyes we were reconciled to God by the deeth of his sonne: moche more seinge we are reconciled we shal be preservid by his lyfe.
Romans,5,11,Not only so but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ by whom we have receavyd the attonment.
Romans,5,12,Wherfore as by one ma synne entred into the worlde and deeth by the meanes of synne. And so deeth went over all men in somoche that all men synned.
Romans,5,13,For even vnto the tyme of the lawe was synne in the worlde: but synne was not regarded as longe as ther was no lawe:
Romans,5,14,neverthelesse deeth rayned fro Adam to Moses eve over them also that synned not wt lyke transgression as dyd Adam: which is ye similitude of him that is to come.
Romans,5,15,But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne. For yf thorow the synne of one many be deed: moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God and gyfte by grace: which grace was geven by one man Iesus Christ.
Romans,5,16,And ye gifte is not over one synne as deeth cam thorow one synne of one yt synned. For damnacion cam of one synne vnto condemnacion: but the gyft cam to iustify fro many synnes.
Romans,5,17,For yf by the synne of one deeth raigned by the meanes of one moche more shall they which receave aboundance of grace and of the gyfte of rightewesnes raygne in lyfe by the meanes of one (that is to saye) Iesus Christ.
Romans,5,18, Lykewyse then as by the synne of one condemnacion cam on all men: eve so by the iustifyinge of one cometh the rightewesnes that bringeth lyfe vpo all men.
Romans,5,19,For as by one manes disobediece many be cam synners: so by ye obediece of one shall many be made righteous.
Romans,5,20,But ye lawe in the meane tyme entred in yt synne shuld encreace. Neverthelater where aboundaunce of synne was there was more plenteousnes of grace.
Romans,5,21,That as synne had raigned vnto deeth even so might grace raygne thorow rightewesnes vnto eternall lyfe by the helpe of Iesu Christ.
Romans,6,1,What shall we saye then? Shall we continue in synne that there maye be aboundaunce of grace?
Romans,6,2,God forbyd. How shall we that are deed as touchynge synne live eny lenger therin?
Romans,6,3,Remember ye not that all we which are baptysed in the name of Iesu Christ are baptysed to dye with him?
Romans,6,4,We are buryed with him by baptim for to dye that lykewyse as Christ was raysed vp from deeth by the glorye of the father: eve so we also shuld walke in a newe lyfe.
Romans,6,5,For yf we be graft in deeth lyke vnto him: even so must we be in the resurreccio.
Romans,6,6,This we must remeber that oure olde man is crucified with him also that the body of synne myght vtterly be destroyed that hence forth we shuld not be servauntes of synne.
Romans,6,7,For he that is deed ys iustified from synne.
Romans,6,8,Wherfore yf we be deed with Christ we beleve that we shall live with him:
Romans,6,9,remembringe that Christ once raysed fro deeth dyeth no more. Deeth hath no moare power over him.
Romans,6,10,For as touchynge that he dyed he dyed concernynge synne once. And as touchinge that he liveth he liveth vnto God.
Romans,6,11,Lykewyse ymagen ye also that ye are deed concernynge synne: but are alive vnto God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
Romans,6,12,Let not synne raygne therfore in youre mortall bodyes that ye shuld thervnto obey in the lustes of it.
Romans,6,13,Nether geve ye youre members as instrumentes of vnrightewesnes vnto synne: but geve youre selves vnto God as they that are alive from deeth. And geve youre membres as iustrumetes of rightewesnes vnto God.
Romans,6,14,Let not synne have power over you. For ye are not vnder the lawe but vnder grace.
Romans,6,15,What then? Shall we synne because we are not vnder the lawe: but vnder grace? God forbyd.
Romans,6,16,Remember ye not how yt to whom soever ye comit youre selves as servautes to obey his servauntes ye are to whom ye obey: whether it be of synne vnto deeth or of obedience vnto rightewesnes?
Romans,6,17,God be thanked yt though ye were once the servauntes of synne ye have yet obeyed with herte vnto the forme of doctryne wher vnto ye were delyvered.
Romans,6,18,Ye are then made fre from synne and are be come the servauntes of rightewesnes.
Romans,6,19, I will speake grossly because of the infirmitie of youre flesshe. As ye have geve youre membres servauntes to vnclennes and to iniquitie fro iniquitie vnto iniquitie: even so nowe geve youre membres servantes vnto rightewesnes yt ye maye be sanctified.
Romans,6,20,For when ye were the servauntes of synne ye were not vnder rightewesnes.
Romans,6,21,What frute had ye then in tho thinges wher of ye are now ashamed. For the ende of tho thynges is deeth.
Romans,6,22,But now are ye delivered from synne and made the servauntes of God and have youre frute that ye shuld be sanctifyed and the ende everlastinge lyfe.
Romans,6,23,For the rewarde of synne is deeth: but eternall lyfe is the gyfte of God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
Romans,7,1,Remember ye not brethren (I speake to them yt know the lawe) how that the lawe hath power over a man as longe as it endureth?
Romans,7,2,For the woman which is in subieccion to a man is bounde by the lawe to the man as longe as he liveth. Yf the man be deed she is lowsed from the lawe of the man.
Romans,7,3,So then yf whill the man liveth she couple her selfe with another man she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker. But yf the man be deed she is fre fro the lawe: so that she is no wedlocke breaker though she couple her selfe with another man.
Romans,7,4,Even so ye my brethren are deed concerninge the lawe by the body of Christ yt ye shuld be coupled to another (I meane to him that is rysen agayne fro deeth) that we shuld bringe forth frute vnto God.
Romans,7,5,For when we were in the flesshe the lustes of synne which were stered vppe by ye lawe raygned in oure membres to bringe forth frute vnto deeth.
Romans,7,6,But now are we delivered fro the lawe and deed fro that whervnto we werein bondage that we shuld serve in a newe conversacion of ye sprete and not in ye olde conversacion of the letter.
Romans,7,7,What shall we saye then? is ye lawe synne? God forbid: but I knewe not what synne meant but by the lawe. For I had not knowne what lust had meant excepte the lawe had sayde thou shalt not lust.
Romans,7,8,But synne toke an occasion by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscece. For with out the lawe synne was deed.
Romans,7,9,I once lived with out lawe. But when the commaundement came synne revyved and I was deed.
Romans,7,10,And the very same comaundement which was ordeyned vnto lyfe was founde to be vnto me an occasion of deeth.
Romans,7,11,For synne toke occasion by the meanes of the comaundement and so disceaved me and by the selfe commaundement slewe we.
Romans,7,12,Wherfore the lawe is holy and the commaundement holy iust and good.
Romans,7,13,Was that then which is good made deeth vnto me? God forbyd. Naye synne was deeth vnto me that it myght appere how that synne by the meanes of that which is good had wrought deeth in me: that synne which is vnder the commandemet myght be out of measure synfull.
Romans,7,14,For we knowe that the lawe is spirituall: but I am carnall solde vnder synne
Romans,7,15,because I wote not what I doo. For what I wold that do I not: but what I hate that do I.
Romans,7,16,Yf I do now that which I wolde not I graute to the lawe that it is good.
Romans,7,17,So then nowe it is not I that do it but synne that dwelleth in me.
Romans,7,18,For I knowe that in me (that is to saye in my flesshe) dwelleth no good thinge. To will is present with me: but I fynde no meanes to performe that which is good.
Romans,7,19,For I doo not yt good thinge which I wold: but that evill do I which I wolde not.
Romans,7,20,Finally yf I do that I wolde not then is it not I that doo it but synne that dwelleth in me doeth it.
Romans,7,21,I fynde then by the lawe that when I wolde do good evyll is present with me.
Romans,7,22,I delite in the lawe of God concerninge the inner man.
Romans,7,23,But I se another lawe in my membres rebellinge agaynst the lawe of my mynde and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne which is in my membres.
Romans,7,24,O wretched man yt I am: who shall delyver me fro this body of deeth?
Romans,7,25,I thanke God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde. So then I my silfe in my mynde serve the lawe of God and in my flesshe the lawe of synne.
Romans,8,1,Ther is then no damnacion to them which are in Christ Iesu which walke not after ye flesshe: but after ye sprete.
Romans,8,2,For the lawe of the sprete yt bringeth life thorowe Iesus Christ hath delivered me fro the lawe of synne and deeth.
Romans,8,3,For what the lawe coulde not doo in as moche it was weake because of the flesshe: that performed God and sent his sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe and by synne daned synne in ye flesshe:
Romans,8,4,that the rightewesnes requyred of the lawe myght be fulfilled in vs which walke not after the flesshe but after the sprete.
Romans,8,5,For they that are carnall are carnally mynded. But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded.
Romans,8,6,To be carnally mynded is deeth. But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.
Romans,8,7,Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.
Romans,8,8,So then they yt are geven to the flesshe canot please God.
Romans,8,9,But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete: yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you. If ther be eny man yt hath not ye sprite of Christ ye same is none of his.
Romans,8,10,Yf Christ be in you the body is deed because of synne: but the sprite is lyfe for rightewesnes sake.
Romans,8,11,Wherfore if the sprite of him that raysed vppe Iesus fro deeth dwell in you: even he that raysed vp Christ from deeth shall quycken youre mortall bodyes because that this sprite dwelleth in you.
Romans,8,12,Therfore brethren we are nowe detters not to the flesshe to live after the flesshe.
Romans,8,13,For if ye live after the flesshe ye must dye. But yf ye mortifie the dedes of the body by the helpe of the sprite ye shall lyve.
Romans,8,14,For as many as are led by the sprete of God: they are the sonnes of god.
Romans,8,15,For ye have no receaved the sprete of bondage to feare eny moare but ye have receaved the sprite of adopcion wherby we crye Abba father.
Romans,8,16,The same sprete certifieth oure sprete yt we are the sonnes of God.
Romans,8,17,Yf we be sonnes we are also heyres the heyres I meane of God and heyres anexed with Christ: if so be that we suffer togedder that we maye be glorified to gedder.
Romans,8,18,For I suppose that the affliccions of this lyfe are not worthy of the glory which shalbe shewed vpon vs.
Romans,8,19,Also the fervent desyre of the creatures abideth lokynge when the sonnes of God shall appere
Romans,8,20,because the creatures are subdued to vanyte agaynst their will: but for his will which subdueth them in hope.
Romans,8,21,For ye very creatures shalbe delivered from the bondage of corrupcion into the glorious lybertie of the sonnes of God.
Romans,8,22,For we knowe that every creature groneth with vs also and travayleth in payne even vnto this tyme.
Romans,8,23,Not they only but even we also which have the fyrst frutes of the sprite morne in oureselves and wayte for the (adopcio) and loke for the delivraunce of oure bodyes.
Romans,8,24,For we are savyd by hope. But hope that is sene is no hope. For how can a ma hope for that which he seyth?
Romans,8,25,But and yf we hope for that we se not then do we with pacience abyde for it.
Romans,8,26,Lyke wyse ye sprite also helpeth oure infirmities. For we knowe not what to desyre as we ought: but the sprete maketh intercession mightely for vs with gronynges which canot be expressid with tonge.
Romans,8,27,And he that searcheth the hertes knoweth what is ye meaninge of the sprite: for he maketh intercession for the sayntes accordinge to ye pleasure of god.
Romans,8,28,For we knowe that all thinges worke for the best vnto them yt love God which also are called of purpose.
Romans,8,29,For those which he knewe before he also ordeyned before yt they shuld be lyke fassioned vnto the shape of his sonne that he myght be ye fyrst begotten sonne amoge many brethren.
Romans,8,30,Morover which he apoynted before them he also called. And which he called them also he iustified which he iustified them he also glorified.
Romans,8,31,What shall we then saye vnto these thinges? yf god be on oure syde: who can be agaynst vs?
Romans,8,32,which spared not his awne sonne but gave him for vs all: how shall he not wt him geve vs all thinges also?
Romans,8,33,Who shall laye eny thinge to ye charge of goddes chosen? it is god that iustifieth:
Romans,8,34,who then shall condempne? it is Christ which is deed ye rather which is rysen agayne which is also on the ryght honde of God and maketh intercession for vs.
Romans,8,35,Who shall seperate vs fro the love of god? shall tribulacion? or anguysshe? or persecucion? other honger? other nakednesse? other parell? other swearde?
Romans,8,36,As it is written: For thy sake are we kylled all daye longe and are counted as shepe apoynted to be slayne.
Romans,8,37,Neverthelesse in all these thinges we overcome strongly thorow his helpe that loved vs.
Romans,8,38,Ye and I am sure that nether deeth nether lyfe nether angels nor rule nether power nether thinges present nether thinges to come
Romans,8,39,nether heyth nether loweth nether eny other creature shalbe able to departe vs fro ye love of God shewed in Christ Iesu oure lorde.
Romans,9,1,I saye the trueth in Christ and lye not in that wherof my conscience beareth me witnes in the holy gost
Romans,9,2,that I have gret hevynes and continuall sorowe in my hert.
Romans,9,3,For I have wysshed my selfe to be cursed from Christ for my brethren and my kynsmen as pertayninge to the flesshe
Romans,9,4,which are the Israelites. To whom pertayneth the adopcion and the glorie and the covenauntes and the law that was geven and the service of God and the promyses:
Romans,9,5,whose also are the fathers and they of whome (as concernynge the flesshe) Christ came which is God over all thinges blessed for ever Amen.
Romans,9,6,I speake not these thinges as though the wordes of god had take none effecte. For they are not all Israelites which came of Israel:
Romans,9,7,nether are they all chyldren strayght waye because they are the seed of Abraham. But in Isaac shall thy seede be called:
Romans,9,8,that is to saye they which are the chyldren of the flesshe are not the chyldren of god. But the chyldren of promes are counted the seede.
Romans,9,9,For this is a worde of promes aboute this tyme will I come and Sara shall have a sonne.
Romans,9,10,Nether was it so wt her only: but also when Rebecca was with chylde by one I meane by oure father Isaac
Romans,9,11,yeer the chyldren were borne when they had nether done good nether bad: that the purpose of God which is by election myght stonde
Romans,9,12,it was sayde vnto her not by the reason of workes but by grace of ye caller: the elder shall serve the yonger.
Romans,9,13,As it is written: Iacob he loved but Esau he hated.
Romans,9,14,What shall we saye then? is there eny vnrightewesses with God? God forbyd.
Romans,9,15,For he sayth to Moses: I will shewe mercye to who I shewe mercy: and will have compassion on whom I have copassion.
Romans,9,16,So lieth it not then in a mans will or cunnynge but in ye mercye of god.
Romans,9,17,For the scripture sayth vnto Pharao: Even for this same purpose have I stered ye vp to shewe my power on ye and that my name myght be declared thorow out all the worlde.
Romans,9,18,So hath he mercye on whom he will and whom he will he maketh hearde herted.
Romans,9,19,Thou wilt saye then vnto me: why then blameth he vs yet? For who can resist his will?
Romans,9,20,But o man what arte thou which disputest with God? Shall the worke saye to the workeman: why hast thou made me on this fassion?
Romans,9,21,Hath not the potter power over the claye even of the same lompe to make one vessell vnto honoure and a nother vnto dishonoure?
Romans,9,22,Even so God willynge to shewe his wrath and to make his power knowen suffered with longe pacience the vessels of wrath ordeyned to damnacion
Romans,9,23,that he myght declare ye ryches of his glory on the vessels of mercye which he had prepayred vnto glorie:
Romans,9,24,that is to saye vs which he called not of the Iewes only but also of ye gentyls.
Romans,9,25,As he sayth in Osee: I will call them my people which were not my people: and her beloved which was not beloved.
Romans,9,26,And it shall come to passe in the place where it was sayd vnto them ye are not my people: that there shalbe called the chyldren of the lyvynge God.
Romans,9,27,But Esaias cryeth concernynge Israel though the nomber of the chyldren of Israel be as the sonde of the see yet shall a remnaut be saved.
Romans,9,28,He finyssheth the worde verely and maketh it short in ryghtwesses. For a short worde will god make on erth.
Romans,9,29,And as Esaias sayd before: Except the Lorde of sabaoth had left us seede we had bene made as Zodoma and had bene lykened to Gomorra.
Romans,9,30,What shall we saye then? We saye that the gentyls which followed not rightewesnes have overtaken rightewesnes: I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.
Romans,9,31,But Israel which folowed the lawe of rightewesnes coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of rightewesnes.
Romans,9,32,And wherfore? Because they sought it not by fath: but as it were by the workes of the lawe. For they have stombled at the stomblynge stone.
Romans,9,33,As it is written: Beholde I put in Syon a stomblynge stone and a rocke which shall make men faule. And none yt beleve on him shalbe a shamed.
Romans,10,1,Brethren my hertes desyre and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved.
Romans,10,2,For I beare them recorde that they have a fervet mynde to God warde but not accordinge to knowledge.
Romans,10,3,For they are ignoraut of the rightewesnes which is alowed before God and goo about to stablisshe their awne rightewesnes and therfore are not obedient vnto the rightewesnes which is of valew before God.
Romans,10,4,For Christ is the ende of the lawe to iustifie all that beleve.
Romans,10,5,Moses describeth the rightewesnes which cometh of ye lawe howe that the man which doth the thinges of the lawe shall lyve therin.
Romans,10,6,But ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth speaketh on this wyse. Saye not in thyne hert who shall ascende into heven? (that is nothinge els then to fetch Christ doune)
Romans,10,7,Other who shall descende into the depe? (that is nothinge els but to fetch vp Christ from deeth)
Romans,10,8,But what sayth the scripture? The worde is nye the even in thy mouth and in thyn herte. This worde is the worde of fayth which we preache.
Romans,10,9,For yf thou shalt knowledge wt thy mouth that Iesus is the lorde and shalt beleve with thyn hert that God raysed him up from deeth thou shalt be safe.
Romans,10,10,For the belefe of the hert iustifieth: and to knowledge with the mouth maketh a man safe.
Romans,10,11,For the scripture sayth: whosoever beleveth on him shall not be ashamed.
Romans,10,12,Ther is no difference bitwene the Iewe and the gentyll. For one is Lorde of all which is ryche vnto all that call on him.
Romans,10,13,For whosoever shall call on the name of the lorde shalbe safe.
Romans,10,14,But how shall they call on him on who they beleved not? how shall they beleve on him of whom they have not herde? how shall they heare with out a preacher?
Romans,10,15,And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written: how beautifull are the fete of them which bringe glad tydynges of peace and bringe glad tydynges of good thinges.
Romans,10,16,But they have not all obeyed to ye gospell. For Esaias sayth: Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinges?
Romans,10,17,So then fayth cometh by hearynge and hearynge cometh by the worde of God.
Romans,10,18,But I axe: have they not herde? No dout their sounde went out into all londes: and their wordes in to the endes of the worlde.
Romans,10,19,But I demaunde whether Israel dyd knowe or not? Fyrst Moses sayth: I will provoke you for to envy by the that are no people and by a folisshe nacion I will anger you.
Romans,10,20,Esaias after that is bolde and sayth. I am founde of the that sought me not and have appered to them that axed not after me.
Romans,10,21,And agaynst Israel he sayth: All daye longe have I stretched forth my hondes vnto a people yt beleveth not but speaketh agaynst me.
Romans,11,1,I saye then: hath god cast awaye his people? God forbyd. For even I verely am an Israelite of the seed of Abraha and of ye tribe of Beniamin
Romans,11,2,god hath not cast awaye his people which he knew before. Ether wote ye not what the scripture sayth by the mouth of Helias how he maketh intercession to god agaynst Israel sayinge:
Romans,11,3,Lorde they have kylled thy prophetes and dygged doune thyn alters: and I am lefte only and they seke my lyfe.
Romans,11,4,But what sayth the answer of god to him agayne? I have reserved vnto me seven thousande men which have not bowed the knee to Baal.
Romans,11,5,Even so at this tyme ys ther a remnanaunt lefte thorow the eleccion of grace.
Romans,11,6,Yf it be of grace the is it not of workes. For then were grace no moare grace. Yf it be of workes then is it no moare grace. For then were deservyng no lenger deservynge.
Romans,11,7,What then? Israel hath not obtayned that that he sought. No but yet the election hath obtayned it. The remnaunt are blynded
Romans,11,8,accordynge as it is written: God hath geven the the sprete of vnquyetnes: eyes that they shuld not se and eares that they shuld not heare even vnto this daye.
Romans,11,9,And David sayth: Let their table be made a snare to take them with all and an occasion to faule and a rewarde vnto them.
Romans,11,10,Let their eyes be blynded that they se not: and ever bowe doune their backes.
Romans,11,11,I saye then: Have they therfore stombled that they shulde but faule only? God forbyd: but thorowe their faule is salvacio happened vnto the gentyls for to provoke the with all.
Romans,11,12,Wherfore yf the faule of them be the ryches of the worlde: and the mynysshynge of them the ryches of the gentyls: How moche more shuld it be so yf they all beleved.
Romans,11,13,I speake to you gentyls in as moche as I am the Apostle of ye gentyls I will magnify myn office
Romans,11,14,that I myght provoke them which are my flesshe and myght save some of them.
Romans,11,15,For yf the castynge awaye of them be the reconcylynge of the worlde: what shall the receavynge of them be but lyfe agayne from deeth?
Romans,11,16,For yf one pece be holy the whole heepe is holy. And yf the rote be holy the braunches are holy also.
Romans,11,17,Though some of the brauuches be broken of and thou beynge a wylde olyue tree arte graft in amonge them and made parttaker of ye rote and fatnes of the olyve tree
Romans,11,18,bost not thy selfe agaynst the brauches. For yf thou bost thy selfe remember that thou bearest not the rote but the rote the.
Romans,11,19,Thou wilt saye then: the brauches are broken of that I myght be grafte in.
Romans,11,20,Thou sayest well: because of vnbeleve they are broken of and thou stondest stedfast in fayth.
Romans,11,21,Be not hye mynded but feare seynge that God spared not the naturall braunches lest haply he also spare not the.
Romans,11,22,Beholde ye kyndnes and rigorousnes of God: on the which fell rigorousnes: but towardes the kyndnes yf thou cotinue in his kyndnes. Or els thou shalt be hewen of
Romans,11,23,and they yf they byde not still in vnbelefe shalbe graffed in agayne. For God is of power to graffe them in agayne.
Romans,11,24,For yf thou wast cut out of a naturall wilde olyve tree and wast graffed contrary to nature in a true olyve tree: how moche more shall the naturall brauches be graffed in their awne olyve tree agayne.
Romans,11,25,I wolde not that this secrete shuld be hyd fro you my brethren (lest ye shuld be wyse in youre awne consaytes) that partly blyndnes is happened in Israel vntyll ye fulnes of the gentyls be come in:
Romans,11,26,and so all Israel shalbe saved. As it is writte: There shall come oute of Sion he yt doth delyver and shall turne awaye the vngodlynes of Iacob.
Romans,11,27,And this is my covenaunt vnto them when I shall take awaye their synnes.
Romans,11,28,As cocernynge the gospell they are enemies for youre sakes: but as touchinge the election they are loved for ye fathers sakes.
Romans,11,29,For verely the gyftes and callynge of god are soche that it cannot repent him of them:
Romans,11,30,for loke as ye in tyme passed have not beleved God yet have now obtayned mercy thorow their vnbelefe:
Romans,11,31,even so now have they not beleved the mercy which is happened vnto you that they also maye obtayne mercy.
Romans,11,32,God hath wrapped all nacions in vnbeleve that he myght have mercie on all.
Romans,11,33,O the depnes of the aboundaunt wysdome and knowledge of God: how vnserchable are his iudgementes and his wayes past findyng out.
Romans,11,34,For who hath knowen the mynde of the lorde? or who was his counseller?
Romans,11,35,other who hath geven vnto him fyrst that he myght be recompensed agayne?
Romans,11,36,For of him and thorow him and for him are all thinges To him be glorye for ever Amen.
Romans,12,1,I beseche you therfore brethre by ye mercyfulnes of God that ye make youre bodyes aquicke sacrifise holy and acceptable vnto God which is youre resonable seruynge of god.
Romans,12,2,And fassion not youre selves lyke vnto this worlde: But be ye chaunged in youre shape by the renuynge of youre wittes that ye maye fele what thynge that good yt acceptable and perfaycte will of god is.
Romans,12,3,For I saye (thorowe the grace that vnto me geve is) to every man amonge you that noman esteme of him selfe moare then it becometh him to esteme: but that he discretely iudge of him selfe accordynge as God hath dealte to every man the measure of fayth.
Romans,12,4,As we have many members in one body and all members have not one office:
Romans,12,5,so we beynge many are one body in Christ and every man (amoge oure selves) one anothers mebers Seynge
Romans,12,6,that we have dyvers gyftes accordynge to the grace that is geven vnto vs: yf eny man have ye gyft of prophesye let him have it that it be agreynge vnto the fayth.
Romans,12,7,Let him that hath an office wayte on his office. Let him that teacheth take hede to his doctrine.
Romans,12,8,Let him that exhorteth geve attendaunce to his exhortacion. Yf eny man geve let him do it with singlenes. Let him that ruleth do it with diligence. Yf eny man shewe mercy let him do it with cherfulnes.
Romans,12,9,Let love be wt out dissimulacion. Hate that which is evyll and cleave vnto that which is good.
Romans,12,10,Be kynde one to another with brotherly love. In gevynge honoure goo one before another.
Romans,12,11,Let not yt busynes which ye have in honde be tedious to you. Be fervet in ye sprete. Applye youre selves to ye tyme.
Romans,12,12,Reioyce in hope. Be paciet in tribulacion. Continue in prayer.
Romans,12,13,Distribute vnto the necessite of the saynctes and diligently to harboure.
Romans,12,14,Blesse the which persecute you: blesse but course not.
Romans,12,15,Be mery with the that are mery. Wepe wt them that wepe.
Romans,12,16,Be of lyke affeccion one towardes another. Be not hye mided: but make youreselves equall to the of ye lower sorte. Be not wyse in youre awne opinios.
Romans,12,17,Recopence to no ma evyll fore evyll. Provyde afore honde thinges honest in ye syght of all men.
Romans,12,18,Yf it be possible howbe it of youre parte have peace with all men.
Romans,12,19,Derly beloued avenge not youre selves but geve roume vnto the wrath of God. For it is written: vengeaunce is myne and I will rewarde saith the lorde.
Romans,12,20,Terfore yf thyn enemy honger fede him: yf he thurst geve him drinke. For in so doynge thou shalt heape coles of fyre on his heed:
Romans,12,21,Be not overcome of evyll: But overcome evyll wt goodnes.
Romans,13,1,Let every soule submit him selfe vnto the auctorite of ye hyer powers. For there is no power but of God.
Romans,13,2,The powers that be are ordeyned of God. Whosoever therfore resysteth power resisteth the ordinaunce of God. And they that resist shall receave to the selfe damnacio.
Romans,13,3,For rulars are not to be feared for good workes but for evyll Wilt thou be with out feare of the power? Do well then: and so shalt thou be praysed of the same.
Romans,13,4,For he is the minister of God for thy welth. But and yf thou do evyll then feare: for he beareth not a swearde for nought: but is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on them that do evyll.
Romans,13,5,Wherfore ye must nedes obeye not for feare of vengeaunce only: but also because of conscience.
Romans,13,6,And even for this cause paye ye tribute. For they are goddes ministers servynge for the same purpose.
Romans,13,7,Geve to every man therfore his duetie: Tribute to whom tribute belongeth: Custome to whom custome is due: feare to whom feare belongeth: Honoure to who honoure pertayneth
Romans,13,8,Owe nothinge to eny man: but to love one another. For he that loveth another fulfylleth the lawe.
Romans,13,9,For these commaundementes: Thou shalt not comit advoutry: Thou shalt not kyll: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Thou shalt not desyre and so forth (yf there be eny other comaundement) they are all comprehended in this sayinge: Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe.
Romans,13,10,Love hurteth not his neghbour. Therfore is love the fulfillynge of the lawe.
Romans,13,11,This also we knowe I mean the season howe that it is tyme that we shuld now awake oute of slepe. For now is oure salvacion nearer then when we beleved.
Romans,13,12,The nyght is passed and the daye is come nye. Let us therfore cast awaye the dedes of darcknes and let vs put on the (Armoure) of lyght.
Romans,13,13,Let vs walke honestly as it were in the daye lyght: not in eatynge and drinkynge: nether in chamburynge and wantannes: nether in stryfe and envyinge:
Romans,13,14,but put ye on the Lorde Iesus Christ. And make not provision for the flesshe to fulfyll ye lustes of it.
Romans,14,1,Him that is weake in the fayth receave vnto you not in disputynge and troublynge his conscience.
Romans,14,2,One beleveth that he maye eate all thinge. Another which is weake eateth earbes.
Romans,14,3,Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not. And let not him whiche eateth not iudge him that eateth. For God hath receaved him.
Romans,14,4,What arte thou that iudgest another manes servaut? Whether he stonde or faule that pertayneth vnto his master: ye he shall stonde. For God is able to make him stonde.
Romans,14,5,This man putteth difference bitwene daye and daye. Another man counteth all dayes alyke. Se that no man waver in his awne meanynge.
Romans,14,6,He that observeth one daye more then another doth it for ye lordes pleasure. And he that observeth not one daye moare then another doeth it to please ye lorde also. He that eateth doth it to please the lorde for he geveth god thankes.
Romans,14,7,And he yt eateth not eateth not to please ye lorde wt all and geveth god thankes.
Romans,14,8,For none of vs lyveth his awne servaut: nether doeth anye of vs dye his awne servaunt. Yf we lyve we lyve to be at ye lordes will. And yf we dye we dye at ye lordes will. Whether we lyve therfore or dye we are the lordes.
Romans,14,9,For Christ therfore dyed and rose agayne and revived that he myght be lorde both of deed and quicke.
Romans,14,10,But why doest thou then iudge thy brother? Other why doest thou despyse thy brother? We shall all be brought before the iudgement seate of Christ.
Romans,14,11,For it is written: as truely as I lyve sayth ye lorde all knees shall bowe to me and all tonges shall geve a knowledge to God.
Romans,14,12,So shall every one of vs geve accomptes of him selfe to God.
Romans,14,13,Let vs not therfore iudge one another eny more. But iudge this rather that no man put a stomblynge blocke or an occasion to faule in his brothers waye.
Romans,14,14,For I knowe and am full certified in the Lorde Iesus that ther is nothinge comen of it selfe: but vnto him that iudgeth it to be comen: to him is it comen.
Romans,14,15,If thy brother be greved with thy meate now walkest thou not charitablye. Destroye not him with thy meate for whom Christ dyed.
Romans,14,16,Cause not youre treasure to be evyll spoken of.
Romans,14,17,For the kyngdome of God is not meate and drinke: but rightewesnes peace and ioye in the holy goost.
Romans,14,18,For whosoever in these thinges serveth Christ pleaseth well God and is commended of men.
Romans,14,19,Let vs folowe tho thinges which make for peace and thinges wherwith one maye edyfie another.
Romans,14,20,Destroye not ye worke of god for a lytell meates sake. All thinges are pure: but it is evyll for that man which eateth with hurte of his conscience.
Romans,14,21,It is good nether to eate flesshe nether to drincke wyne nether eny thinge wherby thy brother stombleth ether falleth or is made weake.
Romans,14,22,Hast thou fayth? have it with thy selfe before god. Happy is he yt condempneth not him selfe in that thinge which he aloweth.
Romans,14,23,For he yt maketh conscience is dampned yf he eate: because he doth it not of fayth. For whatsoever is not of fayth that same is synne.
Romans,15,1,We which are stronge ought to beare the fraylnes of them which are weake and not to stonde in oure awne cosaytes.
Romans,15,2,Let every man please his neghbour vnto his welth and edyfyinge.
Romans,15,3,For Christ pleased not him selfe: but as it is written. The rebukes of the which rebuked the fell one me.
Romans,15,4,Whatsoever thinges are written afore tyme are written for oure learnynge that we thorow pacience and comforte of the scripture myght have hope.
Romans,15,5,The God of pacience and consolacion geve vnto every one of you that ye be lyke mynded one towardes another after the insample of Christ:
Romans,15,6,that ye all agreynge together maye with one mouth prayse God the father of oure Lorde Iesus.
Romans,15,7,Wherfore receave ye one another as Christ receaved vs to the prayse of God.
Romans,15,8,And I saye that Iesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the trueth of god to conferme the promyses made vnto the fathers.
Romans,15,9,And let the gentyls prayse god for his mercy as it is written: For this cause I will prayse the amonge the gentyls and synge in thy name.
Romans,15,10,And agayne he sayth: reioyse ye gentyles with his people.
Romans,15,11,And agayne prayse the Lorde all ye gentyls and laude him all nacions.
Romans,15,12,And in another place Esaias sayth: ther shalbe the rote of Iesse and he that shall ryse ro raygne over the gentyls: in him shall the gentyls trust.
Romans,15,13,The God of hope fyll you with all ioye and peace in belevynge: that ye maye be ryche in hope thorowe the power of the holy goost.
Romans,15,14,I my selfe am full certified of you my brethren that ye youre selves are full of goodnes and filled with all knowledge and are able to exhorte one another.
Romans,15,15,Neverthelesse brethren I have some what boldly written vnto you as one that putteth you in remembrauce thorow the grace that is geven me of God
Romans,15,16,that I shuld be the minister of Iesu Christ amonge the gentyls and shuld minister the gladde tydynges of God that the gentyls myght be an acceptable offerynge sanctyfied by the holy goost.
Romans,15,17,I have therfore wherof I maye reioyse in Christ Iesu in tho thinges which pertayne to God.
Romans,15,18,For I dare not speake of eny of tho thinges which Christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentyls obedient with worde and dede
Romans,15,19,in myghty signes and wonders by the power of the sprete of God: so that from Ierusalem and the costes rounde aboute vnto Illyricum I have fylled all countres with the gladde tydynges of Christ.
Romans,15,20,So have I enforsed my selfe to preache the gospell not where Christ was named lest I shuld have bylt on another mannes foundacion:
Romans,15,21,but as it is written: To whom he was not spoken of they shall se: and they that hearde not shall vnderstonde.
Romans,15,22,For this cause I have bene ofte let to come vnto you:
Romans,15,23,but now seynge I have no moare to do in these countres and also have bene desyrous many yeares to come vnto you
Romans,15,24,when I shall take my iorney into spayne I will come to you. I trust to se you in my iorney and to be brought on my waye thither warde by you after that I have somwhat enioyed you.
Romans,15,25,Now go I vnto Ierusalem and minister vnto the saynctes.
Romans,15,26,For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certayne distribucio vpo the poore saynctes which are at Ierusalem.
Romans,15,27,It hath pleased them verely and their detters are they. For yf the getils be made partetakers of their spirituall thinges their dutie is to minister vnto the in carnall thinges.
Romans,15,28,When I have performed this and have brought them this frute sealed. I will come backe agayne by you into Spayne.
Romans,15,29,And I am sure when I come that I shall come with aboundaunce of the blessinge of the gospell of Christ.
Romans,15,30,I beseche you brethre for oure Lorde Iesus Christes sake and for the love of the sprete that ye helpe me in my busynes with youre prayers to God for me
Romans,15,31,that I maye be delyvered from them which beleve not in Iewry and that this my service which I have to Ierusalem maye be accepted of ye saynctes
Romans,15,32,that I maye come vnto you with ioye by the will of God and maye with you be refresshed.
Romans,15,33,The God of peace be with you. Amen.
Romans,16,1,I commede vnto you Phebe oure sister (which is a minister of the congregacion of Chenchrea)
Romans,16,2,that ye receave her in the Lorde as it becommeth saynctes and that ye assist her in whatsoever busynes she neadeth of youre ayde. For she hath suckered many and myne awne selfe also.
Romans,16,3,Grete Prisca and Aquila my helpers in Christ Iesu

Romans,16,17,I beseche you brethre marke them which cause division and geve occasions of evyll contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned: and avoyde them.
Romans,16,18,For they yt are suche serve not ye Lorde Iesus Christ: but their awne bellyes and with swete preachinges and flatteringe wordes deceave the hertes of the innocetes.
Romans,16,19,For youre obedience extendeth to all men. I am glad no dout of you. But yet I wolde have you wyse vnto yt which is good and to be innocetes concerninge evyll.
Romans,16,20,The God of peace treade Satan vnder youre fete shortly. The grace of oure Lorde Iesu Christ be with you.

I Corinthians,1,4,I thanke my God all wayes on youre behalfe for ye grace of God which is geuen you by Iesus Christ
I Corinthians,1,5,that in all thinges ve are made riche by him in all lerninge and in all knowledge
I Corinthians,1,6,even as the testimony of Iesus Christ was confermed in you)
I Corinthians,1,7,so that ye are behynde in no gyft and wayte for the apperynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ
I Corinthians,1,8,which shall streght you vnto ye ende that ye maye be blamelesse in ye daye of oure lorde Iesus Christ.
I Corinthians,1,9,ffor god is faythfull by whom ye are called vnto ye fellishyppe of his sonne Iesus Christe oure lorde
I Corinthians,1,10,I beseche you brethre in ye name of oure lorde Iesus Christ that ye all speake one thynge and that there be no dissencion amoge you: but be ye knyt together in one mynde and in one meaynge.
I Corinthians,1,11,It is shewed vnto me (my brethren) of you by them that are of the housse of Cloe that ther is stryfe amonge you. And this is it that I meane:
I Corinthians,1,12,how that comelie amonge you one sayeth: I holde of Paul: another I holde of Apollo: ye thyrde I holde of Cephas: ye four ye I holde of Christ.
I Corinthians,1,13,Ys Christ devided? was Paul crucified for you? ether were ye baptised in ye name of Paul?
I Corinthians,1,14,I thanke God that I christened none of you but Crispus and Gayus
I Corinthians,1,15,lest eny shulde saye that I had baptised in myne awne name.
I Corinthians,1,16,I baptised also the housse of Stephana. Forthermore knowe I not whether I baptised eny man or no.
I Corinthians,1,17,For Christ sent me not to baptyse but to preache ye gospell not with wysdome of wordes lest the crosse of Christ shuld have bene made of none effecte.
I Corinthians,1,18,For ye preachinge of the crosse is to them yt perisshe folishnes: but vnto vs which are saved it is ye power of God.
I Corinthians,1,19,For it is written: I will destroye the wysdome of the wyse and will cast awaye the vnderstondinge of the prudet.
I Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wyse? Where is the scrybe? Where is the searcher of this worlde?
I Corinthians,1,21,Hath not God made the wysdome of this worlde folisshnes? For when the worlde thorow wysdome knew not God in ye wysdome of God: it pleased God thorow folisshnes of preachinge to save them yt beleve.
I Corinthians,1,22,For ye Iewes requyre a signe and the Grekes seke after wysdome.
I Corinthians,1,23,But we preache Christ crucified vnto the Iewes an occasion of fallinge and vnto the Grekes folisshnes:
I Corinthians,1,24,but vnto the which are called both of Iewes and Grekes we preache Christ ye power of God and the wysdome of God.
I Corinthians,1,25,For the folishnes of God is wyser then me: and the weakenes of God is stronger then men.
I Corinthians,1,26,Brethren loke on youre callinge how that not many wyse men after the flesshe not many myghty not many of hye degre are called:
I Corinthians,1,27,but God hath chosen the folysshe thinges of the worlde to confounde the wyse. And God hath chosyn the weake thinges of the worlde to confounde thinges which are mighty.
I Corinthians,1,28,And vile thinges of the worlde and thinges which are despysed hath God chosen yee and thinges of no reputacion for to brynge to nought thinges of reputacion
I Corinthians,1,29,that no flesshe shulde reioyce in his presence.
I Corinthians,1,30,And vnto him partayne ye in Christ Iesu which of God is made vnto vs wysdome and also rightewesnes and saunctifyinge and redempcion.
I Corinthians,1,31,That accordinge as it is written: he which reioyseth shulde reioyce in the Lorde.
I Corinthians,2,1,And I brethren when I came to you came not in gloriousnes of wordes or of wysdome shewynge vnto you the testimony of God.
I Corinthians,2,2,Nether shewed I my selfe that I knewe eny thinge amonge you save Iesus Christ eve the same that was crucified.
I Corinthians,2,3,And I was amoge you in weaknes and in feare and in moche treblinge.
I Corinthians,2,4,And my wordes and my preachinge were not with entysynge wordes of manes wysdome: but in shewinge of ye sprete and of power
I Corinthians,2,5,that youre fayth shuld not stonde in ye wysdome of me but in yt power of God.
I Corinthians,2,6,That we speake of is wysdome amonge them that are perfecte: not the wysdome of this worlde nether of the rulars of this worlde (which go to nought)
I Corinthians,2,7,but we speake ye wysdome of God which is in secrete and lieth hyd which God ordeyned before the worlde vnto oure glory:
I Corinthians,2,8,which wysdome none of ye rulars of the worlde knewe. For had they knowe it they wolde not have crucified the Lorde of glory.
I Corinthians,2,9,But as it is written: The eye hath not sene and the eare hath not hearde nether have entred into the herte of man ye thinges which God hath prepared for them that love him.
I Corinthians,2,10,But God hath opened them vnto vs by his sprete. For ye sprete searcheth all thinges ye the bottome of Goddes secretes.
I Corinthians,2,11,For what man knoweth the thinges of a ma: save ye sprete of a man which is with in him? Even so ye thinges of God knoweth no man but ye sprete of god.
I Corinthians,2,12,And we have not receaved the sprete of ye worlde: but the sprete which cometh of god for to knowe the thinges that are geve to vs of god
I Corinthians,2,13,which thinges also we speake not in the conynge wordes of manes wysdome but with the conynge wordes of the holy goost makynge spretuall coparesons of spretuall thinges.
I Corinthians,2,14,For ye naturall man perceaveth not the thinges of the sprete of god. For they are but folysshnes vnto him. Nether can he perceave them because he is spretually examined.
I Corinthians,2,15,But he that is spretuall discusseth all thinges: yet he him selfe is iudged of no ma.
I Corinthians,2,16,For who knoweth the mynde of the Lorde other who shall informe him? But we vnderstonde the mynde of Christ.
I Corinthians,3,1,And I coulde not speake vnto you brethre as vnto spretuall: but as vnto carnall even as it were vnto babes in Christ.
I Corinthians,3,2,I gave you mylke to drinke and not meate. For ye then were not stronge no nether yet are.
I Corinthians,3,3,For ye are yet carnall. As longe verely as ther is amoge you envyige stryfe and dissencio: are ye not carnall and walke after ye manner of me?
I Corinthians,3,4,As loge as one sayth I holde of Paul and another I am of Apollo are ye not carnall?
I Corinthians,3,5,What is Paul? What thinge is Apollo? Only miministers are they by who ye beleved even as the Lorde gave every ma grace.
I Corinthians,3,6,I have planted: Apollo watred: but god gave increace.
I Corinthians,3,7,So then nether is he that planteth eny thinge nether he yt watreth: but god which gave the increace.
I Corinthians,3,8,He that planteth and he that watreth are nether better then the other. Every man yet shall receave his rewarde accordynge to his laboure.
I Corinthians,3,9,We are goddis labourers ye are goddis husbandrye ye are goddis byldynge.
I Corinthians,3,10,Accordynge to the grace of god geven vnto me as a wyse bylder have I layde the foundacio And another bylt thero But let every ma take hede how he bildeth apo.
I Corinthians,3,11,For other foundacion can no man laye then yt which is layde which is Iesus Christ.
I Corinthians,3,12,Yf eny man bilde on this foundacion golde silver precious stones tymber haye or stoble:
I Corinthians,3,13,every mannes worke shall appere. For the daye shall declare it and it shalbe shewed in fyre. And ye fyre shall trye euery mannes worke what it is.
I Corinthians,3,14,Yf eny mannes worke yt he hath bylt apon byde he shall receave a rewarde.
I Corinthians,3,15,If eny manes worke burne he shall suffre losse: but he shalbe safe him selfe: neverthelesse yet as it were thorow fyre.
I Corinthians,3,16, Are ye not ware that ye are the temple of god and how that the sprete of god dwelleth in you?
I Corinthians,3,17,Yf eny man defyle the temple of god him shall god destroye. For the temple of god is holy which temple ye are.
I Corinthians,3,18,Let no man deceave him silfe. Yf eny man seme wyse amonge you let him be a fole in this worlde that he maye be wyse.
I Corinthians,3,19,For ye wisdome of this worlde is folysshnes with god. For it is writte: he compaseth the wyse in their craftynes.
I Corinthians,3,20,And agayne God knoweth the thoughtes of the wyse that they be vayne.
I Corinthians,3,21,
I Corinthians,3,22,Therfore let no ma reioyce in men. For all thinges are youres whether it be Paul other Apollo other Cephas: whether it be ye worlde other lyfe other deeth whether they be present thinges or thinges to come: all are youres
I Corinthians,3,23,and ye are Christes and Christ is goddis.
I Corinthians,4,1,Let men this wyse esteme vs eve as the ministers of Christ and disposers of ye secretes of God.
I Corinthians,4,2,Furthermore it is requyred of the disposers that they be founde faithfull.
I Corinthians,4,3,With me is it but a very smal thinge that I shuld be iudged of you ether of (mans daye) No I iudge not myn awne selfe.
I Corinthians,4,4,I know nought by my selfe: yet am I not therby iustified. It is the Lorde that iudgeth me.
I Corinthians,4,5,Therfore iudge no thinge before the tyme vntill the Lorde come which will lighten thinges that are hyd in darcknes and ope the counsels of the hertes. And then shall every man have prayse of God.
I Corinthians,4,6,These thinges brethre I have described in myn awne person and Apollos for youre sakes that ye myght learne by vs that no man coute of him selfe beyonde that which is above written: that one swell not agaynst another for eny mans cause.
I Corinthians,4,7,For who preferreth the? What hast thou that thou hast not receaved? Yf thou have receaved it why reioysest thou as though thou haddest not receaved it?
I Corinthians,4,8,Now ye are full: now ye are made rych: ye raygne as kinges with out vs: and I wold to god ye dyd raygne that we might raygne with you.
I Corinthians,4,9,Me thinketh that God hath set forth vs which are Apostles for the lowest of all as it were me appoynted to deeth. For we are a gasyngestocke vnto the worlde and to ye angels and to men.
I Corinthians,4,10,We are foles for Christes sake and ye are wyse thorow Christ. We are weake and ye are stroge. Ye are honorable and we are despised.
I Corinthians,4,11,Eve vnto this daye we honger and thyrst and are naked and are boffetted wt fistes and have no certayne dwellinge place
I Corinthians,4,12,and laboure workinge with oure awne hondes. We are revysed and yet we blesse. We are persecuted and suffer it.
I Corinthians,4,13,We are evyll spoken of and we praye. We are made as it were the filthynes of the worlde the ofscowringe of all thinges even vnto this tyme.
I Corinthians,4,14,I write not these thinges to shame you: but as my beloved sonnes I warne you.
I Corinthians,4,15,For though ye have ten thousande instructours in Christ: yet have ye not many fathers. In Christ Iesu I have begotten you thorowe ye gospell.
I Corinthians,4,16,Wherfore I desyre you to folowe me.
I Corinthians,4,17,For this cause have I sent vnto you Timotheus which is my deare sonne and faithfull in the Lorde which shall put you in remembrauce of my wayes which I have in Christ eve as I teache every where in all congregacios.
I Corinthians,4,18,Some swell as though I wolde come no more at you.
I Corinthians,4,19,But I will come to you shortely yf God will: and will knowe not ye wordes of the which swell but ye power:
I Corinthians,4,20,for ye kyngdome of God is not in wordes but in power.
I Corinthians,4,21,What will ye? Shall I come vnto you with a rodde or els in love and in the sprete of mekenes?
I Corinthians,5,1,There goeth a comen sayinge that ther is fornicacion amoge you and soche fornicacion as is not once named amonge the gentyls: that one shuld have his fathers wyfe.
I Corinthians,5,2,And ye swell and have not rather sorowed yt he which hath done this dede myght be put fro amoge you.
I Corinthians,5,3,For I verely as absent in body even so present in sprete have determyned all redy (as though I were present) of him that hath done this dede
I Corinthians,5,4,in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ when ye are gaddered togedder and my sprete with the power of the Lorde Iesus Christ
I Corinthians,5,5,to deliver him vnto Satan for ye destruccio of the flesshe yt the sprete maye be saved in ye daye of ye Lorde Iesus.
I Corinthians,5,6,Youre reioysinge is not good: knowe ye not that a lytle leve sowreth the whole lompe of dowe.
I Corinthians,5,7,Pourge therfore the olde leven that ye maye be newe dowe as ye are swete breed. For Christ oure esterlambe is offered vp for vs.
I Corinthians,5,8,Therfore let vs kepe holy daye not with olde leve nether with the leven of maliciousnes and wickednes: but with the swete breed of purenes and truth.
I Corinthians,5,9,I wrote vnto you in a pistle that ye shuld not company with fornicatours.
I Corinthians,5,10,And I meat not at all of the fornicatours of this worlde ether of the coveteous or of extorsioners ether of the ydolaters: for then must ye nedes have gone out of ye worlde.
I Corinthians,5,11,But now I write vnto you that ye company not togedder yf eny that is called a brother be a fornicator or coveteous or a worshipper of ymages ether a raylar ether a dronkard or an extorcionar: with him that is soche se that ye eate not.
I Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to iudge them which are with out? Do ye not iudge them that are with in?
I Corinthians,5,13,Them that are with out God shall iudge. Put awaye from amonge you that evyll parson.
I Corinthians,6,1,How dare one of you havinge busines with another goo to lawe vnder the wicked and not rather vnder the sainctes?
I Corinthians,6,2,Do ye not know that the sainctes shall iudge the worlde? If the worlde shalbe iudged by you: are ye not good ynough to iudge smale trifles:
I Corinthians,6,3,knowe ye not how that we shall iudge the angles? How moche more maye we iudge thinges that partayne to ye lyfe?
I Corinthians,6,4,If ye have iudgementes of worldely matters take them which are despised in ye congregacio and make them iudges.
I Corinthians,6,5,This I saye to youre shame. Is ther vtterly no wyse man amoge you? What not one at all yt can iudge bitwene brother and brother
I Corinthians,6,6,but one brother goeth to lawe with another: and that vnder the vnbelevers?
I Corinthians,6,7,Now therfore ther is vtterly a faute amonge you because ye goo to lawe one with another. Why rather suffer ye not wronge? why rather suffre ye not youre selves to be robbed?
I Corinthians,6,8,Naye ye youre selves do wronge and robbe: and that the brethren.
I Corinthians,6,9,Do ye not remember how that the vnrighteous shall not inheret the kyngdome of God? Be not deceaved. For nether fornicators nether worshyppers of ymages nether whormongers nether weaklinges nether abusars of them selves with the mankynde
I Corinthians,6,10,nether theves nether the coveteous nether dronkardes nether cursed speakers nether pillers shall inheret the kyngdome of God.
I Corinthians,6,11,And soche ware ye verely: but ye are wesshed: ye are sanctified: ye are iustified by the name of the Lorde Iesus and by the sprete of oure God.
I Corinthians,6,12,All thinges are lawfull vnto me: but all thinges are not proffitable. I maye do all thinges: but I will be brought vnder no mans power.
I Corinthians,6,13,Meates are ordeyned for the belly and the belly for meates: but God shall destroy bothe it and them. Let not the body be applied vnto fornicacion but vnto the Lorde and the Lorde vnto the body.
I Corinthians,6,14,God hath raysed vp the Lorde and shall rayse vs vp by his power.
I Corinthians,6,15,Ether remember ye not that youre bodyes are the members of Christ? Shall I now take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbyd.
I Corinthians,6,16,Do ye not vnderstonde that he which coupleth him selfe with an harlot is become one body? For two (saith he) shalbe one flesshe.
I Corinthians,6,17,But he that is ioyned vnto the Lorde is one sprete.
I Corinthians,6,18,Fle fornicacion. All synnes that a man dothe are with out ye body. But he yt is a fornicator synneth agaynst his awne body.
I Corinthians,6,19,Ether knowe ye not how that youre bodyes are the temple of ye holy goost which is in you who ye have of God and how that ye are not youre awne?
I Corinthians,6,20,For ye are dearly bought. Therfore glorifie ye God in youre bodyes and in youre spretes for they are goddes.
I Corinthians,7,1,As concerninge the thinges wherof ye wrote vnto me: it is good for a ma not to touche a woman.
I Corinthians,7,2,Neverthelesse to avoyde fornicacio let every man have his wyfe: and let every woman have her husbande.
I Corinthians,7,3,Let the man geve vnto the wyfe due benevolence. Lykwyse also the wyfe vnto the man.
I Corinthians,7,4,The wyfe hath not power over her awne body: but the husbande. And lykewyse the man hath not power over his awne body: but the wyfe
I Corinthians,7,5,Withdrawe not youre selves one from another excepte it be with consent for a tyme for to geve youre selves to fastynge and prayer. And afterwarde come agayne to the same thynge lest Satan tempt you for youre incontinencye.
I Corinthians,7,6,This I saye of faveour not of comaundement.
I Corinthians,7,7,For I wolde that all men were as I my selfe am: but every man hath his proper gyfte of God one after this maner another after that.
I Corinthians,7,8,I saye vnto the vnmaried men and widdowes: it is good for them yf they abyde eve as I do.
I Corinthians,7,9,But and yf they canot abstayne let them mary. For it is better to mary then to burne.
I Corinthians,7,10,Vnto the maryed comaunde not I but the Lorde: that the wyfe separate not her selfe from the man.
I Corinthians,7,11,Yf she separate her selfe let her remayne vnmaryed or be reconciled vnto her husbande agayne. And let not the husbande put awaye his wyfe from him.
I Corinthians,7,12,To the remnaunt speake I and not the lorde. Yf eny brother have a wyfe that beleveth not yf she be content to dwell with him let him not put her awaye.
I Corinthians,7,13,And ye woma which hath to her husbande an infidell yf he consent to dwell with her let her not put him awaye.
I Corinthians,7,14,For ye vnbelevynge husbande is sanctified by the wyfe: and the vnbelevynge wyfe is sanctified by the husbande. Or els were youre chyldren vnclene: but now are they pure.
I Corinthians,7,15,But and yf the vnbelevynge departe let him departe. A brother or a sister is not in subiection to soche. God hath called vs in peace.
I Corinthians,7,16,For how knowest thou o woman whether thou shalt save that man or no? Other how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save that woman or no?
I Corinthians,7,17,but even as God hath distributed to every man. As the lorde hath called every person so let him walke: and so orden I in all congregacios.
I Corinthians,7,18,Yf eny man be called beynge circumcised let him adde nothinge therto. Yf eny be called vncircumcised: let him not be circucised.
I Corinthians,7,19,Circumcision is nothinge vncircumcision is nothinge: but the kepyng of the comaundmentes of god is altogether.
I Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abyde in the same state wherin he was called.
I Corinthians,7,21,Arte thou called a servaut? care not for it. Neverthelesse yf thou mayst be fre vse it rather.
I Corinthians,7,22,For he that is called in the lorde beynge a servaunt is the lordes freman. Lykwyse he that is called beynge fre is Christes servaut.
I Corinthians,7,23,Ye are dearly bought be not mennes seruauntes.
I Corinthians,7,24,Brethren let everye man wherin he is called therin abyde with God.
I Corinthians,7,25,As concernynge virgins I have no comaundment of the lorde: yet geve I counsell as one that hath obtayned mercye of the lorde to be faythfull.
I Corinthians,7,26,I suppose that it is good for the present necessite. For it is good for a ma so to be.
I Corinthians,7,27,Arte thou bounde vnto a wyfe? seke not to be lowsed. Arte thou lowsed from a wyfe? seke not a wyfe.
I Corinthians,7,28,But and yf thou take a wyfe thou synnest not. Lykwyse if a virgin mary she synneth not. Neverthelesse soche shall have trouble in their flesshe: but I faver you.
I Corinthians,7,29,This saye I brethre the tyme is shorte. It remayneth that they which have wives be as though they had none
I Corinthians,7,30,and they that wepe be as though thy wept not: and they that reioyce be as though they reioysed not: and they that bye be as though they possessed not:
I Corinthians,7,31,and they yt vse this worlde be as though they vsed it not. For the fassion of this worlde goeth awaye.
I Corinthians,7,32,I wolde have you without care: the single man careth for the thinges of the lorde how he maye please the lorde.
I Corinthians,7,33,But he that hath maried careth for the thinges of the worlde howe he maye please his wyfe.
I Corinthians,7,34,There is differece bitwene a virgin and a wyfe. The single woman careth for the thinges of the lorde that she maye be pure both in body and also in sprete But she that is maryed careth for the thinges of the worlde how she maye please her husband.
I Corinthians,7,35,This speake I for youre proffit not to tangle you in a snare: but for that which is honest and comly vnto you and that ye maye quyetly cleave vnto the lorde wt out separacion.
I Corinthians,7,36,If eny man thinke that it is vncomly for his virgin if she passe the tyme of mariage ad if so nede requyre let him do what he listeth he synneth not: let the be coupled in mariage.
I Corinthians,7,37,Neverthelesse he yt purposeth surely in his herte havynge none nede: but hath power over his awne will: and hath so decreed in his herte that he will kepe his virgin doth well.
I Corinthians,7,38,So then he that ioyneth his virgin in maryage doth well. But he that ioyneth not his virgin in mariage doth better.
I Corinthians,7,39,The wyfe is bounde to the lawe as longe as her husband liveth If her husbande slepe she is at liberte to mary with whom she wyll only in the lorde.
I Corinthians,7,40,But she is happiar yf she so abyde in my iudgmet And I thinke verely that I have the sprete of God.
I Corinthians,8,1,To speake of thinges dedicate vnto ydols we are sure that we all have knowledge. knowledge maketh a man swell: bnt love edifieth.
I Corinthians,8,2,If eny man thinke that he knoweth eny thinge he knoweth nothynge yet as he ought to knowe.
I Corinthians,8,3,But yf eny man love god the same is knowen of him.
I Corinthians,8,4,To speake of meate dedicat vnto ydols we are sure that ther is none ydoll in the worlde and that ther is none other god but one.
I Corinthians,8,5,And though ther be yt are called goddes whether in heven other in erth (as ther be goddes many and lordes many)
I Corinthians,8,6,yet vnto vs is there but one god which is the father of whom are all thinges and we in him: and one lorde Iesus Christ by whom are all thinges and we by him.
I Corinthians,8,7,But every man hath not knowledge. For some suppose that ther is an ydoll vntyll this houre and eate as of a thinge offered vnto ye ydole and so their consciences beynge yet weake are defyled.
I Corinthians,8,8,Meate maketh vs not acceptable to god. Nether yf we eate are we ye better. Nether yf we eate not are we the worsse.
I Corinthians,8,9,But take hede that youre libertie cause not ye weake to faule.
I Corinthians,8,10,For yf some man se ye which hast knowledge sit at meate in the ydoles teple shall not the conscience of hym which is weake be boldened to eate those thinges which are offered vnto ye ydole?
I Corinthians,8,11,And so thorow thy knowledge shall ye weake brother perisshe for whom christ dyed.
I Corinthians,8,12,Whe ye synne so agaynst the brethren and wounde their weake consciences ye synne agaynst Christ.
I Corinthians,8,13,Wherfore yf meate hurt my brother I will eate no flesshe whill the worlde stondeth because I will not hurte my brother.
I Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an Apostle? am I not fre? have I not sene Iesus Christ oure lorde?
I Corinthians,9,2,Are not ye my worke in the lorde. Yf I be not an Apostle vnto other yet am I vnto you. For the seale of myne Apostleshippe are ye in the lorde.
I Corinthians,9,3,Myne answer to them that axe me is this.
I Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eate and to drynke?
I Corinthians,9,5,Ether have we not power to leade about a sister to wyfe as wel as other Apostles and as the brethren of the lorde and Cephas?
I Corinthians,9,6,Ether only I and Barnabas have not power this to do?
I Corinthians,9,7,who goeth a warfare eny tyme at his awne cost? who planteth a vynearde and eateth not of the frute? Who fedeth a flocke and eateth not of the mylke?
I Corinthians,9,8,Saye I these thinges after the manner of men? Or sayth not the lawe the same also?
I Corinthians,9,9,For it ys written in the lawe of Moses. Thou shall not mosell the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne. Doth God take thought for oxen?
I Corinthians,9,10,Ether sayth he it not all to gedder for oure sakes? For oure sakes no doute this is written: that he which eareth shuld eare in hope: and that he which thressheth in hope shuld be parttaker of his hope.
I Corinthians,9,11,Yf we sowe vnto you spirituall thynges: is it a greate thynge yf we reepe youre carnall thynges
I Corinthians,9,12,Yf other be parttakers of this power over you? wherfore are not we rather.Neverthelesse we have not vsed this power: but suffre all thinges lest we shuld hynder the gospell of Christ.
I Corinthians,9,13,Do ye not vnderstoder how that they which minister in the temple have their fyndynge of the temple? And they which wayte at the aulter are partakers with ye aultre?
I Corinthians,9,14,Even so also dyd ye lorde ordayne that they which preache ye gospell shuld live of the gospell.
I Corinthians,9,15,But I have vsed none of these thinges. Nether wrote I these thinges that it shuld be so done vnto me. For it were better for me to dye the yt eny man shnld take this reioysinge from me
I Corinthians,9,16,In that I preache the gospell I have nothinge to reioyce of. For necessite is put vnto me. Wo is it vnto me yf I preache not the gospell.
I Corinthians,9,17,If I do it with a good will I have a rewarde. But yf I do it agaynst my will an office is committed vnto me.
I Corinthians,9,18,What is my rewarde then? Verely that whe I preache the gospell I make the gospell of Christ fre yt I misvse not myne auctorite in ye gospel
I Corinthians,9,19,For though I be fre from all men yet have I made my silfe servaunt vnto all men that I myght wynne the moo.
I Corinthians,9,20,Vnto the Iewes I became as a Iewe to winne ye Iewes. To the that were vnder the lawe was I made as though I had bene vnder the lawe to wynne the that were vnder the lawe.
I Corinthians,9,21,To them that were without lawe be ca I as though I had bene without lawe (whe I was not without lawe as perteyninge to god but vnder a lawe as concerninge Christ) to wynne the that were without lawe.
I Corinthians,9,22,To the weake became I as weake to wynne the weake. In all thinge I fassioned my silfe to all men to save at ye lest waye some.
I Corinthians,9,23,And this I do for the gospels sake that I might have my parte therof.
I Corinthians,9,24,Perceave ye not how that they which runne in a course runne all yet but one receaveth the rewarde. So runne that ye maye obtayne.
I Corinthians,9,25,Euery man yt proveth masteryes abstaineth from all thinges. And they do it to obtayne a corruptible croune: but we to obtayne an vncorruptible croune:
I Corinthians,9,26,I therfore so runne not as at an vncertayne thinge. So fyght I not as one yt beateth the ayer:
I Corinthians,9,27,but I tame my body and bringe it into subieccio lest after that I have preached to other I my silfe shuld be a castawaye.
I Corinthians,10,1,Brethren I wolde not that ye shuld be ignoraunt of this how yt oure fathers were all vnder a cloude and all passed thorow the see
I Corinthians,10,2,and were all baptised vnder Moses in the cloude and in the see:
I Corinthians,10,3,and dyd all eate of one spirituall meate
I Corinthians,10,4,and did all drincke of one maner of spirituall drincke. And they dranke of that spretuall rocke that folowed them which rocke was Christ.
I Corinthians,10,5,But in many of them had god no delite. For they were overthrowen in the wildernes.
I Corinthians,10,6,These are ensamples to vs that we shuld not lust after evyll thinges as they lusted
I Corinthians,10,7,Nether be ye worshippers of Images as were some of them accordynge as it is written: The people sate doune to eate and drynke and rose vp agayne to playe.
I Corinthians,10,8,Nether let vs comit fornicacion as some of them committed fornicacion and were destroyed in one daye .xxiii. thousande.
I Corinthians,10,9,Nether let vs tempte Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpentes.
I Corinthians,10,10,Nether murmure ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of ye destroyer
I Corinthians,10,11,All these thinges happened vnto them for ensamples and were written to put vs in remembraunce whom the endes of the worlde are come apon.
I Corinthians,10,12,Wherfore let hym that thynketh he stodeth take hede least he fall.
I Corinthians,10,13,There hath none other temptacion taken you but soche as foloweth ye nature of ma. But God is faythfull which shall not suffer you to be tempted above youre strenght: but shall in the myddes of the temptacion make awaye to escape out.
I Corinthians,10,14,Wherfore my deare beloued fle from worshippynge of ydols.
I Corinthians,10,15,I speake as vnto them which have discrecion Iudge ye what I saye.
I Corinthians,10,16,Ys not the cuppe of blessinge which we blesse partakynge of ye bloude of Christ? ys not the breed which we breake partetakynge of the body of Christ?
I Corinthians,10,17,because that we (though we be many) yet are one breed and one bodye in as moch as we all are partetakers of one breed.
I Corinthians,10,18,Beholde Israhell which walketh carnally. Are not they which eate of the sacrifyse partetakers of the aultre?
I Corinthians,10,19,What saye I then? that the ymage is eny thinge? or that it which is offered to ymages is eny thinge?
I Corinthians,10,20,Nay but I saye that those thinges which the gentyle offer they offer to devyls and not to god. And I wolde not that ye shuld have fellishippe with ye devils
I Corinthians,10,21,Ye canot drincke of the cup of the lorde and of yt cup of ye deuyls. Ye cnanot be partetakers of the lordes table and of the table of deuelles.
I Corinthians,10,22,Ether shall we provoke the lorde? Or are we stronger then he? All thynges are laufull vnto me but all thynges are not expedient.
I Corinthians,10,23,All thynges are lawfull to me but all thinges edifye not.
I Corinthians,10,24,Let no man seke his awne proffet: but let every man seke anothers welthe.
I Corinthians,10,25, What soever is solde in the market that eate and axe no questions for conscience sake
I Corinthians,10,26,For the erth is the lordis and all that therein is.
I Corinthians,10,27,Yf eny of them which beleve not bid you to a feest and yf ye be disposed to goo what soever is seet before you: eate axinge no question for conscience sake.
I Corinthians,10,28,But and yf eny man saye vnto you: this is dedicate vnto ydols eate not of it for his sake that shewed it and for hurtynge of conscience.
I Corinthians,10,29,Conscience I saye not thyne: but the coscieuce of that other. For why shuld my liberte be iudged of another manes conscience:
I Corinthians,10,30,For yf I take my parte with thakes: why am I evell spoken of for that thynge wherfore I geve thankes.
I Corinthians,10,31,Whether therfore ye eate or dryncke or what soever ye do do all to the prayse of God.
I Corinthians,10,32,Se that ye geve occasion of evell nether to ye Iewes nor yet to the gentyls nether to ye cogregacion of god:
I Corinthians,10,33,euen as I please all men in all thinges not sekynge myne awne proffet but the proffet of many that they myght be saved. Folowe me as I do Christ.
I Corinthians,11,1,I commende you
I Corinthians,11,2,brethren that ye remeber me in all thinges and kepe the ordinaunces even as I delyvered them to you.
I Corinthians,11,3,I wolde ye knew that Christ is the heed of every man. And the man is the womans heed. And God is Christes heed.
I Corinthians,11,4,Eevery ma prayinge or prophesyinge havynge eny thynge on his heed shameth his heed.
I Corinthians,11,5,Every woman that prayeth or prophisieth bare hedded dishonesteth hyr heed. For it is even all one and the very same thinge even as though she were shaven.
I Corinthians,11,6,If the woman be not covered lett her also be shoren. If it be shame for a woma to be shorne or shave let her cover her heed.
I Corinthians,11,7,A man ought not to cover his heed for as moche as he is the image and glory of God. The woman is the glory of the man.
I Corinthians,11,8,For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the ma.
I Corinthians,11,9,Nether was the man created for ye womas sake: but the woma for the mannes sake
I Corinthians,11,10,For this cause ought the woma to have power on her heed for the angels sakes.
I Corinthians,11,11,Neverthelesse nether is the ma with oute the woma nether the woma with out the man in the lorde.
I Corinthians,11,12,For as the woman is of the man eve so is the man by the woman: but all is of God.
I Corinthians,11,13,Iudge in youre selves whether it be coly yt a woman praye vnto god bare heeded.
I Corinthians,11,14,Or els doth not nature teach you that it is a shame for a man
I Corinthians,11,15,if he have longe heere: and a prayse to a woman yf she have longe heere? For her heere is geven her to cover her with all.
I Corinthians,11,16,If there be eny man amonge you yt lusteth to stryve let him knowe that we have no soche custome nether the congregacions of God.
I Corinthians,11,17,This I warne you of and commende not that ye come to gedder: not after a better maner but after a worsse.
I Corinthians,11,18,Fyrst of all when ye come togedder in the cogregacion I heare that ther is dissencion amonge you: and I partly beleve it.
I Corinthians,11,19,For ther must be sectes amonge you that they which are perfecte amonge you myght be knowen.
I Corinthians,11,20,When ye come to gedder a man cannot eate the lordes supper. For every man begynneth a fore to eate his awne supper.
I Corinthians,11,21,And one is hongrye and another is dronken. Have ye not houses to eate and to drinke in?
I Corinthians,11,22,Or els despyse ye the congregacion of god and shame them that have not? What shall I saye vnto you? shall I prayse you: In this prayse I you not.
I Corinthians,11,23,That which I delyvered vnto you I receaved of ye lorde. For ye lorde Iesus the same nyght in which he was betrayed toke breed:
I Corinthians,11,24,and thanked and brake and sayde. Take ye and eate ye: this is my body which is broken for you. This do ye in the remembraunce of me.
I Corinthians,11,25,After the same maner he toke the cup when sopper was done sayinge. This cup is the newe testament in my bloude. This do as oft as ye drynke it in the remebraunce of me.
I Corinthians,11,26,For as often as ye shall eate this breed and drynke this cup ye shall shewe the lordes deeth tyll he come.
I Corinthians,11,27,Wherfore whosoevere shall eate of this bred or drynke of the cup vnworthely shalbe giltie of the body and bloud of the Lorde
I Corinthians,11,28,Let a ma therfore examen him silfe and so let hi eate of the breed and drynke of the cup.
I Corinthians,11,29,For he yt eateth or drinketh vnworthely eateth and drynketh his awne damnacion because he maketh no difference of the lordis body.
I Corinthians,11,30,For this cause many are weake and sicke amoge you and many slepe.
I Corinthians,11,31,Yf we had truly iudged oure selves we shuld not have bene iudged.
I Corinthians,11,32,But when we are iudged of the lorde we are chastened because we shuld not be daned with the worlde.
I Corinthians,11,33,Wherfore my brethren when ye come to gedder to eate tary one for another.
I Corinthians,11,34,Yf eny ma hoger let hi eate at home yt ye come not togedder vnto condenacio. Other thinges will I set in order whe I come.
I Corinthians,12,1,In spirituall thinges brethren I wolde not have you ignoraunt.
I Corinthians,12,2,Ye knowe that ye were gentyls and went youre wayes vnto domme ydoles even as ye were ledde.
I Corinthians,12,3,Wherfore I declare vnto you that no man speakynge in the sprete of god defieth Iesus. Also no man can saye that Iesus is the lorde: but by the holy goost.
I Corinthians,12,4,Ther are diversities of gyftes verely yet but one sprete.
I Corinthians,12,5,And ther are differences of administracions and yet but one lorde.
I Corinthians,12,6,And ther are divers maners of operacions and yet but one God which worketh all thinges that are wrought in all creatures.
I Corinthians,12,7,The gyftes of ye sprete are geven to every man to proffit ye congregacion.
I Corinthians,12,8,To one is geven thorow the spirite the vtteraunce of wisdome? To another is geven the vtteraunce of knowledge by ye same sprete.
I Corinthians,12,9,To another is geuen fayth by ye same sprete. To another ye gyftes of healynge by the same sprete.
I Corinthians,12,10,To another power to do myracles. To another prophesie? To another iudgement of spretes. To another divers tonges. To another the interpretacion of toges.
I Corinthians,12,11,And these all worketh eve ye silfe same sprete devydynge to every man severall gyftes even as he will.
I Corinthians,12,12,For as the body is one and hath many mebres and all the membres of one body though they be many yet are but one body: even so is Christ.
I Corinthians,12,13,For in one sprete are we all baptysed to make one body whether we be Iewes or getyls whether we be bonde or fre: and have all dronke of one sprete.
I Corinthians,12,14,For the body is not one member but many.
I Corinthians,12,15,Yf the fote saye: I am not the honde therfore I am not of the body: is he therfore not of ye body:
I Corinthians,12,16,And if ye eare saye I am not the eye: therfore I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body?
I Corinthians,12,17,If all the body were an eye where were then the eare? If all were hearynge: where were the smellynge?
I Corinthians,12,18,But now hath god disposed the membres every one of them in the body at his awne pleasure.
I Corinthians,12,19,If they were all one member: where were the body?
I Corinthians,12,20,Now are ther many membres yet but one body.
I Corinthians,12,21,And the eye can not saye vnto the honde I have no nede of the: nor ye heed also to the fete. I have no nede of you.
I Corinthians,12,22,Ye rather a greate deale those mebres of the body which seme to be most feble are most necessary.
I Corinthians,12,23,And apo those mebres of yt body which we thinke lest honest put we most honestie on. And oure vngodly parties have most beauty on.
I Corinthians,12,24,For oure honest members nede it not. But God hath so disposed the body ad hath geven most honoure to that parte which laked
I Corinthians,12,25,lest there shuld be eny stryfe in the body: but that the members shuld indifferetly care one for another.
I Corinthians,12,26,And yf one member suffer all suffer with him: yf one member be had in honoure all members be glad also.
I Corinthians,12,27, Ye are the body of Christ and members one of another.
I Corinthians,12,28,And God hath also ordeyned in the congregacion fyrst the Apostels secodarely prophetes thyrdly teachers then the that do miracles: after that the gyftes of healynge helpers governers diversite of tonges.
I Corinthians,12,29,Are all Apostles? Are all Prophetes? Are all teachers? Are all doars of miracles?
I Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gyftes of healinge? Do all speake wt tonges? Do all interprete?
I Corinthians,12,31,Covet after ye best giftes. Amd yet shewe I vnto you a moare excellent waye.
I Corinthians,13,1,Though I spake with the tonges of me and angels and yet had no love I were eve as soundinge brasse: or as a tynklynge Cymball.
I Corinthians,13,2,And though I coulde prophesy and vnderstode all secretes and all knowledge: yee yf I had all fayth so that I coulde move moutayns oute of ther places and yet had no love I were nothynge.
I Corinthians,13,3,And though I bestowed all my gooddes to fede ye poore and though I gave my body even that I burned and yet had no love it profeteth me nothinge.
I Corinthians,13,4,Love suffreth longe and is corteous. Love envieth not. Love doth not frowardly swelleth not dealeth
I Corinthians,13,5,not dishonestly seketh not her awne is not provoked to anger thynketh not evyll
I Corinthians,13,6,reioyseth not in iniquite: but reioyseth in ye trueth
I Corinthians,13,7,suffreth all thynge beleveth all thynges hopeth all thynges endureth in all thynges.
I Corinthians,13,8,Though that prophesyinge fayle other tonges shall cease ) or knowledge vanysshe awaye yet love falleth never awaye
I Corinthians,13,9,For oure knowledge is vnparfect and oure prophesyinge is vnperfet.
I Corinthians,13,10,But when yt which is parfect is come then yt which is vnparfet shall be done awaye.
I Corinthians,13,11,When I was a chylde I spake as a chylde I vnderstode as a childe I ymagened as a chylde. But assone as I was a man I put awaye childesshnes.
I Corinthians,13,12,Now we se in a glasse even in a darke speakynge: but then shall we se face to face. Now I knowe vnparfectly: but then shall I knowe even as I am knowen.
I Corinthians,13,13,Now abideth fayth hope and love even these thre: but the chefe of these is love.
I Corinthians,14,1,Labour for love and covet spretuall giftes: and most chefly forto prophesye.
I Corinthians,14,2,For he that speaketh with toges speaketh not vnto men but vnto god for no man heareth him how be it in the sprete he speaketh misteries.
I Corinthians,14,3,But he that prophesieth speaketh vnto men to edifyinge to exhortacion and to comforte.
I Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh with tonges proffiteth him silfe: he that prophesyeth edifieth the congregacion.
I Corinthians,14,5,I wolde that ye all spake with tonges: but rather that ye prophesied. For greater is he that prophisieth? then he yt speaketh with tonges except he expounde it also that the congregacion maye have edifyinge.
I Corinthians,14,6,Now brehren if I come vnto you speakige wt tonges: what shall I profit you excepte I speake vnto you other by revelacio or knowledge or prophesyinge or doctrine.
I Corinthians,14,7,Moreover whe thinges with out lyfe geve sounde: whether it be a pype or an harpe: except they make a distinccion in the soundes: how shall it be knowen what is pyped or harped?
I Corinthians,14,8,And also if the trope geve an vncertayne voyce who shall prepare him silfe to fyght?
I Corinthians,14,9,Eve so lykwyse whe ye speake with toges excepte ye speake wordes that have signification how shall yt be vnderstonde what is spoke? For ye shall but speake in the ayer.
I Corinthians,14,10, Many kyndes of voyces are in the worlde and none of them are with out signification.
I Corinthians,14,11,If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth I shalbe vnto him that speaketh an alient: and and he that speaketh shalbe an alient vnto me
I Corinthians,14,12,Eve so ye (for as moche as ye covet spretuall giftes) seke that ye maye have plentye vnto ye edifyinge of the congregacion.
I Corinthians,14,13,Wherfore let him that speaketh with tonges praye that he maye interpret also.
I Corinthians,14,14,If I praye with tonge my sprete prayeth: but my mynde is with out frute.
I Corinthians,14,15,What is it then? I will praye with the sprete ad will praye wt the mynde also. I will singe with the sprete and will singe with the mynde also.
I Corinthians,14,16,For els when thou blessest with ye sprete how shall he that occupieth the roume of the vnlearned saye amen at thy gevinge of thankes seynge he vnderstondeth not what thou sayest
I Corinthians,14,17,Thou verely gevest thankes well but the other is not edyfied.
I Corinthians,14,18,I thanke my god I speake with toges moare then ye all.
I Corinthians,14,19,Yet had I lever in ye cogregacio to speake five wordes with my mynde to ye informacio of other rather then ten thousande wordes wt the tonge.
I Corinthians,14,20,Brethre be not chyldre in witte. How be it as cocerninge maliciousnes be chyldre: but in witte be perfet.
I Corinthians,14,21,In the lawe it is written with other toges and with other lyppes wyll I speake vnto this people and yet for all that will they not heare me sayth the Lorde.
I Corinthians,14,22,Wherfore tonges are for a signe not to them that beleve: but to them that beleve not. Contrary wyse prophesyinge serveth not for them that beleve not: but for them which beleve.
I Corinthians,14,23,Yf therfore when all the cogregacion is come to gedder and all speake with tonges ther come in they yt are vnlearned or they which beleve not: will they not saye that ye are out of youre wittes?
I Corinthians,14,24,But and yf all prophesy and ther come in one that beleveth not or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all men and is iudged of every man:
I Corinthians,14,25,and so are ye secretes of his hert opened and so falleth he doune on his face and worshippeth God and sayth yt God is wt you in dede.
I Corinthians,14,26,How is it then brethre? When ye come to gedder every ma hath his songe hath his doctryne hath his toge hath his revelacio hath his interpretacio. Let all thinges be done vnto edifyinge.
I Corinthians,14,27,If eny man speake wt tonges let it be two at once or at the most thre at once and that by course: and let another interprete it.
I Corinthians,14,28,But yf ther be no interpreter let him kepe silence in the cogregacion and let him speake to him selfe and to God.
I Corinthians,14,29, Let the Prophetes speake two at once or thre at once and let other iudge.
I Corinthians,14,30,Yf eny revelacio be made to another that sitteth by let the fyrst holde his peace.
I Corinthians,14,31,For ye maye all prophesy one by one that all maye learne and all maye have comforte.
I Corinthians,14,32,For ye spretes of the Prophetes are in the power of the Prophetes.
I Corinthians,14,33,For God is not causer of stryfe: but of peace as he is in all other congregacions of the saynctes.
I Corinthians,14,34, Let youre wyves kepe silence in the cogregacions. For it is not permitted vnto them to speake: but let them be vnder obedience as sayth the lawe.
I Corinthians,14,35,If they will learne enythinge let the axe their husbandes at home. For it is a shame for wemen to speake in the cogregacio.
I Corinthians,14,36,Sproge ye worde of god fro you? Ether came it vnto you only?
I Corinthians,14,37,Yf eny ma thinke him sylfe a prophet ether spirituall: let him vnderstonde what thinges I write vnto you. For they are the comaundementes of the Lorde.
I Corinthians,14,38,But and yf eny man be ignorat let him be ignorant.
I Corinthians,14,39,Wherfore brethren covet to prophesye and forbyd not to speake with tonges.
I Corinthians,14,40,And let all thinges be done honestly and in order.
I Corinthians,15,1,Brethren as pertayninge to the gospell which I preached vnto you which ye have also accepted and in the which ye continue
I Corinthians,15,2,by which also ye are saved: I do you to wit after what maner I preached vnto you yf ye kepe it except ye have beleved in vayne.
I Corinthians,15,3,For fyrst of all I delivered vnto you that which I receaved: how that Christ dyed for oure synnes agreinge to the scriptures:
I Corinthians,15,4,and that he was buried and that he arose agayne the thyrd daye accordinge to the scriptures:
I Corinthians,15,5,and that he he was sene of Cephas then of the twelve.
I Corinthians,15,6,After that he was sene of moo the five hodred brethren at once: of which many remayne vnto this daye and many are fallen aslepe.
I Corinthians,15,7,After that appered he to Iames then to all the Apostles.
I Corinthians,15,8,And last of all he was sene of me as of one that was borne out of due tyme.
I Corinthians,15,9,For I am the lest of all the Apostles which am not worthy to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the congregacion of God.
I Corinthians,15,10,But by the grace of God I am that I am. And his grace which is in me was not in vayne: but I labored moare aboundauntly then they all not I but the grace of God which is with me.
I Corinthians,15,11,Whether it were I or they so we preache and so have ye beleved.
I Corinthians,15,12,If Christ be preached how that he rose fro deeth: how saye some that are amoge you that ther is no resurreccion from deeth?
I Corinthians,15,13,If ther be no rysynge agayne from deeth: then is Christ not rysen.
I Corinthians,15,14,If Christ be not rysen then is oure preachinge vayne and youre faith is also in vayne.
I Corinthians,15,15,Ye and we are founde falce witnesses of God. For we have testifyed of God how that he raysyd vp Christ whom he raysyd not vp yf it be so that the deed ryse not vp agayne.
I Corinthians,15,16,For yf the deed ryse not agayne then is Christ not rysen agayne.
I Corinthians,15,17,If it be so yt Christ rose not then is youre fayth in vayne and yet are ye in youre synnes.
I Corinthians,15,18,And therto they which are fallen a slepe in Christ are perished.
I Corinthians,15,19,If in this lyfe only we beleve on christ then are we of all men the miserablest.
I Corinthians,15,20,But now is Christ rysen from deeth and is become the fyrst frutes of them that slept.
I Corinthians,15,21,For by a man came deeth and by a man came resurreccion fro deeth.
I Corinthians,15,22,For as by Adam all dye: eve so by Christ shall all be made alive
I Corinthians,15,23,and every man in his awne order. The fyrst is Christ then they yt are Christis at his commynge.
I Corinthians,15,24,Then cometh the ende when he hath delivered vp ye kyngdome to God ye father when he hath put doune all rule auctorite and power.
I Corinthians,15,25,For he must raygne tyll he have put all his enemyes vnder his fete.
I Corinthians,15,26,The last enemye that shalbe destroyed is deeth.
I Corinthians,15,27,For he hath put all thinges vnder his fete. But when he sayth all thinges are put vnder him it is manyfest that he is excepted which dyd put all thinges vnder him.
I Corinthians,15,28,When all thinges are subdued vnto him: then shall the sonne also him selfe be subiecte vnto him that put all thinges vnder him yt God maye be all in all thinges.
I Corinthians,15,29,Ether els what do they which are baptised over ye deed yf the deed ryse not at all? Why are they then baptised over the deed?
I Corinthians,15,30,Ye and why stonde we in ieoperdy every houre?
I Corinthians,15,31,By oure reioysinge which I have in Christ Iesu oure Lorde I dye dayly.
I Corinthians,15,32,That I have fought with beastes at Ephesus after the maner of men what avautageth it me yf the deed ryse not agayne? Let vs eate and drynke to morowe we shall dye.
I Corinthians,15,33,Be not deceaved: malicious speakinges corrupte good maners.
I Corinthians,15,34,Awake truely out of slepe and synne not. For some have not the knowlege of God. I speake this vnto youre rebuke.
I Corinthians,15,35,But some ma will saye: how aryse ye deed? with what bodyes come they in?
I Corinthians,15,36,Thou fole that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye.
I Corinthians,15,37,And what sowest thow? Thow sowest not that body that shalbe: but bare corne (I meane ether of wheet or of some other)
I Corinthians,15,38,and God geveth it a body at his pleasure to every seed a severall body.
I Corinthians,15,39,All flesshe is not one manner of flesshe: but ther is one maner flesshe of men another maner flesshe of beastes another maner flesshe of fysshes and another of byrdes.
I Corinthians,15,40,Ther are celestiall bodyes and ther are bodyes terrestriall. But ye glory of ye celestiall is one and ye glory of the terrestriall is another.
I Corinthians,15,41,Ther is one maner glory of the sonne and another glory of the mone and another glory of the starres. For one starre differth fro another in glory.
I Corinthians,15,42,So is the resurreccio of ye deed. It is sowe in corrupcio and ryseth in incorrupcion.
I Corinthians,15,43,It is sowen in dishonoure and ryseth in honoure. It is sowe in weaknes and ryseth in power. It is sowne a naturall body and ryseth a spretuall body.
I Corinthians,15,44,Ther is a naturall bodye and ther is a spretuall body:
I Corinthians,15,45,as it is written: the fyrste man Adam was made a livinge soule: and ye last Ada was made a quickeninge sprete.
I Corinthians,15,46,How be it yt is not fyrst which is spirituall: but yt which is naturall and then yt which is spretuall.
I Corinthians,15,47,The fyrst ma is of the erth erthy: the seconde man is ye Lorde fro heave.
I Corinthians,15,48,As is the erthy soche are they that are erthye. And as is the hevely soche are they yt are hevenly.
I Corinthians,15,49,And as we have borne the ymage of the erthy so shall we beare the ymage of the hevenly.

Hebrews,1,1,God in tyme past diversly and many wayes spake vnto the fathers by Prophetes:
Hebrews,1,2,but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne whom he hath made heyre of all thinges: by who also he made the worlde.
Hebrews,1,3,Which sonne beynge the brightnes of his glory and very ymage of his substance bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power hath in his awne person pourged oure synnes and is sitten on the right honde of the maiestie an hye
Hebrews,1,4,and is more excellent then the angels in as moche as he hath by inheritaunce obteyned an excellenter name then have they.
Hebrews,1,5,For vnto which of the angels sayde he ateny tyme: Thou arte my sonne this daye be gate I the? And agayne: I will be his father and he shalbe my sonne.
Hebrews,1,6,And agayne whe he bringeth in the fyrst begotten sonne in to the worlde he sayth: And all the angels of God shall worshippe him.
Hebrews,1,7,And of the angels he sayth: He maketh his angels spretes and his ministres flammes of fyre.
Hebrews,1,8,But vnto the sonne he sayth: God thy seate shalbe forever and ever. The cepter of thy kyngdome is a right cepter.
Hebrews,1,9,Thou hast loved rightewesnes and hated iniquyte. Wherfore God which is thy God hath anoynted the with ye oyle of gladnes above thy felowes.
Hebrews,1,10,And thou Lorde in the begynninge hast layde the foundacion of the erth. And the heves are the workes of thy hondes.
Hebrews,1,11,They shall perisshe but thou shalt endure. They all shall wexe olde as doth a garment:
Hebrews,1,12,and as a vesture shalt thou chaunge them and they shalbe chaunged. But thou arte all wayes and thy yeres shall not fayle.
Hebrews,1,13,Vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme? Sit on my ryght honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
Hebrews,1,14,Are they not all mynistrynge spretes sent to minister for their sakes which shalbe heyres of salvacion?
Hebrews,2,1,Wherfore we ought to geve ye more hede to ye thinges we have herde lest we perysshe.
Hebrews,2,2,For yf the worde which was spoke by angels was stedfast: so yt every trasgressio and disobediece receaved a iust recopece to rewarde:
Hebrews,2,3,how shall we escape yf we despyse so great saluacio which at ye fyrst bega to be preached of ye lorde him silfe and afterwarde was cofermed vnto vs warde by the ye hearde it
Hebrews,2,4,god bearynge witnes therto bothe with sygnes and wonders also and with divers miracles and gyftes of the holy gooste accordynge to his awne will.
Hebrews,2,5,He hath not vnto the angels put in subieccion the worlde to come where of we speake.
Hebrews,2,6,But one in a certayne place witnessed sayinge. What is man that thou arte myndfull of him?
Hebrews,2,7,After thou haddest for a season made him lower then the angels: thou crounedst him with honour and glory and hast set him above the workes of thy hondes.
Hebrews,2,8,Thou hast put all thynges in subieccion vnder his fete. In that he put all thynges vnder him he left nothynge that is not put vnder him.
Hebrews,2,9,Neverthelesse we yet se not all thynges subdued but him yt was made lesse the ye angelles: we se that it was Iesus which is crouned with glory and honour for the sofferinge of death: that he by the grace of god shulde tast of deeth for all men.
Hebrews,2,10,For it becam him for whom are all thynges and by whom are all thynges after that he had brought many sonnes vnto glory that he shuld make the lorde of their saluacion parfect thorow sofferynge.
Hebrews,2,11,For he that sanctifieth and they which are sanctified are all of one. For which causes sake he is not ashamde to call the brethren
Hebrews,2,12,sayinge: I will declare thy name vnto my brethren and in the myddes of the congregacio will I prayse the.
Hebrews,2,13,And agayne: I will put my trust in him. And agayne. beholde here am I and the children which god hath geven me.
Hebrews,2,14,For as moche then as the children were parte takers of flesshe and bloud he also him silfe lyke wyse toke parte with them for to put doune thorow deth him that had lordshippe over deeth that is to saye the devyll
Hebrews,2,15,and yt he myght delyver the which thorow feare of deeth were all their lyfetyme in dauger of bondage.
Hebrews,2,16,For he in no place taketh on him the angels: but the seede of Abraham taketh he on him.
Hebrews,2,17,Wherfore in all thynges it became him to be made lyke vnto his brethre that he myght be mercifull and a faythfull hye preste in thynges concernynge god for to pourge the peoples synnes.
Hebrews,2,18,For in that he him silfe suffered and was tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted.
Hebrews,3,1,Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the celestiall callinge cosyder the embasseatour and hye prest of oure profession Christ Iesus
Hebrews,3,2,which was faythfull to him that made him even as was Moses in all his housse.
Hebrews,3,3,And this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses: In as moche as he which hath prepared the housse hath most honoure in the housse.
Hebrews,3,4,Every housse is prepared of some man. But he that ordeyned all thinges is god.
Hebrews,3,5,And Moses verely was faythfull in all his housse as a minister to beare witnes of tho thinges which shuld be spoken afterwarde.
Hebrews,3,6,But Christ as a sonne hath rule over the housse whose housse are we so that we hold fast the confydence and the reioysynge of that hope vnto the ende.
Hebrews,3,7,Wherfore as the holy goost sayth: to daye if ye shall heare his voyce
Hebrews,3,8,harden not youre hertes after the rebellyon in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes
Hebrews,3,9,where youre fathers tempted me proved me and sawe my workes xl. yeare longe.
Hebrews,3,10,Wherfore I was greved wt ye generacio and sayde. They erre ever in their hertes: they verely have not knowe my wayes
Hebrews,3,11,so that I sware in my wrathe that they shuld not enter into my rest.
Hebrews,3,12,Take hede brethren that therbe in none of you an evyll herte in vnbeleve that he shuld departe from ye lyvynge god:
Hebrews,3,13,but exhorte one another dayly whill is it called to daye lest eny of you wexe harde herted thorow ye deceytfullnesse of sinne
Hebrews,3,14,We are partetakers of Christ yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the fyrst substance
Hebrews,3,15,so longe as it is sayd: to daye yf ye heare his voyce harde not youre hertes as when ye rebelled.
Hebrews,3,16,For some whe they hearde rebelled: howbe it not all yt ca out of Egypt vnder Moses.
Hebrews,3,17,But with who was he despleased .xl. yeares? Was he not displeased with them that synned: whose carkases were overthorwen in the desert?
Hebrews,3,18,To whom sware he that they shuld not enter into his rest: but vnto them that beleved not?
Hebrews,3,19,And we se that they coulde not enter in because of vnbeleve.
Hebrews,4,1,Let vs feare therfore lest eny of vs forsakynge the promes of entrynge into his rest shulde seme to come behinde.
Hebrews,4,2,For vnto vs was it declared as well as vnto them. But it proffited not them that they hearde the worde because they which hearde it coupled it not with fayth.
Hebrews,4,3,But we which have beleved do enter into his rest as contrarywyse he sayde to the other: I have sworne in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. And that spake he verely longe after that the workes were made and the foudacio of ye worlde layde.
Hebrews,4,4,For he spake in a certayne place of ye seveth daye on this wyse: And god did rest ye seventh daye fro all his workes.
Hebrews,4,5,And in this place agayne: They shall not come into my rest.
Hebrews,4,6,Seynge therfore it foloweth that some muste enter therinto and they to who it was fyrst preached entred not therin for vnbeleves sake.
Hebrews,4,7,Agayne he apoynteth in David a certayne present daye after so longe a tyme sayinge as it is rehearsed: this daye if ye heare his voyce be not harde herted.
Hebrews,4,8,For if Iosue had geven them rest then wolde he not afterwarde have spoke of another daye.
Hebrews,4,9,There remayneth therfore yet a rest to ye people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,For he yt is is entred into his rest doth cease from his awne workes as god did from his.
Hebrews,4,11,Let vs study therfore to entre into that rest lest eny man faule after the same ensample in to vnbelefe.
Hebrews,4,12,For the worde of god is quycke and myghty in operacion and sharper then eny two edged swearde: and entreth through even vnto the dividynge asonder of the soule and the sprete and of the ioyntes and the mary: and iudgeth the thoughtes and the intentes of the herte:
Hebrews,4,13,nether is there eny creature invisible in the sight of it. For all thynges are naked and bare vnto the eyes of him of who we speake.
Hebrews,4,14,Seynge then that we have a great hye prest whych is entred into heven (I meane Iesus the sonne of God) let vs holde oure profession.
Hebrews,4,15,For we have not an hye prest which can not have compassion on oure infirmities: but was in all poyntes tempted lyke as we are: but yet with out synne.
Hebrews,4,16,Let vs therfore goo boldely vnto the seate of grace that we maye receave mercy and fynde grace to helpe in tyme of nede.
Hebrews,5,1,For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god: to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne:
Hebrews,5,2,which can have compassion on the ignoraunt and on them that are out of the waye because that he him silfe also is compased with infirmitie:
Hebrews,5,3,For the which infirmities sake he is bounde to offer for synnes as well for hys awne parte as for the peoples.
Hebrews,5,4,And no man taketh honour vnto him silfe but he that is called of God as was Aaron.
Hebrews,5,5,Even so lykewise Christ glorified not him silfe to be made the hye prest: but he that sayde vnto him: thou arte my sonne this daye begat I the glorified him.
Hebrews,5,6,As he also in another place speaketh: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
Hebrews,5,7,Which in the dayes of his flesshe did offer vp prayers and sup plicacions with stronge cryinge and teares vnto him that was able to save him from deeth: and was also hearde because of his godlines.
Hebrews,5,8,And though he were Goddes sonne yet learned he obediece by tho thynges which he suffered
Hebrews,5,9,and was made parfaite and the cause of eternall saluacion vnto all them that obey him:
Hebrews,5,10,and is called of God an hye prest after the order of Melchisedech.
Hebrews,5,11,Wherof we have many thynges to saye which are harde to be vttered: because ye are dull of hearinge.
Hebrews,5,12,For when as cocerninge ye tyme ye ought to be teachers yet have ye nede agayne that we teache you the fyrst principles of the worde of god: and are become soche as have nede of mylke and not of stronge meate:
Hebrews,5,13,For every man that is feed with mylke is inexperte in the worde of rightewesnes. For he is but a babe.
Hebrews,5,14,But stronge meate belongeth to them that are parfecte which thorow custome have their wittes exercised to iudge both good and evyll also.
Hebrews,6,1,Wherfore let vs leave ye doctryne pertayninge to the beginninge of a Christen man and let vs go vnto perfeccio and now no more laye the foundacio of repentaunce from deed workes and of fayth towarde God
Hebrews,6,2,of baptyme of doctryne and of layinge on of hondes and of resurreccion from deeth and of eternall iudgemet.
Hebrews,6,3,And so will we do yf God permitte.
Hebrews,6,4,For it is not possible yt they which were once lyghted and have tasted of the hevenly gyft and were become partetakers of the holy goost
Hebrews,6,5,and have tasted of the good worde of God and of the power of the worlde to come:
Hebrews,6,6,yf they faule shuld be renued agayne vnto repentaunce: for as moche as they have (as concerninge them selves) crucified the sonne of God a fresshe makynge a mocke of him.
Hebrews,6,7,For that erth which drinketh in the rayne wich cometh ofte vpon it and bringeth forth erbes mete for them that dresse it receaveth blessynge of god.
Hebrews,6,8,But that grounde which beareth thornes and bryars is reproved and is nye vnto cursynge: whose ende is to be burned.
Hebrews,6,9,Neverthelesse deare frendes we trust to se better of you and thynges which accompany saluacion though we thus speake.
Hebrews,6,10,For god is not vnrighteous that he shuld forget youre worke and laboure that procedeth of love which love shewed in his name which have ministred vnto the saynctes and yet minister
Hebrews,6,11,Yee and we desyre that every one of you shew the same diligence to the stablysshynge of hope even vnto the ende:
Hebrews,6,12,that ye faynt not but folowe them which thorow fayth and pacience inheret the promyses.
Hebrews,6,13,For when god made promes to Abraham because he had no greater thinge to sweare by he sware by him silfe
Hebrews,6,14,sayinge: Surely I will blesse the and multiply the in dede.
Hebrews,6,15,And so after that he had taryed a longe tyme he enioyed the promes.
Hebrews,6,16,Men verely sweare by him that is greater then them selves and an othe to confyrme the thynge ys amonge them an ende of all stryfe.
Hebrews,6,17,So god willynge very aboundanly to shewe vnto the heyres of promes the stablenes of his counsayle he added an othe
Hebrews,6,18,that by two immutable thinges (in which it was vnpossible that god shuld lye) we myght have parfect consolacion which have fled for to holde fast the hope that is set before vs
Hebrews,6,19,which hope we have as an ancre of the soule both sure and stedfast. Which hope also entreth in into tho thynges which are with in the vayle
Hebrews,6,20,whither ye fore runner is for vs entred in I mea Iesus that is made an hye prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
Hebrews,7,1,This Melchisedech kynge of Salem (which beinge prest of ye most hye god met Abraham as he returned agayne from the slaughter of the kynges and blessed him:
Hebrews,7,2,to whom also Abraham gave tythes of all thynges) fyrst is by interpretacion kynge of rightewesnes: after yt he is kynge of Sale yt is to saye kynge of peace
Hebrews,7,3,with out father wt out mother with out kynne and hath nether begynnynge of his tyme nether yet ende of his lyfe: but is lykened vnto the sonne of god and cotinueth a preste for ever.
Hebrews,7,4,Consyder what a man this was vnto who the patriarke Abraham gave tythes of the spoyles.
Hebrews,7,5,And verely those children of levy which receave the office of the prestes have a commaundement to take a cordyng to the lawe tythes of the people that is to saye of their brethren yee though they spronge out of the loynes of Abraham.
Hebrews,7,6,But he whose kynred is not counted amonge them receaved tythes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promyses.
Hebrews,7,7,And no man denyeth but that which is lesse receaveth blessinge of yt which is greater.
Hebrews,7,8,And here men that dye receave tythes. But there he receaveth tythes of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
Hebrews,7,9,And to saye the trueth Levy him silfe also which receaveth tythes payed tythes in Abraham.
Hebrews,7,10,For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchisech met him.
Hebrews,7,11,Yf now therfore perfeccion came by the presthod of the levites (for vnder that presthod the people recaved the lawe) what neded it furthermore that an other prest shuld ryse after the order of Melchisedech and not after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews,7,12,Now no dout yf the presthod be translated then of necessitie must the lawe be translated also.
Hebrews,7,13,For he of whom these thynges are spoken pertayneth vnto another trybe of which never man served at the aultre.
Hebrews,7,14,For it is evidet that oure lorde spronge of the trybe of Iuda of which trybe spake Moses nothynge concernynge presthod.
Hebrews,7,15,And it is yet a more evydent thinge yf after the similitude of Melchisedech ther aryse a nother prest
Hebrews,7,16,which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundmet: but after the power of the endlesse lyfe
Hebrews,7,17,(For he testifieth: Thou arte a prest forever after the order of Melchysedech)
Hebrews,7,18,Then the commaundmet that went a fore is disanulled because of hir weaknes and vnproffitablenes.
Hebrews,7,19,For the lawe made nothynge parfecte: but was an introduccion of a better hope by which hope we drawe nye vnto god.
Hebrews,7,20,And for this cause it is a better hope that it was not promysed with out an othe.
Hebrews,7,21,Those prestes were made wt out an oth: but this prest with an oth by him that saide vnto him The lorde sware and will not repent: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
Hebrews,7,22,And for that cause was Iesus a stablyssher of a better testament.
Hebrews,7,23,And amonge them many were made prestes because they were not suffred to endure by the reason of deeth.
Hebrews,7,24,But this man because he endureth ever hath an everlastinge presthod.
Hebrews,7,25,Wherfore he is able also ever to save them that come vnto god by him seynge he ever lyveth to make intercession for vs.
Hebrews,7,26,Soche an hye prest it became vs to have which is wholy harmlesse vndefyled separat from synners and made hyar then heven.
Hebrews,7,27,Which nedeth not dayly (as yonder hie prestes) to offer vp sacrifice fyrst for his awne synnes and then for the peoples synnes. For that did he at once for all when he offered vp him silfe.
Hebrews,7,28,For the lawe maketh men prestes which have infirmitie: but the worde of the othe that came fence ye lawe maketh the sonne prest which is parfecte for ever more.
Hebrews,8,1,Of the thynges which we have spoke this is the pyth: that we have soche an hye preste that is sitten on ye right honde of the seate of maieste in heven
Hebrews,8,2,and is a minister of holy thynges and of the very tabernacle which God pyght and not ma.
Hebrews,8,3,For every hye prest is ordeyned to offer gyftes and sacryfises wherfore it is of necessitie that this man have somewhat also to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,For he were not a preste yf he were on ye erth where are prestes that acordynge to ye lawe
Hebrews,8,5,offer giftes which prestes serve vnto ye ensample and shadowe of hevenly thynges: even as the answer of God was geven vnto Moses when he was about to fynnishe the tabernacle: Take hede (sayde he) that thou make all thynges accordynge to the patrone shewed to the in the mount.
Hebrews,8,6,Now hath he obtayned a more excellent office in as moche as he is the mediator of a better testament which was made for better promyses.
Hebrews,8,7,For yf that fyrst testament had bene fautelesse: then shuld no place have bene sought for the seconde.
Hebrews,8,8,For in rebukynge the he sayth: Beholde the dayes will come (sayth the lorde) and I will fynnyshe apon the housse of Israhel and apon the housse of Iuda
Hebrews,8,9,a newe testament: not lyke the testament that I made with their fathers at that tyme whe I toke them by the hondes to lede them oute of the londe of Egipte for they continued not in my testament and I regarded them not sayth the lorde.
Hebrews,8,10,For this is the testament that I will make with the housse of Israhell: After those dayes sayth the lorde: I will put my lawes in their myndes and in their hertes I will wryte the and I wilbe their God and they shalbe my people.
Hebrews,8,11,And they shall not teache every man his neghboure and every man his brother sayinge: knowe the lorde: For they shall knowe me from the lest to the moste of them:
Hebrews,8,12,For I wilbe mercifull over their vnrightwesnes and on their synnes and on their iniquiries.
Hebrews,8,13,In yt he sayth a new testament he hath abrogat the olde. Now that which is disanulled and wexed olde is redy to vannysshe awaye.
Hebrews,9,1,That fyrst tabernacle verely had ordinaunces and servynges of god and wordly holynes.
Hebrews,9,2,For there was a fore tabernacle made wherin was the candlesticke and the table and the shewe breed which is called wholy.
Hebrews,9,3,But with in the secode vayle was ther a tabernacle which is called holiest of all
Hebrews,9,4,which had the golden senser and the arcke of the testamet overlayde round about with golde wherin was the golden pot with manna and Aarons rodde that spronge and the tables of the testament.
Hebrews,9,5,Over the arcke were the cherubis of glory shadowynge the seate of grace. Of which thynges we wyll not now speake perticularly.
Hebrews,9,6,When these thynges were thus ordeyned the prestes went all wayes into the fyrst tabernacle and executed the service of god.
Hebrews,9,7,But into the seconde went the hye prest alone once every yeare: and not with out bloud which he offered for him silfe and for the ignoraunce of ye people.
Hebrews,9,8,Wherwith ye holy goost this signifyeng yt the waye of holy thynges was not yet opened whill as yet ye fyrst tabernacle was stondynge.
Hebrews,9,9,Which was a similitude for the tyme then present and in which were offered gyftes and sacrifises that coulde not make them that minister parfecte as pertaynynge to the conscience
Hebrews,9,10,with only meates and drinkes and divers wesshynges and iustifyinges of the flesshe which were ordeyned vntyll the tyme of reformacion.
Hebrews,9,11,But Christ beynge an hye prest of good thynges to come came by a greater and a moare parfecte tabernacle not made with hondes: that is to saye not of this maner bildynge
Hebrews,9,12,nether by the bloud of gotes and calves: but by his awne bloud we entred once for all into the holy place and founde eternall redemcion.
Hebrews,9,13,For yf the bloud of oxen and of Gotes and the asshes of an heyfer whe it was sprynckled puryfied the vnclene as touchynge the purifiynge of the flesshe:
Hebrews,9,14,How moche more shall the bloud of Christ (which thorow the eternall sprete offered him silfe with out spot to God) pourdge youre consciences from deed workes for to serve the livynge god?
Hebrews,9,15,And for this cause is he the mediator of ye newe testament that thorow deeth which chaunsed for the redempcion of those transgressions that were in ye fyrst testamet) they which were called myght receave the promes of eternall inheritaunce.
Hebrews,9,16,For whersoever is a testament there must also be the deeth of him that maketh the testament.
Hebrews,9,17,For the testament taketh auctoritie when men are deed: For it is of no value as longe as he that made it is alive.
Hebrews,9,18,For which cause also nether that fyrst testament was ordeyned with out bloud.
Hebrews,9,19,For when all the commaundementes were redde of Moses vnto all the people he toke ye bloud of calves and of Gotes with water and purple woll and ysope and sprynkled both the boke and all the people
Hebrews,9,20,sayinge: this is the bloud of the testament which god hath apoynted vnto you.
Hebrews,9,21,Morover he sprenkled the tabernacle with bloud also and all the ministrynge vessels.
Hebrews,9,22,And almost all thynges are bye the lawe pourged with bloud and with out effusion of bloud is no remission.
Hebrews,9,23,It is then nede that the similitudes of hevenly thynges be purified with soche thynges: but the hevenly thynges them selves are purified with better sacrifises then are those.
Hebrews,9,24,For Christ is not entred into the holy places that are made with hondes which are but similitudes of true thynges: but is entred into very heven for to appere now in the syght of God for vs:
Hebrews,9,25,not to offer him silfe often as the hye prest entreth in to ye holy place every yeare with straunge bloud
Hebrews,9,26,for then must he have often suffered sence the worlde bega. But now in the ende of the worlde hath he appered once to put synne to flyght by the offerynge vp of him silfe.
Hebrews,9,27,And as it is apoynted vnto men that they shall once dye and then commeth the iudegement even
Hebrews,9,28,so Christ was once offered to take awaye the synnes of many and vnto them that loke for him shall he appeare agayne without synne vnto saluacion.
Hebrews,10,1,For the lawe which hath but the shadowe of good thynges to come and not the thynges in their awne fassion can never with ye sacryfises which they offer yere by yere continually make the comers thervnto parfayte.
Hebrews,10,2,For wolde not then those sacrifises have ceased to have bene offered because that the offerers once pourged shuld have had no moare conscieces of sinnes.
Hebrews,10,3,Neverthelesse in those sacrifises is ther mencion made of synnes every yeare.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is vnpossible that the bloud of oxen and of gotes shuld take awaye synnes.
Hebrews,10,5,Wherfore when he commeth into the worlde he sayth: Sacrifice and offeringe thou woldest not have: but a bodie hast thou ordeyned me.
Hebrews,10,6,In sacrifices and synne offerynges thou hast no lust.
Hebrews,10,7,Then I sayde: Lo I come in the chefest of the boke it is written of me that I shuld doo thy will o god.
Hebrews,10,8,Above when he had sayed sacrifice and offerynge and burnt sacrifices and synne offerynges thou woldest not have nether hast alowed (which yet are offered by the lawe)
Hebrews,10,9,and then sayde: Lo I come to do thy will o god: he taketh awaye the fyrst to stablisshe the latter.
Hebrews,10,10,By the which will we are sanctified by the offeringe of the body of Iesu Christe once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,And every prest is redy dayly ministrynge and ofte tymes offereth one maner of offerynge which can never take awaye synnes.
Hebrews,10,12,But this man after he had offered one sacrifyce for synnes sat him doune for ever on the right honde of god
Hebrews,10,13,and from hence forth tarieth till his foes be made his fotestole.
Hebrews,10,14,For with one offerynge hath he made parfecte for ever them yt are sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,And ye holy goost also beareth vs recorde of this even when he tolde before:
Hebrews,10,16,This is the testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes sayth the lorde. I will put my lawes in their hertes and in their mynde I will write them
Hebrews,10,17,and their synnes and iniquyties will I remember no moare.
Hebrews,10,18,And where remission of these thinges is there is no moare offerynge for synne.
Hebrews,10,19,Seynge brethren that by the meanes of the bloud of Iesu we maye be bolde to enter into that holy place
Hebrews,10,20,by the newe and livynge waye which he hath prepared for vs through the vayle that is to saye by his flesshe.
Hebrews,10,21,And seynge also that we have an hye prest which is ruler over ye housse of god
Hebrews,10,22,let vs drawe nye with a true herte in a full fayth sprynckeled in oure hertes from an evyll conscience and wesshed in oure bodies with pure water
Hebrews,10,23,and let vs kepe the profession of oure hope with oute waveringe (for he is faythfull that promysed)
Hebrews,10,24,and let vs consyder one another to provoke vnto love and to good workes:
Hebrews,10,25,and let vs not forsake the felishippe that we have amoge oure selves as the maner of some is: but let vs exhorte one another and that so moche the more because ye se that the daye draweth nye.
Hebrews,10,26,For yf we synne willyngly after that we have receaved the knowledge of the trueth there remayneth no more sacrifice for synnes
Hebrews,10,27,but a fearfull lokynge for iudgement and violent fyre which shall devoure the adversaries
Hebrews,10,28,He that despiseth Moses lawe dyeth with out mercy vnder two or thre witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,Of how moche sorer punyshment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy which treadeth vnderfote the sonne of god: and counteth the bloude of the testament as an vnholy thynge wherwith he was sanctified and doth dishonoure to the sprete of grace.
Hebrews,10,30,For we knowe him that hath sayde vengeaunce belongeth vnto me I will recompence sayth the lorde. And agayne: the lorde shall iudge his people.
Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearfull thynge to faule into the hondes of the livynge God.
Hebrews,10,32,Call to remebraunce the dayes that are passed in the which after ye had receaved light ye endured a greate fyght in adversities
Hebrews,10,33,partly whill all men wondred and gased at you for the shame and trioulacion that was done vnto you and partly whill ye became companyons of the which so passed their tyme.
Hebrews,10,34,For ye suffered also with my bondes and toke a worth the spoylynge of youre goodes and that with gladnes knowynge in youre selves how that ye had in heven a better and an endurynge substaunce
Hebrews,10,35,Cast not awaye therfore youre confidence which hath great rewarde to recopence.
Hebrews,10,36,For ye have nede of paciece that after ye have done ye will of god ye myght receave the promes.
Hebrews,10,37,For yet a very lytell whyle and he that shall come will come and will not tary.
Hebrews,10,38,But the iust shall live by faith. And yf he withdrawe him silfe my soule shall have no pleasure in him.
Hebrews,10,39,We are not whiche withdrawe oure selves vnto dampnacio but partayne to fayth to the wynnynge of the soule.
Hebrews,11,1,Fayth is a sure confidence of thynges which are hoped for and a certayntie of thynges which are not sene.
Hebrews,11,2,By it ye elders were well reported of.
Hebrews,11,3,Thorow fayth we vnderstonde that the worlde was ordeyned by the worde of god: and that thynges which are sene were made of thynges which are not sene.
Hebrews,11,4,By fayth Abell offered vnto god a more plenteous sacrifice then Cayn: by which he obteyned witnes that he was righteous god testifyinge of his gyftes: by which also he beynge deed yet speaketh.
Hebrews,11,5,By fayth was Enoch traslated yt he shuld not se deeth: nether was he founde: for God had taken him awaye. Before he was taken awaye he was reported of that he had pleased God:
Hebrews,11,6,but with out fayth it is vnpossible to please him. For he that commeth to God must beleve that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that seke him.
Hebrews,11,7,By fayth Noe honored God after that he was warned of thinges which were not sene and prepared the arcke to the savinge of his houssholde thorowe the which arcke he condempned the worlde and became heyre of the rightewesnes which commeth by fayth.
Hebrews,11,8,By fayth Abraha whe he was called obeyed to goo out into a place which he shuld afterwarde receave to inheritaunce and he wet out not knowynge whether he shuld goo.
Hebrews,11,9,By fayth he removed into the londe yt was promysed him as into a straunge countre and dwelt in tabernacles: and so dyd Isaac and Iacob heyres with him of the same promes.
Hebrews,11,10,For he loked for a citie havinge a foundacio whose bylder and maker is God.
Hebrews,11,11,Thorow fayth Sara also receaved stregth to be with chylde and was delivered of a chylde when she was past age because she iudged him faythfull which had promysed.
Hebrews,11,12,And therfore spronge therof one (and of one which was as good as deed) so many in multitude as the starres of ye skye and as the sond of the see shore which is innumerable.
Hebrews,11,13,And they all dyed in fayth and receaved not the promyses: but sawe them a farre of and beleved them and saluted them: and confessed that they were straungers and pilgrems on the erthe.
Hebrews,11,14,They that saye soche thinges declare that they seke a coutre.
Hebrews,11,15,Also yf they had bene myndfull of that countre from whence they came oute they had leasure to have returned agayne.
Hebrews,11,16,But now they desyre a better that is to saye a hevenlye. Wherfore God is not ashamed of them even to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a citie.
Hebrews,11,17,In fayth Abraham offered vp Isaac whe he was tempted and he offered him beinge his only begotten sonne which had receaved the promyses
Hebrews,11,18,of who it was sayde in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews,11,19,for he cosidered that God was able to rayse vp agayne fro deeth. Wherfore receaved he him for an ensample.
Hebrews,11,20,In fayth Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau concerninge thinges to come.
Hebrews,11,21,By fayth Iacob when he was a dyinge blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph and bowed him selfe towarde the toppe of his cepter.
Hebrews,11,22,By fayth Ioseph when he dyed remebred the departinge of the chyldren of Israel and gave commaundement of his bones.
Hebrews,11,23,By fayth Moses when he was borne was hid thre monethes of his father and mother be cause they sawe he was a proper chylde: nether feared they the kynges commaundemet.
Hebrews,11,24,By fayth Moses when he was great refused to be called ye sonne of Pharaos doughter
Hebrews,11,25,and chose rather to suffre adversitie wt the people of God then to enioye the pleasurs of synne for a ceason
Hebrews,11,26,and estemed the rebuke of Christ greater ryches then the treasure of Egypt. For he had a respect vnto ye rewarde.
Hebrews,11,27,By fayth he forsoke Egypt and feared not the fearcenes of the kynge. For he endured even as he had sene him which is invisible.
Hebrews,11,28,Thorow fayth he ordeyned the ester lambe and the effusion of bloud lest he that destroyed the fyrst borne shuld touche them.
Hebrews,11,29,By fayth they passed thorow the reed see as by drye londe which when the Egypcians had assayed to do they were drouned.
Hebrews,11,30,By fayth the walles of Ierico fell doune after they were copased about seven dayes.
Hebrews,11,31,By fayth ye harlot Raab perisshed not with the vnbelevers whe she had receaved the spyes to lodgynge peaseably.
Hebrews,11,32,And what shall I more saye ye tyme wold be to short for me to tell of Gedeo of Barach and of Samson and of Iephthae: also of David and Samuel and of the Prophetes:
Hebrews,11,33,which thorowe fayth subdued kyngdomes wrought righteousnes obteyned the promyses stopped the mouthes of lyons
Hebrews,11,34,queched the violence of fyre escaped the edge of the swearde of weake were made stroge waxed valient in fight turned to flyght the armyes of the alientes.
Hebrews,11,35,And the wemen receaved their deed raysed to lyfe agayne. Other were racked and wolde not be delyvered that they myght receave a better resurreccion.
Hebrews,11,36,Other tasted of mockynges and scourginginges morover of bondes and presonmet:
Hebrews,11,37,were stoned were hewen a sunder were tepted were slayne with sweardes walked vppe and doune in shepes skynnes in gotes skynnes in nede tribulacio and vexacio
Hebrews,11,38,which ye worlde was not worthy of: they wadred in wildernes in moutaynes in dennes and caves of the erth.
Hebrews,11,39,And these all thorow fayth obtayned good reporte and receaved not the promes God provydinge a better thinge for vs that they with out vs shuld not be made parfecte.
Hebrews,11,40,
Hebrews,12,1,Wherfore let vs also (seynge that we are copased with so great a multitude of witnesses) laye awaye all that presseth doune and the synne that hageth on and let vs rune with paciece vnto the battayle yt is set before vs
Hebrews,12,2,lokynge vnto Iesus the auctor and fynnyssher of oure fayth which for the ioye that was set before him abode the crosse and despysed the shame and is set doune on the right honde of ye trone of God.
Hebrews,12,3,Consider therfore how that he endured suche speakinge agaynst him of synners lest ye shuld be weried and faynte in youre myndes.
Hebrews,12,4,For ye have not yet resisted vnto bloud sheddinge stryvinge agaynst synne.
Hebrews,12,5,And ye have forgotten the consolacion which speaketh vnto you as vnto chyldren: My sonne despyse not the chastenynge of the Lorde nether faynt when thou arte rebuked of him:
Hebrews,12,6,For whom the Lorde loveth him he chasteneth: yee and he scourgeth every sonne that he receaveth.
Hebrews,12,7,Yf ye endure chastninge God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes. What sonne is that whom the father chasteneth not?
Hebrews,12,8,If ye be not vnder correccio (where of all are part takers) then are ye bastardes and not sonnes.
Hebrews,12,9,Moreover seynge we had fathers of oure flesshe which corrected vs and we gave them reverence: shuld we not moche rather be in subieccion vnto the father of spretuall gyftes that we myght live?
Hebrews,12,10,And they verely for a feaue dayes nurtred vs after their awne pleasure: but he learneth vs vnto that which is proffitable that we myght receave of his holines.
Hebrews,12,11,No manner chastisynge for the present tyme semeth to be ioyeous but greveous: neverthelesse afterwarde it bryngeth the quyet frute of rightewesnes vnto them which are therin exercysed.
Hebrews,12,12,Stretch forthe therfore agayne the hondes which were let doune and the weake knees
Hebrews,12,13,and se that ye have strayght steppes vnto youre fete lest eny haltinge turne out of ye waye: yee let it rather be healed.
Hebrews,12,14,Embrace peace with all men and holynes: with out the which no man shall se the Lorde.
Hebrews,12,15,And looke to that no man be destitue of the grace of God and that no rote of bitternes springe vp and trouble and therby many be defiled:
Hebrews,12,16,and that there be no fornicator or vnclene person as Esau which for one breakfast solde his birthright.
Hebrews,12,17,Ye knowe how that afterwarde when he wolde have inherited the blessinge he was put by and he foude no meanes to come therby agayne: no though he desyred it with teares.
Hebrews,12,18,For ye are not come vnto the mounte that can be touched and vnto burninge fyre nor yet to myst and darcknes and tempest of wedder
Hebrews,12,19,nether vnto the sounde of a trope and the voyce of wordes: which voyce they that hearde it wisshed awaye that the comunicacion shuld not be spoken to them.
Hebrews,12,20,For they were not able to abyde that which was spoken. If a beast had touched the mountayne it must have bene stoned or thrust thorowe with a darte:
Hebrews,12,21,eve so terreble was ye sight which appered. Moses sayde I feare and quake.
Hebrews,12,22,But ye are come vnto the moute Sion and to the citie of the livinge god the celestiall Ierusalem: and to an innumerable sight of angels
Hebrews,12,23,and vnto the congregacion of ye fyrst borne sonnes which are writte in heven and to God the iudge of all and to the spretes of iust and parfecte men
Hebrews,12,24,and to Iesus the mediator of the newe testament and to the spryncklynge of bloud that speaketh better then the bloud of Abell.
Hebrews,12,25,Se that ye despise not him yt speaketh. For yf they escaped not which refused him that spake on erth: moche more shall we not escape yf we turne awaye fro him yt speaketh fro heve:
Hebrews,12,26,whose voyce the shouke the erth and now declareth sayinge: yet once more will I shake not the erth only but also heven.
Hebrews,12,27,No dout yt same that he sayth yet once more signifieth the removinge a waye of those thinges which are shaken as of thinges which have ended their course: that the thynges which are not shaken maye remayne.
Hebrews,12,28,Wherfore if we receave a kyngdom which is not moved we have grace wherby we maye serve god and please him with reverence and godly feare.
Hebrews,12,29,For oure god is a consumynge fyre.
Hebrews,13,1,Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews,13,2,Be not forgetfull to lodge straungers. For therby have dyvers receaved angels into their houses vnwares.
Hebrews,13,3,Remember them that are in bondes even as though ye were bounde with them. Be myndfull of them which are in adversitie as ye which are yet in youre bodies.
Hebrews,13,4,Let wedlocke be had in pryce in all poyntes and let the chamber be vndefiled: for whore kepers and advoutrars god will iudge.
Hebrews,13,5,Let youre conversacion be with out coveteousnes and be contet with that ye have all redy. For he verely sayd: I will not fayle the nether forsake the:
Hebrews,13,6,that we maye boldly saye: the lorde is my helper and I will not feare what man doeth vnto me.
Hebrews,13,7,Remember them which have the oversight of you which have declared vnto you the worde of god. The ende of whose conversacion se that ye looke vpon and folowe their fayth.
Hebrews,13,8,Iesus Christ yesterdaye and to daye and the same continueth for ever.
