### Matthew

[1:1] Geslachtboek van Jezus Christus, den zoon van David, den zoon van Abraham.
[1:2] Abraham gewon Isaäk, en Isaäk gewon Jakob, en Jakob gewon Juda en zijn broeders.
[1:3] Juda gewon Phares en Zara bij Thamar, en Phares gewon Esron, en Esron gewon Aram.
[1:4] En Aram gewon Aminadab, en Aminadab gewon Naässon, en Naässon gewon Salmon.
[1:5] En Salmon gewon Boas bij Rachab, en Boas gewon Obed bij Rutli, en Obed gewon Jesse.
[1:6] En Jesse gewon David, den koning. David nu gewon Salomo bij de vrouw van Uria.
[1:7] En Salomo gewon Rehabeam, en Rehabeam gewon Abia, en Abia gewon Asa.
[1:8] En Asa gewon Josafat, en Josafat gewon Joram, en Joram gewon Ozias.
[1:9] En Ozias gewon Joatham, en Joatham gewon Achaz, en Achaz gewon Hiskia.
[1:10] En Hiskia gewon Manasse, en Manasse gewon Amon, en Amon gewon Josias.
[1:11] En Josias gewon Jechonias en zijn broeders, ten tijde der wegvoering naar Babylon.
[1:12] En na de wegvoering naar Babyion, gewon Jechonias Salathiël, en Salathiël gewon Zorobabel.
[1:13] En Zorobabel gewon Abiud, en Abiud gewon Eliakim, en Eliakim gewon Azor.
[1:14] En Azor gewon Sadok, en Sadok gewon Achim, en Achim gewon Eliud.
[1:15] En Eliud gewon Eleazar, en Eleazar gewon Mathan, en Mathan gewon Jakob.
[1:16] En Jakob gewon Jozef, den man van Maria, uit wie geboren is Jezus, genaamd Christus.
[1:17] Al de geslachten dus van Abraham tot David zijn veertien geslachten; en van David tot de wegvoering naar Babylon, veertien geslachten; en van de wegvoering naar Babylon tot Christus, veertien geslachten. 
[1:18]  De geboorte van Jezus Christus nu was aldus. Terwijl zijn moeder Maria ondertrouwd was met Jozef, werd zij zwanger bevonden uit den Heiligen Geest, éér zij samengekomen waren.
[1:19] Jozef nu, haar man, die rechtvaardig was en haar niet wilde te schande maken, was van zin haar heimelijk te verlaten.
[1:20] Maar ziet, toen hij dit in den zin had, verscheen een engel des Heeren hem in een droom, zeggende: Jozef, zoon van David! Vrees niet Maria uw vrouw tot u te nemen, want hetgeen in haar is verwekt, is uit den Heiligen Geest;
[1:21] En zij zal een zoon baren, en gij zult zijn naam Jezus noemen, want Hij zal zijn volk verlossen van hun zonden.
[1:22] Dit alles nu is geschied, opdat zou vervuld worden hetgeen de Heere gesproken heeft door den profeet, die zegt:
[1:23] Ziet, de maagd zal zwanger worden en een zoon baren en men zal zijn naam Emmanuël noemen, dat is overgezet: God met ons.
[1:24] En Jozef uit den slaap ontwaakt zijnde, deed gelijk de engel des Heeren hem geboden had, en nam zijn vrouw tot zich.
[1:25] En hij bekende haar niet, totdat zij haar eerstgeboren zoon gebaard had. En hij noemde zijn naam Jezus.  
[2:1] Toen nu Jezus geboren was te Bethlehem in Judea, in de dagen van den koning Herodes, ziet, daar kwamen wijzen uit het Oosten naar Jerusalem,
[2:2] zeggende: Waar is de koning der Joden, die geboren is? want wij hebben zijn ster in het opgaan gezien, en zijn gekomen om Hem te aanbidden.
[2:3] De koning Herodes nu, dit hoorende, werd ontroerd en geheel Jerusalem met hem.
[2:4] En al de overpriesters en schriftgeleerden des volks samengeroepen hebbende, vroeg hij aan dezen waar de Christus zou worden geboren.
[2:5] En zij zeiden tot hem: Te Bethlehem in Judea, want zoo is er geschreven door den profeet:
[2:6] Gij Bethlehem, land van Juda, zijt geenszins de minste onder de prinsen van Juda; uit u toch zal een Vorst voortkomen, die mijn volk Israël zal besturen.
[2:7] Toen riep Herodes de wijzen in ‘t geheim en vroeg hun nauwkeurig naar den tijd dat de ster hun verschenen was.
[2:8] En hij zond hen naar Bethlehem en zeide: Gaat heen en doet nauwkeurig onderzoek naar het kind, en als gij het gevonden hebt, boodschapt het mij dan, opdat ik ook kome en het aanbidde.
[2:9] Zij nu den koning gehoord hebbende, reisden heen. En ziet, de ster die zij in het opgaan gezien hadden, ging hun voor, totdat zij kwam en stilstond boven de plaats waar het kind was.
[2:10] Toen zij nu de ster zagen, verheugden zij zich met zeer groote vreugde.
[2:11] En in het huis gekomen zijnde, zagen zij het kind met Maria, zijn moeder; en nedervallende, aanbaden zij het. En zij openden hun schatten en brachten het geschenken, goud, en wierook en mirre.
[2:12] En nadat zij in een droom van Godswege vermaand waren om niet weder te keeren naar Herodes, vertrokken zij langs een anderen weg terug naar hun land. 
[2:13]  Toen zij nu vertrokken waren, ziet, een engel des Heeren verscheen in een droom aan Jozef, zeggende: Sta op, neem het kind en zijn moeder mede, en vlucht naar Egypte, en blijf daar totdat Ik het u zal zeggen; want Herodes zal het kind zoeken, om het te dooden.
[2:14] En hij stond op en nam des nachts het kind en zijn moeder mede en vertrok naar Egypte.
[2:15] En hij was daar tot den dood van Herodes; opdat vervuld zou worden hetgeen de Heere gesproken heeft door den profeet, die zegt: Uit Egypte heb Ik mijn Zoon geroepen. 
[2:16]  Toen Herodes dan zag dat hij door de wijzen bedrogen was, werd hij zeer toornig; en hij zond heen en vermoordde al de kinderen te Bethlehem en in geheel de omliggende landstreek, die twee jaar oud waren en daarbeneden, naar den tijd dien hij van de wijzen nauwkeurig onderzocht had.
[2:17] Toen is vervuld het woord dat door den profeet Jeremia is gesproken:
[2:18] Een stem is in Rama gehoord, geklag, geween en veel gejammer. Rachel beweent haar kinderen en wil niet vertroost worden, want zij zijn niet meer. 
[2:19]  Toen nu Herodes gestorven was, ziet, een engel des Heeren verscheen in een droom aan Jozef in Egypte,
[2:20] zeggende: Sta op, neem het kind en zijn moeder mede, en ga naar het land Israëls; want die de ziel van het kind zochten, zijn gestorven.
[2:21] En hij stond op en nam het kind en zijn moeder mede, en kwam naar het land Israëls.
[2:22] Maar toen hij hoorde dat Archelaüs over Judea regeerde in de plaats van zijn vader Herodes, vreesde hij daarheen te gaan; maar van Godswege in een droom vermaand zijnde, vertrok hij naar de landstreek van Galilea.
[2:23] En hij ging wonen in een stad genaamd Nazaret; opdat zou vervuld worden hetgeen door de profeten is gesproken, dat Hij Nazarener zou genaamd worden.  
[3:1] In die dagen nu kwam Johannes de Dooper, en hij predikte in de woestijn van Judea,
[3:2] zeggende: Doet boetvaardigheid want het koninkrijk der hemelen is nabij!
[3:3] Deze is het van wien gesproken is door Jesaja, den profeet, die zegt: De stem des roependen: bereidt in de woestijn den weg des Heeren, maakt zijn paden recht!
[3:4] Deze Johannes nu had zijn kleed van kemelshaar, en een lederen gordel om zijn lenden; en zijn voedsel was sprinkhanen en wilde honig.
[3:5] Toen ging tot hem uit Jerusalem, en geheel Judea, en de geheele omstreek van den Jordaan.
[3:6] En zij werden door hem gedoopt in den Jordaan, belijdende hun zonden.
[3:7] Maar velen van de fariseërs en sadduceërs tot den doop ziende komen, zeide hij tot hen: Gij adderen–gebroed, wie heeft u aangewezen te vlieden den toekomenden toorn?
[3:8] Brengt dan vrucht voort der boetvaardigheid waardig!
[3:9] En schijnt toch niet bij u zelven te zeggen: Wij hebben Abraham tot vader! want ik zeg ulieden dat God uit deze steenen aan Abraham kinderen kan verwekken.
[3:10] De bijl ligt reeds aan den wortel der boomen; iedere boom dus, die geen goede vruchten voortbrengt, wordt omgehouwen en in het vuur geworpen.
[3:11] Ik doop u wel met water tot boetvaardigheid, maar die na mij komt is machtiger dan ik, wien ik niet waardig ben de schoenen na te dragen; die zal u doopen met den Heiligen Geest en met vuur.
[3:12] Zijn wan is in zijn hand en Hij zal zijn dorschvloer geheel zuiveren en zijn koren verzamelen in de schuur; maar het kaf zal Hij verbranden met onuitbluschbaar vuur. 
[3:13]  Toen kwam Jezus van Galilea naar den Jordaan tot Johannes om van hem gedoopt te worden.
[3:14] Maar Johannes weigerde het Hem, zeggende: Mij is noodig om door U gedoopt te worden, en Gij komt tot mij?
[3:15] Maar Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Houd nu op, want alzoo betaamt het ons alle rechtvaardigheid te volbrengen! Toen zweeg Johannes.
[3:16] En toen Jezus gedoopt was, kwam Hij terstond op uit het water, en ziet, de hemelen werden geopend en hij zag den Geest Gods nederdalen zooals een duive, en op Hem komen.
[3:17] En ziet, een stem uit de hemelen zeide: Deze is mijn Zoon, de Beminde, in wien Ik welbehagen heb.  
[4:1] Toen werd Jezus naar de woestijn gevoerd door den Geest, om door den duivel bekoord te worden.
[4:2] En als Hij veertig dagen en veertig nachten lang gevast had, kreeg Hij ten laatste honger.
[4:3] En de bekoorder kwam tot Hem en zeide: Indien Gij Gods Zoon zijt, zeg dan dat deze steenen brooden worden.
[4:4] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide: Er staat geschreven: Niet van brood alleen zal de mensch leven, maar van alle woord dat Gods mond uitgaat.
[4:5] Toen bracht Hem de duivel naar de heilige stad en plaatste Hem op het dak des tempels,
[4:6] en zeide tot Hem: Als Gij Gods Zoon zijt, werp U dan naar beneden, want er staat geschreven: Hij zal zijn engelen aangaande U bevel geven en zij zullen U dragen op de handen, opdat Gij uw voet aan geen steen stoot.
[4:7] Jezus zeide tot hem: Er staat wederom geschreven: Gij zult den Heere, uw God, niet op de proef stellen.
[4:8] Wederom nam de duivel Hem mede naar een zeer hoogen berg en toonde Hem al de koninkrijken der wereld en hun glorie,
[4:9] en zeide tot Hem: Dit alles zal ik U geven, zoo Gij nedervalt en mij aanbidt.
[4:10] Toen zeide Jezus tot hem: Ga weg Satan! want er staat geschreven: Den Heere uw God, zult gij aanbidden en Hem alleen zult gij dienen.
[4:11] Toen verliet de duivel Hem, en ziet er kwamen engelen en zij dienden Hem. 
[4:12]  Nadat Jezus nu gehoord had dat Johannes was gevangen genomen, vertrok Hij naar Galilea.
[4:13] En Nazaret verlatende, kwam Hij wonen te Kapernaüm, dat bij de zee lag, in het gebied van Zebulon en Nephtalim.
[4:14] Opdat zou vervuld worden hetgeen door Jesaja, den profeet, is gezegd:
[4:15] Het land Zebulon en Nephtalim, aan den weg der zee, over den Jordaan, Galilea der volken;
[4:16] het volk dat in duisternis zit, ziet een groot licht, en over hen die zitten in een land en schaduw des doods, gaat een licht op.
[4:17] Van toen af begon Jezus te prediken en te zeggen: Doet boetvaardigheid, want het koninkrijk der hemelen is nabij. 
[4:18]  En wandelende langs de zee van Galilea, zag Jezus twee broeders, Simon, die Petrus genaamd wordt, en Andreas, zijn broeder, die bezig waren met hun netten in zee te werpen, want zij waren visschers.
[4:19] En Hij zeide tot hen: Komt achter Mij, en Ik zal u visschers van menschen maken.
[4:20] Toen verlieten zij terstond de netten en volgden Hem.
[4:21] En vandaar voortgaande, zag Hij twee andere broeders, Jakobus, den zoon van Zebedeüs, en Johannes, zijn broeder, die in het schip met hun vader Zebedeüs bezig waren hun netten te verstellen; en Hij riep hen.
[4:22] En zij verlieten terstond het schip en hun vader en volgden Hem. 
[4:23]  En Jezus ging door geheel Galilea, leerende in hun synagogen en predikende het Evangelie des koninkrijks; en Hij genas alle ziekten en alle kwalen onder het volk.
[4:24] En het gerucht van Hem liep door geheel Syrië; en men bracht tot Hem al de zieken, die bevangen waren van allerlei kwalen en pijnen, en bezetenen door booze geesten, en maanzieken, en verlamden, en Hij genas hen.
[4:25] En vele scharen volgden Hem van Galilea, en Dekapolis, en Jerusalem, en Judea, en van over den Jordaan.  
[5:1] Toen Jezus nu de scharen zag, klom Hij op een berg, en als Hij gezeten was, kwamen zijn discipelen tot Hem.
[5:2] En Hij opende zijn mond en leerde hen, zeggende:
[5:3] Zalig de armen van geest, want hunner is het koninkrijk der hemelen.
[5:4] Zalig de zachtmoedigen, want zij zullen de aarde bezitten.
[5:5] Zalig die treuren, want zij zullen vertroost worden.
[5:6] Zalig die honger en dorst hebben naar de rechtvaardigheid, want zij zullen verzadigd worden.
[5:7] Zalig de barmhartigen, want hun zal barmhartigheid geschieden.
[5:8] Zalig de reinen van hart, want zij zullen God zien.
[5:9] Zalig de vredelievenden, want zij zullen kinderen Gods genoemd worden.
[5:10] Zalig de vervolgden om de rechtvaardigheid, want hunner is het koninkrijk der hemelen.
[5:11] Zalig zijt gij als men u smaadt en vervolgt en al liegende allerlei kwaad tegen u spreekt om Mijnentwil.
[5:12] Verheugt u en zijt blijde, want uw loon in de hemelen is groot; want evenzoo heeft men de profeten vervolgd die vóór u zijn geweest.
[5:13] Het zout der aarde zijt gij; als het zout zijn kracht verliest, waarmede zal het dan gezouten worden? Tot niets anders deugt het dan meer, dan om buiten geworpen en door de menschen vertrapt te worden.
[5:14] Het licht der wereld zijt gij; een stad, boven op een berg gelegen, kan niet verborgen zijn.
[5:15] Ook steekt men geen lamp aan om die onder een korenvat te zetten, maar op een kandelaar, en dan geeft zij licht aan allen die in huis zijn.
[5:16] Laat uw licht alzoo schijnen voor de menschen, opdat zij uw goede werken mogen zien en uw Vader die in de hemelen is, de glorie geven.
[5:17] Meent niet dat Ik ben gekomen om de wet of de profeten krachteloos te maken; Ik ben niet gekomen om ze van kracht te berooven, maar om ze te vervullen.
[5:18] Want voorwaar Ik zeg u: totdat de hemel en de aarde zullen voorbijgegaan zijn, zal er niet één letter of stipken van de wet voorbijgaan, totdat alles geschied is.
[5:19] Wie dan een van de minste geboden krachteloos maakt en de menschen alzoo leert, die zal de minste worden genaamd in het koninkrijk der hemelen; maar wie ze zal houden en leeren, die zal groot genaamd worden in het koninkrijk der hemelen.
[5:20] Want Ik zeg u, wanneer uw rechtvaardigheid niet overvloediger is dan die der schriftgeleerden en der fariseërs, dat gij het koninkrijk der hemelen niet zult binnengaan.
[5:21] Gij hebt gehoord dat tot de ouden gezegd is: Gij zult niet doodslaan, en: Wie doodslaat is schuldig voor het gericht.
[5:22] Maar Ik zeg u dat een ieder die ten onrechte toornig is op zijn broeder, schuldig zal zijn voor het gericht; maar wie zegt tot zijn broeder: Raka! die zal schuldig zijn voor den Raad; en wie zegt: Gij dwaas! die zal schuldig zijn tot het helsche vuur.
[5:23] Wanneer gij dan uw gave brengt op den altaar en gij u daar herinnert dat uw broeder iets tegen u heeft,
[5:24] laat dan uw gave daar vóór den altaar, en ga heen, verzoen u eerst met uw broeder, en kom dan en offer uw gave.
[5:25] Zijt terstond welgezind jegens uw tegenpartij, terwijl gij nog met hem op den weg zijt, opdat de tegenpartij u niet overlevere aan den rechter, en de rechter aan den dienaar, en gij in de gevangenis wordt geworpen.
[5:26] Voorwaar Ik zeg u, dat gij geenszins daaruit zult komen, vóórdat gij den laatsten penning zult betaald hebben.
[5:27] Gij hebt gehoord dat gezegd is: Gij zult geen overspel doen.
[5:28] Maar lk zeg u dat al wie een vrouw aanziet om haar te begeeren, reeds overspel in zijn hart met haar heeft gedaan.
[5:29] En indien uw rechteroog u ergert, trek het uit en werp het van u weg; want het is beter voor u dat één uwer leden verderft, dan dat geheel uw lichaam in de hel zou geworpen worden.
[5:30] En indien uw rechterhand u ergert, snijd ze af en werp ze van u weg; want het is beter voor u dat één uwer leden verderft, dan dat geheel uw lichaam naar de hel zou gaan.
[5:31] Er is ook gezegd: Wie zijn vrouw verlaat, die geve haar een scheidbrief.
[5:32] Maar Ik zeg u dat al wie zijn vrouw verlaat, anders dan om hoererij, die maakt dat zij overspel doet; en wie de verlatene trouwt, die doet overspel.
[5:33] Wederom hebt gij gehoord dat er tot de ouden gezegd is: Gij zult geen valschen eed doen, maar gij zult den Heere uw eeden volbrengen.
[5:34] Maar Ik zeg u: Zweert in ‘t geheel niet; noch bij den hemel, want die is Gods troon; 
[5:35] noch bij de aarde, want deze is de voetbank zijner voeten; noch bij Jerusalem, want het is de stad van den grooten Koning; 
[5:36] ook bij uw hoofd zult gij niet zweren, want gij kunt niet één haar wit of zwart maken.
[5:37] Uw woord: Ja, zij ja; uw neen, zij neen; want wat, daarboven is, dat is uit den booze.
[5:38] Gij hebt gehoord dat er gezegd is: oog om oog en tand om tand.
[5:39] Maar Ik zeg u dat gij den kwade niet moogt wederstaan, maar aan al wie u op de rechterwang slaat, moet gij de andere toekeeren; 
[5:40] en aan hem die met u voor het gericht wil gaan en uw kleed nemen, moet gij ook uw mantel laten; 
[5:41] en die u dwingt voor één mijl, ga met hem twee mijlen.
[5:42] Geef aan wie van u vraagt, en wend u niet af van hem die van u wil leenen.
[5:43] Gij hebt gehoord dat er gezegd is: Gij zult uw naaste liefhebben en uw vijand haten.
[5:44] Maar Ik zeg ulieden: Hebt uw vijanden lief; zegent ze die u vervloeken; doet wel aan hen die u haten, en bidt voor hen die u smadelijk behandelen en u vervolgen,
[5:45] opdat gij kinderen moogt zijn van uw Vader, die in de hemelen is; want die doet zijn zon opgaan over boozen en goeden, en regent over rechtvaardigen en onrecht vaardigen.
[5:46] Want als gij liefhebt die u liefhebben, welk loon hebt gij? Doen ook niet de tollenaars alzoo?
[5:47] En als gij uw broeders alleen groet, wat doet gij dan boven anderen? Doen ook niet de heidenen alzoo?
[5:48] Daarom weest gijlieden volmaakt, gelijk uw hemelsche Vader volmaakt is.  
[6:1] Ziet toe, dat gij uw rechtvaardigheid niet doet voor de menschen om door hen gezien te worden, want anders hebt gij geen loon bij uw Vader, die in de hemelen is.
[6:2] Wanneer gij dan een aalmoes geeft, bazuin het niet uit, gelijk de geveinsden doen in de synagogen en op de straten, om door de menschen geëerd te worden; voorwaar Ik zeg u, zij hebben hun loon weg.
[6:3] Maar als gij een almoes geeft, laat dan uw linkerhand niet weten wat uw rechterhand doet; 
[6:4] opdat uw aalmoes in het verborgen zij, en uw Vader die in het verborgen ziet, zal het u in het openbaar vergelden.
[6:5] En wanneer gij bidt, zijt dan niet gelijk de geveinsden, want die bidden gaarne, staande in de synagogen en op de hoeken der straten, opdat zij door de menschen gezien zouden worden. Voorwaar Ik zeg u, zij hebben hun loon weg.
[6:6] Maar gij, als gij bidt, ga dan in uw binnenkamer en sluit uw deur om te bidden tot uw Vader die in het verborgen is; en uw Vader die in het verborgen ziet, zal het u vergelden.
[6:7] En als gij bidt, dan moet gij niet klappen gelijk de heidenen, want die meenen dat zij verhoord zullen worden om de veelheid hunner woorden.
[6:8] Weest dan aan dezen niet gelijk, want uw Vader weet wat gij noodig hebt éér dat gij tot Hem bidt.
[6:9] Bidt gijlieden dan aldus: Onze Vader, die in de hemelen zijt, geheiligd zij uw Naam!
[6:10] Uw koninkrijk kome! Uw wil geschiede, gelijk in den hemel, alzoo ook op aarde.
[6:11] Geef ons heden ons dagelijksch brood!
[6:12] En vergeef ons onze schulden, gelijk ook wij vergeven aan onze schuldenaren!
[6:13] En leid ons niet in bekoring, maar verlos ons van den kwade! Want uw is het koninkrijk, en de kracht, en de glorie in der eeuwigheid. Amen.
[6:14] Want als gij den menschen hun overtredingen vergeeft, dan zal ook uw hemelsche Vader ulieden vergeven.
[6:15] Maar indien gij den menschen niet vergeeft, dan zal ook uw Vader uw overtredingen niet vergeven.
[6:16] En wanneer gij vast, zijt dan niet droevig van aangezicht gelijk de geveinsden; want die misvormen hun aangezicht opdat de menschen zouden zien dat zij vasten; voorwaar Ik zeg u, dat zij hun loon weg hebben.
[6:17] Maar gij, als gij vast, zalf dan uw hoofd en wasch uw aangezicht; 
[6:18] opdat de menschen het niet zien dat gij vast, maar uw Vader die in het verborgen is; en uw Vader die in het verborgen ziet, zal het u vergelden.
[6:19] Verzamelt voor u geen schatten op aarde, waar mot en roest ze verderft, en waar dieven inbreken en stelen.
[6:20] Maar verzamelt u schatten in den hemel, waar geen mot of roest ze verderft, en waar geen dieven inbreken en stelen.
[6:21] Want waar uw schat is, daar zal ook uw hart zijn.
[6:22] De lamp van het lichaam is het oog. Als uw oog helder is, dan zal geheel uw lichaam verlicht zijn.
[6:23] Maar als uw oog kwaad is, dan zal geheel uw lichaam duister zijn. Wanneer nu het licht dat in u is, duisternis is, hoe groot zal dan de duisternis zelve wel zijn!
[6:24] Niemand kan twee heeren dienen; want hij zal den eenen haten en den anderen beminnen, of den eenen aanhangen en den anderen verachten. Gij kunt niet God dienen en tegelijk den rijkdom.
[6:25] Daarom zeg Ik u, zijt niet bekommerd voor uw leven, wat gij eten zult en wat gij drinken zult; noch voor uw lichaam, waarmede gij u kleeden zult. Is niet het leven meer dan het voedsel, en het lichaam meer dan de kleeding?
[6:26] Ziet op de vogelen des hemels, dat ze niet zaaien, of maaien, of in schuren verzamelen, en uw hemelsche Vader voedt ze; gaat gij hen niet verre te boven?
[6:27] Wie van u kan door bekommerd te zijn één oogenblik tot zijn leeftijd toedoen?
[6:28] En wat zijt gij bekommerd over uw kleeding? Let op de leliën des velds, hoe zij groeien; zij arbeiden niet, ook spinnen ze niet.
[6:29] En Ik zeg u dat zelfs Salomo in al zijn glorie niet gekleed was gelijk een van dezen.
[6:30] Indien dan God het gras des velds, dat er vandaag is en morgen in den oven wordt geworpen, alzoo kleedt, zal Hij u dan niet veel meer kleeden, o kleingeloovigen?
[6:31] Zijt dan niet bekommerd, zeggende: Wat zullen wij eten, of wat zullen wij drinken, of waarmede zullen wij ons kleeden?
[6:32] Want al die dingen zoeken de heidenen; want uw hemelsche Vader weet dat gij dit alles noodig hebt.
[6:33] Maar zoekt eerst Gods koninkrijk en zijn rechtvaardigheid, en dat alles zal er u bijgevoegd worden.
[6:34] Zijt dan niet bekommerd tegen den dag van morgen; want de dag van morgen zal zijn eigen zorgen hebben; elke dag heeft genoeg aan zijn eigen kwaad.  
[7:1] Oordeelt niet, opdat gij niet geoordeeld wordt.
[7:2] Want met het oordeel waarmede gij oordeelt, zult gij geoordeeld worden, en met de maat waarmede gij meet, zal u gemeten worden.
[7:3] En wat ziet gij den splinter die in het oog van uw broeder is, en gij bemerkt den balk niet die in uw eigen oog is?
[7:4] Of hoe zult gij tot uw broeder zeggen: Laat mij den splinter uit uw oog trekken, en zie, er is een balk in uw eigen oog?
[7:5] Geveinsde, haal eerst uit uw eigen oog den balk, en tracht dan den splinter te trekken uit uws broeders oog.
[7:6] Geeft het heilige niet aan de honden, en werpt uw paarlen niet voor de varkens; opdat zij die misschien niet vertrappen met hun pooten, en zich omkeerende, u verscheuren.
[7:7] Bidt, en u zal gegeven worden; zoekt, en gij zult vinden; klopt, èn u zal opengedaan worden.
[7:8] Want al wie bidt, die ontvangt, en wie zoekt, die vindt, en wie klopt, hem zal opengedaan worden.
[7:9] Of welk mensch is er onder u, wiens zoon hem vraagt om brood, die hem een steen zal geven?
[7:10] Of als hij om een visch vraagt, die hem een slang zal geven?
[7:11] Indien dan gij, die boos zijt, aan uw kinderen goede gaven weet te geven, hoeveel te meer zal uw Vader, die in de hemelen is, goede gaven geven aan hen die Hem bidden?
[7:12] Alles dan wat gij wilt dat de menschen u zullen doen, doet gij hun ook alzoo; want dit is de wet en de profeten.
[7:13] Gaat in door de enge poort; want de poort is wijd en de weg is breed, die naar het verderf leidt, en velen zijn er die daar door ingaan.
[7:14] Want eng is de poort en smal is de weg die naar het leven leidt en weinigen zijn er die hem vinden.
[7:15] Wacht u voor de valsche profeten, die tot u komen in schaapskleederen, maar van binnen zijn zij roofgierige wolven.
[7:16] Aan hun vruchten zult gij hen kennen. Men plukt toch van doornen geen druiven, of van distelen geen vijgen?
[7:17] Zoo brengt iedere goede boom goede vruchten voort, maar de slechte boom brengt slechte vruchten voort.
[7:18] Een goede boom kan geen slechte vruchten voortbrengen, en een slechte boom kan geen goede vruchten voortbrengen.
[7:19] Iedere boom, die geen goede vruchten voortbrengt, wordt omgehouwen en in het vuur geworpen.
[7:20] Aan hun vruchten dus zult gij ze kennen.
[7:21] Niet een ieder die tot Mij zegt: Heere, Heere! zal het koninkrijk der hemelen ingaan, maar die den wil doet van mijn Vader, die in de hemelen is,
[7:22] Velen zullen in dien dag tot Mij zeggen: Heere, Heere! hebben we niet in uw Naam geprofeteerd, en in uw Naam booze geesten uitgeworpen, en in uw Naam vele krachten gedaan?
[7:23] En dan zal Ik hun verklaren: Ik heb u nooit gekend; gaat van Mij weg, gij die de onrechtvaardigheid werkt!
[7:24] Een ieder dan die deze mijn woorden hoort en ze doet, zal Ik vergelijken bij een wijs man, die zijn huis bouwde op de rots.
[7:25] En de regen sloeg neder, en de stortvloeden kwamen en de winden bliezen en sloegen tegen dat huis aan, en het is niet gevallen, want het was gegrond op de rots.
[7:26] En een ieder die deze mijn woorden hoort en ze niet doet, zal Ik vergelijken bij een dwaas man, die zijn huis bouwde op het zand.
[7:27] En de regen sloeg neder, en de stortvloeden kwamen en de winden bliezen en sloegen tegen dat huis aan; en het is gevallen, en zijn val was groot. 
[7:28]  En het geschiedde toen Jezus deze reden had geëindigd, dat de scharen verslagen stonden over zijn leer;
[7:29] want Hij leerde hen als machthebbende, en niet zooals hun schriftgeleerden.  
[8:1] Toen Jezus nu van den berg was afgekomen, zijn Hem vele scharen gevolgd.
[8:2] En ziet, een melaatsche kwam en viel voor Hem neder, zeggende: Heere, zoo Gij wilt, Gij kunt mij zuiveren!
[8:3] En de hand uitstrekkende, raakte Hij hem aan, zeggende: Ik wil, word gezuiverd! En terstond werd zijn melaatschheid gezuiverd.
[8:4] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Zie toe, dat gij het aan niemand zegt; maar ga heen, vertoon u zelven aan den priester en offer de gave die Mozes heeft geboden, hun tot een getuigenis. 
[8:5]  En toen Hij in Kapernaüm was gekomen, kwam tot Hem een hoofdman die hem bad,
[8:6] en tot Hem zeide: Heere, mijn knecht ligt tehuis verlamd en hij lijdt vreeselijk.
[8:7] En Hij zeide tot hem: Ik zal komen en hem genezen.
[8:8] Maar de hoofdman antwoordde en zeide: Heere, ik ben niet waardig dat Gij onder mijn dak komt; maar zeg het maar met een woord, en mijn knecht zal genezen.
[8:9] Want ook ik ben een mensch die onder anderen sta, en heb onder mij krijgslieden. En ik zeg tot den een: Ga weg! en dan gaat hij; en tot den ander: Kom hier! en dan komt hij: en tot mijn dienstknecht: Doe dit! en dan doet hij het.
[8:10] Als Jezus nu dit hoorde, verwonderde Hij zich en zeide tot hen die Hem volgden: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, zelfs in Israël heb Ik zoo groot een geloof niet gevonden!
[8:11] En Ik zeg ulieden dat velen van oost en west zullen komen, en aanliggen met Abraham en Isaäk en Jakob in het koninkrijk der hemelen; 
[8:12] maar de kinderen des koninkrijks zullen worden uitgeworpen in de dikste duisternis; daar zal het geween zijn en het tandengeknars.
[8:13] En Jezus zeide tot den hoofdman: Ga heen; en gelijk gij geloofd hebt, geschiede u! En zijn knecht werd genezen in dezelfde ure. 
[8:14]  En toen Jezus in het huis van Petrus kwam, zag Hij diens schoonmoeder met de koorts liggen.
[8:15] En Hij greep haar hand en de koorts verliet haar; en zij stond op en diende Hem.
[8:16] En toen het avond was geworden, bracht men velen die van booze geesten bezeten waren, tot Hem; en Hij wierp de geesten uit door een woord; en genas allen die ziek waren.
[8:17] Opdat vervuld zou worden wat door Jesaja, den profeet, is gezegd: Hij heeft onze krankheden op zich genomen en onze ziekten gedragen. 
[8:18]  Toen nu Jezus vele scharen rondom zich zag, beval Hij naar de overzijde te varen.
[8:19] En er kwam een schriftgeleerde tot Hem, die tot Hem zeide: Meester, ik zal U volgen, waar Gij ook heengaat!
[8:20] En Jezus zeide tot hem: De vossen hebben holen en de vogelen des hemels nesten, maar de Zoon des menschen heeft niets waarop Hij het hoofd nederlegge.
[8:21] Doch een ander van de discipelen zeide tot Hem: Heere, laat mij toe eerst heen te gaan om mijn vader te begraven.
[8:22] Maar Hij zeide tot hem: Volg mij na en laat de dooden hun dooden begraven. 
[8:23]  En als Hij in het schip gegaan was, zijn Hem zijn discipelen gevolgd.
[8:24] En ziet er kwam eer groote storm op zee, zoodat het schip door de golven bedekt werd; maar Hij sliep.
[8:25] En tot Hem komende, maakten zij Hem wakker, zeggende: Heere, help! wij vergaan.
[8:26] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wat zijt gij bevreesd, gij kleingeloovigen! Toen stond Hij op en bestrafte de winden en de zee, en er kwam een groote stilte.
[8:27] Doch de menschen verwonderden zich, zeggende: Hoedanig is deze, dat zelfs de winden en de zee Hem gehoorzamen? 
[8:28]  En toen Hij aan de overzijde kwam, in het land der Gadarenen, kwamen Hem twee door booze geesten bezetenen te gemoet, die uit de grafsteden kwamen en zeer ruw waren, zoodat niemand langs dien weg kon voorbijgaan.
[8:29] En ziet, zij schreeuwden, zeggende: Wat hebben wij met U te doen, Gij Jezus, Zoon van God? Zijt Gij hier gekomen om vóór den tijd ons te pijnigen?
[8:30] En er was ver van hen een kudde varkens weidende.
[8:31] En de booze geesten baden Hem, zeggende: Indien Gij ons uitwerpt, laat ons dan naar de kudde varkens gaan.
[8:32] En Hij zeide tot hen: Gaat heen! En zij gingen uit naar de varkens, en ziet, geheel de kudde stortte van de steilte af in de zee, en zij stierven in het water.
[8:33] En die ze geweid hadden vluchtten, en kwamen in de stad, en boodschapten alles, ook wat met de bezetenen geschied was.
[8:34] En ziet, de geheele stad ging uit, Jezus te gemoet; en als zij Hem zagen, baden zij Hem van hun grenzen weg te gaan.  
[9:1] En in het schip gegaan zijnde, voer Jezus over en kwam in zijn eigen stad.
[9:2] En ziet, zij brachten tot Hem een lamme, die op een bed lag. En Jezus hun geloof ziende, zeide tot den lamme: Zoon, heb goeden moed, uw zonden zijn vergeven.
[9:3] En ziet, sommigen der schriftgeleerden zeiden bij zich zelven: Deze lastert!
[9:4] En Jezus hun gedachten ziende, zeide: Waarom denkt gij kwaad in uw harten?
[9:5] Want wat is gemakkelijker? te zeggen: Uw zonden zijn vergeven, of te zeggen: Sta op en wandel?
[9:6] Maar opdat gij weten moogt dat de Zoon des menschen macht heeft, op de aarde zonden te vergeven, — toen zeide Hij tot den lamme: Sta op, neem uw bed op en ga heen naar uw huis.
[9:7] En opstaande, ging hij heen naar zijn huis.
[9:8] Doch de scharen, dit ziende, werden bevreesd, en zij gaven God de glorie, die zulk een macht aan de menschen had gegeven. 
[9:9]  En Jezus, vandaar heengaande, zag een mensch zitten bij het tolhuis, Mattheüs genaamd, en Hij zeide tot hem: Volg Mij na! En hij stond op en volgde Hem.
[9:10] En het geschiedde toen Hij in het huis aanlag, dat vele tollenaren en zondaren kwamen en mede aanlagen met Jezus en zijn discipelen.
[9:11] En de fariseërs, dit ziende, zeiden tot zijn discipelen: Waarom eet uw Meester met de tollenaren en zondaren?
[9:12] Maar Jezus hoorde dit en zeide: Niet de gezonden hebben een geneesmeester noodig, maar de zieken.
[9:13] Maar gaat heen en leert wat het is: Barmhartigheid wil Ik en niet een offerande. Want Ik ben niet gekomen om rechtvaardigen te roepen maar zondaars. 
[9:14]  Toen kwamen de discipelen van Johannes tot Hem, zeggende: Waarom vasten wij en de fariseërs veel, doch uw discipelen vasten niet?
[9:15] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Kunnen de bruiloftsgasten wel treuren, zoolang de bruidegom bij hen is? Maar er zullen dagen komen, als de bruidegom van hen is weggerukt, en dan zullen zij vasten.
[9:16] Niemand zet toch een stuk ongekrompen laken op een oud kleed; want dan zou dit nieuwe stuk van het kleed afscheuren en de scheur zou nog erger worden.
[9:17] Ook giet men geen jongen wijn in oude zakken; want dan zouden de zakken barsten, en de wijn zou wegvloeien, en de zakken zouden verloren zijn. Maar jongen wijn giet men in nieuwe zakken, en dan blijven beide bewaard. 
[9:18]  En terwijl Hij dit tot hen sprak, ziet, een overste kwam tot Hem, die Hem aanbad en zeide: Mijn dochter is zoo even gestorven, maar kom Gij, leg uw hand op haar, en zij zal leven.
[9:19] En opstaande, volgde Jezus hem met zijn discipelen.
[9:20] En ziet, een vrouw die twaalf jaar lang het bloedvloeien gehad had, kwam van achteren tot Hem en raakte den boord van zijn kleed aan;
[9:21] want zij zeide bij zich zelve: Als ik zijn kleed maar aanraak, zal ik genezen zijn.
[9:22] En Jezus zich omkeerende, en haar ziende, zeide: Dochter, heb goeden moed! uw geloof heeft u behouden! En de vrouw was gezond van die zelfde ure. 
[9:23]  En toen Jezus in het huis van den overste kwam, en de fluitspelers en het woelende volk zag,
[9:24] zeide Hij: Gaat weg, want het meisje is niet gestorven, maar het slaapt! En zij lachten Hem uit.
[9:25] Maar toen het volk was weggejaagd, ging Hij binnen, en Hij greep haar hand. En het meisje stond op.
[9:26] En het gerucht hiervan liep door die geheele landstreek. 
[9:27]  En toen Jezus vandaar wegging, volgden Hem twee blinden, roepende en zeggende: Ontferm U over ons, o Zoon van David!
[9:28] En als Hij in huis was gekomen, kwamen de blinden tot Hem, en Jezus zeide tot hen: Gelooft gij dat Ik dat kan doen? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Ja, Heere!
[9:29] Toen opende Hij hun oogen, zeggende: Naar uw geloof geschiede u!
[9:30] En hun oogen werden geopend. En Jezus verbood hun streng, zeggende: Ziet toe, dat het niemand wete.
[9:31] Maar zij uitgaande, maakten Hem ruchtbaar in die gansche landstreek. 
[9:32]  Terwijl dezen nu uitgingen, bracht men tot Hem een stommen mensch, die door een boozen geest bezeten was.
[9:33] En toen de booze geest was uitgedreven, sprak de stomme. En de scharen verwonderden zich, zeggende: Nooit is zoo iets in Israël gezien!
[9:34] Maar de fariseërs zeiden: Door den overste der booze geesten werpt Hij de booze geesten uit. 
[9:35]  En Jezus trok door al de steden en vlekken, leerende in hun synagogen en predikende het Evangelie des koninkrijks en genezende alle ziekten en kwalen onder het volk.
[9:36] En de scharen ziende, werd Hij over hen bewogen, omdat zij geplunderd en uitgeput waren, als schapen die geen herder hebben.
[9:37] Toen zeide Hij tot zijn discipelen: De oogst is wel groot, maar er zijn weinig arbeiders.
[9:38] Bidt dan den Heere van den oogst dat Hij arbeiders in zijn oogst uitzende.  
[10:1] En Jezus riep zijn twaalf discipelen tot zich en gaf hun macht over de onreine geesten, om die uit te werpen, en om alle ziekten en kwalen te genezen.
[10:2] De namen nu der twaalf apostelen zijn deze: vooreerst Simon, genaamd Petrus, en Andreas, zijn broeder; Jakobus de zoon van Zebedeüs, en Johannes, zijn broeder;
[10:3] Fillippus en Bartholomeüs, Thomas en Mattheüs, de tollenaar; Jakobus, de zoon van Alfeüs en Labbeüs, toegenaamd Taddeüs;
[10:4] Simon, de Kananeër en Judas Iskariot, die Hem ook verraden heeft. 
[10:5]  Deze twaalf zond Jezus uit en gebood hun, zeggende: Op den weg tot de heidenen zult gij niet gaan, en in een stad der Samaritanen zult gij niet treden.
[10:6] Maar gaat liever tot de verloren schapen van het huis Israëls.
[10:7] Gaat heen en predikt, zeggende: Het koninkrijk der hemelen is nabij.
[10:8] Geneest kranken, wekt dooden op, zuivert melaatschen, werpt booze geesten uit; om niet hebt gij het ontvangen; geeft het ook om niet.
[10:9] Hebt geen goud, of zilver, of koper in uw beurzen.
[10:10] Hebt geen reiszak op weg, noch twee rokken, noch schoenen, noch staf; want de arbeider is zijn voedsel waardig.
[10:11] En in wat stad of dorp gij komt, onderzoekt wie daarin waardig is; en blijft daar totdat gij er uitgaat.
[10:12] En als gij de woning binnentreedt, groet haar dan.
[10:13] En wanneer die woning het waardig is, dan kome uw vrede over haar; maar als zij het niet waardig is, dan keere uw vrede tot u weder.
[10:14] En zoo iemand u niet ontvangt en uw woorden niet hoort, schudt dan het stof van uw voeten af, als gij uit dat huis of uit die stad vertrekt.
[10:15] Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, het zal voor het land van Sodom en Gomorra verdragelijker zijn in den dag des oordeels, dan voor die stad.
[10:16] Ziet, Ik zend u als schapen in het midden van wolven; zijt dan voorzichtig zooals de slangen en eenvoudig zooals de duiven.
[10:17] Wacht u voor de menschen, want zij zullen u overleveren aan de rechtbanken, en in hun synagogen zullen zij u geeselen.
[10:18] Doch ook voor stad houders en koningen zult gij gesteld worden om Mijnentwil, tot een getuigenis voor hen en de heidenen.
[10:19] Maar zijt niet bezorgd, als zij u overleveren, hoe of wat gij zult zeggen; want hetgeen gij spreken zult, zal u in die zelfde ure gegeven worden.
[10:20] Want gij zijt het niet die spreekt, maar het is de Geest uws Vaders die in u spreekt.
[10:21] En de eene broeder zal den anderen overleveren ter dood en de vader zijn kind; en de kinderen zullen opstaan tegen de ouders en hen dooden.
[10:22] En gij zult gehaat zijn van allen om mijn Naam; maar die tot het einde toe volhardt, die zal behouden worden.
[10:23] Wanneer men u dan in de eene stad vervolgt, vlucht naar de andere; want voorwaar Ik zeg u, gij zult de steden Israëls niet doorreisd hebben vóórdat de Zoon des menschen zal gekomen zijn.
[10:24] De discipel is niet boven zijn meester, en de knecht niet boven zijn heer.
[10:25] Het zij den discipel genoeg dat hij gelijk is aan zijn meester, en den knecht gelijk aan zijn heer. Indien zij den huisheer Beëlzebul hebben genoemd, hoeveel te meer dan zijn huisgenooten!
[10:26] Vreest hen dan niet; want niets is bedekt dat niet ontdekt zal worden, en verborgen dat niet bekend zal worden.
[10:27] Hetgeen Ik tot u zeg in de duisternis, spreekt gij dat in het licht, en hetgeen u in het oor wordt gezegd, predikt dat van de daken.
[10:28] En vreest niet voor hen die het lichaam dooden, maar de ziel niet kunnen dooden, maar vreest veel meer hem die ziel en lichaam kan verderven in de hel.
[10:29] Worden niet twee musschen verkocht voor een penning? En niet één van deze zal op de aarde vallen zonder uw Vader.
[10:30] En van u zijn zelfs al de haren des hoofds geteld.
[10:31] Vreest dus niet; want gij zijt meer waard dan vele musschen.
[10:32] Een ieder dan die Mij zal belijden voor de menschen, dien zal Ik ook belijden voor mijn Vader die in de hemelen is.
[10:33] Maar wie Mij verloochent voor de menschen, dien zal Ik ook verloochenen voor mijn Vader, die in de hemelen is.
[10:34] Meent niet dat Ik ben gekomen om vrede op de aarde te brengen. Ik ben niet gekomen om vrede te brengen, maar het zwaard.
[10:35] Want Ik ben gekomen om den mensch verdeeld te maken tegen zijn vader, en de dochter tegen haar moeder, en de schoondochter tegen haar schoonmoeder; 
[10:36] en des menschen vijanden zullen zijn huisgenooten zijn.
[10:37] Wie vader of moeder liefheeft boven Mij, is Mijns niet waardig, en wie zoon of dochter liefheeft boven Mij, is Mijns niet waardig.
[10:38] En wie zijn kruis niet opneemt en Mij navolgt, die is Mijns niet waardig.
[10:39] Wie zijn leven vindt zal het verliezen, en wie zijn leven verliest om Mijnentwil, zal het vinden.
[10:40] Wie u ontvangt, ontvangt Mij, en wie Mij ontvangt, ontvangt Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[10:41] Wie een profeet ontvangt om zijn naam van profeet, zal het loon van een profeet ontvangen; en wie een rechtvaardige ontvangt om zijn naam van rechtvaardige, zal het loon van een rechtvaardige ontvangen.
[10:42] En zoo wie aan een van deze geringsten maar een beker koud water te drinken geeft om zijn naam van discipel, voorwaar Ik zeg u, hij zal zijn loon niet verliezen.  
[11:1] En het is geschied, toen Jezus geëindigd had aan zijn twaalf discipelen bevelen te geven, dat Hij vandaar ging om te onderwijzen en te prediken in hun steden.
[11:2] En Johannes de Dooper, in de gevangenis vernomen hebbende van de werken van Christus, zond twee van zijn discipelen om tot Hem te zeggen:
[11:3] Zijt Gij degene die komen zou, of moeten wij een ander verwachten?
[11:4] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Gaat heen, boodschapt aan Johannes wat gij hoort en ziet:
[11:5] Blinden worden ziende, en kreupelen wandelen; melaatschen worden gezuiverd, en dooven hooren; dooden worden opgewekt, en aan armen wordt het Evangelie verkondigd; 
[11:6] en zalig is hij, die zich aan Mij niet zal ergeren. 
[11:7]  Toen dezen nu heengingen, begon Jezus te zeggen tot de scharen aangaande Johannes: Wat zijt gij in de woestijn gaan zien? Een riet dat door den wind heen en weder geschud wordt?
[11:8] Maar wat zijt gij gaan zien? Een mensch met schoone kleederen bekleed? Ziet, die schoone kleederen dragen, zijn in de huizen der koningen.
[11:9] Maar waartoe zijt gij uitgegaan? Om een profeet te zien? — Ja, zeg Ik u, ook veel meer dan een profeet.
[11:10] Want hij is het van wien is geschreven: Ziet, Ik zend mijn engel voor uw aangezicht, die den weg vóór U uit bereiden zal.
[11:11] Voorwaar Ik zeg u, onder die van vrouwen geboren zijn, is er geen meerdere opgestaan dan Johannes de Dooper; maar de minste in het koninkrijk der hemelen is meer dan hij.
[11:12] En van de dagen van Johannes den Dooper af tot nu toe, wordt het koninkrijk der hemelen bestormd en bestormers rooven het weg.
[11:13] Want al de profeten en de wet hebben geprofeteerd tot op Johannes.
[11:14] En zoo gij het wilt aannemen, hij is de Elias die komen zou.
[11:15] Wie ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore.
[11:16] Doch waarbij zal Ik dit geslacht vergelijken? Het is gelijk aan de kinderen die op de pleinen zitten, en hun gezellen toeroepen, zeggende:
[11:17] Op de fluit speelden wij voor u, en gedanst hebt gij niet; klaagliederen hebben wij gezongen, en gij hebt niet geweend!
[11:18] Want Johannes is gekomen, niet etende of drinkende, en men zegt: Hij heeft een boozen geest!
[11:19] De Zoon des menschen is gekomen, etende en drinkende, en men zegt: Ziet daar, een gulzigaard en dronkaard, een vriend van tollenaars en zondaars! En de wijsheid is gerechtvaardigd door haar kinderen. 
[11:20]  Toen begon Hij de steden te verwijten, waarin zijn meeste krachten geschied warén, omdat zij zich niet bekeerden:
[11:21] Wee u, Chorazin! Wee u, Bethsaïda! Want zoo in Tyrus en Sidon de krachten geschied waren die in u geschied zijn, zij hadden al lang in zak en assche boetvaardigheid gedaan.
[11:22] Maar Ik zeg u: Tyrus en Sidon zal het verdragelijker zijn in den dag des oordeels dan ulieden!
[11:23] En gij Kapernaüm! zijt gij niet tot den hemel toe verhoogd? Tot het doodenrijk toe zult gij nedergestooten worden. Want zoo in Sodom de krachten geschied, waren die in u geschied zijn, het zou tot vandaag toe bestaan hebben.
[11:24] Maar Ik zeg u dat het den lande van Sodom verdragelijker zal zijn in den dag des oordeels dan u. 
[11:25]  In dien tijd antwoordde Jezus en zeide: Ik loof U, Vader, Heere des hemels en der aarde, dat Gij deze dingen verborgen hebt voor wijzen en verstandigen, en ze aan kinderen hebt geopenbaard.
[11:26] Ja, o Vader! want alzoo is het voor U welbehagelijk geweest.
[11:27] Alles is Mij overgegeven van mijn Vader, en niemand kent den Zoon dan de Vader, en niemand kent den Vader dan de Zoon, en wien het de Zoon wil openbaren.
[11:28] Komt tot Mij, gij allen die vermoeid en beladen zijt, en Ik zal u rust geven.
[11:29] Neemt mijn juk op u en leert van Mij, want Ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart, en gij zult rust vinden voor uw zielen.
[11:30] Want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.  
[12:1] In dien tijd ging Jezus op den sabbat door het korenveld, en zijn discipelen hadden honger en begonnen aren te plukken en te eten.
[12:2] En de fariseërs dit ziende, zeiden tot Hem: Ziet, uw discipelen doen wat niet geoorloofd is op een sabbat!
[12:3] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Hebt gij niet gelezen wat David gedaan heeft, toen hij, en zij die met hem waren, honger hadden?
[12:4] Hoe hij is gegaan in het huis Gods en de toonbrooden heeft gegeten, die hij niet eten mocht, noch zij die met hem waren, maar alleen de priesters?
[12:5] Of hebt gij niet gelezen in de wet, dat de priesters op den sabbat in den tempel den sabbat schenden en toch onschuldig zijn?
[12:6] En Ik zeg u, een meerdere dan de tempel is hier.
[12:7] Maar indien gij verstondt wat het zeggen wil: Barmhartigheid wil Ik, en niet offerande, dan zoudt gij de onschuldigen niet veroordeeld hebben.
[12:8] Want ook over den sabbat is de Zoon des menschen de Heer. 
[12:9]  En vandaar weggaande kwam Hij in hun synagoge.
[12:10] En ziet, er was daar een mensch met een stijve hand. En zij vroegen Hem, zeggende: Is het geoorloofd op den sabbat te genezen? om Hem te kunnen aanklagen.
[12:11] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wie zal er onder u zijn, die, als hij een schaap heeft en dit op den sabbat in een put valt, het niet terstond zal grijpen en er uittrekken?
[12:12] Hoeveel verschilt nu een mensch niet van een schaap? Zoo is het dus geoorloofd op den sabbat goed te doen.
[12:13] Toen zeide Hij tot den mensch: Steek uw hand uit! En hij stak haar uit en zij werd weder gezond gelijk de andere.
[12:14] En de fariseërs gingen uit en hielden te zamen raad tegen Hem, om Hem te dooden.
[12:15] Maar Jezus wist dit en vertrok vandaar. En velen volgden Hem en Hij genas hen allen. 
[12:16]  En Hij gebood hun dat zij Hem niet openbaar zouden maken.
[12:17] Opdat zou vervuld worden hetgeen gezegd is door Jesaja den profeet:
[12:18] Ziet, mijn Knecht, dien Ik verkoren heb; mijn Beminde, in wien mijn ziel een welbehagen heeft. Ik zal mijn Geest op Hem leggen, en Hij zal het oordeel aan de heidenen verkondigen.
[12:19] Hij zal niet twisten of schreeuwen, en niemand zal op de straten zijn stem hooren.
[12:20] Het geknakte riet zal Hij niet verbreken en de rookende wiek zal Hij niet uitblusschen, totdat Hij het oordeel zal uitvoeren tot overwinning.
[12:21] En op zijn Naam zullen de heidenen hopen. 
[12:22]  Toen werd tot Hem een bezetene gebracht, die blind en stom was. En Hij genas hem, zoodat de blinde en stomme sprak en zag.
[12:23] En al de scharen verwonderden zich en zeiden; Is deze niet de Zoon van David?
[12:24] Maar toen de fariseërs dit hoorden, zeiden zij: Deze werpt de booze geesten niet uit dan door Beëlzebul, den overste der booze geesten.
[12:25] Maar Jezus wist hun gedachten en zeide tot hen: Ieder koninkrijk, dat tegen zich zelf verdeeld is, wordt verwoest, en geen stad of huisgezin, tegen zich zelf verdeeld, zal blijven bestaan.
[12:26] En indien de Satan den Satan uitwerpt, is hij tegen zich zelf verdeeld; en hoe zal dan zijn koninkrijk bestaan?
[12:27] En indien Ik door Beëlzebul de booze geesten uitwerp, door wien werpen ze dan uw zonen uit? Daarom zullen die uw rechters zijn.
[12:28] Maar indien Ik door den Geest Gods de booze geesten uitwerp, zoo is dan het koninkrijk Gods tot u gekomen.
[12:29] Of hoe kan iemand in het huis van een sterke ingaan en diens huisraad rooven, indien hij niet eerst den sterke vastbindt? En dan zal hij zijn huis berooven.
[12:30] Die niet met Mij is, is tegen Mij; en die niet met Mij vergadert, verstrooit.
[12:31] Daarom zeg Ik u: Iedere zonde en lastering zal den menschen vergeven worden, maar de lastering tegen den Geest, zal niet vergeven worden.
[12:32] En zoo wie een woord spreekt tegen den Zoon des menschen, het zal hem vergeven worden; maar zoo wie spreekt tegen den Heiligen Geest, het zal hem niet vergeven worden, noch in deze eeuw, noch in de toekomende.
[12:33] Of acht den boom goed en zijn vrucht goed, of acht den boom slecht en zijn vrucht slecht; want uit de vrucht wordt de boom gekend.
[12:34] Gij slangen–gebroed! hoe kunt gij goede dingen spreken, gij die boos zijt? Want uit den overvloed des harten spreekt de mond.
[12:35] De goede mensch brengt goede dingen voort uit den goeden schat des harten, en de booze mensch brengt booze dingen voort uit den boozen schat.
[12:36] Maar Ik zeg u dat de menschen van elk ijdel woord dat zij spreken zullen, rekenschap zullen geven in den dag des oordeels.
[12:37] Want uit uw woorden zult gij gerechtvaardigd, en uit uw woorden zult gij veroordeeld worden. 
[12:38]  Toen antwoordden Hem sommigen van de schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, zeggende: Meester, wij wilden wel een teeken van U zien!
[12:39] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Een boos en overspelig geslacht begeert een teeken, en het zal geen teeken gegeven worden dan het teeken van Jonas, den profeet.
[12:40] Want gelijk Jonas drie dagen en drie nachten was in den buik van den visch, alzoo zal de Zoon des menschen drie dagen en drie nachten zijn in het hart der aarde.
[12:41] Mannen van Ninivé zullen opstaan in het oordeel met dit geslacht en zullen het veroordeelen, omdat zij zich bekeerd hebben op de prediking van Jonas; en ziet, een meerdere dan Jonas is hier.
[12:42] De koningin van het Zuiden zal opstaan in het oordeel met dit geslacht en zal het veroordeelen, omdat zij is gekomen van het einde der aarde om de wijsheid van Salomo te hooren, en ziet, een meerdere dan Salomo is hier.
[12:43] Wanneer de onreine geest van den mensch is uitgegaan, trekt hij door dorre plaatsen om rust te zoeken, maar vindt die niet.
[12:44] Dan zegt hij: Ik zal terugkeeren naar mijn huis vanwaar ik uitgegaan ben. En als hij daar komt, vindt hij het ledig, en schoongemaakt, en versierd.
[12:45] Dan gaat hij heen en neemt met zich zeven andere geesten, boozer dan hij zelf; en zij gaan binnen om daar te wonen; en het laatste van dien mensch wordt dan slechter dan het eerste. Zoo zal het ook zijn met dit boos geslacht. 
[12:46]  En terwijl Hij nog sprak tot te scharen, stonden zijn moeder en broeders buiten, zoekende Hem te spreken.
[12:47] En iemand zeide tot Hem: Zie, uw moeder en broeders staan buiten, zoekende U te spreken.
[12:48] Maar Hij antwoordde en sprak tot dengene die dit tot Hem zeide: Wie is mijn moeder en wie zijn mijn broeders?
[12:49] En zijn hand uitstrekkende over zijn discipelen, zeide Hij: Ziet mijn moeder en mijn broeders.
[12:50] Want zoo wie den wil doet van mijn Vader die in de hemelen is, die is mijn broeder, en zuster, en moeder.  
[13:1] Op dien zelfden dag ging Jezus uit het huis en zette zich neder bij de zee,
[13:2] En vele scharen verzamelden hen bij Hem, zoodat Hij in een schip ging zitten; en de gansche schare stond op den oever.
[13:3] En Hij sprak tot hen vele dingen in gelijkenissen, en zeide:
[13:4] Ziet, de zaaier ging uit om te zaaien; en als hij zaaide viel een deel bij den weg en de vogelen kwamen en pikten dit op.
[13:5] En een ander deel viel op den rotsgrond waar het niet veel aarde had, en het kwam terstond op, omdat het geen diepte van aarde had.
[13:6] Maar toen de zon opging verbrandde het, en het verdorde; omdat het geen wortel had.
[13:7] En een ander deel viel op de doornen, en de doornen schoten op en verstikten het.
[13:8] En een ander deel viel op den goeden grond en het gaf vrucht, het een honderd– het ander zestig– het ander dertigvoud.
[13:9] Wie ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore.
[13:10] En de discipelen kwamen en zeiden tot Hem: Waarom spreekt Gij tot hen in gelijkenissen?
[13:11] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Omdat het ulieden gegeven is de verborgenheden van het koninkrijk der hemelen te verstaan, maar aan dezen is dit niet gegeven.
[13:12] Want zoo wie heeft, hem zal gegeven worden en hij zal overvloed hebben; maar zoo wie niet heeft, van hem zal weggenomen worden ook dat hij heeft.
[13:13] Daarom spreek Ik tot hen in gelijkenissen; want ziende zien zij niet, en hoorende hooren of verstaan zij niet.
[13:14] En aan hen wordt vervuld de profetie van Jesaja, die zegt: Met het oor zult gij hooren en toch niet verstaan, en ziende zult gij zien en toch niet opmerken; 
[13:15] want het hart van dit volk is verhard, en met de ooren hebben zij bezwaarlijk gehoord, en hun oogen hebben zij toegesloten; opdat zij niet zouden zien met de oogen, en hooren met de ooren, en met het hart verstaan, en zich bekeeren, en Ik hen geneze.
[13:16] Maar uw oogen zijn zalig omdat zij zien, en uw ooren omdat zij hooren.
[13:17] Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat vele profeten en rechtvaardigen begeerd hebben te zien hetgeen gij ziet, en hebben het niet gezien, en te hooren hetgeen gij hoort, en hebben het niet gehoord.
[13:18] Gij dan, hoort de gelijkenis van den zaaier,
[13:19] Als iemand het woord van het koninkrijk hoort en niet verstaat, dan komt de booze en hij rooft weg hetgeen in zijn hart gezaaid was. Deze is het die bij den weg is gezaaid.
[13:20] En die op den rotsgrond gezaaid is, is deze die het woord hoort en terstond met vreugde ontvangt.
[13:21] Maar hij heeft geen wortel in zich zelven en is maar voor een tijd, en als er verdrukking komt of vervolging om des woords wil, wordt hij terstond geërgerd.
[13:22] En die in de doornen gezaaid is, is hij die het woord hoort, en de zorgen des tijds en de verleiding des rijkdoms verstikken het woord, en het wordt onvruchtbaar.
[13:23] En die op den goeden grond is gezaaid, is hij die het woord hoort en verstaat; die dan vrucht draagt en voortbrengt, de een honderd– de ander zestig– de ander dertigvoud. 
[13:24]  Een andere gelijkenis stelde Hij hun voor, zeggende: Het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan een mensch die goed zaad zaaide in zijn akker.
[13:25] En terwijl de menschen sliepen, kwam zijn vijand, en die zaaide onkruid midden tusschen de tarwe en ging weg.
[13:26] Toen nu het kruid opschoot en vrucht voortbracht, openbaarde zich ook het onkruid.
[13:27] En de dienstknechten van den heer des huizes kwamen en zeiden tot hem: Heer, gij hebt immers goed zaad gezaaid in uw akker? Vanwaar is dan nu het onkruid?
[13:28] En hij zeide tot hen: Een vijandig mensch heeft dit gedaan. En de dienstknechten zeiden tot hem: Wilt gij dat wij heengaan en het verzamelen?
[13:29] Maar hij zeide: Neen, opdat gij niet misschien, het onkruid verzamelende, te gelijk daarmee de tarwe uittrekt.
[13:30] Laat beide opwassen tot den oogst, en ten tijde van den oogst zal ik tot de maaiers zeggen: Verzamelt eerst het onkruid en bindt het tot bussels om het te verbranden, maar verzamelt de tarwe in mijn schuur. 
[13:31]  Een andere gelijkenis stelde Hij hun voor, zeggende: Het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan een mosterdzaad, dat iemand nam en in zijn land zaaide; 
[13:32] dit is nu wel het kleinste van alle zaden, maar wanneer het opgewassen is, dan is het grooter dan alle moeskruiden en het wordt een boom, zoodat het gevogelte des hemels komt en schuilt in zijn takken. 
[13:33]  Een andere gelijkenis sprak Hij tot hen! Het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan zuurdeesem, dien een vrouw nam en verborg in drie maten meel totdat het geheel doorzuurd was. 
[13:34]  Al deze dingen sprak Jezus tot de scharen in gelijkenissen en zonder gelijkenis sprak Hij niets tot hen,
[13:35] opdat zou vervuld worden wat gesproken is door den profeet, die zegt: Ik zal mijn mond opendoen in gelijkenissen, Ik zal openbaren wat verborgen was van de schepping der wereld af. 
[13:36]  Toen liet Jezus de scharen vertrekken, en Hij ging naar huis. En zijn discipelen kwamen tot Hem, zeggende: Verklaar ons de gelijkenis van het onkruid des akkers.
[13:37] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Die het goede zaad zaait, is de Zoon des menschen.
[13:38] De akker is de wereld, het goede zaad zijn de kinderen des koninkrijks; het onkruid zijn de kinderen van den booze.
[13:39] De vijand, die dit gezaaid heeft, is de duivel; de oogst is de voleinding der eeuw, en de maaiers zijn engelen.
[13:40] Gelijk nu het onkruid vergaderd en met vuur verbrand wordt, zoo zal het zijn in de voleinding der eeuw.
[13:41] De Zoon des menschen zal zijn engelen uitzenden, en zij zullen uit zijn koninkrijk verzamelen al de ergernissen en die de onrechtvaardigheid doen.
[13:42] En zij zullen dezen werpen in den brandenden oven; daar zal zijn het geween en het tandengeknars.
[13:43] Dan zullen de rechtvaardigen blinken gelijk de zon in het koninkrijk huns Vaders. Wie ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore. 
[13:44]  Het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan een verborgen schat in den akker, dien iemand vond en verborg; en uit blijdschap daarover gaat hij heen en verkoopt al wat hij heeft en koopt dien akker. 
[13:45]  Wederom is het koninkrijk der hemelen gelijk aan een koopman die schoone paarlen zoekt.
[13:46] En als hij een kostelijke paarl had gevonden, ging hij heen en verkocht al wat hij had om haar te koopen. 
[13:47]  Wederom is het koninkrijk der hemelen gelijk aan een net, in zee geworpen, dat allerlei soort van visch samenbracht,
[13:48] En wanneer het vol was, trokken zij het op den oever, en nederzittende verzamelden zij het goede in vaten, en het slechte wierpen zij weg.
[13:49] Alzoo zal het zijn in de voleinding der eeuw: de engelen zullen uitgaan en de boozen afzonderen uit het midden der rechtvaardigen; 
[13:50] en zij zullen hen werpen in den brandenden oven; daar zal het geween zijn en het tandengeknars.
[13:51] Jezus zeide tot hen: Hebt gij dit alles verstaan? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Ja, Heere!
[13:52] En Hij zeide tot hen: Daarom is ieder schriftgeleerde, die onderwezen is in het koninkrijk der hemelen, gelijk aan een heer des huizes die uit zijn schat nieuwe en oude dingen tevoorschijn brengt. 
[13:53]  En het geschiedde, toen Jezus deze gelijkenissen geëindigd had, dat Hij vandaar vertrok.
[13:54] En in zijn vaderland gekomen zijnde, leerde Hij hen in hun synagogen, zoodat zij zich verwonderden, zeggende: Vanwaar heeft deze die wijsheid en krachten?
[13:55] Is deze niet de zoon des timmermans? Heet zijn moeder, niet Maria, en zijn broeders Jakobus, en Joses, en Simon, en Judas?
[13:56] En zijn zusters, zijn ze niet allen bij ons? Vanwaar heeft dan deze dit alles?
[13:57] En zij ergerden zich aan Hem. Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Een profeet is niet ongeëerd dan in zijn eigen vaderland en in zijn huis.
[13:58] En Hij deed daar niet veel krachten vanwege hun ongeloof.  
[14:1] In dien tijd hoorde de vorst Herodes het gerucht van Jezus,
[14:2] en zeide tot zijn dienaren: Deze is Johannes de Dooper; hij is verrezen van de dooden en daarom werken die krachten in hem. 
[14:3]  Want Herodes had Johannes gevangen en gebonden en hem in de gevangenis gezet om Herodias, de vrouw van zijn broeder Filippus.
[14:4] Want Johannes had tot hem gezegd: Gij moogt haar niet hebben.
[14:5] En hij wilde hem dooden, maar vreesde het volk, want zij hielden hem voor een profeet.
[14:6] Maar toen de kroningsdag van Herodes gevierd werd, danste de dochter van Herodias in het midden, en behaagde aan Herodes.
[14:7] Daarom beloofde hij onder eede dat hij haar geven zou wat zij zou begeeren.
[14:8] En zij, door haar moeder vooraf opgezet, zeide: Geef mij hier op een schotel het hoofd van Johannes den Dooper.
[14:9] En de koning werd bedroefd; doch om de eeden en ter wille van de gasten, gebood hij het haar te geven.
[14:10] En hij zond heen en onthoofdde Johannes in de gevangenis.
[14:11] En zijn hoofd werd gebracht op een schotel en aan het meisje gegeven, en zij bracht het aan haar moeder.
[14:12] En zijn discipelen kwamen en namen het lijk weg en begroeven het, en zij kwamen het aan Jezus berichten.
[14:13] En toen Jezus het hoorde, vertrok Hij vandaar te scheep naar een eenzame plaats, alleen. 
[14:14]  En de scharen dit vernemende, volgden Hem te voet uit de steden, en toen Hij uitging zag Hij een groote schare, en kreeg innerlijk medelijden met hen, en genas hun kranken.
[14:15] En toen het avond geworden was, kwamen zijn discipelen tot Hem en zeiden: Deze plaats is eenzaam en de tijd is al voorbij; laat nu de scharen van U, opdat zij heengaan naar de dorpen en voor zich zelven spijzen koopen.
[14:16] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Het is niet noodig dat zij weggaan: geeft gij hun te eten.
[14:17] Maar zij zeiden tot Hem: Wij hebben hier niet dan vijf brooden en twee visschen!
[14:18] En Hij zeide: Brengt Mij die hier.
[14:19] En Hij gebood de scharen neder te zitten op het gras, en Hij nam de vijf brooden en de twee visschen en zag op naar den hemel en dankte. En de brooden gebroken hebbende, gaf Hij ze aan de discipelen, en de discipelen gaven ze aan de scharen.
[14:20] En zij aten allen en werden verzadigd, en zij namen het overschot der stukken op, twaalf volle korven.
[14:21] Zij nu, die gegeten hadden, waren omtrent vijf duizend mannen, behalve de vrouwen en kinderen. 
[14:22]  En Jezus dwong terstond de discipelen in het schip te gaan en Hem vooruit naar de overzijde te varen, terwijl Hij de scharen van zich zou laten.
[14:23] En toen Hij de scharen van zich gelaten had, ging Hij alleen op den berg om te bidden. En het was avond en Hij was alleen.
[14:24] Het schip nu was al midden in de zee, geslingerd door de golven, want zij hadden tegenwind.
[14:25] En in de vierde nachtwake kwam Hij tot hen af, wandelende op de zee.
[14:26] En zij, Hem op de zee ziende wandelen, ontroerden en zeiden: Het is een spook! En zij schreeuwden van vreeze.
[14:27] Maar terstond sprak Jezus hen aan, zeggende: Hebt moed, Ik ben het, vreest niet!
[14:28] En Petrus antwoordde Hem en zeide: Heere, zoo Gij het zijt, gebied mij dan tot U te komen op het water!
[14:29] En Hij zeide: Kom! En van het schip afdalende, wandelde Petrus op het water om tot Jezus te komen.
[14:30] Maar toen hij den sterken wind zag, werd hij bevreesd, en toen hij begon te zinken, riep hij, zeggende: Heere, behoud mij!
[14:31] En terstond strekte Jezus zijn hand uit, greep hem en zeide tot hem: Kleingeloovige, waartoe getwijfeld?
[14:32] En toen zij in het schip geklommen waren, bedaarde de wind.
[14:33] En die in het schip waren, kwamen en aanbaden Hem, zeggende: Waarlijk, Gods Zoon zijt Gij! 
[14:34]  Toen zij nu overgevaren waren, kwamen zij in het land Gennezareth.
[14:35] En de mannen van die plaats kenden Hem en zonden naar dien ganschen omtrek, en brachten tot Hem allen die krank waren.
[14:36] En zij baden Hem om alleen den zoom van zijn kleed aan te raken. En zoo velen dien aanraakten, werden genezen.  
[15:1] Toen kwamen tot Jezus de schriftgeleerden en fariseërs van Jerusalem, zeggende:
[15:2] Waarom overtreden uw discipelen de overlevering der ouden? Want zij wasschen hun handen niet als zij brood gaan eten.
[15:3] En Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Waarom overtreedt ook gijlieden Gods gebod om uw overlevering?
[15:4] Want God heeft geboden, zeggende: Eert uw vader en moeder, en: Wie vader of moeder kwaad toespreekt, sterve den dood!
[15:5] Maar gijlieden zegt: Zoo wie tot zijn vader of moeder zegt: ‘t Is een offergave, wat gij van mij zoudt genieten, — maar intusschen eert hij zijn vader of moeder niet.
[15:6] En gij hebt dus de wet Gods krachteloos gemaakt om uw overlevering.
[15:7] Geveinsden! te recht heeft Jesaja aangaande u geprofeteerd, zeggende:
[15:8] Dit volk genaakt Mij met hun mond, en eert Mij met de lippen, maar hun hart is verre van Mij.
[15:9] Maar tevergeefs dienen zij Mij, omdat zij leeringen leeren die geboden van menschen zijn.
[15:10] En Hij riep de menigte tot zich en zeide tot haar: Hoort en verstaat!
[15:11] Niet wat den mond ingaat, verontreinigt den mensch; maar wat den mond uitgaat, dat is het wat den mensch verontreinigt.
[15:12] Toen kwamen de discipelen tot Hem en zeiden tot Hem: Weet gij wel dat de fariseërs, dit woord gehoord hebbende, zich geërgerd hebben?
[15:13] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide: Alle plant die mijn hemelsche Vader niet geplant heeft, zal uitgerukt worden.
[15:14] Laat ze varen! Blinde leidslieden van blinden zijn zij! En als de eene blinde den anderen leidt, zullen zij beiden in de gracht vallen.
[15:15] Petrus nu antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Verklaar ons deze gelijkenis.
[15:16] En Jezus zeide: Zijt ook gij nog onverstandig?
[15:17] Weet gij nog niet dat alles wat den mond ingaat, in den buik komt, en in het geheim wordt uitgeworpen?
[15:18] Maar wat den mond uitgaat, komt uit het hart, en die dingen verontreinigen den mensch.
[15:19] Want uit het hart komen booze overleggingen, moord, overspel, hoererij, diefstal, valsch getuigenis, lasteringen.
[15:20] Deze dingen zijn het die den mensch verontreinigen, maar het eten met ongewasschen handen verontreinigt den mensch niet. 
[15:21]  En Jezus vandaar weggaande, trok naar de omstreken van Tyrus en Sidon.
[15:22] En ziet, een kananeesche vrouw, uit die streken komende, riep, zeggende: Ontferm U mijner, Heere, Zoon van David! mijn dochter is erg bezeten van een boozen geest.
[15:23] Maar Hij antwoordde haar geen woord. En zijn discipelen gingen tot Hem en vroegen Hem, zeggende: Laat haar van U! want zij roept ons na.
[15:24] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Ik ben niet gezonden dan tot de verloren schapen van het huis Israëls.
[15:25] En zij kwam en aanbad Hem, zeggende: Heere, help mij!
[15:26] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide: Het is niet billijk het brood van de kinderen te nemen en voor de honden te werpen!
[15:27] En zij zeide: ‘t Is waar, Heere! doch de honden eten toch van de kruimels die vallen van de tafel hunner meesters?
[15:28] Toen antwoordde Jezus en zeide tot haar: O vrouw! groot is uw geloof! U geschiede gelijk gij wilt. En haar dochter werd genezen in die zelfde ure. 
[15:29]  En vandaar weggaande, ging Jezus langs de zee van Galilea, en Hij klom op den berg en zat daar neder.
[15:30] En tot Hem kwamen vele scharen die bij zich hadden kreupelen, blinden, stommen, lammen en vele anderen; en zij leiden die aan zijn voeten, en Hij genas hen,
[15:31] zoodat de scharen zich verwonderden, toen zij zagen dat stommen spraken, lammen gezond werden, kreupelen wandelden en blinden zagen; en zij gaven glorie aan den God van Israël. 
[15:32]  En Jezus riep zijn discipelen tot zich en zeide: Ik heb medelijden met de schare, want het is nu al drie dagen dat zij bij Mij blijven en zij hebben niets om te eten; en Ik wil hen niet hongerig laten gaan, opdat zij onderweg niet bezwijken.
[15:33] En de discipelen zeiden tot Hem: Vanwaar krijgen wij in een woestijn zooveel brooden, om zoo groote menigte te verzadigen?
[15:34] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Hoeveel brooden hebt gij? En zij zeiden: Zeven en een weinig vischjes.
[15:35] En Hij gebood de schare zich op den grond neder te zetten.
[15:36] En Hij nam de zeven brooden en de visschen, en als Hij gedankt had, brak Hij ze en gaf ze aan de discipelen; en de discipelen gaven ze aan de scharen.
[15:37] En allen aten en werden verzadigd; en het overschot der brokken namen zij op, zeven volle manden.
[15:38] En die gegeten hadden, waren vier duizend mannen, behalve de kinderen en de vrouwen.
[15:39] En toen Hij de scharen had laten weggaan, ging Hij in het schip; en zij kwamen in de omstreken van Magdala.  
[16:1] En de fariseërs en de sadduceërs kwamen tot Hem om Hem te verstrikken; en zij begeerden dat Hij hun een teeken uit den hemel zou toonen.
[16:2] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Des avonds zegt gij: Goed weer, want de hemel is rood.
[16:3] En des morgens: Vandaag ruw weer, want de hemel is somber rood. Gij geveinsden! de gedaante des hemels weet gij wel te onderscheiden, maar de teekenen der tijden kunt gij niet onderscheiden?
[16:4] Een boos en overspelig geslacht begeert een teeken, en het zal geen teeken gegeven worden, dan het teeken van Jonas, den profeet. En Hij verliet hen en ging weg. 
[16:5]  En toen zij naar den overkant gegaan waren, hadden de discipelen vergeten brooden mede te nemen.
[16:6] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Ziet toe en wacht u van den zuurdeesem der fariseërs en sadduceërs.
[16:7] En zij overleiden bij zich zelven en zeiden: Hij zegt dit, omdat wij geen brood hebben meegenomen?
[16:8] Maar Jezus wist dit en zeide: Wat overlegt gij onder malkander, gij kleingeloovigen, dat gij geen brood hebt meegenomen?
[16:9] Verstaat gij nog niet? Herinnert gij u niet de vijf brooden der vijf duizend, en hoeveel korven gij opnaamt?
[16:10] Of de zeven brooden der vier duizend, en hoeveel manden gij opnaamt?
[16:11] Hoe? verstaat gij niet dat Ik niet van brood tot u sprak, toen Ik zeide: Wacht u van den zuurdeesem der fariseërs en sadduceërs?
[16:12] Toen verstonden zij dat Hij niet gezegd had dat zij zich wachten zouden van den zuurdeesem, maar van de leer der fariseërs en sadduceërs. 
[16:13]  Toen Jezus gekomen was in de omstreken van Cesarea–Filippi, vroeg Hij aan zijn discipelen, zeggende: Wie zeggen de menschen dat Ik, de Zoon des menschen, ben?
[16:14] En zij zeiden: Sommigen, Johannes de Dooper; anderen, Elias; anderen, Jeremia, of een der profeten.
[16:15] Hij zeide tot hen: Maar gijlieden, wie zegt gij dat Ik ben?
[16:16] Simon Petrus antwoordde en zeide: Gij zijt de Christus, de Zoon des levenden Gods!
[16:17] Jezus nu antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Zalig zijt gij, Simon Barjona! want vleesch en bloed heeft u dit niet geopenbaard, maar mijn Vader die in de hemelen is.
[16:18] Doch Ik zeg u ook dat gij zijt Petrus, en op deze rots zal ik mijn Gemeente bouwen, en de poorten van het doodenrijk zullen haar niet overweldigen.
[16:19] En Ik zal u geven de sleutelen van het koninkrijk der hemelen, en zoo wat gij zult binden op aarde zal in de hemelen gebonden zijn, en zoo wat gij zult losmaken op aarde zal in de hemelen losgemaakt zijn.
[16:20] Toen gebood Hij aan de discipelen dat zij aan niemand zouden zeggen dat Hij Jezus, de Christus is. 
[16:21]  Van toen af begon Jezus aan zijn discipelen te toonen dat Hij naar Jerusalem moest opgaan, en veel lijden van de oudsten, overpriesters en schriftgeleerden, en gedood, en op den derden dag opgewekt worden.
[16:22] En Petrus, Hem tot zich nemende, begon Hem te berispen, zeggende: Heere, God behoede U! dat zal U niet geschieden!
[16:23] Maar Hij keerde zich om en zeide tot Petrus: Ga weg, achter Mij, Satanas! gij zijt Mij een aanstoot; want gij bedenkt niet de dingen Gods, maar der menschen! 
[16:24]  Toen zeide Jezus tot zijn discipelen: Indien iemand achter Mij wil komen, die verloochene zich zelven en neme zijn kruis op en volge Mij na.
[16:25] Want zoo wie zijn leven wil behouden, zal het verliezen; en zoo wie zijn leven om Mijnentwil zal verliezen, die zal het vinden.
[16:26] Want welk profijt heeft de mensch, als hij de gansche wereld wint, en hij verliest zijn leven? Of wat zal een mensch geven in ruil voor zijn leven?
[16:27] Want de Zoon des menschen zal komen in de glorie zijns Vaders met zijn engelen, en dan zal Hij ieder vergelden naar zijn werken.
[16:28] Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat er sommigen zijn van die hier staan, die den dood in het geheel niet smaken zullen, totdat zij den Zoon des menschen hebben zien komen in zijn koninkrijk.  
[17:1] En na zes dagen nam Jezus met zich Petrus, Jakobus en Johannes, diens broeder, en bracht hen afzonderlijk op een hoogen berg.
[17:2] En Hij werd van gedaante veranderd in hun tegenwoordigheid en zijn aangezicht schitterde gelijk de zon, en zijn kleederen werden wit, als het licht.
[17:3] En ziet, hun verschenen Mozes en Elias, die met Hem samen spraken.
[17:4] En Petrus antwoordde en zeide tot Jezus: Heer, het is goed dat wij hier zijn; zoo Gij wilt, laat ons hier drie tenten maken, voor U een, en voor Mozes een, en voor Elias een.
[17:5] Terwijl hij nog sprak, ziet, een heldere wolk overschaduwde hen, en ziet, een stem uit de wolk zeide: Deze is mijn Zoon, de Beminde, in Wien Ik welbehagen heb; hoort Hem!
[17:6] En toen de discipelen dit hoorden, vielen zij op hun aangezicht en vreesden zeer.
[17:7] En Jezus kwam tot hen en raakte hen aan, zeggende: Staat op en vreest niet!
[17:8] En toen zij hun oogen opsloegen, zagen zij niemand dan Jezus alleen.
[17:9] En terwijl zij van den berg afkwamen, gebood Jezus hun, zeggende: Vertelt aan niemand dit gezicht, totdat de Zoon des menschen uit de dooden zal verrezen zijn. 
[17:10]  En zijn discipelen vroegen Hem, zeggende: Waarom zeggen toch de schriftgeleerden dat Elias eerst moet komen?
[17:11] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Elias komt wel en zal alles herstellen; 
[17:12] maar Ik zeg u dat Elias al gekomen is, en zij hebben hem niet erkend, maar zij hebben hem gedaan wat zij wilden; zoo zal ook de Zoon des menschen door hen lijden.
[17:13] Toen verstonden de discipelen dat Hij tot hen sprak over Johannes den Dooper. 
[17:14]  En toen zij bij de schare gekomen waren, kwam tot Hem een mensch, die voor Hem op de knieën viel en zeide:
[17:15] Heere! ontferm U over mijn zoon, want hij is maanziek en lijdt veel; want dikwijls valt hij in het vuur en in het water.
[17:16] En ik heb hem gebracht tot uw discipelen en zij hebben hem niet kunnen genezen.
[17:17] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide: O ongeloovig en verkeerd geslacht! tot wanneer zal Ik bij u zijn? tot wanneer zal Ik u verdragen? brengt hem Mij hier.
[17:18] En Jezus bestrafte hem; en de booze geest ging van hem uit, en de zoon werd genezen van die ure af.
[17:19] Toen kwamen de discipelen tot Jezus afzonderlijk en zeiden: Waarom hebben wij hem niet kunnen uitwerpen?
[17:20] En Hij zeide tot hen: Om uw ongeloof; want voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat gij, zoo gij geloof hadt als een mosterdzaad, tot dezen berg zoudt zeggen: Ga vanhier, derwaarts! en hij zal heengaan; en niets zal u onmogelijk zijn.
[17:21] Maar dit geslacht vaart niet uit dan door gebed en vasten. 
[17:22]  En terwijl zij in Galilea verkeerden, zeide Jezus tot hen: De Zoon des menschen zal overgeleverd worden in de handen der menschen,
[17:23] en zij zullen Hem dooden en op den derden dag zal Hij opgewekt worden. En zij werden zeer bedroefd. 
[17:24]  En toen zij naar Kapernaüm gekomen waren, kwamen de ontvangers der tolpenningen tot Petrus en zeiden: Betaalt uw Meester den tolpenning niet?
[17:25] En hij zeide: Ja. Toen hij nu in huis gekomen was, voorkwam hem Jezus, zeggende: Wat dunkt u, Simon, van wie nemen de koningen der aarde tol of schatting? Van hun zonen of van de vreemden?
[17:26] En hij zeide: Van de vreemden. Toen zeide Jezus tot hem: Dan zijn de zonen ook vrij.
[17:27] Maar opdat we hun geen aanstoot geven, ga naar zee, werp een angel uit en neem den eersten visch die opkomt; en als gij zijn mond opent, zult gij een dubbelen tolpenning vinden: neem dien en geef dien aan hen voor Mij en u.  
[18:1] In die ure kwamen de discipelen tot Jezus, zeggende: Wie is toch de meeste in het koninkrijk der hemelen?
[18:2] En Jezus riep een kind bij zich en stelde dit in hun midden,
[18:3] en zeide: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, indien gij niet verandert en wordt gelijk de kinderen, dan zult gij het koninkrijk der hemelen niet binnengaan.
[18:4] Wie dan zich zelven vernederen zal gelijk dit kind, die is de meeste in het koninkrijk der hemelen.
[18:5] En zoo wie één zoodanig kind aannemen zal, in mijn Naam, die neemt Mij aan; 
[18:6] en zoo wie één van die kleinen die in Mij gelooven zal ergeren, het zou hem beter zijn zoo hem een molensteen aan den hals gebonden en hij in de diepte der zee verdronken werd.
[18:7] Wee der wereld vanwege de ergernissen! want het is noodig dat er ergernissen komen; maar wee den mensch, door wien de ergernis komt.
[18:8] Indien dan uw hand of uw voet u ergert, snijdt ze af en werpt ze van u weg; het is u toch beter kreupel of verminkt het leven in te gaan, dan met twee handen of twee voeten in het eeuwig vuur geworpen te worden.
[18:9] En indien uw oog u ergert, trekt het uit en werpt het van u weg; het is u toch beter met één oog het leven in te gaan, dan met twee oogen in het helsche vuur geworpen te worden.
[18:10] Ziet toe, dat gij niet één van deze kleinen veracht! Want Ik zeg u dat hun engelen in de hemelen altijd zien het aangezicht van mijn Vader die in de hemelen is.
[18:11] Want de Zoon des menschen is gekomen om het verlorene te redden. 
[18:12]  Wat dunkt ulieden? Indien aan iemand een honderdtal schapen ten deel geworden was, en één van dezen is afgedwaald, laat hij dan niet de negen en negentig op de bergen, om heen te gaan en het afgedwaalde te zoeken?
[18:13] En als het gebeurt dat hij het vindt, voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat hij zich meer verblijdt over dit ééne, dan over de negen en negentig die niet afgedwaald zijn geweest.
[18:14] Alzoo is het niet de wil voor uw Vader die in de hemelen is, dat één van deze kleinen verloren ga.
[18:15] Indien nu uw broeder tegen u zondigt, ga dan heen, bestraf hem tusschen u en hem alleen; wanneer hij u hoort, dan hebt gij uw broeder gewonnen.
[18:16] Maar wanneer hij niet hoort, neem dan nog één of twee met u mede, opdat op het woord van twee of drie getuigen alle zaak besta.
[18:17] En indien hij dezen niet hoort, zeg het dan aan de gemeente; en zoo hij ook de gemeente niet hoort, dan zij hij u als de heiden en de tollenaar.
[18:18] Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, al wat gij zult binden op de aarde, zal gebonden zijn in den hemel, en al wat gij losmaken zult op de aarde, zal in den hemel losgemaakt zijn.
[18:19] Wederom zeg Ik u, wanneer twee van ulieden overeenstemmen op de aarde, over welke zaak ook, die zij zouden begeeren, het zal hun geschieden van uw Vader die in de hemelen is.
[18:20] Want waar er twee of drie vergaderd zijn in mijn Naam, daar ben Ik in hun midden. 
[18:21]  Toen kwam Petrus tot Hem en zeide: Heere, hoeveel malen zal ik het aan mijn broeder vergeven, als hij tegen mij zal zondigen? Tot zevenmaal?
[18:22] Jezus zeide tot hem: Ik zeg u niet tot zevenmaal, maar tot zeventigmaal zevenmaal.
[18:23] Daarom wordt het koninkrijk der hemelen vergeleken bij een koning die wilde afrekenen met zijn dienstknechten.
[18:24] Toen hij nu begon af te rekenen, werd er een tot hem gebracht die tien duizend talenten schuldig was.
[18:25] En daar hij niet kon betalen, beval de heer dat men hem zou verkoopen, met zijn vrouw en kinderen en al wat hij bezat, en dat er betaald zou worden.
[18:26] De dienstknecht dan viel neder, hem smeekende, en zeide tot hem: Wees lankmoedig jegens mij en ik zal u alles betalen.
[18:27] En de heer van dezen dienstknecht was barmhartig jegens hem, en ontsloeg hem en schold hem de schuld kwijt.
[18:28] Maar toen deze dienstknecht uitgegaan was, vond hij een zijner mededienstknechten, die hem honderd penningen schuldig was; en hij greep hem bij de keel zeggende: Betaal wat gij schuldig zijt!
[18:29] En zijn mededienst knecht viel neder aan zijn voeten en smeekte hem, zeggende: Wees lankmoedig jegens mij en ik zal u alle betalen.
[18:30] Maar hij wilde niet doch ging heen en wierp hem in de gevangenis totdat hij de schuld betaald zou hebben.
[18:31] Zijn mededienstknechten nu, ziende wat er geschied was, werden zeer bedroefd, en zij gingen heen en verhaalden aan hun heer al wat er gebeurd was.
[18:32] Toen riep zijn heer hem tot zich en zeide tot hem: Gij booze dienstknecht! al die schuld heb ik u kwijtgescholden omdat gij mij gebeden hebt; 
[18:33] moest gij u dan ook niet ontfermen over uw mededienstknecht, gelijk ook ik mij over u ontfermd heb?
[18:34] En zijn heer vertoornd zijnde, gaf hem over aan de pijnigers, totdat hij zou betaald hebben al wat hij schuldig was.
[18:35] Alzoo zal ook mijn hemelsche Vader ulieden doen, indien gij niet een ieder aan zijn broeder van harte zijn misdaden vergeeft.  
[19:1] En het geschiedde toen Jezus deze woorden geëindigd had, dat Hij uit Galilea vertrok en ging naar de landstreken van Judea, aan de overzijde van den Jordaan.
[19:2] En vele scharen volgden Hem en Hij genas hen aldaar. 
[19:3]  En de fariseërs kwamen tot Hem, om Hem op de proef te stellen, en zij zeiden: Is het aan iemand geoorloofd zijn vrouw te verlaten om elke reden?
[19:4] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Hebt gij niet gelezen dat de Schepper hen van den beginne man en vrouw heeft gemaakt,
[19:5] en dat Hij gezegd heeft: Daarom zal een mensch vader en moeder verlaten en zijn vrouw aanhangen, en die twee zullen zijn tot één vleesch?
[19:6] Zoo zijn ze dus niet meer twee, maar één vleesch. Wat God dus samengevoegd heeft scheide de mensch niet.
[19:7] Zij zeiden tot Hem: Waarom heeft dan Mozes geboden een scheidbrief te geven en haar te verlaten?
[19:8] Hij zeide tot hen: Mozes heeft wegens uw hardheid van hart u toegelaten uw vrouwen te verlaten: maar van den beginne is het zoo niet geweest.
[19:9] En Ik zeg u, dat zoo iemand zijn vrouw verlaat anders dan om hoererij, en een andere trouwt, die doet overspel, en wie een verlatene trouwt, doet ook overspel.
[19:10] De discipelen zeiden tot Hem: Indien de zaak van den mensch met de vrouw zoo is, dan is het niet raadzaam om te trouwen.
[19:11] Doch Hij zeide tot hen: Niet allen verstaan dit woord, maar zij, wien het gegeven is.
[19:12] Want er zijn gesnedenen die uit hun moeder alzoo geboren zijn, en er zijn gesnedenen die door de menschen gesneden zijn, en er zijn gesnedenen die zich zelven gesneden hebben om het koninkrijk der hemelen. Die het vatten kan, vatte het. 
[19:13]  Toen werden er kinderkens tot Hem gebracht, opdat Hij hun de handen zou opleggen en bidden; en de discipelen bestraften hen.
[19:14] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Laat de kinderkens met vrede en verhindert ze niet om tot Mij te komen, want voor zoodanigen is het koninkrijk der hemelen.
[19:15] En als Hij hun de handen opgelegd had, ging Hij vandaar weg. 
[19:16]  En ziet, er kwam een tot Hem die zeide: Goede Meester, welk goed zal ik doen opdat ik het eeuwige leven hebbe?
[19:17] En Hij zeide tot hem: Wat vraagt gij Mij naar hetgeen goed is? Een is er goed, dat is, God! Maar zoo gij tot het leven wilt ingaan, onderhoud de geboden.
[19:18] En hij zeide: Welke? En Jezus zeide: Gij zult niet doodslaan, gij zult geen overspel doen, gij zult niet stelen, gij zult geen valsch getuigenis geven,
[19:19] eert vader en moeder, en: gij zult uw naaste liefhebben als u zelven.
[19:20] De jongeling zeide tot Hem: Dit alles heb ik onderhouden van mijn jeugd af; wat ontbreekt mij nog?
[19:21] Jezus zeide tot hem: Indien gij volmaakt wilt zijn, ga dan heen, verkoop uw goederen en geef het aan de armen, en gij zult een schat hebben in den hemel, en kom herwaarts en volg Mij.
[19:22] Als de jongeling nu dit woord hoorde, ging hij bedroefd weg, want hij bezat vele goederen. 
[19:23]  En Jezus zeide tot zijn discipelen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat een rijke bezwaarlijk in het koninkrijk der hemelen zal ingaan.
[19:24] En wederom zeg Ik u, dat het gemakkelijker is dat een kameel gaat door het oog van een naald dan dat een rijke het koninkrijk der hemelen ingaat.
[19:25] Toen de discipelen dit hoorden, waren zij zeer verwonderd, zeggende: Wie kan dan behouden worden?
[19:26] En Jezus hen aanziende, zeide tot hen: Bij de menschen is dit onmogelijk, maar bij God is alles mogelijk.
[19:27] Toen antwoordde Petrus en zeide tot Hem: Zie, wij hebben alles verlaten en zijn U gevolgd; wat zal ons dan geworden?
[19:28] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat, bij de wedergeboorte, als de Zoon des menschen zal zitten op den troon zijner glorie, gij die Mij gevolgd zijt, ook op twaalf troonen zult zitten, oordeelende de twaalf stammen van Israël.
[19:29] En al wie verlaten zal hebben huizen, of broeders, of zusters, of vader, of moeder, of vrouw, of kinderen, of akkers, om mijns Naams wil, die zal honderdvoudig ontvangen en het eeuwige leven beërven.
[19:30] Doch vele eersten zullen de laatsten zijn en vele laatsten de eersten.  
[20:1] Want het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan een heer des huizes, die des morgens vroeg uitging om werklieden te huren voor zijn wijngaard.
[20:2] En als hij met de werklieden overeengekomen was voor een penning daags, zond hij hen naar zijn wijngaard.
[20:3] En omtrent de derde ure uitgaande, zag hij anderen ledig staan op de markt.
[20:4] En hij zeide tot dezen: Gaat ook gijlieden heen naar den wijngaard, en hetgeen billijk is, zal ik u geven. En zij gingen heen.
[20:5] En wederom uitgaande omtrent de zesde en de negende ure, deed hij desgelijks.
[20:6] En omtrent de elfde ure uitgegaan zijnde, vond hij anderen staan en zeide tot hen: Waarom staat gij hier den ganschen dag ledig?
[20:7] Zij zeiden tot hem: Omdat niemand ons heeft gehuurd. Hij zeide tot hen: Gaat ook gijlieden naar den wijngaard.
[20:8] Als het nu avond geworden was, zeide de heer des wijngaards tot zijn opzichter: Roep de werklieden en geef hun het loon, beginnende van de laatsten tot de eersten.
[20:9] En die omtrent de elfde ure gehuurd waren, kwamen en ontvingen ieder een penning.
[20:10] Doch toen de eersten kwamen, meenden zij dat zij meer zouden ontvangen. En ook zij ontvingen ieder een penning.
[20:11] En dien ontvangende, murmureerden zij tegen den heer des huizes,
[20:12] zeggende: Deze laatsten hebben maar één uur gewerkt en gij hebt hen gelijk gesteld met ons, die den last van den dag en de hitte gedragen hebben!
[20:13] Maar hij antwoordde en zeide tot een van hen: Vriend, ik doe u geen ongelijk! Zijt gij niet met mij overeengekomen voor een penning?
[20:14] Neem den uwen en ga heen! Ik wil aan deze laatsten geven gelijk aan u.
[20:15] Of mag ik met het mijne niet doen zooals ik wil? Of is uw oog kwaad omdat ik goed ben?
[20:16] Zoo zullen de laatsten de eersten zijn en de eersten de laatsten. Want velen zijn geroepen, doch weinigen uitverkoren. 
[20:17]  En toen Jezus naar Jerusalem opging, nam Hij de twaalf discipelen afzonderlijk, en onderweg zeide Hij tot hen:
[20:18] Ziet, wij gaan op naar Jerusalem en de Zoon des menschen zal overgeleverd worden aan de overpriesters en schriftgeleerden, en zij zullen Hem ter dood veroordeelen,
[20:19] en zij zullen Hem overleveren aan de heidenen om Hem te bespotten en te geeselen en te kruisigen; en op den derden dag zal Hij verrijzen. 
[20:20]  Toen kwam tot Hem de moeder der zonen van Zebedeüs met haar zonen, en zij aanbad Hem en begeerde iets van Hem.
[20:21] En Hij zeide tot haar: Wat wilt gij? Zij zeide tot Hem: Zeg dat deze mijn twee zonen mogen zitten aan uw rechter– en linkerhand in uw koninkrijk.
[20:22] Doch Jezus antwoordde en zeide: Gij weet niet wat gij begeert. Kunt gij den beker drinken dien Ik zal drinken? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Wij kunnen.
[20:23] Hij zeide tot hen: Mijn beker zult gij wel drinken, maar het zitten aan mijn rechter– en linkerhand, dat staat aan Mij niet te geven, maar is voor hen wien het bereid is van mijn Vader.
[20:24] En als de tien dit hoorden, namen zij het zeer kwalijk van de twee broeders.
[20:25] Doch Jezus riep hen tot zich en zeide: Gij weet dat de oversten der volken over hen heerschen en dat de grooten over hen macht gebruiken.
[20:26] Maar zoo zal het niet zijn onder u; maar zoo wie onder u zal willen groot worden, die zal uw dienaar zijn; 
[20:27] en zoo wie onder u zal willen de eerste zijn, die zal uw dienstknecht zijn,
[20:28] gelijk de Zoon des menschen niet is gekomen om gediend te worden, maar om te dienen en zijn leven te geven tot een losprijs voor velen. 
[20:29]  En toen zij Jericho uitgingen, volgde Hem een groote schare.
[20:30] En ziet, twee blinden zaten bij den weg; en toen zij hoorden dat Jezus voorbijging, riepen zij, zeggende: Ontferm U over ons, Gij Zoon van David!
[20:31] Doch de schare bestrafte hen, opdat zij zwijgen zouden. Maar des te meer riepen zij, zeggende: Heere! ontferm U over ons, Gij Zoon van David!
[20:32] En Jezus bleef staan en riep hen, en zeide: Wat wilt gij dat Ik u doen zal?
[20:33] Zij zeiden tot Hem: Heere, dat onze oogen geopend worden!
[20:34] En Jezus met hen bewogen zijnde, raakte hun oogen aan; en terstond zagen zij op en zij volgden Hem.  
[21:1] Toen zij nu Jerusalem naderden en te Bethfagé aan den berg der Olijven kwamen, zond Jezus twee discipelen en zeide tot hen:
[21:2] Gaat naar het dorp daar tegenover u, en terstond zult gij een ezelin vinden, die vastgebonden is, en een veulen bij haar; maakt die los en brengt ze tot Mij; 
[21:3] en als soms iemand iets tot u zegt, dan moet gij zeggen dat de Heere ze noodig heeft; en terstond zal hij ze laten volgen.
[21:4] Dit nu geschiedde, opdat vervuld zou worden het woord, dat door den profeet gesproken is:
[21:5] Zegt tot de dochter Sions: Zie, uw Koning komt tot u, zachtmoedig en gezeten op een ezelin en op een veulen, het jong van een lastdier.
[21:6] En de discipelen gingen heen en deden gelijk Jezus hun bevolen had.
[21:7] Zij brachten de ezelin en het veulen, en leiden er hun kleederen op; en Jezus ging daarop zitten.
[21:8] En de grootste menigte spreidde hun kleederen op den weg, en anderen sneden takken van de boomen en spreidden die op den weg.
[21:9] En de scharen die vóór Hem gingen en die volgden riepen, zeggende: Hosannah, den Zoon van David! Gezegend Hij die komt in den Naam des Heeren! Hosannah, in het allerhoogste!
[21:10] En toen Hij binnen Jerusalem kwam, geraakte de gansche stad in roeren, zeggende: Wie is deze?
[21:11] En de scharen zeiden: Deze is de profeet Jezus, van Nazaret in Galilea. 
[21:12]  En Jezus ging naar den tempel Gods en Hij wierp daaruit allen die kochten en verkochten in den tempel, en de tafelen der wisselaars keerde Hij om, en de zetels van de duivenverkoopers.
[21:13] En Hij zeide tot hen: Er is geschreven: Mijn huis zal een huis des gebeds genoemd worden, maar gij hebt het gemaakt tot een roovershol.
[21:14] En er kwamen blinden en kreupelen tot Hem in den tempel en Hij genas hen.
[21:15] En toen de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden de mirakelen zagen die Hij deed, en de kinderen die in den tempel riepen: Hosannah! den Zoon van David! — toen werden zij kwaad,
[21:16] en zeiden tot Hem: Hoort gij wel wat dezen zeggen? En Jezus zeide tot hen: Ja! hebt gij nooit gelezen: Uit den mond van kinderen en zuigelingen hebt Gij U lof bereid?
[21:17] En Hij verliet hen en ging de stad uit naar Bethanië en overnachtte aldaar. 
[21:18]  Toen Hij nu des morgens vroeg naar de stad terugkeerde, had Hij honger.
[21:19] En een vijgeboom aan den weg ziende, ging Hij er naar toe; en Hij vond er niets aan dan alleen bladeren. En Hij zeide: Dat er nooit in der eeuwigheid meer vrucht aan u kome! En de vijgeboom verdorde terstond.
[21:20] En de discipelen dit ziende, verwonderden zich en zeiden: Hoe is de vijgeboom terstond verdord!
[21:21] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u: Indien gij geloof hebt en niet twijfelt, dan zult gij niet alleen doen wat den vijgeboom is geschied, maar al zegt gij dan ook tot dien berg: Hef u op, en werp u in de zee! — het zal geschieden.
[21:22] En alles wat gij geloovig begeeren zult in het gebed, dat zult gij ontvangen. 
[21:23]  En toen Hij in den tempel was gekomen, kwamen de overpriesters en de oudsten des volks tot Hem, terwijl Hij leerde, en zij zeiden: Door welke macht doet Gij deze dingen? en wie heeft u deze macht gegeven?
[21:24] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Ik zal u ook één ding vragen; zoo gij Mij dit zegt, dan zal Ik u ook zeggen door welke macht Ik deze dingen doe.
[21:25] De doop van Johannes, vanwaar was die? uit den hemel of uit de menschen?
[21:26] En zij overleiden bij zich zelven, zeggende: Als wij zeggen: Uit den hemel, dan zal Hij tot ons zeggen: Waarom hebt gij hem dan niet geloofd? En als wij zeggen: Uit de menschen, dan vreezen wij het volk, want allen houden Johannes voor een profeet.
[21:27] En zij antwoordden Jezus en zeiden: Wij weten het niet. Toen zeide ook Hij tot hen: Dan zeg Ik u ook niet door welke macht Ik deze dingen doe. 
[21:28]  Maar wat dunkt u? Iemand had twee zonen. En hij kwam tot den een en zeide: Zoon, ga vandaag in mijn wijngaard werken!
[21:29] Doch hij antwoordde en zeide: Ik wil niet. Maar later had hij berouw en ging.
[21:30] En tot den ander komende, zeide hij hetzelfde. En die antwoordde en zeide: Ik ga, heer! maar hij ging niet.
[21:31] Wie van de twee heeft den wil van den vader gedaan? — Zij zeiden: De eerste. Jezus zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u dat de tollenaars en de hoeren u voorgaan in het koninkrijk Gods.
[21:32] Want Johannes is tot u gekomen in den weg der rechtvaardigheid, en gij hebt hem niet geloofd. Maar de tollenaars en de hoeren hebben hem geloofd; en ofschoon gij dit gezien hebt, hebt gij toch later geen berouw gehad, om hem te gelooven. 
[21:33]  Hoort een andere gelijkenis: Er was een heer des huizes die een wijngaard plantte; en hij leide er een haag rond en groef er een wijnpers in, en hij bouwde een wachttoren, en verhuurde den wijngaard aan landlieden en ging buitenslands.
[21:34] Toen nu de tijd der vruchten naderde, zond hij zijn dienaren naar de landlieden om zijn vruchten te ontvangen.
[21:35] En de landlieden grepen zijn dienaren, en sloegen den een, en doodden den ander, en steenigden een derde.
[21:36] Wederom zond hij andere dienaren, meer in getal dan de eersten, en die handelden zij evenzoo.
[21:37] Ten laatste zond hij tot hen zijn zoon, zeggende: Zij zullen toch mijn zoon wel ontzien!
[21:38] Maar de landlieden den zoon ziende, spraken onder malkander: Deze is de erfgenaam! komt, laat ons hem dooden en zijn erfenis aan ons houden!
[21:39] En zij namen hem, wierpen hem buiten den wijngaard en doodden hem.
[21:40] Als dan de heer des wijngaards komt, wat zal hij aan die landlieden doen?
[21:41] Zij zeiden tot Hem: Hij zal die boozen schrikkelijk verderven, en den wijngaard zal hij verhuren aan andere landlieden, die hem zijn vruchten zullen opbrengen op zijn tijd.
[21:42] Jezus zeide tot hen: Hebt gij nooit gelezen in de Schriften: De steen dien de bouwlieden verworpen hebben, deze is geworden tot een hoeksteen; vanwege den Heere is dit geschied, en het is wonderbaar in onze oogen?
[21:43] Daarom zeg Ik ulieden dat van u het koninkrijk Gods zal weggenomen worden, en gegeven aan een volk dat zijn vruchten voortbrengt.
[21:44] Want al wie over dezen steen valt, die zal verpletterd worden, en op wien hij valt, dien zal hij vermorzelen.
[21:45] En als de overpriesters en de fariseërs zijn gelijkenissen hoorden, verstonden zij dat Hij van hen sprak.
[21:46] En zij zochten Hem te vangen, maar zij vreesden de scharen, omdat die Hem voor een profeet hielden.  
[22:1] En Jezus antwoordde en sprak wederom tot hen in gelijkenissen, zeggende:
[22:2] Het koninkrijk der hemelen is gelijk aan een koning, die voor zijn zoon een bruiloft bereidde.
[22:3] En hij zond zijn dienaren om de genoodigden tot de bruiloft te roepen; en zij wilden niet komen.
[22:4] Wederom zond hij andere dienaren, zeggende: Zegt tot de genoodigden: Ziet, mijn maaltijd heb ik gereed, mijn ossen en mestvee zijn geslacht en alles is gereed; komt tot de bruiloft!
[22:5] Maar zij letten er niet op en gingen heen, de een naar zijn akker en de ander naar zijn koophandel.
[22:6] Doch de anderen grepen zijn dienaren en mishandelden en doodden hen.
[22:7] Toen werd de koning toornig als hij dit hoorde, en hij zond zijn krijgslieden en vernielde die moordenaars en stak hun stad in brand.
[22:8] Toen zeide hij tot zijn dienaren: Mijn bruiloft is gereed, maar de genoodigden waren het niet waardig.
[22:9] Gaat dan naar de uitgangen der wegen en roept zoovelen als gij er vindt tot de bruiloft.
[22:10] En die dienaren gingen heen naar de wegen en verzamelden allen die ze vonden, kwaden en goeden. En de bruiloftzaal werd vol gasten.
[22:11] Doch toen de koning binnenkwam om de gasten te zien, zag hij daar een mensch die geen bruiloftskleed aanhad.
[22:12] En hij zeide tot hem: Vriend! hoe zijt gij hier binnengekomen zonder bruiloftskleed? Maar hij verstomde.
[22:13] Toen zeide de koning tot de dienaren: Bindt hem handen en voeten, neemt hem weg, en werpt hem in de duisternis daarbuiten; daar zal het geween zijn en het tandengeknars.
[22:14] Want velen zijn geroepen, doch weinigen uitverkoren. 
[22:15]  Toen gingen de fariseërs heen en beraadslaagden samen om Hem in zijn rede te verstrikken.
[22:16] En zij zonden tot Hem hun discipelen met de Herodianen, zeggende: Meester, wij weten dat Gij waarachtig zijt en den weg Gods in waarheid leert, en dat Gij niemand ontziet, want Gij ziet niet op den persoon des menschen.
[22:17] Zeg ons dan: Wat dunkt U? Is het geoorloofd om aan den keizer belasting te geven of niet?
[22:18] Doch Jezus hun valschheid kennende, zeide tot hen: Wat verzoekt gij Mij, gij geveinsden?
[22:19] Toont Mij de schattingsmunt! En zij brachten Hem een penning.
[22:20] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Van wien is dit beeld en dit opschrift?
[22:21] Zij zeiden: Van den keizer. Toen zeide Hij tot hen: Geeft dan aan den keizer wat den keizer, en aan God wat Gode toekomt.
[22:22] En toen, zij dit hoorden, verwonderden zij zich, en Hem daarlatende, vertrokken zij. 
[22:23]  Op dien zelfden dag kwamen er sadduceërs tot Hem, die zeggen dat er geen verrijzenis is, en zij vroegen Hem, zeggende:
[22:24] Meester! Mozes heeft gezegd: Als iemand zonder kinderen sterft, dan zal zijn broeder diens vrouw trouwen en aan zijn broeder nakomelingschap verwekken.
[22:25] Daar waren nu bij ons zeven broeders; en de eerste stierf getrouwd, en daar hij geen kinderen had, liet hij zijn vrouw na voor zijn broeder;
[22:26] en zoo ook de tweede en de derde, tot den zevende toe.
[22:27] Ten laatste van allen stierf ook de vrouw.
[22:28] In de verrijzenis dan, wiens vrouw van de zeven zal zij zijn? want allen hebben haar gehad.
[22:29] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Gij doolt, omdat gij de Schrifturen niet kent, noch de kracht Gods.
[22:30] Want in de verrijzenis trouwen zij niet en worden zij niet getrouwd, maar zij zijn als de engelen Gods in den hemel.
[22:31] Wat nu de verrijzenis der dooden belangt: hebt gij niet gelezen wat door God tot u gesproken is, als Hij zegt:
[22:32] Ik ben de God van Abraham, en de God van Isaäk, en de God van Jakob? Hij is toch geen God van dooden, maar van levenden!
[22:33] En toen de scharen dit hoorden, waren zij verwonderd over zijn onderwijs. 
[22:34]  En de fariseërs, hoorende dat Hij aan de sadduceërs den mond gestopt had, kwamen bijeen.
[22:35] En een uit hen, een wetgeleerde, Hem verzoekende, vroeg Hem:
[22:36] Meester! welk is het groote gebod in de wet?
[22:37] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Gij zult beminnen den Heere, uw God, met geheel uw hart, en met geheel uw ziel, en met geheel uw verstand.
[22:38] Dit is het eerste en groote gebod.
[22:39] Het tweede, daaraan gelijk, is: Gij zult uw naaste beminnen als uzelven.
[22:40] Aan deze twee geboden hangt de gansche wet en de profeten. 
[22:41]  Terwijl nu de fariseërs bijeen waren, vroeg Jezus hun, zeggende:
[22:42] Wat dunkt u van den Christus? Wiens zoon is Hij? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Van David.
[22:43] Hij zeide tot hen: Hoe noemt Hem David in den Geest dan Heere, als hij zegt:
[22:44] De Heere heeft gezegd tot mijn Heere: Zit aan mijn rechterhand totdat Ik uw vijanden gelegd heb onder uw voeten?
[22:45] Indien dan David Hem Heere noemt, hoe is Hij zijn zoon?
[22:46] En niemand kon Hem een woord antwoorden; ook durfde niemand Hem van dien dag af iets meer vragen.  
[23:1] Toen sprak Jezus tot de scharen en tot zijn discipelen, zeggende:
[23:2] De schriftgeleerden en de fariseërs zijn gezeten op den leerstoel van Mozes.
[23:3] Doet dan en onderhoudt alles wat zij u zeggen dat gij houden zult; maar doet niet naar hun werken, want zij zeggen het wel, maar doen het niet.
[23:4] Want zij binden zware en ondragelijke lasten samen, en leggen die op de schouders der menschen; maar zij zelven willen die met hun vinger niet aanraken.
[23:5] En al hun werken doen zij om door de menschen gezien te worden; want zij maken hun gedenkcedels breed en de boorden van hun kleederen groot.
[23:6] En zij zitten gaarne vooraan bij de maaltijden en in de synagogen.
[23:7] En zij worden gaarne gegroet op de markten en door de menschen Meester genoemd.
[23:8] Maar gij, laat u niet Meester noemen; want één is uw Meester, namelijk de Christus, en gij allen zijt broeders.
[23:9] En noemt niemand op aarde Vader; want één is uw Vader, die in den hemel is.
[23:10] En laat u ook niet Leeraar noemen; want één is uw Leeraar, de Christus.
[23:11] Maar de meeste van u zal uw dienaar zijn.
[23:12] En wie zich zelven verhoogt, zal vernederd worden! en wie zich zelven vernedert, zal verhoogd worden.
[23:13] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! omdat gij het koninkrijk der hemelen sluit voor de menschen; want gij gaat er zelf niet binnen, en die er zouden binnengaan, belet gij om binnen te gaan.
[23:14] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! omdat gij de huizen der weduwen opeet, en dat onder den schijn van lang te bidden; daarom zult gij te zwaarder oordeel ontvangen.
[23:15] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! omdat gij zee en land afreist om één proseliet te maken, en wanneer hij het is geworden, dan maakt gij hem een kind der hel, tweemaal meer dan gij zelf zijt.
[23:16] Wee u, gij blinde leidslieden! die zegt: Bij den tempel te zweren, dat is niets; maar zoo wie zweert bij het goud van den tempel, die is gebonden.
[23:17] Gij dwazen en blinden! wat is er toch meer, het goud, of de tempel die het goud heiligt?
[23:18] En bij den altaar te zweren, dat is niets; maar, zoo wie zweert bij de gave die daarop is, die is gebonden.
[23:19] Gij dwazen en blinden! wat is toch meer, de gave, of de altaar die de gave heiligt?
[23:20] Die dan zweert bij den altaar, zweert bij dien en bij al wat er op is.
[23:21] En wie bij den tempel zweert, zweert bij dezen en bij Hem die er in woont.
[23:22] En wie zweert bij den hemel, zweert bij den troon van God en bij Hem die daarop zit.
[23:23] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! want gij geeft de tienden van de munte, en van de dille, en van het komijn, en gij laat het gewichtigste van de wet na, het recht en de barmhartigheid en de getrouwheid. Het eene nu moest gij doen en het andere niet nalaten.
[23:24] Gij blinde leidslieden! de mug zift gij uit, maar den kameel zwelgt gij door!
[23:25] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! want gij zuivert het buitenste van den beker en van den schotel, maar van binnen zijn zij vol roof en onmatigheid.
[23:26] Gij blinde fariseër! zuiver eerst het binnenste van den beker en van den schotel, opdat ook zijn buitenste gezuiverd worde.
[23:27] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! want gij gelijkt op de gewitte grafsteden die van buiten wel schoon schijnen, maar van binnen vol zijn van doodsbeenderen en allerlei onzuiverheid.
[23:28] Zoo ook schijnt gij van buiten voor de menschen wel rechtvaardig, maar van binnen zijt gij vol geveinsdheid en goddeloosheid.
[23:29] Wee u, schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! want gij bouwt de graven der profeten op, en versiert de grafteekenen der rechtvaardigen,
[23:30] en gij zegt: Indien wij er geweest waren in de dagen onzer vaderen, dan zouden wij met hen geen deel genomen hebben aan den moord der profeten.
[23:31] Alzoo getuigt gij dus tegen u zelven dat gij kinderen zijt van de profeten–moordenaars,
[23:32] en gij— maakt de maat uwer vaderen vol!
[23:33] Gij slangen– en adderengebroed! hoe zoudt gij het vonnis der hel ontvlieden?
[23:34] Daarom ziet, Ik zend tot u profeten en wijzen en schriftgeleerden, en sommigen van hen zult gij dooden en kruisigen, en anderen zult gij geeselen in uw synagogen en vervolgen van stad tot stad.
[23:35] Opdat op u kome al het rechtvaardige bloed dat op de aarde vergoten is, van het bloed van den rechtvaardigen Abel af, tot op het bloed van Zacharias, een zoon van Barachias, dien gij vermoord hebt tusschen den tempel en den altaar.
[23:36] Voorwaar Ik zeg u, dit alles zal komen over deze natie! 
[23:37]  Jerusalem, Jerusalem! dat de profeten doodt en steenigt die tot u gezonden zijn! hoe dikwijls heb Ik uw kinderen willen bijeenvergaderen gelijk een klokhen haar kiekens bijeenvergadert onder de vleugelen! en gij hebt niet gewild!
[23:38] Zie, uw huis wordt u woest gelaten!
[23:39] Want Ik zeg u: Gij zult Mij van nu aan niet meer zien, totdat gij zeggen, zult: Gezegend Hij, die komt in den Naam des Heeren!  
[24:1] En Jezus ging uit den tempel en vertrok. En zijn discipelen kwamen om Hem de gebouwen des tempels te toonen.
[24:2] Doch Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Ziet gij niet dit alles? Voorwaar Ik zeg u, hier zullen geen twee steenen op malkander gelaten worden, die niet zullen afgebroken worden.
[24:3] En toen Hij op den Berg der Olijven zat, kwamen de discipelen tot Hem afzonderlijk, zeggende: Zeg ons, wanneer zal dit zijn? en wat is het teeken van uw toekomst en van de voleinding der eeuw?
[24:4] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Ziet toe, dat niemand u verleide!
[24:5] Want velen zullen komen onder mijn Naam, zeggende: Ik hen de Christus; en velen zullen zij verleiden.
[24:6] En gij zult hooren van oorlogen en oorlogsgeruchten! Ziet toe en verschrikt niet! want dit moet geschieden, maar nog is het einde er niet.
[24:7] Want het eene volk zal opstaan tegen het andere, en het eene koninkrijk tegen het andere, en er zullen allerwege hongersnooden, en pest, en aardbevingen zijn.
[24:8] En dit alles is maar een begin van de smarten.
[24:9] Dan zal men u overleveren tot verdrukking, en men zal u dooden, en gij zult gehaat zijn door al de volken, om mijns Naams wil.
[24:10] En dan zullen velen geërgerd worden, malkander overleveren en malkander haten.
[24:11] En vele valsche profeten zullen verwekt worden en die zullen velen verleiden.
[24:12] En door het toenemen der goddeloosheid zal de liefde van velen verminderen.
[24:13] Maar wie zal volharden tot het einde, die zal behouden worden.
[24:14] En dit Evangelie des koninkrijks zal gepredikt worden over de geheele aarde, tot een getuigenis voor alle volken; en dan zal het einde komen.
[24:15] Wanneer gij dan den gruwel der verwoesting, waarvan gesproken is door Daniël den profeet, zult zien staan in de heilige plaats (die het leest lette er op!):
[24:16] dat alsdan degenen die in Judea zijn, vluchten op de bergen.
[24:17] Die op het dak is, kome dan niet af om weg te nemen wat in zijn huis is,
[24:18] en die op den akker is, keere niet terug om zijn kleed weg te nemen.
[24:19] Maar wee den zwangeren en den zogenden in die dagen!
[24:20] En bidt dat uw vlucht niet geschiede des winters of op een sabbat.
[24:21] Want alsdan zal de verdrukking groot zijn, zooals er geen is geweest van het begin der wereld tot nu toe, en er ook geen zijn zal.
[24:22] En wanneer die dagen niet verkort waren, zou er niet één mensch behouden worden; maar om de uitverkorenen zullen die dagen verkort worden.
[24:23] Zoo iemand dan tot u zegt: Ziet, hier de Christus! of daar! — gelooft het niet.
[24:24] Want er zullen schijnchristussen en schijnprofeten opstaan, en die zullen groote teekenen en mirakelen doen, zoodat zij zelfs, als het mogelijk was, de uitverkorenen zouden in doling brengen.
[24:25] Ziet, Ik heb het u voorzegd!
[24:26] Zoo zij dan tot u zeggen: Ziet, in de woestijn is Hij! gaat dan niet uit. Ziet, in de binnenkameren! gelooft het niet.
[24:27] Want gelijk de bliksem uitgaat van het oosten en schijnt tot het westen, alzoo zal de toekomst zijn van den Zoon des menschen.
[24:28] Want waar het lijk is, daar zullen de arenden vergaderd worden.
[24:29] En terstond na de verdrukking dier dagen zal de zon verduisterd worden, en de maan zal haar licht niet geven, en de sterren zullen van den hemel vallen, en de krachten der hemelen zullen beroerd worden.
[24:30] En dan zal het teeken van den Zoon des menschen verschijnen aan den hemel, en al de geslachten der aarde zullen weenen en den Zoon des menschen zien komen op de wolken des hemels met kracht en veel glorie.
[24:31] En Hij zal zijn engelen uitzenden met sterk bazuingeluid, en die zullen zijn uitverkorenen bijeenvergaderen uit de vier windstreken, van het ééne einde der hemelen tot het andere. 
[24:32]  Leert dan van den vijgeboom deze gelijkenis: Zoodra zijn tak zacht wordt en de bladeren uitbotten, weet gij dat de zomer nabij is.
[24:33] Alzoo ook gij, als gij dit alles ziet, dan weet gij dat Hij nabij is, vóór de deur.
[24:34] Voorwaar Ik zeg u, dat deze natie niet zal voorbijgaan totdat dit alles zal geschied zijn.
[24:35] De hemel en de aarde zullen voorbijgaan, maar mijn woorden zullen niet voorbijgaan.
[24:36] Doch van dien dag en die ure weet niemand, ook niet de engelen der hemelen, maar wel mijn Vader alleen.
[24:37] En gelijk de dagen van Noach, alzoo zal de toekomst van den Zoon des menschen zijn.
[24:38] Want gelijk zij waren in de dagen vóór den zondvloed, etende en drinkende, trouwende en ten huwelijk gevende, tot op den dag zelven dat Noach naar de ark ging,
[24:39] en het niet begrepen, totdat de zondvloed kwam en allen wegnam, — alzoo zal ook zijn de toekomst van den Zoon des menschen.
[24:40] Dan zullen er twee zijn op den akker; de een wordt medegenomen en de ander achtergelaten.
[24:41] Twee zullen er malen in den molen; de eene wordt medegenomen en de andere achtergelaten.
[24:42] Waakt dus, want gij weet niet op welken dag uw Heer komt.
[24:43] Maar dit verstaat gij, dat, als de heer des huizes geweten had in welke nachtwake de dief zou komen, hij zou gewaakt hebben en niet toegelaten dat zijn huis doorgraven werd.
[24:44] Daarom, zijt ook gij bereid, want in een ure waarin gij het niet meent, komt de Zoon des menschen.
[24:45] Wie is toch de getrouwe en verstandige dienst knecht, dien de heer heeft gesteld over zijn huisgezin, om hun voedsel te geven op zijn tijd?
[24:46] Zalig die dienstknecht, wien zijn heer, als hij komt, zal vinden alzoo doende!
[24:47] Voorwaar Ik zeg u, dat hij hem zal stellen over al zijn goederen.
[24:48] Maar wanneer die booze dienstknecht in zijn hart zou zeggen: Mijn heer vertoeft!
[24:49] en hij begint zijn mededienstknechten te slaan, en hij eet en drinkt met de dronkaards; 
[24:50] dan zal de heer van dien dienstknecht komen op een dag waarop hij het niet verwacht, en in een ure waarin hij het niet meent,
[24:51] en hij zal hem in stukken houwen, en zijn deel stellen met de geveinsden. Daar zal het geween zijn en het tandengeknars.  
[25:1] Dan zal het koninkrijk der hemelen gelijk zijn aan tien maagden, die haar lampen namen en uitgingen den bruidegom te gemoet.
[25:2] Vijf van haar nu waren wijs en vijf waren dwaas.
[25:3] Want de dwazen namen wel de lampen, maar namen geen olie met zich.
[25:4] Doch de wijzen namen olie in haar vaten met haar lampen.
[25:5] Als nu de bruidegom vertoefde, werden zij allen sluimerig en vielen in slaap.
[25:6] Maar midden in den nacht kwam er een geroep: Ziet, de bruidegom! gaat uit, hem te gemoet!
[25:7] Toen stonden al die maagden op, en zij maakten haar lampen schoon.
[25:8] Doch de dwazen zeiden tot de wijzen: Geeft ons van uw olie, omdat onze lampen uitgaan.
[25:9] Maar de wijzen antwoordden en zeiden: Dan zou er misschien voor ons en voor u niet genoeg zijn; gaat liever tot de verkoopers en koopt voor u zelven.
[25:10] Terwijl zij nu heengingen om te koopen, kwam de bruidegom, en die gereed waren, gingen met hem in tot de bruiloft. En de deur werd gesloten.
[25:11] En eindelijk kwamen ook de andere maagden, zeggende: Heere, heere, doe ons open!
[25:12] En hij antwoordde en zeide: Voorwaar ik zeg u, ik ken u niet!
[25:13] Waakt dan! want gij weet den dag niet, noch het uur. 
[25:14]  Want het is als een mensch die, buitenslands gaande, zijn eigen dienstknechten riep en hun zijn goederen overgaf,
[25:15] en aan den een gaf hij vijf talenten, aan den ander twee, aan den derde één, een ieder naar zijn bekwaamheid, en hij vertrok terstond.
[25:16] Die nu vijf talenten ontvangen had, ging heen en dreef met deze handel, en won vijf andere talenten.
[25:17] Zoo ook die de twee ontvangen had, won ook zelf twee andere.
[25:18] Maar die het ééne ontvangen had, ging heen en groef in den grond en verborg het geld van zijn heer.
[25:19] Een langen tijd daarna nu kwam de heer van die dienstknechten en hield afrekening met hen.
[25:20] En die de vijf talenten ontvangen had, kwam en bracht vijf andere talenten, zeggende: Heer, vijf talenten hebt gij mij toevertrouwd, zie, ik heb vijf andere talenten er bij gewonnen.
[25:21] Zijn heer zeide tot hem: Wel gedaan! gij goede en trouwe dienstknecht: Over weinig zijt gij getrouw geweest, over veel zal ik u stellen; ga binnen de vreugde van uw heer!
[25:22] En die de twee talenten ontvangen had, kwam ook, en zeide: Heer, twee talenten hebt gij mij toevertrouwd; zie, ik heb twee andere talenten er bij gewonnen.
[25:23] Zijn heer zeide tot hem: Wel gedaan! gij goede en trouwe dienstknecht! over weinig zijt gij getrouw geweest, over veel zal ik u stellen: ga binnen de vreugde van uw heer!
[25:24] En die het ééne talent ontvangen had, kwam ook en zeide: Heer, ik kende u, dat gij een hardvochtig mensch zijt, die maait waar gij niet hebt gezaaid, en verzamelt waar gij niet hebt gestrooid.
[25:25] En bevreesd zijnde, ben ik heengegaan, en heb ik uw talent verborgen in den grond; zie, daar hebt gij het uwe.
[25:26] En zijn heer antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Gij booze en luie dienstknecht! gij wist dat ik maai waar ik niet gezaaid heb, en verzamel waar ik niet gestrooid heb.
[25:27] Gij hadt dan mijn geld bij de bankiers moeten uitzetten, en ik zou, als ik kwam, het mijne met rente hebben terug ontvangen.
[25:28] Neemt dan van hem het talent af en geeft het aan hem die de tien talenten heeft.
[25:29] Want aan ieder die heeft, zal gegeven worden en hij zal overvloed hebben; maar van hem die niet heeft, zal ook hetgeen hij heeft ontnomen worden.
[25:30] En werpt den onnutten dienstknecht uit in de buitenste duisternis; daar zal zijn het geween en het tandengeknars. 
[25:31]  En als de Zoon des menschen zal gekomen zijn in zijn glorie en al de heilige engelen met Hem, dan zal Hij zitten op den troon zijner glorie.
[25:32] En vóór Hem zullen al de volken vergaderd worden, en Hij zal die van malkander scheiden, gelijk de herder de schapen van de bokken scheidt.
[25:33] En de schapen zal Hij stellen aan zijn rechter– en de bokken aan zijn linkerhand.
[25:34] Dan zal de Koning zeggen tot hen die aan zijn rechterhand zijn: Komt, gij gezegenden mijns Vaders, beërft het koninkrijk dat u is bereid van de grondlegging der wereld.
[25:35] Want Ik heb honger gehad, en gij hebt Mij te eten gegeven; Ik heb dorst gehad, en gij hebt Mij te drinken gegeven; Ik was een vreemdeling, en gij hebt Mij geherbergd; 
[25:36] naakt, en gij hebt Mij gekleed; Ik was krank, en gij hebt Mij bezocht; Ik was in de gevangenis, en gij zijt tot Mij gekomen.
[25:37] Dan zullen Hem de rechtvaardigen antwoorden, zeggende: Heere, wanneer hebben wij U hongerig gezien, en U gespijzigd? of dorstig, en U te drinken gegeven?
[25:38] Wanneer hebben wij U een vreemdeling gezien, en U geherbergd? of naakt, en U gekleed?
[25:39] Wanneer hebben wij U krank gezien, of in de gevangenis, en zijn tot U gekomen?
[25:40] En de Koning zal antwoorden en tot hen zeggen: Voorwaar Ik zeg u, voor zooveel gij dit gedaan hebt aan een der geringsten van deze mijn broeders, hebt gij het aan Mij gedaan.
[25:41] Dan zal Hij ook zeggen tot die aan zijn linkerhand: Gaat van Mij weg, gij vervloekten! naar het eeuwige vuur, dat bereid is voor den duivel en zijn engelen.
[25:42] Want Ik heb honger gehad, en gij hebt Mij niet te eten gegeven; Ik heb dorst gehad, en gij hebt Mij niet te drinken gegeven; 
[25:43] Ik was een vreemdeling, en gij hebt Mij niet geherbergd; naakt, en gij hebt Mij niet gekleed; krank en in de gevangenis, en gij hebt Mij niet bezocht.
[25:44] Dan zullen ook die antwoorden en zeggen: Heere, wanneer hebben wij U hongerig gezien, of dorstig, of een vreemdeling, of naakt, of krank, of in de gevangenis, en wij hebben U niet gediend?
[25:45] Dan zal Hij antwoorden en tot hen zeggen: Voorwaar Ik zeg u, voor zooveel gij dit niet gedaan hebt aan één van deze geringsten, zoo hebt gij het aan Mij niet gedaan.
[25:46] En dezen zullen heengaan tot eeuwige pijniging, maar de rechtvaardigen ten eeuwigen leven.  
[26:1] En het geschiedde toen Jezus al deze woorden geëindigd had, dat Hij tot zijn discipelen zeide:
[26:2] Gij weet het dat na twee dagen paaschfeest is, en dat de Zoon des menschen wordt overgeleverd om gekruisigd te worden. 
[26:3]  Toen vergaderden de overpriesters, en de schriftgeleerden, en de oudsten des volks in de zaal van den hoogepriester, genaamd Kajafas,
[26:4] en zij beraadslaagden om Jezus door list te vatten en te dooden;
[26:5] doch zij zeiden: Niet op het feest, opdat er geen oproer zij onder het volk. 
[26:6]  Toen nu Jezus in Bethanië was, in het huis van Simon, den melaatsche,
[26:7] kwam tot Hem een vrouw die een albasten flesch had met kostbaren balsem, en zij goot dien uit over zijn hoofd terwijl Hij aanlag.
[26:8] En de discipelen dit ziende, namen het zeer kwalijk, zeggende: Waartoe dit verlies?
[26:9] want dit had duur verkocht kunnen worden en aan de armen gegeven.
[26:10] Maar Jezus bemerkte dit en zeide: Waarom doet gij deze vrouw moeite aan? want zij heeft een goed werk aan Mij gedaan.
[26:11] Want de armen hebt gij altijd bij u, maar Mij hebt gij niet altijd.
[26:12] Want dat zij dezen balsem over mijn lichaam gegoten heeft, dit deed zij ter voorbereiding mijner begrafenis!
[26:13] Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, overal waar dit Evangelie in de gansche wereld zal verkondigd worden, zal ook van hetgeen deze gedaan heeft, tot haar gedachtenis worden gesproken. 
[26:14]  Toen ging een van de twaalven, genaamd Judas Iskariot, tot de overpriesters en zeide:
[26:15] Wat wilt gij mij geven en ik zal Hem aan u overleveren? En zij wogen hem dertig zilverlingen toe.
[26:16] En van toen af zocht hij een geschikte gelegenheid om Hem over te leveren. 
[26:17]  En op den eersten dag der ongedeesemde brooden kwamen de discipelen tot Jezus, zeggende: Waar wilt Gij dat wij toebereidselen voor U maken om het pascha te eten?
[26:18] En Hij zeide: Gaat naar de stad tot zoo iemand, en zegt tot hem: De Meester zegt: Mijn tijd is nabij, bij u houd Ik het paaschfeest met mijn discipelen.
[26:19] En de discipelen deden gelijk Jezus hun bevolen had en bereidden het pascha.
[26:20] Als het nu avond was geworden, lag Hij aan met de twaalf discipelen.
[26:21] En terwijl zij aten zeide Hij: Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden dat één van u Mij zal verraden.
[26:22] En zeer bedroefd geworden zijnde, begon ieder van hen tot Hem te zeggen: Ik ben het toch niet, Heere?
[26:23] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Die met Mij de hand in den schotel indoopt, die zal Mij verraden.
[26:24] De Zoon des menschen gaat wel heen, gelijk van Hem geschreven is; maar wee dien mensch door wien de Zoon des menschen verraden wordt; beter ware het dien mensch zoo hij niet geboren was.
[26:25] En Judas, die Hem verried, zeide: Ik ben het toch niet, Meester? Hij zeide tot hem: Gij hebt het gezegd.
[26:26] En terwijl zij aten, nam Jezus brood, en gedankt hebbende, brak Hij het en gaf het aan de discipelen en zeide: Neemt, eet; dat is mijn lichaam.
[26:27] En een beker nemende, dankte Hij en gaf hun dien, zeggende: Drinkt allen daaruit,
[26:28] want dit is mijn bloed, des Nieuwen Verbonds, dat voor velen vergoten wordt tot vergiffenis der zonden.
[26:29] En Ik zeg u, Ik zal van nu af niet meer drinken van deze vrucht des wijnstoks tot op dien dag als Ik ze met u nieuw zal drinken in het koninkrijk mijns Vaders. 
[26:30]  En als zij den lofzang gezongen hadden, gingen zij uit naar den Berg der Olijven.
[26:31] Toen zeide Jezus tot hen: Gij zult allen aan Mij geërgerd worden in dezen nacht; want er is geschreven: Ik zal den herder slaan en de schapen der kudde zullen verstrooid worden.
[26:32] Maar nadat Ik zal verrezen zijn, zal Ik u voorgaan naar Galilea.
[26:33] En Petrus antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Al werden ook allen aan U geërgerd, zoo zal ik toch nimmer geërgerd worden.
[26:34] Jezus zeide tot hem: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u, dat gij in dezen zelfden nacht, voordat een haan kraait, Mij driemaal zult verloochenen.
[26:35] Petrus zeide tot Hem: Al moest ik dan ook met U sterven, U verloochenen zal ik niet. Evenzoo spraken ook al de discipelen. 
[26:36]  Toen ging Jezus met hen naar een plaats, genaamd Gethsemane, en Hij zeide tot de discipelen: Zit hier neder, totdat Ik daar zal gegaan zijn om te bidden.
[26:37] En Petrus en de twee zonen van Zebedeüs medenemende, begon Hij bedroefd en zeer benauwd te worden.
[26:38] Toen zeide Hij tot hen: Mijn ziel is diep bedroefd tot stervens toe! blijft hier en waakt met Mij!
[26:39] En een weinig voortgaande, viel Hij op het aangezicht, biddende en zeggende: Vader, indien het mogelijk is, laat dezen beker van Mij voorbijgaan! Doch niet zooals Ik wil, maar zooals Gij wilt.
[26:40] En Hij kwam tot de discipelen en vond hen slapende, en zeide tot Petrus: Zoo hebt gij dan niet één uur met Mij kunnen waken?
[26:41] Waakt en bidt opdat gij niet in bekoring komt! de geest is wel gewillig, maar het vleesch is zwak.
[26:42] En voor de tweede maal heengaande, bad Hij, zeggende: Mijn Vader! als deze beker van Mij niet voorbijgaan kan, tenzij dat Ik hem drinke, uw wil geschiede!
[26:43] En komende, vond Hij hen wederom slapende, want hun oogen waren bezwaard.
[26:44] En hen daar latende, ging Hij wederom heen en bad voor de derde maal, dezelfde woorden sprekende.
[26:45] Toen kwam Hij tot de discipelen en zeide tot hen: Slaapt nu voort en rust! Ziet, de ure is nabij en de Zoon des menschen wordt overgeleverd in de handen der zondaren.
[26:46] Staat op, laat ons gaan! Ziet, hij is nabij die Mij verraadt. 
[26:47]  En terwijl Hij nog sprak, ziet, Judas, een der twaalven, kwam, en met hem een groote schare met zwaarden en stokken, gezonden door de overpriesters en oudsten des volks.
[26:48] En die Hem verried had hun een teeken gegeven, zeggende: Wien ik zal kussen, die is het; grijpt Hem!
[26:49] En terstond kwam hij op Jezus toe en zeide: Gegroet Meester! en hij kuste Hem.
[26:50] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Vriend! waartoe zijt gij hier? Toen traden zij toe en sloegen de handen aan Jezus en grepen Hem.
[26:51] En ziet, een dergenen die met Jezus waren, strekte de hand uit, trok zijn zwaard en trof den dienaar van den hoogepriester en sloeg hem het oor af.
[26:52] Toen zeide Jezus tot hem: Steek uw zwaard weder in zijn scheede; want allen die het zwaard nemen, zullen door het zwaard omkomen.
[26:53] Of meent gij dat Ik mijn Vader nu niet kan bidden, en Hij zal Mij meer dan twaalf legioenen engelen te hulp zenden?
[26:54] Hoe zouden dan de Schriften vervuld worden, omdat het alzoo moet geschieden?
[26:55] Te dier ure zeide Jezus tot de schare: Als tegen een roover zijt gij uitgegaan met zwaarden en stokken om Mij gevangen te nemen! dagelijks was Ik bij u in den tempel gezeten om te leeren, en gij hebt Mij niet gegrepen.
[26:56] Maar dit alles is geschied opdat de Schriften der profeten zouden vervuld worden. — Toen verlieten Hem al de discipelen en zij vluchtten. 
[26:57]  Maar zij die Jezus gegrepen hadden, voerden Hem naar Kajafas, den hoogepriester, waar de schriftgeleerden en de oudsten vergaderd waren.
[26:58] Petrus evenwel volgde Hem van verre tot aan den voorhof van den hoogepriester, en hij ging daar binnen en zat bij de dienaren om den afloop te zien.
[26:59] En de overpriesters en de oudsten en de geheele Raad zochten valsch getuigenis tegen Jezus, opdat zij Hem dooden konden.
[26:60] Maar zij vonden niets, ofschoon er vele valsche getuigen opdaagden. Doch ten laatste kwamen er twee valsche getuigen, die zeiden:
[26:61] Deze heeft gezegd: Ik kan den tempel Gods afbreken, en in drie dagen hem weder opbouwen.
[26:62] En de hoogepriester stond op en zeide tot Hem: Antwoordt Gij niets? Wat getuigen dezen tegen U?
[26:63] Maar Jezus zweeg. En de hoogepriester antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Ik bezweer U bij den levenden God, dat Gij ons zegt of Gij de Christus zijt, de Zoon van God!
[26:64] Jezus zeide tot hem: Gij hebt het gezegd; daarenboven zeg Ik ulieden, van nu af zult gij den Zoon des menschen zien, gezeten aan de rechterzijde der Almacht, en komende op de wolken des hemels.
[26:65] Toen scheurde de hoogepriester zijn kleederen en zeide: Hij heeft gelasterd! wat hebben wij nog getuigen van doen? Ziet, nu hebt gij de lastering gehoord!
[26:66] Wat dunkt u? — En zij antwoordden en zeiden: Hij is des doods schuldig!
[26:67] Toen spogen zij Hem in het aangezicht en sloegen Hem met vuisten, en zij sloegen Hem in zijn gezicht, zeggende:
[26:68] Profeteer ons, Christus! Wie is hij, die U sloeg? 
[26:69]  En Petrus zat buiten in den voorhof; en er kwam een dienstmaagd bij hem, die zeide: Ook gij waart met Jezus den Galileër!
[26:70] Doch hij loochende het voor allen, zeggende: Ik weet niet wat gij zegt.
[26:71] En toen hij uitging naar de voorpoort, zag hem een andere, die zeide tot hen die daar waren: Deze was met Jezus den Nazarener!
[26:72] En wederom loochende hij het, met een eed: Ik ken dien mensch niet.
[26:73] En een weinig later kwamen zij, die daar stonden, tot Petrus en zeiden: Waarlijk, gij zijt ook van die, want uw spraak maakt u bekend!
[26:74] Toen begon hij zich te vervloeken en te zweren: Ik ken dien mensch niet! En terstond kraaide een haan.
[26:75] En Petrus herinnerde zich het woord van Jezus, die gezegd had: Eer een haan zal kraaien, zult gij Mij driemaal verloochenen. En naar buiten gaande, weende hij bitter.  
[27:1] En toen het dag geworden was, beraadslaagden al de overpriesters en de oudsten des volks tegen Jezus, om Hem te dooden.
[27:2] En zij bonden Hem en voerden Hem weg en leverden Hem over aan den stadhouder Pontius Pilatus. 
[27:3]  Toen nu Judas, de verrader, zag dat Jezus veroordeeld was, kreeg hij berouw en hij bracht de dertig zilverlingen aan de overpriesters en de oudsten terug en zeide:
[27:4] Ik heb gezondigd door onschuldig bloed te verraden! Maar zij zeiden: Wat gaat ons dat aan? dat is uw zaak!
[27:5] En de zilverlingen in den tempel neergeworpen hebbende, ging hij heen en verworgde zich.
[27:6] Maar de overpriesters namen de zilverlingen en zeiden: Dit geld mag niet in de offerkist worden geworpen, daar het een bloedprijs is!
[27:7] En toen zij beraadslaagd hadden, kochten zij daarvoor den akker van den pottebakker, tot een begraafplaats voor de vreemdelingen.
[27:8] Daarom is die akker tot op den huidigen dag Bloedakker genoemd.
[27:9] Toen is vervuld wat gesproken is door den profeet Jeremia, als hij zegt: En zij hebben de dertig zilverlingen genomen, den prijs des gewaardeerden, dien zij gewaardeerd hebben, van de kinderen Israëls,
[27:10] en zij hebben dien gegeven voor den akker des pottebakkers, gelijk mij de Heere bevolen heeft. 
[27:11]  En Jezus stond voor den stadhouder. En de stadhouder vroeg Hem, zeggende: Zijt Gij de koning der Joden? En Jezus zeide: Gij zegt het.
[27:12] En terwijl Hij door de overpriesters en oudsten beschuldigd werd, antwoordde Hij niets.
[27:13] Toen zeide Pilatus tot Hem: Hoort Gij niet hoeveel dezen tegen U getuigen?
[27:14] Maar Hij antwoordde hem geen enkel woord, zoodat de stadhouder zich zeer verwonderde. 
[27:15]  Tegen het feest nu was de stadhouder gewoon het volk een gevangene los te laten, wien zij wilden.
[27:16] En zij hadden toen een beruchten gevangene, Barabbas genaamd.
[27:17] En toen zij samengekomen waren, zeide Pilatus tot hen: Wien wilt gij dat ik u zal loslaten? Barabbas, of Jezus, die Christus genoemd wordt?
[27:18] Want hij wist dat ze Hem uit nijdigheid hadden overgeleverd.
[27:19] En terwijl hij op den rechterstoel zat, zond zijn vrouw tot hem, zeggende: Bemoei u toch niet met dien Rechtvaardige, want veel heb ik heden in een droom om Hem geleden!
[27:20] Doch de overpriesters en de oudsten stookten de scharen op, dat zij Barabbas zouden eischen en Jezus dooden.
[27:21] En de stadhouder antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wien van deze twee wilt gij dat ik u zal loslaten? En zij zeiden: Barabbas!
[27:22] Pilatus zeide tot hen: Wat zal ik dan doen met Jezus, die Christus genoemd wordt? Zij zeiden allen: Hij moet gekruisigd worden!
[27:23] En hij zeide: Wat kwaad heeft Hij dan gedaan? Maar zij schreeuwden nog sterker: Hij moet gekruisigd worden!
[27:24] En toen Pilatus zag dat hij niets vorderde, maar dat er veeleer oproer kwam, nam hij water en wiesch zich de handen voor de schare, zeggende: Ik ben onschuldig aan het bloed van dezen Rechtvaardige; gij moogt het verantwoorden!
[27:25] En het gansche volk antwoordde en zeide: Zijn bloed kome op ons en op onze kinderen!
[27:26] Toen liet hij hun Barabbas los, en Jezus gegeeseld hebbende, gaf hij Hem over om gekruisigd te worden. 
[27:27]  Toen namen de soldaten van den stadhouder Jezus mede naar het rechthuis en vergaderden tegen Hem de gansche bende.
[27:28] En als zij Hem ontkleed hadden, deden zij Hem een scharlaken mantel om.
[27:29] En zij vlochten een kroon van doornen en die zetten zij op zijn hoofd, en een rietstok in zijn rechterhand. En zij knielden voor Hem neder en bespotten Hem, zeggende: Gegroet, Gij, koning der Joden!
[27:30] En zij spuwden op Hem en namen den rietstok en sloegen Hem op zijn hoofd.
[27:31] En toen zij Hem bespot hadden, trokken zij Hem den mantel af en zijn eigen kleederen aan, en voerden Hem weg om gekruisigd te worden.
[27:32] En toen zij uitgingen vonden zij een man van Cyrene, Simon genaamd. Dezen dwongen zij om zijn kruis op te nemen.
[27:33] En gekomen op de plaats genaamd Golgotha, hetgeen Plaats der Doodshoofden beteekent,
[27:34] gaven ze Hem azijn te drinken met galle vermengd. En toen Hij het geproefd had, wilde Hij niet drinken.
[27:35] En toen zij Hem aan het kruis gehangen hadden, verdeelden zij zijn kleederen door het lot te werpen; opdat vervuld zou worden hetgeen gezegd is door den profeet: Zij hebben mijn kleederen onder malkander verdeeld, en hebben het lot over mijn kleeding geworpen.
[27:36] En zij zaten neder en bewaakten Hem aldaar.
[27:37] En zij stelden boven zijn hoofd zijn beschuldiging, aldus geschreven: Deze is Jezus, de koning der Joden.
[27:38] Toen kruisigden zij met Hem twee moordenaars, een aan zijn rechter– en een aan zijn linkerzijde.
[27:39] En die voorbijgingen lasterden Hem, schudden hun hoofden en zeiden:
[27:40] Gij, tempelafbreker en opbouwer in drie dagen! verlos U zelven! Als Gij Gods Zoon zijt, kom dan af van het kruis!
[27:41] En desgelijks bespotten Hem ook de overpriesters met de schriftgeleerden en de oudsten, zeggende:
[27:42] Anderen heeft Hij verlost, en zich zelven verlossen kan Hij niet! — Koning Israëls is Hij! — Laat Hem nu afkomen van het kruis en wij zullen in Hem gelooven!
[27:43] Op God heeft Hij vertrouwd! Dat die Hem dan nu redde, indien Hij Hem genegen is! Hij heeft toch gezegd: Ik ben Gods Zoon!
[27:44] En hetzelfde verweten Hem ook de moordenaars die met Hem gekruisigd waren. 
[27:45]  En van de zesde ure af was er duisternis over de geheele aarde tot de negende ure toe.
[27:46] En omtrent de negende ure riep Jezus met een groote stem, zeggende: Eli! Eli! lema sabachtanei! dat is: Mijn God! mijn God! waarom hebt Gij Mij verlaten?
[27:47] En sommigen die daar stonden, hoorden dit en zeiden: Deze roept Elias!
[27:48] En terstond liep een van hen, en nam een spons gevuld met azijn en die op een riet gestoken hebbende, gaf hij Hem te drinken.
[27:49] Maar de anderen zeiden: Houd op, laat ons zien of Elias komt om Hem te verlossen!
[27:50] En Jezus wederom roepende met een groote stem, gaf den geest.
[27:51] En ziet, het voorhangsel des tempels scheurde van boven tot beneden in tweeën, en de aarde beefde en de steenrotsen barstten;
[27:52] en de graven werden geopend en vele lichamen van ontslapen heiligen werden opgewekt,
[27:53] en uit de graven uitgegaan zijnde, kwamen zij na zijn verrijzenis in de heilige stad en verschenen aan velen.
[27:54] De hoofdman nu en die met hem waren en Jezus bewaakten, ziende de aardbeving en wat er geschied was, werden zeer bevreesd en zeiden: Waarlijk, Gods Zoon was deze!
[27:55] En daar waren vele vrouwen die het van verre aanschouwden; deze waren Jezus gevolgd van Galilea om Hem te dienen.
[27:56] Onder deze was Maria Magdalena, en Maria, de moeder van Jakobus en Joses, en de moeder der zonen van Zebedeüs. 
[27:57]  Toen het nu avond geworden was, kwam er een rijk man van Arimathea, genaamd Jozef, die ook zelf een discipel van Jezus was.
[27:58] Deze kwam tot Pilatus en verzocht om het lichaam van Jezus. Toen gebood Pilatus het hem te geven.
[27:59] En Jozef nam het lichaam en wond het in rein lijnwaad,
[27:60] en leide het in zijn nieuwen grafkelder, dien hij in een rots had uitgekapt; en als hij een grooten steen had gewenteld tegen den ingang van den grafkelder, ging hij weg.
[27:61] En Maria Magdalena en de andere Maria zaten daar, tegenover het graf.
[27:62] En den volgenden dag, dat is den dag na de voorbereiding, kwamen de overpriesters en de fariseërs tot Pilatus en zeiden:
[27:63] Heer, wij herinneren ons, dat deze verleider, toen Hij nog leefde, gezegd heeft: Na drie dagen zal Ik verrijzen.
[27:64] Beveel dan dat het graf bewaakt worde tot den derden dag toe, opdat zijn discipelen niet komen bij nacht en Hem stelen en tot het volk zeggen: Hij is verrezen van de dooden! En zoo zou het laatste bedrog erger zijn dan het eerste.
[27:65] En Pilatus zeide tot hen: Gij hebt een wacht; gaat heen en bewaakt het zoo goed gij kunt.
[27:66] En zij gingen heen en bewaakten het graf met de wacht, den steen verzegeld hebbende.  
[28:1] En laat na den sabbat, bij het aanbreken van den eersten dag der week, kwam Maria Magdalena en de andere Maria om het graf te bezien.
[28:2] En ziet, er geschiedde een groote aardbeving; want een engel des Heeren daalde uit den hemel en kwam den steen van de deur afwentelen en zat daarop.
[28:3] En zijn aangezicht was als de bliksem, en zijn kleed zoo wit als sneeuw.
[28:4] En door vrees voor hem beefden de wachters, en zij werden als dooden.
[28:5] En de engel antwoordde en zeide tot de vrouwen: Vreest gijlieden niet! want ik weet dat gij Jezus, den gekruisigde, zoekt.
[28:6] Hij is hier niet; want Hij is verrezen zooals Hij gezegd heeft. Komt en ziet de plaats waar de Heere gelegen heeft.
[28:7] En gaat spoedig heen en zegt tot zijn discipelen dat Hij is verrezen van de dooden; en ziet, Hij gaat u voor naar Galilea; daar zult gij Hem zien; ziet, ik heb het u gezegd. 
[28:8]  En spoedig heengaande van het graf met vrees en groote vreugde, liepen zij heen om het aan zijn discipelen te boodschappen.
[28:9] En als zij heengingen om aan zijn discipelen te boodschappen, ziet, Jezus ontmoette haar en zeide: Weest gegroet! En zij kwamen toe en omhelsden zijn voeten en aanbaden Hem.
[28:10] Toen zeide Jezus tot haar: Vreest niet! gaat heen, boodschapt aan mijn broederen dat zij naar Galilea moeten gaan en daar zullen zij Mij zien. 
[28:11]  Terwijl zij nu heengingen, ziet, eenigen van de wacht kwamen naar de stad en boodschapten aan de overpriesters al wat er geschied was.
[28:12] En zij vergaderden met de oudsten, en toen zij beraadslaagd hadden, gaven zij aan de soldaten veel geld, zeggende:
[28:13] Zegt: Zijn discipelen zijn des nachts gekomen en hebben Hem gestolen terwijl wij sliepen.
[28:14] En als dit aan den stadhouder mocht ter oore komen, dan zullen wij hem tevreden en u buiten zorg stellen.
[28:15] En zij namen het geld en deden zooals men hun gezegd had. En dit verhaal is verbreid onder de Joden tot op den huidigen dag. 
[28:16]  Doch de elf discipelen zijn heengegaan naar Galilea, naar den berg dien Jezus hun aangewezen had.
[28:17] En als zij Hem zagen, aanbaden zij Hem; doch sommigen twijfelden.
[28:18] En Jezus bij hen komende, sprak tot hen, zeggende: Mij is gegeven alle macht in hemel en op aarde.
[28:19] Gaat heen, maakt alle volken tot mijn discipelen, hen doopende in den Naam des Vaders en des Zoons en des Heiligen Geestes; hen leerende te onderhouden alles wat Ik u geboden heb.
[28:20] En ziet, Ik ben met u al de dagen tot aan het einde der eeuw. Amen.   

### Mark

[1:1] Begin van het Evangelie van Jezus Christus, den Zoon van God. 
[1:2]  Zooals geschreven is in den profeet Jesaja: Zie, Ik zend mijn boodschapper voor u heen, die uw weg bereiden zal;
[1:3] een stem van een die roept in de woestijn: Bereidt den weg des Heeren, maakt zijn paden recht!
[1:4] Johannes was doopende in de woestijn, en predikende den doop der boetvaardigheid tot vergiffenis der zonden.
[1:5] En tot hem ging uit het geheele land van Judea, en al de Jerusalemmers, en zij werden door hem gedoopt in de rivier den Jordaan, belijdende hun zonden.
[1:6] En Johannes was bekleed met kemelshaar, en met een lederen gordel om zijn lenden, en hij at sprinkhanen en wilden honig.
[1:7] En hij predikte, zeggende: Na mij komt Hij, die machtiger is dan ik, wien ik niet waardig ben, nederbukkende, den riem zijner schoenen los te maken;
[1:8] ik heb u gedoopt met water, maar Hij zal u doopen met den Heiligen Geest. 
[1:9]  En het geschiedde in die dagen dat Jezus kwam van Nazaret in Galilea, en gedoopt werd in den Jordaan door Johannes.
[1:10] En terstond, terwijl Hij opklom uit het water, zag hij de hemelen scheuren en den Geest zooals een duive op Hem nederdalen.
[1:11] En een stem kwam uit de hemelen: Gij zijt mijn Zoon, de Beminde, in U heb Ik welbehagen! 
[1:12]  En terstond voerde de Geest Hem uit naar de woestijn;
[1:13] en Hij was in de woestijn veertig dagen lang, bekoord van den Satan; en Hij was bij de wilde beesten, en de engelen dienden Hem. 
[1:14]  Nadat nu Johannes was overgeleverd, kwam Jezus naar Galilea, predikende het Evangelie van het koninkrijk Gods, zeggende:
[1:15] De tijd is vervuld en het koninkrijk Gods nabij! doet boetvaardigheid en gelooft in het Evangelie! 
[1:16]  En langs de zee van Galilea gaande, zag Hij Simon en Andreas, den broeder van Simon, het net in de zee werpen, want zij waren visschers.
[1:17] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Komt achter Mij, en Ik zal u visschers van menschen doen worden!
[1:18] En terstond lieten zij hun netten achter en volgden Hem.
[1:19] En vandaar een weinig voortgaande zag Hij Jakobus, den zoon van Zebedeüs, en Johannes zijn broeder, die in het schip de netten herstelden.
[1:20] En terstond riep Hij hen, en zij lieten hun vader Zebedeüs in het schip met de knechten, en gingen heen, Hem achterna. 
[1:21]  En zij kwamen naar Kapernaüm, en terstond ging Hij op den sabbat in de synagoge om onderwijs te geven.
[1:22] En zij stonden verbaasd over zijn onderwijs, want Hij leerde hen als een machthebbende, en niet zooals de schriftgeleerden. 
[1:23]  En er was in hun synagoge een mensch met een onzuiveren geest, en die schreeuwde en zeide:
[1:24] Wat hebben wij met U te doen, Jezus de Nazarener? Zijt Gij gekomen om ons te verderven? We weten wie Gij zijt! — de Heilige Gods!
[1:25] En Jezus bestrafte hem, zeggende: Zwijg stil en ga van hem uit!
[1:26] En de onzuivere geest smeet hem heen en weer, en met een groote stem schreeuwende ging hij van hem uit.
[1:27] En allen stonden verbaasd, zoodat zij onder malkander vroegen, zeggende: Wat is dat? Een nieuwe leer! met macht gebiedt Hij zelfs de onzuivere geesten, en die gehoorzamen Hem!
[1:28] En zijn gerucht ging terstond overal uit, door het geheele omliggende land van Galilea. 
[1:29]  En terstond uit de synagoge gegaan zijnde kwamen zij naar het huis van Simon en van Andreas, met Jakobus en Johannes.
[1:30] De schoonmoeder nu van Simon lag aan de koorts, en terstond spraken ze tot Hem over haar.
[1:31] En tot haar gaande greep Hij haar hand en richtte haar op; en de koorts verliet haar terstond en zij bediende hen.
[1:32] Toen het nu avond was geworden en de zon was ondergegaan, brachten ze tot Hem allen die ziek en van booze geesten bezeten waren.
[1:33] En de geheele stad was samenvergaderd bij de deur.
[1:34] En Hij genas er velen die krank waren aan allerlei ziekten, en vele booze geesten wierp Hij uit, en liet de booze geesten niet toe te spreken, omdat zij Hem kenden. 
[1:35]  En vroeg, toen het nog diep in den nacht was, opgestaan zijnde, ging Hij uit en begaf zich naar een eenzame plaats, en daar bad Hij.
[1:36] En Simon, en die met hem waren, volgden Hem na,
[1:37] en vonden Hem, en zeiden tot Hem: Allen zoeken u!
[1:38] En Hij zeide tot hen: Laat ons heengaan naar de nabijgelegen marktplaatsen, opdat Ik ook daar predike, want daartoe ben Ik uitgegaan.
[1:39] En Hij ging, predikende in hun synagogen door geheel Galilea, en wierp de booze geesten uit. 
[1:40]  En er kwam een melaatsche tot Hem, die Hem bad en op de knieën vallende tot Hem zeide: Als Gij wilt, kunt Gij mij zuiveren!
[1:41] En Jezus met medelijden bewogen zijnde, strekte zijn hand uit, raakte hem aan en zeide: Ik wil, word gezuiverd!
[1:42] En terstond, als Hij dit gezegd had, ging de melaatschheid van hem en hij werd gezuiverd.
[1:43] En Hij verbood hem streng en zond hem terstond weg,
[1:44] en zeide tot hem: Zie toe, zeg aan niemand iets, maar ga heen, vertoon u aan den priester en offer voor uw zuivering wat Mozes geboden heeft, hun tot een getuigenis!
[1:45] Maar hij ging uit en begon veel te verkondigen en de zaak te verbreiden, zoodat Jezus niet meer openlijk naar de stad kon komen; maar Hij was buiten in eenzame plaatsen; en zij kwamen tot Hem van alle kanten.  
[2:1] En na eenige dagen kwam Jezus wederom naar Kapernaüm, en men hoorde dat Hij te huis was.
[2:2] En velen verzamelden zich, zoodat er geen plaats meer was, zelfs niet bij de deur; en Hij sprak het woord tot hen.
[2:3] En zij kwamen en brachten tot Hem een lamme, die door vier gedragen werd.
[2:4] En omdat zij niet bij Hem konden komen ter oorzake van de menigte, namen zij het dak weg waar Hij was, en toen zij een opening gemaakt hadden lieten zij het bed naar beneden, waar de lamme op lag.
[2:5] En Jezus hun geloof ziende, zeide tot den lamme: Zoon, de zonden zijn u vergeven!
[2:6] Er waren nu sommigen van de schriftgeleerden daar gezeten, die in hun harten redeneerden:
[2:7] Hoe spreekt deze alzoo? Hij lastert! — Wie kan zonden vergeven, dan God alleen?
[2:8] En terstond bekende Jezus in zijn geest dat zij alzoo redeneerden in zich zelven, en zeide tot hen: Wat beredeneert gij deze dingen in uw harten?
[2:9] Wat is gemakkelijker, tot den lamme te zeggen: Uw zonden zijn vergeven, of te zeggen: Sta op, en neem uw bed op en ga heen!
[2:10] Maar opdat gij weten moogt dat de Zoon des menschen macht heeft op aarde om zonden te vergeven, — toen zeide Hij tot den lamme:
[2:11] Ik zeg u, sta op, neem uw bed op en ga heen naar uw huis!
[2:12] En hij stond op en nam terstond het bed op en ging uit voor aller oogen, zoodat allen verbaasd waren en God de glorie gaven, zeggende: Zoo iets hebben wij nooit gezien! 
[2:13]  En Hij ging wederom uit naar de zee en al het volk kwam tot Hem en Hij onderwees hen.
[2:14] En voorbijgaande zag Hij Levi, den zoon van Alfeüs, aan het tolhuis zitten, en Hij zeide tot hem: Volg Mij na! — En opstaande volgde hij Hem na.
[2:15] En het geschiedde dat Hij aanlag in Levi’s huis, en veel tollenaars en zondaars lagen met Jezus en zijn discipelen mede aan; want er waren er velen en zij waren Hem nagevolgd.
[2:16] En de schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, als ze zagen dat Hij at met de tollenaars en zondaars, zeiden tot zijn discipelen: Waarom eet en drinkt Hij met de tollenaars en zondaars?
[2:17] En Jezus dit hoorende zeide tot hen: Niet de gezonden hebben een geneesmeester noodig, maar de zieken; Ik ben niet gekomen om rechtvaardigen te roepen, maar zondaars! 
[2:18]  En de discipelen van Johannes en van de fariseërs waren vastende, en zij kwamen en zeiden tot Hem: Waarom vasten de discipelen van Johannes en die der fariseërs, maar uw discipelen vasten niet?
[2:19] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Kunnen dan de bruiloftsgasten vasten terwijl de bruidegom bij hen is? Zoolang zij den bruidegom bij zich hebben, kunnen zij niet vasten!
[2:20] maar er zullen dagen komen, als de bruidegom van hen is weggenomen, en dan zullen zij vasten in dien dag!
[2:21] Niemand toch naait een stuk ongekrompen laken op een oud kleed; anders scheurt het ingezette stuk, dat nieuw is, van het oude af, en de scheur wordt erger.
[2:22] En niemand giet jongen wijn in oude zakken, anders doet de wijn de zakken barsten, en de wijn wordt uitgestort, en de zakken gaan verloren; maar jongen wijn moet men in nieuwe zakken gieten. 
[2:23]  En het geschiedde dat Hij op den sabbat door het korenveld ging, en zijn discipelen begonnen al gaande, aren te plukken.
[2:24] En de fariseërs zeiden tot Hem: Zie, waarom doen zij op den sabbat wat niet geoorloofd is?
[2:25] En Hij zeide tot hen: Hebt gij nooit gelezen, wat David gedaan heeft, toen hij gebrek had en honger had, en zij die met hem waren?
[2:26] Hoe hij is ingegaan in het huis Gods, ten tijde van Abjathar den hoogepriester, en de toonbrooden heeft gegeten, die niemand mag eten dan alleen de priesters, en dat hij gegeven heeft ook aan degenen die met hem waren?
[2:27] En Hij zeide tot hen: De sabbat is gemaakt om den mensch, en niet de mensch om den sabbat.
[2:28] Zoo is de Zoon des menschen Heer, ook van den sabbat!  
[3:1] En Jezus ging wederom naar de synagoge, en daar was een mensch die een stijve hand had.
[3:2] En zij letten op Hem of Hij op den sabbat hem zou genezen, opdat ze Hem mochten beschuldigen.
[3:3] En Hij zeide tot den mensch die de stijve hand had: Sta op in het midden!
[3:4] En Hij zeide tot hen: Is het geoorloofd op den sabbat goed te doen of kwaad te doen? een ziel te behouden of te dooden? — Maar zij zwegen stil.
[3:5] En als Hij rondom hen aangezien had met toorn, te gelijk bedroefd over de verharding van hun harte, zeide Hij tot den mensch: Steek uw hand uit! — En hij stak ze uit en zijn hand was genezen. 
[3:6]  En de fariseërs gingen uit en hielden terstond met de herodianen raad tegen Hem, hoe ze Hem ten val brengen zouden. 
[3:7]  En Jezus vertrok met zijn discipelen naar de zee, en een groote menigte van Galilea en van Judea volgde Hem,
[3:8] en van Jerusalem, en van Idumea, en van over den Jordaan, en van bij Tyrus en Sidon; een groote menigte, die gehoord had hoe groote dingen Hij deed, kwam tot Hem.
[3:9] En Hij zeide tot zijn discipelen dat er een scheepken bij Hem moest blijven wegens de schare; opdat ze Hem niet zouden verdringen; 
[3:10] want velen genas Hij, zoodat al wie krankheden hadden, op Hem aandrongen, om Hem aan te raken.
[3:11] En de onzuivere geesten, als ze Hem zagen, vielen voor Hem neder, en schreeuwden, zeggende: Gij zijt de Zone Gods!
[3:12] En Hij gebood hun scherpelijk dat zij Hem niet openbaar zouden maken. 
[3:13]  En Hij klom op een berg en riep tot zich die Hij zelf wilde, en zij kwamen tot Hem.
[3:14] En Hij stelde er twaalf aan, om met Hem te zijn, en om die uit te zenden om te prediken,
[3:15] en om macht te hebben de ziekten te genezen en om de booze geesten uit te werpen.
[3:16] En Hij stelde deze twaalf aan, en gaf aan Simon den naam Petrus,
[3:17] en Jakobus den zoon van Zebedeüs en Johannes den broeder van Jakobus, en Hij gaf hun den naam Boanerges, dat is: Zonen des donders;
[3:18] en Andreas, en Filippus, en Bartholomeüs, en Mattheüs, en Thomas, en Jakobus den zoon van Alfeüs, en Thaddeüs, en Simon den Kananeër,
[3:19] en Judas Iskariot, die Hem ook verraden heeft.
[3:20] En zij kwamen in huis, en wederom vergaderde een menigte, zoodat zij zelfs geen brood konden eten. 
[3:21]  En als zijn familie dit gehoord had, kwamen zij om Hem te vatten, want zij zeiden dat Hij uitzinnig was. 
[3:22]  En de schriftgeleerden, die van Jerusalem afgekomen waren, zeiden: Hij heeft Beëlzebul, en door den overste der booze geesten werpt Hij de booze geesten uit!
[3:23] En Hij riep hen tot zich en sprak in gelijkenissen tot hen: Hoe kan Satan den Satan uitwerpen?
[3:24] En als een koninkrijk tegen zich zelf verdeeld is, dan kan dat koninkrijk niet bestaan.
[3:25] En als een huisgezin tegen zich zelf verdeeld is, dan zal dat huisgezin niet kunnen bestaan.
[3:26] En als de Satan tegen zich zelven opstaat, dan is hij verdeeld en kan hij niet bestaan, maar heeft een einde.
[3:27] Doch niemand kan ingaan in het huis van een sterke en zijn huisraad rooven als hij niet eerst den sterke vastbindt; en dan zal hij zijn huis berooven.
[3:28] Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden: Al de zonden en de lasteringen, waarmede zij zullen gelasterd hebben, zullen aan de kinderen der menschen vergeven worden,
[3:29] maar zoo wie tegen den Heiligen Geest zal lasteren, — hij heeft geen vergiffenis in eeuwigheid, maar hij zal schuldig zijn aan een eeuwige zonde.
[3:30] Want zij zeiden: Hij heeft een onzuiveren geest! 
[3:31]  En zijn moeder kwam, met zijn broeders, en buiten staande zonden zij tot Hem, en riepen Hem.
[3:32] En er zat een menigte volks rondom Hem, en zij zeiden tot Hem: Zie, uw moeder en uw broeders daarbuiten zoeken U!
[3:33] En Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wie zijn mijn moeder of mijn broeders?; 
[3:34] En rondom ziende, op degenen die om Hem heen zaten, zeide Hij: Ziet, mijn moeder en mijn broeders!
[3:35] Want al wie den wil van God doet, die is mijn broeder, en zuster, en moeder.  
[4:1] En wederom begon Jezus onderwijs te geven bij de zee, en tot Hem vergaderde zeer veel volk, zoodat Hij in het schip ging en op zee ging zitten. En al het volk was aan de zee, op het land.
[4:2] En Hij onderwees hen in gelijkenissen vele dingen, en Hij zeide tot hen in zijn onderwijs:
[4:3] Luistert! — Ziet, de zaaier ging uit om te zaaien.
[4:4] En het geschiedde, als hij zaaide, dat er een deel bij den weg viel, en de vogels kwamen en pikten dat op.
[4:5] En een ander deel viel op den rotsgrond, waar het niet veel aarde had, en terstond kwam het op, omdat het geen diepte van aarde had.
[4:6] Maar toen de zon opging verbrandde het, en omdat het geen wortel had verdorde het.
[4:7] En een ander deel viel tusschen de doornen, en de doornen schoten op, en verstikten het, en het gaf geen vrucht.
[4:8] En een ander deel viel op den goeden grond en gaf een vrucht die opschoot en groeide, en bracht op tot dertig– en tot zestig– en tot honderdvoud.
[4:9] En Hij zeide: Wie ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore! 
[4:10]  En toen Hij alleen was vroegen zij, die bij Hem waren met de twaalven, Hem naar de gelijkenis.
[4:11] En Hij zeide tot hen: Aan ulieden is de verborgenheid van het koninkrijk Gods te verstaan gegeven, maar dezen die buiten zijn, geschiedt alles in gelijkenissen,
[4:12] opdat zij ziende zien, en niet opmerken, en hoorende hooren, en niet verstaan, opdat zij niet misschien zich zouden bekeeren en hun vergiffenis geschiede! 
[4:13]  En Hij zeide tot hen: Weet gij deze gelijkenis niet? En hoe zult gij dan al de gelijkenissen verstaan?
[4:14] De zaaier zaait het woord.
[4:15] Dezen nu zijn het die bij den weg gezaaid zijn, waar het woord gezaaid wordt, en als zij het gehoord hebben, de Satan terstond komt en het woord wegneemt, dat in hen gezaaid is.
[4:16] En zoo zijn ook dezen die op den rotsgrond worden gezaaid, die, als zij het woord gehoord hebben, het terstond met blijdschap aannemen; 
[4:17] doch zij hebben geen wortel in zich zelven, maar zijn voor een tijd; daarna als er verdrukking komt of vervolging om des woords wil, dan worden zij terstond geërgerd.
[4:18] En anderen zijn het die tusschen de doornen gezaaid zijn. Dezen zijn het die het woord gehoord hebben,
[4:19] en de zorgen des tijds, en de verleiding des rijkdoms, en de begeerte naar de andere dingen, komen binnen en verstikken het woord, en het wordt onvruchtbaar.
[4:20] En dezen zijn het die op den goeden grond zijn gezaaid, die het woord hooren, en aannemen, en vrucht dragen in dertig–, en in zestig–, en in honderdvoudige mate.
[4:21] En Hij zeide tot hen: De lamp komt toch niet om onder een korenvat of onder een bed gezet te worden? Is het niet, om op een kandelaar gezet te worden?
[4:22] Want er is niets verborgen, dan om openbaar te worden, en er gebeurt niets in het geheim, dan om aan het licht te komen.
[4:23] Als iemand ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore!
[4:24] En Hij zeide tot hen: Ziet toe, wat gij hoort! Met de mate waarmede gij meet, zal u gemeten worden, en u zal nog toegevoegd worden!
[4:25] Want wie heeft, hem zal gegeven worden; en wie niet heeft, ook wat hij heeft zal van hem weggenomen worden. 
[4:26]  En Hij zeide: Alzoo is het koninkrijk Gods, gelijk wanneer een mensch het zaad in den grond geworpen heeft,
[4:27] en slaapt, en opstaat, nacht en dag, en het zaad spruit voort en wordt lang hij weet zelf niet hoe.
[4:28] Vanzelf toch brengt de aarde vrucht voort; eerst een stengel, dan een aar, dan volkomen graan in de aar.
[4:29] En als de vrucht het toelaat, zendt hij er terstond de sikkel in, omdat de oogst is gekomen. 
[4:30]  En Hij zeide: Hoe zullen wij het koninkrijk Gods vergelijken, of in welke gelijkenis zullen wij het voorstellen?
[4:31] Als een mosterdzaad, dat, als het in de aarde gezaaid wordt, het kleinste is van al de zaden op de aarde,
[4:32] en als het gezaaid is, schiet het op en het wordt het grootste van de moeskruiden, en maakt groote takken, zoodat onder zijn schaduw de vogelen des hemels kunnen verschuilen.
[4:33] En in veel zulke gelijkenissen sprak Hij tot hen het woord, naar dat zij het konden verstaan; 
[4:34] maar zonder gelijkenis sprak Hij tot hen niet, maar afzonderlijk verklaarde Hij alles voor zijn discipelen. 
[4:35]  En Hij zeide tot hen, op denzelfden dag, toen het avond was geworden: Laat ons overgaan, naar den anderen kant!
[4:36] En het volk verlatende namen zij Hem, zooals Hij was, in het schip; en er waren andere schepen bij Hem.
[4:37] En er kwam een groote stormvlaag, en de golven sloegen over in het schip, zoodat het schip vol werd.
[4:38] En Hij was in het achterschip slapende op het kussen; en zij maakten Hem wakker en zeiden tot Hem: Meester! trekt Gij het U niet aan, dat wij vergaan?
[4:39] En wakker geworden zijnde, bestrafte Hij den wind en zeide tot de zee: Zwijg, wees stil! — En de wind ging liggen, en er kwam een groote stilte.
[4:40] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wat zijt gij zoo bevreesd? Hoe, hebt gij geen geloof?
[4:41] En zij vreesden met groote vreeze en zeiden tot malkander: Wie is deze toch, dat zelfs de wind en de zee Hem gehoorzamen?  
[5:1] En zij kwamen naar den anderen kant van de zee, naar het land der Gerasenen.
[5:2] En toen Hij uit het schip gegaan was, kwam Hem terstond uit de grafsteden een mensch te gemoet, met een onzuiveren geest,
[5:3] die zijn woonplaats had in de grafsteden; en zelfs met een ketting kon niemand hem meer binden,
[5:4] omdat hij dikwijls met voetboeien en kettingen was gebonden geweest; en de kettingen werden door hem gebroken en de voetboeien verbrijzeld, en niemand kon hem temmen.
[5:5] En altijd, nacht en dag, in de grafsteden en op de bergen zijnde, schreeuwde hij en sloeg zich zelven met steenen.
[5:6] En Jezus van verre ziende, liep hij toe en boog zich voor Hem,
[5:7] en schreeuwende met een groote stem, zeide hij: Wat heb ik met U te doen, Jezus, Zoon van God den Allerhoogste? Ik bezweer U bij God, pijnig mij niet!
[5:8] Want Hij zeide tot hem: Gij onzuivere geest, ga uit den mensch!
[5:9] Èn Hij vroeg hem: Hoe is uw naam? — En hij zeide tot Hem: Mijn naam is Legioen, want we zijn met ons velen!
[5:10] En hij verzocht Hem zeer dat Hij hem niet buiten het land zou jagen.
[5:11] Er was nu daar bij den berg een groote kudde varkens weidende.
[5:12] En al de booze geesten verzochten Hem zeggende: Zend ons naar de varkens, opdat wij daarin gaan!
[5:13] En Jezus liet hun dat terstond toe. En de onzuivere geesten gingen uit naar de varkens, en de kudde stortte van de steilte af naar de zee, omtrent twee duizend, en ze versmoorden in de zee.
[5:14] En die ze weidden vluchtten weg en boodschapten het in de stad en op het land; en zij kwamen zien wat er gebeurd was.
[5:15] En zij kwamen tot Jezus, en zagen den bezetene, die het Legioen gehad had, zitten, gekleed en goed bij zijn verstand, en zij werden bevreesd.
[5:16] En die het gezien hadden, vertelden hun hoe het den bezetene gegaan was en van de varkens.
[5:17] En zij begonnen Hem te verzoeken van hun grenzen weg te gaan.
[5:18] En toen Hij naar het schip ging, verzocht Hem degene die bezeten was geweest, om bij Hem te mogen zijn.
[5:19] Doch Jezus liet hem dat niet toe, maar zeide tot hem: Ga naar uw huis, tot uw familie, en vertel hun wat groote dingen de Heere u gedaan heeft en dat Hij zich over u ontfermd heeft!
[5:20] En hij ging weg en begon te prediken in Dekapolis wat groote dingen Jezus hem gedaan had. En allen verwonderden zich. 
[5:21]  En als Jezus wederom in het schip naar den anderen kant was overgevaren, vergaderde een groote schare bij Hem, en Hij was bij de zee.
[5:22] En er kwam een van de oversten der synagoge, met name Jaïrus, en Hem ziende, viel hij aan zijn voeten,
[5:23] en verzocht Hem dringend, zeggende: Mijn dochterken ligt in haar uiterste; kom toch, leg de handen op haar, opdat zij gezond worde en leve!
[5:24] En Hij ging met hem, en een groote menigte volgde Hem en zij verdrongen Hem. 
[5:25]  En een vrouw, die twaalf jaar lang het bloedvloeien gehad had,
[5:26] en veel geleden had van veel geneesmeesters, en al wat zij had er aan te koste gelegd had, en die niets beter maar eerder erger geworden was,
[5:27] kwam, toen zij van Jezus gehoord had, onder de menigte van achter en raakte zijn kleed aan;
[5:28] want zij zeide: Als ik ook zijn kleederen maar aanraak, dan zal ik gezond worden!
[5:29] En terstond hield haar bloedvloeiing op, en zij gevoelde aan haar lichaam dat zij genezen was van de kwaal.
[5:30] En terstond bemerkte Jezus in zich zelven de kracht die van Hem uitgegaan was, en Hij keerde zich om in de menigte en zeide: Wie heeft mijn kleederen aangeraakt?
[5:31] En zijn discipelen zeiden tot Hem: Gij ziet dat de menigte U verdringt, en Gij zegt: Wie heeft Mij aangeraakt?
[5:32] En Hij zag rond om haar te zien die dit gedaan had.
[5:33] De vrouw nu, bevreesd en bevende zijnde, en weten de wat aan haar gebeurd was, kwam en viel voor Hem neder en zeide Hem de gansche waarheid.
[5:34] En Hij zeide tot haar: Dochter, uw geloof heeft u gezond gemaakt! ga heen in vrede en wees genezen van uw kwaal! 
[5:35]  Terwijl Hij nog sprak kwamen er van den overste der synagoge, die zeiden: Uw dochter is gestorven, wat valt gij den Meester nog lastig?
[5:36] Maar toen Jezus het woord gehoord had, dat gesproken was, zeide Hij tot den overste der synagoge: Vrees niet, geloof maar!
[5:37] En Hij liet aan niemand toe Hem te volgen, dan alleen aan Petrus, en Jakobus en Johannes, den broeder van Jakobus.
[5:38] En zij kwamen in het huis van den overste der synagoge, en Hij zag het gewoel, en die weenden en zeer klaagden;
[5:39] en binnengegaan zijnde zeide Hij tot hen: Wat woelt en weent gij toch? het kind is niet gestorven maar slaapt!
[5:40] En zij lachten Hem uit. Maar Hij joeg hen allen weg, en nam den vader en de moeder van het kind, en die bij Hem waren, en ging binnen waar het kind lag.
[5:41] En Hij nam de hand des kinds en zeide tot haar: Talitha Kumi! dat wil zeggen: Dochterken, Ik zeg u, sta op!
[5:42] En terstond rees het dochterken op en wandelde, want het was twaalf jaar oud; en zij waren ten uiterste verwonderd.
[5:43] En Hij gebood hun scherp dat zij dit aan niemand mochten doen weten, en zeide dat haar wat eten moest gegeven worden.  
[6:1] En Jezus ging vandaar weg en kwam naar zijn vaderland, en zijn discipelen volgden Hem.
[6:2] En toen het sabbat was geworden begon Hij onderwijs te geven in de synagoge. En velen die Hem hoorden stonden verwonderd, zeggende: Vanwaar heeft deze dit alles? en welke wijsheid is het, die Hem gegeven is? en zulke krachten geschieden er door zijn handen?
[6:3] Is deze niet de timmerman, de zoon van Maria, en de broeder van Jakobus, en van Joses, en van Judas, en van Simon? en zijn ook zijn zusters niet hier bij ons? — En zij werden aan Hem geërgerd.
[6:4] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Een profeet is niet ongeacht, dan in zijn eigen vaderland, en onder zijn familie, en in zijn huis!
[6:5] En Hij kon aldaar geen kracht doen, behalve dat Hij aan weinige zieken de handen opleide en ze genas.
[6:6] En Hij verwonderde zich over hun ongeloof, en trok, onderwijs gevende, door de omliggende dorpen. 
[6:7]  En Hij riep de twaalven tot zich, en begon hen uit te zenden twee aan twee, en gaf hun macht over de onzuivere geesten.
[6:8] En Hij gebood hun dat zij niets zouden meenemen op reis, dan alleen een staf; geen reiszak, geen brood, geen geld in de beurs,
[6:9] maar met schoenzolen aan de voeten gebonden, en niet bekleed met twee kleederen.
[6:10] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wanneer gij ergens naar een huis komt, blijft daar totdat gij vandaar weggaat.
[6:11] En zoo wat plaats u niet zal ontvangen, noch u hooren, schudt, bij het weggaan vandaar, het stof af, dat onder aan uw voeten is, tot een getuigenis tegen hen.
[6:12] En zij gingen uit en predikten dat zij boetvaardigheid zouden doen;
[6:13] en veel booze geesten wierpen zij uit, en zalfden veel kranken met olie, en maakten ze gezond. 
[6:14]  En de koning Herodes hoorde het, want zijn naam werd vermaard, en zeide: Johannes de Dooper is verrezen uit de dooden, en daarom werken die krachten in Hem!
[6:15] Anderen nu zeiden: Hij is Elias! En anderen zeiden: Hij is een profeet als een der profeten.
[6:16] Maar toen Herodes het hoorde zeide hij: Het is Johannes, dien ik onthoofd heb, die uit de dooden is verrezen! 
[6:17]  Want deze Herodes had gezonden om Johannes te vangen, en hij had hem in de gevangenis geboeid, ter oorzake van Herodias, de vrouw van Filippus, zijn broeder, omdat hij haar getrouwd had.
[6:18] Want Johannes zeide tot Herodes: Het is u niet geoorloofd de vrouw uws broeders te hebben!
[6:19] Herodias nu loerde op hem en wilde hem dooden, en kon niet;
[6:20] want Herodes vreesde Johannes, wetende dat hij een rechtvaardig en heilig man was; en hij spaarde hem. En als hij hem gehoord had, was hij zeer verslagen en hoorde hem gaarne.
[6:21] En als er een bekwame dag gekomen was, toen Herodes op zijn kroningsdag een maaltijd had aangericht voor zijn grooten en krijgsoversten, en de eersten van Galilea,
[6:22] en de dochter van die Herodias binnengekomen was, en danste, behaagde zij aan Herodes en aan degenen die mede aanlagen. En de koning zeide tot het dochterken: Vraag van mij wat gij wilt, en ik zal het u geven!
[6:23] En hij bezwoer haar: Zoo wat gij van mij vraagt, zal ik u geven, tot de helft van mijn koninkrijk toe!
[6:24] En zij ging uit en zeide tot haar moeder: Wat zal ik vragen? — En die zeide: Het hoofd van Johannes den Dooper!
[6:25] En zij ging terstond met haast tot den koning en vroeg, zeggende: Ik wil dat gij mij terstond op een schotel het hoofd geeft van Johannes den Dooper!
[6:26] En de koning werd zeer bedroefd; doch om de eeden en om de aanliggenden wilde hij haar niet afwijzen.
[6:27] En de koning zond terstond een van zijn lijfwacht en gebood zijn hoofd te brengen.
[6:28] Deze nu ging weg en onthoofdde hem in de gevangenis, en hij bracht zijn hoofd op een schotel en gaf het aan het dochterken, en het dochterken gaf het aan haar moeder.
[6:29] En zijn discipelen hoorden het en kwamen en namen zijn lijk weg en leiden het in een graf. 
[6:30]  En de apostelen verzamelden zich tot Jezus en boodschapten Hem al wat zij gedaan en geleerd hadden.
[6:31] En Hij zeide tot hen: Komt mede, gijlieden alleen, naar een eenzame plaats en rust een weinig! — Want er waren er velen die kwamen en gingen, en zij hadden zelfs geen tijd om te eten.
[6:32] En zij vertrokken afzonderlijk per schip naar een eenzame plaats.
[6:33] En de schare zag hen weggaan; en velen kenden hen en liepen over land van alle steden daar samen en kwamen eer dan zij aan. 
[6:34]  En Jezus ging uit en zag een groote menigte, en kreeg innerlijk medelijden met hen, omdat ze waren als schapen die geen herder hebben, en Hij begon hun veel te leeren.
[6:35] En toen het al laat was geworden kwamen zijn discipelen tot Hem en zeiden: Deze plaats is eenzaam, en het is al laat;
[6:36] zend ze van U, opdat zij naar de omliggende dorpen en vlekken gaan om voor zich zelven wat eten te koopen!
[6:37] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Geeft gij hun te eten! — En zij zeiden tot Hem: Wij zouden dan heengaan en voor tweehonderd penningen brood koopen, en hun te eten geven?
[6:38] En Hij zeide tot hen: Hoeveel brooden hebt gij? gaat heen en ziet! — En toen zij het wisten zeiden zij: Vijf, en twee visschen.
[6:39] En Hij gebood hun allen bij groepen te gaan zitten op het groene gras.
[6:40] En zij gingen zitten in groepen van honderd en van vijftig.
[6:41] En Hij nam de vijf brooden en de twee visschen, en zag op naar den hemel en dankte; en Hij brak de brooden en gaf die aan de discipelen om ze hun voor te zetten, en de twee visschen deelde Hij onder allen.
[6:42] En zij allen aten en werden verzadigd,
[6:43] en zij namen twaalf volle korven met brokken op, en ook van de visschen.
[6:44] En die de brooden gegeten hadden, waren vijf duizend mannen. 
[6:45]  En terstond dwong Hij zijn discipelen naar het schip te gaan en vooruit te varen naar den overkant, naar Bethsaïda, terwijl Hij de schare van zich zou laten.
[6:46] En als Hij van hen afscheid had genomen, ging Hij naar een berg om te bidden.
[6:47] En toen het avond was geworden, was het schip in het midden der zee, en Hij alleen was op het land;
[6:48] En als Hij zag dat zij veel moeite hadden om voort te roeien— want zij hadden tegenwind— kwam Hij omtrent de vierde nachtwake tot hen, wandelende op de zee, en Hij wilde hen voorbijgaan.
[6:49] Maar toen zij Hem op de zee zagen wandelen, meenden zij dat het een spooksel was en zij schreeuwden het uit.
[6:50] Want zij zagen Hem allen en werden ontroerd. Maar Hij sprak terstond met hen en zeide tot, hen: Hebt moed, Ik ben het, vreest niet!
[6:51] En Hij klom tot hen in het schip en de wind bedaarde; en zij waren in zich zelven bovenmate zeer ontroerd,
[6:52] want zij hadden niet opgelet bij de brooden, maar hun hart was verhard. 
[6:53]  En toen zij waren overgevaren naar het land, kwamen zij naar Gennesaret en leiden daar aan.
[6:54] En toen zij uit het schip gegaan waren herkenden ze Hem terstond,
[6:55] en zij liepen dat geheele land rond en begonnen op bedden de kranken om te dragen daar waar zij hoorden dat Hij was;
[6:56] en overal waar Hij kwam, naar dorpen, of steden, of vlekken, leiden zij de zieken op de markten, en baden Hem dat zij maar den zoom van zijn kleed mochten aanraken; en zoovelen Hem aanraakten, werden genezen.  
[7:1] En tot Jezus vergaderden de fariseërs en eenigen van de schriftgeleerden, die van Jerusalem gekomen waren,
[7:2] en die gezien hadden dat sommigen zijner discipelen met onzuivere, dat is met ongewasschen handen, brood aten.
[7:3] Want de fariseërs en al de Joden, als zij niet wel de handen gewasschen hebben, dan eten zij niet, omdat ze vasthouden aan de overlevering der ouden;
[7:4] en als zij van de markt komen, en zich niet gewasschen hebben, dan eten zij niet; en veel andere dingen zijn er waaraan zij bij overlevering vasthouden, als: het wasschen van bekers, en kannen, en koperen vaten, en bedden.
[7:5] Die fariseërs en schriftgeleerden vroegen Hem dan: Waarom doen uw discipelen niet naar de overlevering der ouden, maar eten brood met ongewasschen handen?
[7:6] En Hij zeide tot hen: Te recht heeft Jesaja van u, geveinsden! geprofeteerd, gelijk er geschreven is: Dit volk eert Mij met de lippen, maar hun hart is verre van Mij!
[7:7] doch tevergeefs dienen zij Mij, omdat zij leeringen leeren, die geboden van menschen zijn!
[7:8] Gij verlaat het gebod Gods en houdt vast aan de overlevering der menschen; het wasschen van kannen en bekers, en veel zulke dingen doet gij.
[7:9] En Hij zeide tot hen: ’t Is wel fraai, Gods gebod te verwerpen, om uw overleveringen te onderhouden!
[7:10] Want Mozes heeft gezegd: Eer uw vader en uw moeder, en ook: Die van vader of moeder kwaadspreekt, zal den dood sterven.
[7:11] Maar gij zegt: Als iemand tot vader of moeder zegt: Wat gij van mij zoudt kunnen trekken, dat is korban (een offergifte die ik aan God moet offeren),
[7:12] en gij laat hem niet meer toe iets aan vader of moeder te doen,
[7:13] dan maakt gij Gods woord krachteloos door uw overlevering, die gij hebt ingesteld; en soortgelijke dingen doet gij veel!
[7:14] En Hij riep de menigte wederom tot zich en zeide tot hen: Luistert allen naar Mij, en verstaat!
[7:15] Niets is er, dat van buiten tot den mensch ingaat, dat hem kan onzuiver maken; maar wat uit den mensch uitgaat, dat is het wat den mensch onzuiver maakt; 
[7:16] als iemand ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore!
[7:17] En toen Hij van de schare naar huis gekomen was, vroegen Hem zijn discipelen naar de gelijkenis.
[7:18] En Hij zeide tot hen: Zijt ook gij zoo onverstandig? Verstaat gij niet dat al wat van buiten tot den mensch ingaat hem niet kan onzuiver maken?
[7:19] dat dit niet komt tot zijn hart, maar tot zijn buik, en uitgaat in het geheim, zuiverende alle spijzen?
[7:20] En Hij zeide: Wat uit den mensch uitgaat, dat maakt den mensch onzuiver; 
[7:21] want van binnen, uit het hart der menschen, komen de kwade gedachten voort, overspel, hoererij, moord,
[7:22] diefstal, hebzucht, slechtheid, list, ontucht, afgunst, lastering, hoovaardij, onverstand.
[7:23] Al dit kwade komt van binnen, en maakt den mensch onzuiver. 
[7:24]  En vandaar opstaande, ging Hij naar de omstreken van Tyrus en Sidon. En in een huis gegaan zijnde wilde Hij niet dat iemand het wist, en toch kon Hij niet verborgen blijven.
[7:25] Want toen een vrouw van Hem gehoord had, wier dochterken een onzuiveren geest had, kwam zij terstond en viel aan zijn voeten;
[7:26] de vrouw nu was een grieksche, een syrofenicische van geboorte— en zij smeekte Hem dat Hij den boozen geest uit haar dochter zou werpen.
[7:27] En Jezus zeide tot haar: Laat eerst de kinderen verzadigd worden; want het is niet schoon het brood van de kinderen te nemen en voor de honden te werpen!
[7:28] Maar zij antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: ‘t Is waar, Heere! want ook de honden onder de tafel eten van de kruimels der kinderen!
[7:29] En Hij zeide tot haar: Om dezes woords wil, ga heen! de booze geest is uit uw dochter gegaan!
[7:30] En zij ging naar haar huis en vond het kind te bed liggen en den boozen geest uitgegaan. 
[7:31]  En Jezus wederom uit de omstreken van Tyrus weggegaan zijnde, kwam door Sidon naar de zee van Galilea, midden door de omstreken van Dekapolis.
[7:32] En zij brachten tot Hem een doove, die moeilijk sprak, en zij baden Hem dat Hij op dezen de hand zou leggen.
[7:33] En Hij nam hem uit de schare ter zijde, stak hem zijn vingers in de ooren, en gespuwd hebbende, raakte Hij zijn tong aan.
[7:34] En opziende naar den hemel, zuchtte Hij en zeide tot hem: Effatha! dat is, word geopend!
[7:35] En zijn ooren werden geopend, en terstond ging de band zijner tong los en hij sprak goed.
[7:36] En Hij gebood hun dat zij het aan niemand zouden zeggen; maar hoe meer Hij het hun gebood, des te meer vertelden zij het.
[7:37] En zij waren bovenmate verwonderd, zeggende: Alles heeft Hij goed gedaan, en de dooven doet Hij hooren en de stommen spreken.  
[8:1] Toen er nu in die dagen wederom veel volk was, en zij niet te eten hadden, riep Jezus de discipelen samen en zeide tot hen:
[8:2] Ik heb medelijden met het volk, omdat zij al drie dagen bij Mij zijn gebleven, en zij hebben niet te eten; 
[8:3] en als Ik ze zonder eten naar hun huis laat gaan, zullen zij onderweg bezwijken, en sommigen van hen zijn van verre gekomen!
[8:4] En zijn discipelen antwoordden Hem: Vanwaar zal iemand; hier in een woestijn, dezen met brood kunnen verzadigen?
[8:5] En Hij vroeg hun: Hoeveel brooden hebt gij? — En zij zeiden: Zeven.
[8:6] En Hij gebood het volk op den grond te gaan zitten; en Hij nam de zeven brooden, en dankte, en brak ze, en gaf ze aan zijn discipelen, om ze voor te zetten; en zij zetten ze aan de schare voor.
[8:7] En zij hadden enkele vischjes; en als Hij gedankt had zette Hij die ook voor.
[8:8] En zij aten en werden verzadigd, en zij namen het overschot der brokken op, zeven manden.
[8:9] En die gegeten hadden waren omtrent vier duizend. — En Hij liet ze weggaan. 
[8:10]  En terstond ging Hij naar het schip met zijn discipelen en kwam naar de omstreken van Dalmanutha.
[8:11] En de fariseërs gingen uit en begonnen met Hem te twisten, verzoekende van Hem een teeken uit den hemel, om Hem te verstrikken.
[8:12] En Hij zuchtte in zijn geest en zeide: Wat verzoekt dit geslacht een teeken? — Voorwaar zeg Ik ulieden: Aan dit geslacht zal geen teeken gegeven worden!
[8:13] En hen verlatende ging Hij wederom per schip naar de overzijde. 
[8:14]  En de discipelen hadden vergeten brooden mede te nemen, en hadden niets dan één brood bij zich in het schip.
[8:15] En Hij gebood hun, zeggende: Ziet toe, wacht u van den zuurdeesem der fariseërs en van den zuurdeesem van Herodes!
[8:16] En zij overleiden onder malkander, zeggende: Hij zegt dit omdat wij geen brooden hebben!
[8:17] En Jezus, dit bemerkt hebbende, zeide tot hen: Wat overlegt gij, dat gij geen brooden hebt? verstaat en begrijpt gij nog niet? hebt gij nog uw verhard harte?
[8:18] terwijl gij oogen hebt ziet gij niet, en terwijl gij ooren hebt hoort gij niet, en gij hebt geen geheugen?
[8:19] Toen ik de vijf brooden brak voor de vijf duizend, hoeveel volle korven met brokken naamt gij op? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Twaalf.
[8:20] En toen Ik de zeven brak voor de vier duizend, hoeveel volle manden met brokken naamt gij toen op? — Zij zeiden: Zeven.
[8:21] En Hij zeide tot hen: Verstaat gij dan nog niet? 
[8:22]  En zij kwamen naar Bethsaïda, en men bracht tot Hem een blinde, en bad Hem dat Hij hem zou aanraken.
[8:23] En den blinde bij de hand genomen hebbende, bracht Hij hem buiten het dorp. En als Hij hem op de oogen gespuwd had, leide Hij hem de handen op en vroeg hem of hij wat zag.
[8:24] En opziende zeide de blinde: Ik zie demenschen; want als boomen zie ik ze wandelen!
[8:25] Toen leide Jezus wederom de handen op zijn oogen en hij zag op en was genezen, en zag alles klaarlijk.
[8:26] En Hij zond hem naar zijn huis, zeggende: Ga niet naar het dorp en zeg het aan niemand. 
[8:27]  En Jezus ging met zijn discipelen uit naar de dorpen van Cesarea Filippi, en onderweg vroeg Hij zijn discipelen en zeide tot hen: Wie zeggen de menschen dat Ik ben?
[8:28] En zij spraken tot Hem en zeiden: Johannes de Dooper; — en anderen: Elias— en anderen: Een der profeten.
[8:29] En Hij vroeg hun: Maar gij, wie zegt gij dat Ik ben? En Petrus antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Gij zijt de Christus!
[8:30] En Hij gebood hun scherpelijk dat zij tot niemand over Hem spreken zouden. 
[8:31]  En Hij begon hun te leeren dat de Zoon des menschen veel moest lijden, en verworpen worden van de oudsten en de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden, en gedood worden, en na drie dagen verrijzen.
[8:32] En dit woord sprak Hij vrij uit. En Petrus nam Hem ter zijde en begon Hem te bestraffen.
[8:33] Maar Hij keerde zich om en op zijn discipelen ziende, bestrafte Hij Petrus en zeide: Ga weg, achter Mij, Satan! want gij bedenkt niet de dingen van God, maar die der menschen! 
[8:34]  En als Hij de schare met zijn discipelen tot zich geroepen had, zeide Hij tot hen: Zoo wie wil achter Mij komen die verloochene zich zelven, en neme zijn kruis op, en volge Mij na.
[8:35] Want zoo wie zijn leven wil behouden, die zal het verliezen, maar zoo wie zijn leven zal verliezen om Mijnentwil en om des Evangelies wil, die zal het behouden.
[8:36] Want welk profijt zal een mensch hebben, als hij de geheele wereld wint en zijn leven verliest?
[8:37] Wat toch zal een mensch geven in ruil voor zijn leven?
[8:38] Want zoo wie zich over Mij en mijn woorden zal geschaamd hebben in dit overspelig en goddeloos geslacht, over dien zal ook de Zoon des menschen zich schamen, als Hij komt in de glorie zijns Vaders met de heilige engelen.  
[9:1] En Hij zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden dat er sommigen hier staan die den dood in ‘t geheel niet smaken zullen, totdat zij het koninkrijk Gods met kracht zullen hebben zien komen! 
[9:2]  En zes dagen daarna nam Jezus met zich Petrus, en Jakobus, en Johannes, en bracht hen alleen naar een hoogen berg, afzonderlijk; en Hij werd van gedaante veranderd in hun tegenwoordigheid.
[9:3] En zijn kleederen werden blinkend, zeer wit, als sneeuw, zooals geen voller op de aarde ze wit kan maken.
[9:4] En hun verscheen Elias met Mozes, en zij spraken samen met Jezus.
[9:5] En Petrus antwoordde en zeide tot Jezus: Meester, het is goed dat wij hier zijn, en laat ons drie tenten maken, voor U een, en voor Mozes een, en voor Elias een!
[9:6] Want hij wist niet wat te antwoorden, want ze waren verschrikt.
[9:7] En er kwam een wolk die hen overschaduwde, en er kwam een stem uit de wolk: Deze is mijn Zoon, de Beminde, hoort Hem!
[9:8] En haastig rondziende zagen zij niemand meer; maar Jezus alleen bij zich. 
[9:9]  Terwijl zij nu den berg afgingen, gebood Hij hun dat zij aan niemand zouden vertellen wat zij gezien hadden, dan wanneer de Zoon des menschen uit de dooden zou verrezen zijn.
[9:10] En dit woord hielden zij in het geheugen, en vroegen onder malkander: Wat is dat, uit de dooden verrijzen?
[9:11] En zij vroegen Hem zeggende: Waarom zeggen de fariseërs en de schriftgeleerden dat Elias eerst moet komen?
[9:12] En Hij zeide tot hen: Elias als hij komt zal wel eerst alles herstellen; en hoe is er geschreven van den Zoon des menschen? — dat Hij veel zal lijden en veracht worden.
[9:13] Maar Ik zeg ulieden dat Elias al gekomen is, en zij hebben hem gedaan zooals zij wilden, gelijk van hem geschreven is. 
[9:14]  En toen Jezus bij de discipelen was gekomen, zag Hij een groote schare rond hen, en schriftgeleerden die met hen twistten.
[9:15] En de gansche schare, zoodra zij Hem zag, werd verbaasd, en zij liepen naar Hem toe en groetten Hem.
[9:16] En Hij vroeg hun: Wat twist gij met dezen?
[9:17] En een uit de schare antwoordde Hem: Meester, ik heb mijn zoon tot U gebracht, die een stommen geest heeft;
[9:18] en waar deze hem ook aangrijpt daar scheurt hij hem, en hij schuimbekt en knarst op de tanden, en verstijft; en ik heb aan uw discipelen gezegd, dat zij hem zouden uitwerpen, en zij konden niet.
[9:19] Maar Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: O ongeloovig geslacht, tot wanneer zal Ik bij u zijn? tot wanneer zal Ik u verdragen? — brengt hem tot Mij!
[9:20] En zij brachten hem tot Hem. En Hem ziende smeet de geest hem terstond heen en weer; en op den grond vallende wentelde hij zich al schuimbekkende.
[9:21] En Jezus vroeg aan zijn vader: Hoe lang is het, dat dit hem overkomen is? En hij zeide: Van zijn kindsheid af!
[9:22] en dikwijls heeft hij hem ook in vuur geworpen en in water, om hem te dooden; maar als Gij iets kunt, ontferm U over ons en help ons!
[9:23] Maar Jezus zeide tot hem: Wat? zoo Gij kunt? alles is mogelijk voor wie gelooft!
[9:24] En terstond riep de vader van het kind met tranen uit, zeggende: Ik geloof! help mij, ofschoon in ongeloof!
[9:25] En toen Jezus zag dat de schare bijeen liep, bestrafte Hij den onzuiveren geest en zeide tot hem: Gij stomme en doove geest, Ik beveel u, ga uit hem en kom niet meer in hem!
[9:26] En al schreeuwend, en hem heen en weer smijtende, ging hij uit. En het kind werd als een doode, zoodat velen zeiden dat het dood was.
[9:27] Maar Jezus greep zijn hand en richtte hem op, en hij stond recht.
[9:28] En toen zij in huis gekomen waren, vroegen zijn discipelen Hem in het bijzonder: Waarom hebben wij hem niet kunnen uitwerpen?
[9:29] En Hij zeide tot hen: Dit geslacht kan door niets uitgaan, dan door gebed en vasten. 
[9:30]  En zij gingen vandaar weg en trokken door Galilea, en Hij wilde niet dat iemand het wist;
[9:31] want Hij onderwees zijn discipelen en zeide tot hen: De Zoon des menschen wordt overgeleverd in de handen der menschen, en zij zullen Hem dooden, en gedood zijnde zal Hij na drie dagen verrijzen.
[9:32] Maar zij verstonden de rede niet en zij vreesden Hem er naar te vragen. 
[9:33]  En zij kwamen naar Kapernaüm. En toen Hij te huis was, vroeg Hij hun: Waarover hebt gij onderweg gehandeld?
[9:34] Maar zij zwegen stil, want zij hadden onderweg getwist met malkander, wie toch de meeste was.
[9:35] En toen Hij nederzat riep Hij de twaalven en zeide tot hen: Als iemand wil de eerste zijn, die zal de laatste van allen zijn, en de dienaar van allen.
[9:36] En Hij nam een klein kind en stelde dat in hun midden, en omhelsde het en zeide tot hen:
[9:37] Zoo wie één van zulke kinderen zal aannemen in mijn Naam, die neemt Mij aan; en zoo wie Mij aanneemt, die neemt niet Mij aan, maar Hem die Mij gezonden heeft. 
[9:38]  Johannes sprak tot Hem: Meester, wij hebben iemand gezien die in uw Naam booze geesten uitwerpt, en die ons niet volgt; en wij hebben het hem verboden.
[9:39] Maar Jezus zeide: Verbiedt hem niet! Niemand toch is er die een kracht zal doen in mijn Naam en spoedig van Mij zal kunnen kwaadspreken; 
[9:40] want die niet tegen ons is, is vóór ons!
[9:41] Want zoo wie ulieden een beker waters te drinken geeft in mijn Naam, omdat gij van Christus zijt, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden, dat hij zijn loon geenszins zal verliezen.
[9:42] En zoo wie één dezer kleinen, die in Mij gelooven, ergeren zal, het ware voor hem beter dat er een molensteen om zijn hals was gedaan, en hij in de zee geworpen was. 
[9:43]  En als uw hand u ergert, snijd ze af! het is beter dat gij verminkt naar het leven gaat, dan dat gij, twee handen hebbende, naar de helle gaat, naar het onuitbluschbaar vuur,
[9:44] waar hun worm niet sterft en het vuur niet wordt uitgebluscht.
[9:45] En als uw voet u ergert, snijd hem af! beter is het dat gij kreupel tot het leven ingaat, dan dat gij, twee voeten hebbende, in de helle geworpen wordt,
[9:46] het onuitbluschbaar vuur, waar hun worm niet sterft, en het vuur niet wordt uitgebluscht.
[9:47] En als uw oog u ergert, trek het uit! beter is het dat gij met één oog in het koninkrijk Gods ingaat, dan dat gij, twee oogen hebbende, in de helle geworpen wordt,
[9:48] waar hun worm niet sterft, en het vuur niet wordt uitgebluscht.
[9:49] Want ieder zal met vuur gezouten worden, en elk offer zal met zout gezouten worden.
[9:50] Het zout is goed; maar als het zout onzout wordt, waarmede zult gij het smakelijk maken? — Hebt in u zelven zout en houdt vrede onder malkander!  
[10:1] En Jezus stond op en ging vandaar naar de landstreken van Judea en over den Jordaan; en wederom kwamen er scharen tot Hem, en Hij onderwees hen wederom, zooals Hij gewoon was.
[10:2] En de fariseërs kwamen tot Hem en vroegen Hem of het een man geoorloofd is zijn vrouw te verlaten, — Hem verzoekende.
[10:3] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wat heeft Mozes u geboden?
[10:4] En zij zeiden: Mozes heeft toegestaan een akte van scheiding te schrijven en haar te verlaten.
[10:5] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Om uw verhardheid van harte heeft hij voor ulieden dit gebod geschreven; 
[10:6] maar van het begin der schepping af heeft God hen man en vrouw gemaakt.
[10:7] Daarom zal een mensch zijn vader en zijn moeder verlaten, en zijn vrouw aanhangen,
[10:8] en die twee zullen zijn tot één vleesch, zoodat zij niet meer twee zijn, maar één vleesch.
[10:9] Wat God dan heeft vereenigd, dat scheide de mensch niet!
[10:10] En tehuis vroegen de discipelen Hem wederom over deze zaak;
[10:11] en Hij zeide tot hen: Zoo wie zijn vrouw zal verlaten en met een andere trouwen, doet overspel tegen haar; 
[10:12] en als een vrouw haar man verlaat en met een ander trouwt, doet zij overspel. 
[10:13]  En zij brachten kinderkens tot Hem opdat Hij die zou aanraken; maar de discipelen bestraften degenen die ze bij Hem brachten.
[10:14] En Jezus dit ziende nam het kwalijk en zeide tot hen: Laat de kinderkens tot Mij komen, verhindert ze niet! want voor zoodanigen is het koninkrijk Gods.
[10:15] Voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Zoo wie het koninkrijk Gods niet zal aannemen als een kindeken, die zal er geenszins in komen!
[10:16] En Hij omhelsde ze en leide hun de handen op, en zegende ze. 
[10:17]  En toen Hij op weg ging, liep er een naar Hem toe en voor Hem op de knieën vallende vroeg hij Hem: Goede Meester! wat zal ik doen om eeuwig leven te verkrijgen?
[10:18] Doch Jezus zeide tot hem: Wat noemt gij Mij goed? niemand is goed dan de eenige God!
[10:19] De geboden kent gij: Gij zult geen overspel doen, gij zult niet doodslaan, gij zult niet stelen, gij zult geen valsch getuigenis geven, gij zult niemand te kort doen, eer uw vader en uw moeder.
[10:20] Maar hij zeide tot Hem: Meester, dit alles heb ik onderhouden van mijn jeugd af.
[10:21] En Jezus zag hem aan en beminde hem, en zeide tot hem: Eén zaak ontbreekt u! ga heen, verkoop al wat gij hebt en geef het aan de armen, en gij zult een schat hebben in den hemel, en kom, en volg Mij!
[10:22] Maar hij werd bedroefd over dat woord en ging treurig heen, want hij bezat veel goederen. 
[10:23]  En Jezus zag rond en zeide tot zijn discipelen: Hoe bezwaarlijk zullen zij die goederen bezitten, tot het koninkrijk Gods ingaan!
[10:24] En de discipelen werden verwonderd over zijn woorden. Maar Jezus antwoordde wederom en zeide tot hen: Kinderen! hoe bezwaarlijk is het voor hen die op hun goederen vertrouwen, tot het koninkrijk Gods in te gaan!
[10:25] Gemakkelijker is het dat een kameel door het oog van de naald gaat, dan dat een rijke tot het koninkrijk Gods ingaat!
[10:26] Zij nu werden nog meer verwonderd en zeiden tot malkander: En wie kan dan behouden worden?
[10:27] Doch Jezus zag hen aan en zeide: Bij de menschen onmogelijk, maar niet bij God! want bij God is alles mogelijk.
[10:28] Toen begon Petrus tot Hem te zeggen: Zie, wij hebben alles verlaten en zijn U gevolgd!
[10:29] Jezus zeide: Voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden, niemand is er, die verlaten heeft huis, of broeders, of zusters, of moeder, of vader, of kinderen, of akkers, om Mijnentwil en om des Evangelies wil,
[10:30] of hij ontvangt honderdvoudig nu in dezen tijd huizen, en broeders, en zusters, en moeders, en kinderen, en akkers, met vervolgingen, en in de eeuw die komende is, eeuwig leven.
[10:31] Doch veel eersten zullen laatsten zijn, en de laatsten eersten. 
[10:32]  En zij waren op weg om naar Jerusalem te gaan, en Jezus ging vóór hen uit. En zij waren verbaasd, en volgden Hem vreezende. En de twaalven wederom tot zich nemende, begon Hij tot hen te spreken over de dingen die Hem overkomen zouden:
[10:33] Ziet, wij gaan op naar Jerusalem, en de Zoon des menschen wordt overgeleverd aan de overpriesters en aan de schriftgeleerden, en zij zullen Hem ter dood veroordeelen, en Hem aan de heidenen overleveren,
[10:34] en zij zullen Hem bespotten, en Hem geeselen, en Hem bespuwen, en Hem dooden, en na drie dagen zal Hij verrijzen. 
[10:35]  En tot Hem kwamen Jakobus en Johannes, de zonen van Zebedeüs, en zeiden tot Hem: Meester! wij wenschen dat Gij ons doen zult wat wij U verzoeken!
[10:36] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wat wilt gij dat Ik u doen zal?
[10:37] En zij zeiden tot Hem: Geef ons dat wij, de een aan uw rechter– en de ander aan uw linkerhand, mogen zitten in uw glorie!
[10:38] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Gij weet niet wat gij begeert! Kunt gij drinken den drinkbeker dien Ik drink, of gedoopt worden met den doop waarmede Ik gedoopt word?
[10:39] En zij zeiden tot Hem: Ja wel! — En Jezus zeide tot hen: Den drinkbeker, dien Ik drink, zult gij drinken, en met den doop, waarmede Ik gedoopt word, zult gij gedoopt worden!
[10:40] doch het zitten aan mijn rechter– of aan mijn linkerhand staat bij Mij niet te geven, maar is voor wie het bereid is.
[10:41] En toen de tien andere aposlelen dit gehoord hadden begonnen zij het kwalijk te nemen van Jakobus en Johannes.
[10:42] En Jezus riep hen tot zich en zeide tot hen: Gij weet dat degenen die geacht worden oversten der volken te zijn over hen heerschen, en hun grooten hebben macht over hen; 
[10:43] doch niet alzoo is het onder u, maar zoo wie wil groot worden onder u, zal uw dienaar zijn; 
[10:44] en zoo wie van u de eerste wil worden, zal een knecht van allen zijn; 
[10:45] want ook de Zoon des menschen is niet gekomen om gediend te worden, maar om te dienen en zijn leven te geven tot een losprijs voor velen. 
[10:46]  En zij kwamen naar Jericho. En als Hij Jericho uitging met zijn discipelen en een groote menigte volks, zat Bartimeüs, een blinde bedelaar, zoon van Timeüs, aan den weg.
[10:47] En toen hij gehoord had dat het Jezus de Nazarener was, begon hij te roepen en te zeggen: Zone Davids! Jezus! ontferm U mijner!
[10:48] En velen bestraften hem, opdat hij zou zwijgen; maar des te meer riep hij: Zone Davids! ontferm U mijner!
[10:49] En Jezus bleef staan en zeide: Roept hem! En zij riepen den blinde en zeiden tot hem: Heb moed, sta op, Hij roept u!
[10:50] En hij wierp zijn mantel af, en sprong op en kwam tot Jezus.
[10:51] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Wat wilt gij dat Ik u doen zal? — En de blinde zeide tot Hem: Meester, dat ik ziende mag worden!
[10:52] Jezus zeide tot hem: Ga heen, uw geloof heeft u behouden! — En terstond werd hij ziende, en volgde Hem op den weg.  
[11:1] En toen zij nabij Jerusalem kwamen, bij Bethfage en Bethanië, aan den Berg der Olijven, zond Jezus twee zijner discipelen en zeide tot hen:
[11:2] Gaat heen naar het dorp daar vóór u, en terstond als gij er inkomt, zult gij een veulen vastgebonden vinden, waarop nooit een mensch gezeten heeft; maakt dat los en brengt het.
[11:3] En als soms iemand tot u zegt: Waarom doet gij dat? dan moet gij zeggen: De Heere heeft het van doen! en terstond zal hij het wederom naar hier zenden.
[11:4] En zij gingen heen en vonden het veulen vastgebonden bij de deur, buiten aan de open straat, en zij maakten het los:
[11:5] En sommigen van die daar stonden zeiden tot hen: Wat doet gij, dat gij het veulen losmaakt?
[11:6] Zij nu zeiden tot hen zooals Jezus gezegd had. En ze lieten hen begaan.
[11:7] En zij brachten het veulen tot Jezus en wierpen hun kleederen daarover, en zetten Hem daarop.
[11:8] En velen spreidden hun kleederen op den weg, en anderen takken, die ze van de velden afsneden.
[11:9] En die vooraan gingen en die volgden riepen: Hosannah, gezegend Hij die komt in den Naam des Heeren!
[11:10] Gezegend het koninkrijk van onzen vader David, dat komt! Hosannah, in het allerhoogste!
[11:11] En Jezus kwam naar Jerusalem, naar den tempel; en als Hij alles rondom bezien had en het al avond was geworden, ging Hij uit naar Bethanië met de twaalven. 
[11:12]  En toen zij den volgenden dag uit Bethanië gingen, kreeg Hij honger.
[11:13] En van verre een vijgeboom ziende, die bladeren had, ging Hij er naar toe, of Hij er ook wat aan vinden zou; en er bij gekomen zijnde, vond Hij niets dan bladeren; want het was de tijd der vijgen niet;
[11:14] en Hij antwoordde en zeide tot den boom: Tot in eeuwigheid ete niemand meer vrucht van u! — En zijn discipelen hoorden het. 
[11:15]  En zij kwamen naar Jerusalem, en naar den tempel gegaan zijnde, begon Jezus degenen die in den tempel kochten en verkochten uit te werpen, en de tafels der wisselaars en de zetels der duivenverkoopers keerde Hij om;
[11:16] en Hij liet niet toe dat iemand eenig vat door den tempel droeg;
[11:17] en Hij onderwees hen en zeide tot hen: Is er niet geschreven: Mijn huis zal een huis des gebeds genoemd worden voor alle volken? Gij nu hebt het gemaakt tot een roovershol.
[11:18] En de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden hoorden dit, en zochten hoe zij Hem zouden dooden. Want zij vreesden Hem, omdat de gansche schare verbaasd stond over zijn onderwijs.
[11:19] En toen het avond was geworden vertrok Hij uit de stad. 
[11:20]  En des morgens vroeg voorbijgaande zagen zij dat de vijgeboom verdord was van de wortelen af.
[11:21] En Petrus, dit indachtig geworden zijnde, zeide tot Hem: Meester, zie de vijgeboom dien Gij vervloekt hebt, is verdord!
[11:22] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Hebt geloof in God!
[11:23] Voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden, zoo wie tot dezen berg zou zeggen: Hef u op en werp u in de zee! en niet twijfelt in zijn hart, maar gelooft dat wat hij zegt geschieden zal, — het zal hem geworden!
[11:24] Daarom zeg Ik ulieden: al wat gij bidt en begeert, gelooft dat gij het ontvangen zult, en het zal u geworden. 
[11:25]  En als gij staat om te bidden, vergeeft het dan als gij iets hebt tegen iemand, opdat ook uw Vader, die in de hemelen is, ulieden uw overtredingen vergeve; 
[11:26] maar als gijlieden niet vergeeft, dan zal ook uw Vader, die in de hemelen is, uw overtredingen niet vergeven. 
[11:27]  En zij kwamen wederom naar Jerusalem. En terwijl Jezus in den tempel wandelde kwamen tot Hem de overpriesters, en de schriftgeleerden, en de oudsten,
[11:28] en zeiden tot Hem: Door welke macht doet Gij deze dingen? of wie heeft U de macht gegeven om deze dingen te doen?
[11:29] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Ik zal u ook één ding vragen, en antwoordt Mij, dan zal Ik u zeggen door welke macht Ik deze dingen doe.
[11:30] De doop van Johannes, was die uit den hemel of uit de menschen? — antwoordt Mij!
[11:31] En zij redeneerden onder malkander zeggende: Als wij zeggen: Uit den hemel, dan zal Hij zeggen: Waarom hebt gij hem dan niet geloofd?
[11:32] Maar als wij zeggen: Uit de menschen? — Zij vreesden het volk; want allen hielden voor vast, dat Johannes een profeet was.
[11:33] En zij antwoordden Jezus en zeiden: Wij weten het niet. — En Jezus zeide tot hen: Dan zeg Ik u ook niet door welke macht Ik deze dingen doe.  
[12:1] En Jezus begon tot hen in gelijkenissen te spreken: Een mensch plantte een wijngaard, en leide er een haag rond, en groef een wijnpers en bouwde een wachttoren, en verhuurde hem aan landlieden, en reisde buitenslands; 
[12:2] en toen het tijd was, zond hij een dienstknecht tot de landlieden, om van de landlieden te ontvangen van de vruchten des wijngaards.
[12:3] Doch zij grepen en sloegen hem en zonden hem ledig weg.
[12:4] En wederom zond hij tot hen een anderen dienstknecht,; en dezen sloegen zij een wonde aan het hoofd en mishandelden hem.
[12:5] En hij zond wederom een anderen, en dezen doodden zij; en vele anderen, die zij of sloegen, of doodden.
[12:6] Als hij dan nog één beminden zoon had, zond hij ten laatste dezen tot hen, zeggende: Zij zullen toch mijn zoon ontzien!
[12:7] Maar die landlieden zeiden tot malkander: Deze is de erfgenaam! komt, laat ons hem dooden, en de erfenis zal voor ons zijn!
[12:8] En zij grepen en doodden hem, en wierpen hem buiten den wijngaard.
[12:9] Wat zal dan de heer van den wijngaard doen? — Hij zal komen en de landlieden ombrengen, en den wijngaard aan anderen geven.
[12:10] Hebt gij ook deze Schrifture niet gelezen: De steen, dien de bouwlieden hebben verworpen, die is geworden tot een hoeksteen; 
[12:11] van den Heer is dit geschied en het is wonder in onze oogen?
[12:12] En zij zochten Hem te grijpen, en vreesden het volk, want zij verstonden dat Hij de gelijkenis op hen gesproken had; en zij verlieten Hem en gingen weg. 
[12:13]  En zij zonden tot Hem eenigen van de fariseërs en van de herodianen, om Hem in zijn woorden te vangen.
[12:14] En zij kwamen tot Hem en zeiden: Meester, wij weten dat Gij waarachtig zijt, en niemand ontziet, want Gij ziet niet naar het aangezicht der menschen, maar leert den weg Gods naar waarheid. — Is het geoorloofd belasting aan den keizer te geven, of niet?
[12:15] Hij nu zag hun geveinsdheid en zeide tot hen: Wat verzoekt gij Mij? brengt Mij een penning, dat Ik hem zie.
[12:16] En zij brachten Hem er een. En Hij zeide tot hen: Van wien is dit beeld en het opschrift? Zij nu zeiden: Van den keizer!
[12:17] Jezus dan zeide tot hen: Geeft dan aan den keizer wat den keizer, en aan God wat Gode toekomt! — En zij verwonderden zich over Hem. 
[12:18]  En er kwamen sadduceërs tot Hem, die zeggen dat er geen verrijzenis is, en zij vroegen Hem, zeggende:
[12:19] Meester, Mozes heeft ons voorgeschreven dat, als iemands broeder sterft en deze een vrouw, maar geen kind nalaat, dat dan zijn broeder de vrouw moet nemen en voor zijn gestorven broeder nakomelingschap verwekken.
[12:20] Er waren nu zeven broeders; en de eerste nam een vrouw en liet bij zijn sterven geen nakomelingschap na;
[12:21] en de tweede broeder nam haar en liet bij zijn sterven geen nakomelingschap na; en de derde evenzoo;
[12:22] en al de zeven namen haar en lieten geen nakomelingschap na; ten laatste van allen is ook de vrouw gestorven.
[12:23] In de verrijzenis nu, als zij zullen verrezen zijn, van wien zal zij dan de vrouw zijn? want de zeven hebben haar tot vrouw gehad.
[12:24] Doch Jezus zeide tot hen: Dwaalt gij niet daarom, dat gij de Schrifturen niet kent, noch de kracht Gods?
[12:25] Want wanneer zij uit de dooden verrijzen, zullen zij niet trouwen of getrouwd worden, maar zij zijn als engelen in de hemelen.
[12:26] Aangaande de dooden nu, dat zij verrijzen zullen, hebt gij niet gelezen in het boek van Mozes, hoe God bij den braambosch tot hem sprak, zeggende: Ik ben de God van Abraham, en de God van Isaäk, en de God van Jakob?
[12:27] Hij is niet de God van dooden, maar van levenden. Gij dwaalt dan zeer! 
[12:28]  En een der schriftgeleerden, die hen had hooren redetwisten, kwam tot Hem, en wetende dat Hij hun goed had geantwoord, vroeg hij Hem: Wat is het eerste gebod van allen?
[12:29] Jezus antwoordde: Het eerste is: Hoor Israël, de Heere, onze God, is een éénig Heer!
[12:30] en gij zult den Heere, uwen God, beminnen uit geheel uw hart, en uit geheel uw ziel, en uit geheel uw verstand, en uit geheel uw kracht; 
[12:31] het tweede gebod is dit: Gij zult uw naaste beminnen als u zelven, Daar is geen ander gebod, grooter dan deze.
[12:32] En de schriftgeleerde zeide tot Hem: Juist, Meester! in waarheid hebt Gij gezegd dat er maar één God is, en dat er geen andere is dan Hij;
[12:33] en Hem te beminnen uit het geheele hart, en uit het geheele verstand, en uit geheel de ziel, en uit de geheele kracht, en den naaste te beminnen als zich zelven, is meer dan al de brandoffers en slachtoffers!
[12:34] En Jezus zag dat hij verstandig had geantwoord en zeide tot hem: Niet ver zijt gij van het koninkrijk Gods! — En niemand durfde Hem meer vragen. 
[12:35]  En Jezus antwoordde en zeide, toen Hij onderwijs gaf in den tempel: Hoe zeggen de schriftgeleerden dat de Christus Davids Zoon is?
[12:36] David zelf toch heeft gezegd in den Heiligen Geest: De Heere heeft tot mijn Heere gesproken: Zit aan mijn rechterhand totdat Ik uw vijanden gezet heb tot een voetbank uwer voeten?
[12:37] David zelf noemt Hem Heere, en vanwaar is Hij dan zijn Zoon? — En de geheele schare hoorde Hem gaarne. 
[12:38]  En in zijn onderwijs zeide Hij: Wacht u voor de schriftgeleerden, die gaarne in lange kleederen wandelen en op de markten gegroet worden,
[12:39] en vooraanzitten in de synagogen en vooraanliggen bij de maaltijden; 
[12:40] die de huizen der weduwen opeten en voor den schijn lange gebeden doen; dezen zullen een zwaarder oordeel ontvangen. 
[12:41]  En Hij ging zitten tegenover de schatkist en zag hoe de schare geld wierp in de schatkist; en vele rijken wierpen er veel in.
[12:42] En er kwam één arme weduwe, die twee penningskens er inwierp, dat is een kodrant.
[12:43] En Hij riep zijn discipelen en zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u dat deze arme weduwe er meer heeft ingeworpen dan allen die in de schatkist geld geworpen hebben; 
[12:44] want allen hebben er ingeworpen van hun overvloed, maar deze heeft van haar armoede, al wat zij had, er ingeworpen, haar geheelen schat.  
[13:1] En toen Jezus uit den tempel ging zeide een zijner discipelen tot Hem: Meester, zie eens, hoedanige steenen en hoedanige gebouwen!
[13:2] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Gij ziet die groote gebouwen? — geen twee steenen zullen op elkander gelaten worden, die niet zullen afgebroken worden!
[13:3] En toen Hij op den Berg der Olijven zat, tegenover den tempel, vroegen Petrus, en Jakobus, en Johannes, en Andreas Hem afzonderlijk:
[13:4] Zeg ons, wanneer zal dat zijn? en wat is het teeken, als dit alles zal volbracht worden?
[13:5] En Jezus begon tot hen te zeggen: Ziet toe, dat u niemand verleide!
[13:6] Velen zullen komen onder mijn Naam, zeggende: Ik ben het! en zij zullen velen verleiden.
[13:7] Als gij dan hooren zult van oorlogen en oorlogsgeruchten, verschrikt niet! want dit moet geschieden, maar nog is het einde er niet.
[13:8] Want volk zal tegen volk opstaan, en koninkrijk tegen koninkrijk; aardbevingen zullen er allerwege zijn, en hongersnooden! — Dat is het begin der smarten.
[13:9] Maar ziet gij toe voor u zelven; want zij zullen u overleveren aan de raadsvergaderingen, en in de synagogen zult gij geslagen worden, en voor stadhouders en koningen zult gij gesteld worden om Mijnentwille, tot een getuigenis voor hen.
[13:10] En aan al de volken moet eerst het Evangelie gepredikt worden.
[13:11] En als zij u wegvoeren en overleveren, weest dan te voren niet bekommerd wat gij zeggen zult, maar wat u zal worden gegeven in die ure, spreekt dat; want gij zijt het niet die spreekt, maar de Heilige Geest.
[13:12] En de eene broeder zal den anderen broeder overgeven tot den dood, en een vader zijn kind, en kinderen zullen opstaan tegen ouders en zullen hen dooden; 
[13:13] en gij zult gehaat zijn door allen om mijns Naams wil; maar die zal volharden tot den einde, die zal behouden worden.
[13:14] Wanneer gij dan den gruwel der verwoesting zult zien staan waar hij niet mag zijn—( die het leest lette er op! — dat dan die in Judea zijn naar de bergen vluchten; 
[13:15] die dan op het dak is, kome niet naar beneden in zijn huis, en ga niet uit om iets uit zijn huis weg te nemen; 
[13:16] en die op den akker is, keere niet terug om zijn kleed weg te nemen!
[13:17] Maar wee den zwangeren en den zogenden in die dagen!
[13:18] Bidt dus, dat dit niet voorvalle in den winter!
[13:19] Want in die dagen zal er een verdrukking zijn, zooals er geene is geweest van het begin der schepping, die God geschapen heeft, tot nu toe, en ook niet zijn zal.
[13:20] En zoo de Heere die dagen niet verkort had, geen vleesch zou behouden worden; maar ter wille van de uitverkorenen, die Hij uitverkoren heeft, heeft Hij die dagen verkort.
[13:21] En als iemand dan tot ulieden zal zeggen: Zie hier, de Christus! — zie daar! — gelooft het niet.
[13:22] Want schijnchristussen en schijnprofeten zullen er opstaan, en zij zullen mirakelen doen en teekenen om te verleiden, als het mogelijk was, zelfs de uitverkorenen.
[13:23] Maar ziet gijlieden toe; Ik heb u alles voorzegd!
[13:24] Maar in die dagen, na die verdrukking, zal de zon duister worden, en de maan zal haar licht niet geven,
[13:25] en de sterren zullen uit den hemel vallen, en de krachten, die in de hemelen zijn, zullen beroerd worden; 
[13:26] en alsdan zullen zij den Zoon des menschen zien komen in wolken, met veel kracht en glorie; 
[13:27] en alsdan zal Hij de engelen zenden en zal de uitverkorenen verzamelen uit de vier windstreken, van het uiteinde der aarde tot het uiteinde des hemels. 
[13:28]  Van den vijgeboom nu leert gij deze gelijkenis: Zoodra zijn tak zacht wordt en de bladeren uitbotten, dan weet gij dat de zomer nabij is.
[13:29] Zoo ook gijlieden, als gij die dingen ziet geschieden, dan weet gij dat het nabij is, vóór de deur.
[13:30] Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden, dat deze natie niet zal voorbijgaan, totdat dit alles zal geschied zijn.
[13:31] De hemel en de aarde zullen voorbijgaan, maar mijn woorden zullen geenszins voorbijgaan!
[13:32] Maar van dien dag of die ure weet niemand, noch de engelen in den hemel, noch de Zoon, maar wel de Vader.
[13:33] Ziet toe, zijt gereed en bidt! want gij weet niet wanneer het de tijd is.
[13:34] Het is zooals een mensch, die buitenslands ging, zijn huis verliet en zijn dienstknechten het bestuur gaf, aan een ieder zijn werk, en aan den deurwachter gebood dat hij waken zou.
[13:35] Waakt dan, want gij weet niet wanneer de heer des huizes komt, of laat, of des middernachts, of tegen den morgen, of des morgens vroeg!
[13:36] opdat hij, onverziens komende, u niet slapende vinde.
[13:37] En wat Ik ulieden zeg, dat zeg Ik tot allen: — Waakt!  
[14:1] En het feest van Paschen en van de ongedeesemde brooden was na twee dagen; en de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden zochten hoe zij Hem met list zouden vatten en dooden.
[14:2] Want zij zeiden: Niet op het feest, opdat er geen volksoproer geschiede. 
[14:3]  En als Hij in Bethanië was, in het huis van Simon den melaatsche, terwijl Hij aanlag, kwam er een vrouw die een albasten flesch had met onvervalschten, kostbaren nardusbalsem; en zij brak de albasten flesch en goot die uit over zijn hoofd.
[14:4] Sommigen nu waren er die dit bij zich zelven kwalijk namen, en zeiden: Waartoe dient dit verlies van den balsem?
[14:5] Want deze balsem had kunnen verkocht worden voor meer dan driehonderd penningen, en den armen gegeven zijn! — En zij werden vergramd tegen haar.
[14:6] Maar Jezus zeide: Laat haar doen; waarom doet gij haar moeite aan? een goed werk heeft zij aan Mij gedaan; 
[14:7] Want de armen hebt gij altijd met u, en als gij wilt kunt gij hun goed doen, maar Mij hebt gij niet altijd; 
[14:8] zij heeft gedaan wat ze kon; zij is mijn lichaam vooraf reeds komen zalven ter begrafenis.
[14:9] Voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Overal waar het Evangelie zal worden gepredikt, over de geheele wereld, daar zal ook gesproken worden tot haar gedachtenis van hetgeen zij heeft gedaan. 
[14:10]  En Judas Iskariot, een van de twaalven, ging heen tot de overpriesters, om Jezus aan hen over te leveren.
[14:11] Dezen nu waren verblijd toen zij dit hoorden en beloofden hem geld te geven; en hij zocht hoe hij Hem ter rechtertijd zou overleveren. 
[14:12]  En op den eersten dag der ongedeesemde brooden, als men het paaschlam slachtte, zeiden zijn discipelen tot Jezus: Waar wilt Gij dat wij den paaschmaaltijd gaan toebereiden om dien te eten?
[14:13] En Hij zond twee zijner discipelen uit en zeide tot hen: Gaat heen naar de stad Jerusalem, en u zal een mensch ontmoeten die een kruik water draagt; volgt hem.
[14:14] En waar hij ingaat, zegt daar tot den huisheer: De Meester zegt: Waar is mijn eetplaats, waar Ik het paaschmaal met mijn discipelen zal eten?
[14:15] En hij zal u een groote bovenzaal wijzen, toebereid en gereed; en daar zult gij het ons bereiden.
[14:16] En de discipelen gingen uit en gingen naar de stad, en vonden het zooals Hij hun gezegd had, en zij bereidden het paaschmaal.
[14:17] En toen het avond was geworden kwam Hij met de twaalven. 
[14:18]  En toen zij aanlagen en aten zeide Jezus: Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden dat één uit ulieden, die met Mij eet, Mij verraden zal.
[14:19] En zij begonnen bedroefd te worden en één voor één tot Hem te zeggen: Ik toch niet?
[14:20] En Hij zeide tot hen: Eén uit de twaalven, die met Mij in den schotel indoopt; 
[14:21] de Zoon des menschen gaat wel heen, zooals van Hem is geschreven; maar wee dien mensch, door wien de Zoon des menschen wordt verraden! Het ware hem goed als die mensch niet geboren was! 
[14:22]  En toen zij aan het eten waren nam Jezus brood, en Hij dankte, en brak het, en gaf het hun, en zeide: Neemt, dat is mijn lichaam!
[14:23] En den beker nemende, en een dankzegging gesproken hebbende, gaf Hij hun dien, en zij dronken allen daaruit.
[14:24] En Hij zeide tot hen: Dit is mijn bloed des nieuwen verbonds, dat voor velen wordt vergoten!
[14:25] Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden dat Ik geenszins meer drinken zal van de vrucht des wijnstoks, tot op dien dag, als Ik ze nieuw zal drinken in het koninkrijk Gods. 
[14:26]  En als zij den lofzang hadden gezongen gingen zij uit naar den Berg der Olijven.
[14:27] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Gij allen zult dezen nacht aan Mij geërgerd worden, want er is geschreven: Ik zal den Herder slaan, en de schapen zullen verstrooid worden.
[14:28] Maar nadat Ik zal verrezen zijn, zal Ik u voorgaan naar Galilea.
[14:29] Petrus nu zeide tot Hem: Al zouden zij ook allen geërgerd worden, ik toch niet!
[14:30] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Voorwaar, Ik zeg u dat gij heden, in dezen nacht, eer dat een haan tweemaal zal gekraaid hebben, Mij driemaal zult verloochenen!
[14:31] Maar Petrus zeide nog te meer: Al móest ik ook met U sterven, ik zal U geenszins verloochenen! — Desgelijks spraken zij ook allen. 
[14:32]  En zij kwamen aan een plaats, genaamd Gethsemane, en Hij zeide tot zijn discipelen: Zit hier neder, totdat Ik gebeden heb.
[14:33] En Hij nam Petrus en Jakobus en Johannes met zich mede, en begon ontroerd en benauwd te worden,
[14:34] en zeide tot hen: Mijn ziel is diep bedroefd tot stervens toe; blijft hier en waakt!
[14:35] En een weinig voortgaande viel Hij op den grond, en bad dat die ure van Hem mocht voorbijgaan, als het mogelijk was.
[14:36] En Hij zeide: Abba, Vader! alles is U mogelijk; neem van Mij dezen drinkbeker weg! — Doch niet wat Ik wil, maar wat Gij wilt!
[14:37] En Hij kwam en vond hen slapende, en Hij zeide tot Petrus: Simon, gij slaapt? — kunt gij niet één ure waken?
[14:38] Waakt en bidt, opdat gij niet tot bekoring komt: De geest is wel gewillig, maar het vleesch is zwak.
[14:39] En wederom ging Hij heen en bad, en sprak dezelfde woorden.
[14:40] En terugkeerende vond Hij hen wederom slapende, want hun oogen waren bezwaard, en zij wisten niet wat zij Hem zouden antwoorden.
[14:41] En Hij kwam voor de derde maal en zeide tot hen: Slaapt nu voort en rust! Het is genoeg. De ure is gekomen; ziet, de Zoon des menschen wordt overgeleverd in de handen der zondaren!
[14:42] Staat op, laat ons gaan! Ziet, die Mij verraadt is nabij! 
[14:43]  En terstond, toen Hij nog sprak, kwam Judas Iskariot, één van de twaalven, en met hem een groote menigte, met zwaarden en stokken, van de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden, en de oudsten.
[14:44] De verrader nu had hun een teeken gegeven, zeggende: Dien ik zal kussen, die is het; grijpt Hem en voert Hem zeker weg!
[14:45] En toen hij er gekomen was, ging hij terstond op Hem toe en zeide: Meester! — En hij kuste Hem.
[14:46] En zij sloegen de handen aan Hem en grepen Hem.
[14:47] En één dergenen die er bij stonden trok het zwaard en trof des hoogepriesters dienstknecht en sloeg hem het oor af.
[14:48] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Als tegen een roover zijt gij uitgegaan, met zwaarden en stokken, om Mij te vangen?
[14:49] dagelijks was Ik bij ulieden in den tempel en leerde, en gij hebt Mij niet gegrepen! Maar zoo moeten de schrifturen vervuld worden.
[14:50] En ze verlieten Hem allen en vluchtten weg.
[14:51] En een zeker jongeling volgde Hem, met een linnen kleed om het naakte lichaam, en zij grepen hem;
[14:52] maar hij liet het kleed in den steek en vluchtte naakt. 
[14:53]  En zij voerden Jezus naar den hoogepriester, en al de overpriesters en de oudsten en de schriftgeleerden vergaderden met hem.
[14:54] En Petrus volgde Hem van verre tot binnen in den voorhof des hoogepriesters, en hij was mede gezeten niet de dienaren en warmde zich, bij het licht van het vuur.
[14:55] De overpriesters nu en de geheele Raad zochten getuigenis tegen Jezus, om Hem te dooden, en zij vonden er geen.
[14:56] Want velen gaven een valsch getuigenis tegen Hem en de getuigenissen kwamen niet overeen.
[14:57] En sommigen stonden op, die valschelijk tegen Hem getuigden, zeggende:
[14:58] Wij hebben Hem hooren zeggen: Ik zal dezen tempel, die met handen gemaakt is, afbreken, en in drie dagen een anderen bouwen, zonder handen gemaakt.
[14:59] Doch ook alzoo kwam hun getuigenis niet overeen. 
[14:60]  En de hoogepriester stond op in het midden en vroeg Jezus, zeggende: Antwoordt Gij niets? wat getuigen dezen tegen U?
[14:61] Maar Hij zweeg en antwoordde niets. — Wederom vroeg de hoogepriester Hem en zeide tot Hem: Gij zijt de Christus, de Zoon van den Hooggeloofde?
[14:62] En Jezus zeide: Ik ben het! en gij zult den Zoon des menschen zien, gezeten aan de rechterhand der Almacht, en komende met de wolken des hemels!
[14:63] En de hoogepriester scheurde zijn kleederen en zeide: Wat hebben we nog getuigen van noode?
[14:64] gij hebt de lastering gehoord! Wat dunkt ulieden? En zij allen veroordeelden Hem des doods schuldig te zijn.
[14:65] En sommigen begonnen Hem te bespuwen en Hem het aangezicht te bedekken, en Hem met vuisten te slaan, en zeiden tot Hem: Profeteer! — En de dienaren sloegen Hem in het gezicht.
[14:66] En toen Petrus beneden in den voorhof was kwam een der dienstmaagden des hoogepriesters.
[14:67] En Petrus ziende, die zich warmde, zag zij hem aan en zeide: Ook gij waart met den Nazarener Jezus!
[14:68] Maar hij loochende het en zeide: Ik weet en versta niet wat gij zegt! — En hij ging naar buiten, naar het voorportaal en een haan kraaide.
[14:69] En de dienstmaagd hem ziende, begon wederom te zeggen tot die daarbij stonden: Deze is een uit hen!
[14:70] Maar hij loochende het wederom. En kort daarna zeiden degenen die daarbij stonden wederom tot Petrus: Waarlijk, gij zijt een uit hen, want gij zijt ook een Galileër!
[14:71] Maar hij begon te vloeken en te zweren: Ik ken dien mensch niet, van wien gij spreekt!
[14:72] En terstond kraaide een haan voor de tweede maal. En Petrus werd het woord indachtig, hoe Jezus tot hem gezegd had: Eer een haan tweemaal zal kraaien, zult gij Mij driemaal verloochenen. — En hij dacht daarover na, en weende.  
[15:1] En terstond, des morgens vroeg, hielden de overpriesters, met de oudsten, en de schriftgeleerden, en den geheelen Raad samen een vergadering; en toen zij Jezus gebonden hadden voerden zij Hem weg en gaven Hem over aan Pilatus.
[15:2] En Pilatus vroeg Hem: Gij zijt de Koning der Joden? — En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Gij zegt het.
[15:3] En de overpriesters beschuldigden Hem van vele dingen.
[15:4] Maar Pilatus vroeg Hem wederom: Antwoordt Gij niets? zie, van hoeveel beschuldigen zij U!
[15:5] Maar Jezus antwoordde niets meer, zoodat Pilatus zich verwonderde. 
[15:6]  En op het feest liet hij hun één gevangene los, dien zij begeerden.
[15:7] Er was nu een, Barabbas genoemd, met de oproermakers gevangen, die in een oproer een moord had begaan.
[15:8] En de schare kwam op en begon te eischen dat hij hun doen zou, zooals hij gewoon was.
[15:9] Doch Pilatus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wilt gij dat ik u den koning der Joden zal loslaten?
[15:10] Want hij wist dat de overpriesters Hem uit nijdigheid hadden overgeleverd.
[15:11] Doch de overpriesters stookten de schare op, dat hij hun Barabbas liever zou loslaten.
[15:12] Pilatus dan antwoordde wederom en zeide tot hen: Wat wilt gij dan dat ik doen zal met Hem dien gij koning der Joden noemt?
[15:13] Doch zij schreeuwden wederom: Kruisig Hem!
[15:14] Pilatus nu zeide tot hen: Wat kwaads heeft Hij toch gedaan? — Maar des te meer schreeuwden zij: Kruisig Hem!
[15:15] Pilatus nu, die aan de schare wilde voldoen, liet hun Barabbas los, en gaf Jezus over, nadat hij Hem gegeeseld had, opdat Hij zou gekruisigd worden. 
[15:16]  De soldaten dan voerden Hem weg, naar binnen in den voorhof, dat is het rechthuis, en zij riepen den ganschen troep samen.
[15:17] En zij deden Hem een purperen mantel om en zetten Hem een kroon op, die van doornen was gevlochten.
[15:18] En zij begonnen Hem te begroeten: Wees gegroet, koning der Joden!
[15:19] En zij sloegen op zijn hoofd met een riet, en spogen op Hem, en vielen voor Hem op de knieën en aanbaden Hem.
[15:20] En toen zij Hem bespot hadden, trokken zij Hem het purperen kleed uit en deden Hem zijn eigen kleederen aan. 
[15:21]  En zij voerden Hem weg om Hem te kruisigen, en dwongen zekeren Simon van Cyrene, die daar voorbijging en van den akker kwam— den vader van Alexander en Rufus— om zijn kruis op te nemen.
[15:22] En zij brachten Hem naar de plaats Golgotha, dat wil zeggen: Plaats der doodshoofden.
[15:23] En zij gaven Hem wijn met mirre gemengd; maar Hij nam dien niet.
[15:24] En zij kruisigden Hem en verdeelden zijn kleederen, door het lot daarover te werpen, wat elk zou nemen.
[15:25] En het was de derde ure toen zij Hem kruisigden.
[15:26] En de aanwijzing zijner beschuldiging, boven Hem geschreven, was: De Koning der Joden.
[15:27] En met Hem kruisigden zij twee moordenaars, den één aan zijn rechter– en den ander aan zijn linkerzijde.
[15:28] En de schrifture is vervuld, die zegt: En met misdadigers is hij gerekend.
[15:29] En de voorbijgangers lasterden Hem, en schudden hun hoofden en zeiden: Welaan, gij tempelafbreker en opbouwer in drie dagen!
[15:30] verlos u zelven door af te komen van het kruis!
[15:31] Desgelijks bespotten Hem ook de overpriesters onder malkander, met de schriftgeleerden, zeggende: Anderen heeft Hij verlost, zich zelven verlossen kan Hij niet!
[15:32] die Christus, de koning Israëls! dat Hij nu afkome van het kruis, dat wij het zien en wij zullen gelooven! En ook die met Hem gekruisigd waren, beschimpten Hem.
[15:33] En toen de zesde ure was gekomen werd er duisternis over de geheele aarde tot de negende ure toe.
[15:34] En ter negender ure riep Jezus met een groote stem: Eloï, Eloï, lema sabachthanei, dat wil zeggen: Mijn God! mijn God! waartoe hebt Gij Mij verlaten?
[15:35] En sommigen, die daarbij stonden en het hoorden, zeiden: Zie, Hij roept Elias!
[15:36] En één liep er toe en vulde een spons met azijn en stak die op een rietstok en gaf Hem te drinken, zeggende: Wacht, laat ons zien of Elias komt om Hem af te nemen! 
[15:37]  En Jezus riep met een luide stem en gaf den geest.
[15:38] En het voorhangsel des tempels scheurde in tweeën van boven naar beneden.
[15:39] En de hoofdman die er bij stond tegenover Hem, ziende dat Hij alzoo roepende den geest had gegeven, zeide: Waarlijk, deze mensch was Gods Zoon!
[15:40] En er waren ook vrouwen, die het uit de verte aanschouwden, onder welke ook Maria Magdalena, en Maria, de moeder van Jakobus den jongere en van Joses, en Salome.
[15:41] Deze volgden Hem reeds als Hij in Galilea was en dienden Hem; en vele anderen, die met Hem naar Jerusalem waren opgegaan. 
[15:42]  En toen het nu avond was geworden, daar het voorbereiding was, dat is de voorsabbat,
[15:43] kwam Jozef van Arimathea, een aanzienlijk raadsheer, die ook zelf het koninkrijk Gods verwachtende was; en hij verstoutte zich en ging tot Pilatus en verzocht om het lichaam van Jezus.
[15:44] Doch Pilatus verwonderde zich dat Hij al zou gestorven zijn, en riep den hoofdman tot zich en vroeg hem of Hij al lang dood was.
[15:45] En toen hij het van den hoofdman vernomen had, schonk hij het lichaam aan Jozef.
[15:46] En deze kocht lijnwaad en, nadat hij Hem had afgenomen, wond hij Hem in het lijnwaad en leide Hem in een graf dat uit een steenrots was gekapt, en hij rolde een steen tegen de deur des grafs.
[15:47] Maria Magdalena nu, en Maria de moeder van Joses zagen toe waar Hij gelegd werd.  
[16:1] En toen de sabbat voorbij was kochten Maria Magdalena, en Maria de moeder van Jakobus, en Salome welriekende kruiden om Jezus te gaan zalven.
[16:2] En zeer vroeg, op den eersten dag der week, kwamen zij naar het graf, toen de zon aan het opgaan was.
[16:3] En zij zeiden tot malkander: Wie zal voor ons den steen van voor de deur des grafs afwentelen?
[16:4] En opziende zagen zij dat de steen afgewenteld was; — want hij was zeer groot.
[16:5] En in het graf gegaan zijnde, zagen zij een jongeling zitten ter rechterzijde, gekleed met een lang, wit kleed, en zij verschrikten.
[16:6] Maar hij zeide tot haar: Verschrikt niet! Jezus zoekt gij, den Nazarener, den gekruisigde; Hij is verrezen, Hij is hier niet! Zie de plaats waar zij Hem gelegd hebben.
[16:7] Maar gaat heen, zegt tot zijn discipelen en tot Petrus, dat Hij u voorgaat naar Galilea; daar zult gij Hem zien, zooals Hij u gezegd heeft!
[16:8] En zij gingen heen en vloden van het graf, want zij vreesden en beefden, en zeiden aan niemand iets, want zij waren bevreesd. 
[16:9]  Toen Jezus nu des morgens vroeg was verrezen, op den eersten dag der week, verscheen Hij eerst aan Maria Magdalena, uit wie Hij zeven booze geesten had uitgeworpen.
[16:10] Deze ging heen en boodschapte het aan degenen die met Hem geweest waren, die treurden en weenden.
[16:11] En als dezen hoorden dat Hij leefde en door haar gezien was, geloofden zij het niet. 
[16:12]  Daarna verscheen Hij in een andere gedaante aan twee van hen, die wandelden en naar het veld gingen.
[16:13] Ook dezen gingen heen en boodschapten het aan de anderen; maar ook dezen geloofden zij niet. 
[16:14]  Later verscheen Hij aan de elf apostelen toen zij aan tafel lagen, en verweet hun ongeloof en verharding des harten, omdat zij hen niet hadden geloofd die Hem gezien hadden, nadat Hij was verrezen. 
[16:15]  En Hij zeide tot hen: Gaat heen door de geheele wereld, predikt het Evangelie aan alle schepsel.
[16:16] Die geloofd zal hebben en gedoopt zal zijn die zal behouden worden, maar die niet geloofd zal hebben zal veroordeeld worden.
[16:17] Dengenen nu, die geloofd zullen hebben, zullen deze teekenen volgen: In mijn Naam zullen zij booze geesten uitwerpen; met nieuwe tongen zullen zij spreken;
[16:18] slangen zullen zij opnemen, en mochten zij iets doodelijks drinken, dat zal hun geenszins schaden; op kranken zullen zij de handen leggen en zij zullen genezen. 
[16:19]  De Heere dan, nadat Hij tot hen gesproken had, is opgenomen naar den hemel en gezeten aan Gods rechterhand.
[16:20] Zij nu gingen uit en predikten overal, terwijl de Heere medewerkte en het woord bekrachtigde door de teekenen die er op volgden.   

### Luke

[1:1] Aangezien velen ondernomen hebben om een verhaal te geven van de dingen die onder ons met volkomen zekerheid voorgevallen zijn,
[1:2] gelijk zij ons hebben medegedeeld, die van den beginne af ooggetuigen en dienaars des woords zijn geweest;
[1:3] zoo heeft het ook mij goedgedacht, nadat ik alles vooraf nauwkeurig onderzocht heb, ze voor u achtereenvolgens te schrijven, voortreffelijke Theofilus!
[1:4] opdat gij de zekere waarheid moogt erkennen van de leer waarin gij onderwezen zijt. 
[1:5]  In de dagen van Herodes, den koning van Judea, was er een zeker priester met name Zacharias, uit de dagorde van Abia, en zijn vrouw was uit de dochteren van Aäron, en haar naam was Elisabet.
[1:6] En zij waren beiden rechtvaardig voor God, wandelende in al de geboden en instellingen des Heeren, onberispelijk.
[1:7] En zij hadden geen kind, omdat Elisabet onvruchtbaar was; en zij beiden waren tot hooge jaren gekomen.
[1:8] Het geschiedde nu, als hij in de beurt zijner dagorde eens het priesterambt voor God bediende,
[1:9] dat, naar de gewoonte van het priesterschap, het lot op hem viel om in den tempel des Heeren in te gaan en het reukoffer aan te steken.
[1:10] En de geheele menigte des volks was buiten, biddende ter ure des reukoffers.
[1:11] En hem verscheen een engel des Heeren, staande aan de rechterzijde van den reukaltaar.
[1:12] En Zacharias hem ziende werd verschrikt en vreeze viel op hem.
[1:13] Maar de engel zeide tot hem: Vrees niet, Zacharias! want uw gebed is verhoord, en uw vrouw Elisabet zal u een zoon baren en gij zult zijn naam Johannes noemen.
[1:14] En gij zult vreugde en blijdschap hebben, en velen zullen zich verheugen over zijn geboorte;
[1:15] want hij zal groot zijn voor den Heere, en wijn of sterken drank zal hij geenszins drinken, en met den Heiligen Geest zal hij vervuld worden reeds van zijn geboorte af,
[1:16] en velen der kinderen Israëls zal hij bekeeren tot den Heere hun God;
[1:17] en hij zal vóór Hem heengaan in den geest en de kracht van Elias, om de harten der vaderen te keeren tot de kinderen en de ongehoorzamen tot de verstandigheid der rechtvaardigen, om voor den Heere een wel toegerust volk te bereiden.
[1:18] En Zacharias zeide tot den engel: Waaraan zal ik dit weten? ik ben toch een oud man en mijn vrouw is hoog bejaard?
[1:19] En de engel antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Ik ben Gabriël die voor Gods aangezicht sta, en ik ben gezonden om tot u te spreken en u deze goede boodschap te verkondigen;
[1:20] en zie, gij zult stom zijn en niet kunnen spreken tot op den dag dat deze dingen geschieden zullen, omdat gij mijn woorden niet geloofd hebt, die op hun tijd zullen vervuld worden.
[1:21] En het volk was wachtende op Zacharias, en verwonderd, dat hij zoo lang in den tempel bleef.
[1:22] Maar toen hij naar buiten kwam kon hij tot hen niet spreken, en zij bemerkten dat hij in den tempel een visioen had gezien; en hij wenkte hun toe en bleef stom.
[1:23] En het geschiedde, toen de dagen van zijn dienst vervuld waren, dat hij naar zijn huis ging.
[1:24] Na die dagen nu werd Elisabet, zijn huisvrouw, zwanger; en zij hield zich vijf maanden verborgen, zeggende:
[1:25] Alzoo heeft mij de Heere gedaan in de dagen waarin Hij neergezien heeft om mijn smaad onder de menschen weg te nemen. 
[1:26]  En in de zesde maand werd de engel Gabriël door God gezonden naar een stad van Galilea, genaamd Nazaret,
[1:27] tot een maagd, die ondertrouwd was met een man, genaamd Jozef, uit het geslacht van David; en de naam der maagd was Maria.
[1:28] En de engel, bij haar binnengekomen zijnde, zeide: Wees gegroet, gij begenadigde! de Heere met u! gij gezegende onder de vrouwen!
[1:29] Zij nu ontroerde op dit woord, en bepeinsde wat voor een groetenis dit mocht zijn.
[1:30] En de engel zeide tot haar: Vrees niet, Maria! want gij hebt genade gevonden bij God;
[1:31] en zie, gij zult zwanger worden en een zoon baren, en zijn naam Jezus noemen;
[1:32] deze zal groot zijn en Zoon des Allerhoogsten genoemd worden; en de Heere God zal Hem den troon geven van zijn vader David;
[1:33] en Hij zal koning zijn over het huis van Jakob tot in eeuwigheid en aan zijn koninkrijk zal geen einde zijn.
[1:34] Maria nu zeide tot den engel: Hoe zal dit wezen, daar ik geen man heb?
[1:35] En de engel antwoordde en zeide tot haar: De Heilige Geest zal over u komen, en de kracht des Allerhoogsten zal u overschaduwen; daarom zal ook het heilige, dat geboren wordt, Gods Zoon worden genoemd;
[1:36] en zie, Elisabet, uw bloedverwante, ook zij is in haar ouderdom zwanger van een zoon, en dit is de zesde maand voor haar die onvruchtbaar werd genoemd;
[1:37] want onmogelijk zal er bij God geen woord zijn.
[1:38] En Maria zeide: Zie, de dienstmaagd des Heeren; mij geschiede naar uw woord! En de engel ging van haar weg. 
[1:39]  Maria nu stond in die dagen op en ging met haast naar het gebergte, naar een stad van Juda.
[1:40] En zij kwam in het huis van Zacharias en groette Elisabet.
[1:41] En het geschiedde, zoodra Elisabet de begroeting van Maria hoorde, dat het kindeken in haar lichaam opsprong; en Elisabet werd vervuld met den Heiligen Geest.
[1:42] En zij riep met een groote stem en zeide: Gezegend zijt gij onder de vrouwen, en gezegend de vrucht uws lichaams!
[1:43] en vanwaar overkomt mij dit, dat de moeder mijns Heeren tot mij komt?
[1:44] want zie, toen de klank uwer begroeting in mijn ooren kwam sprong het kindeken van vreugde op in mijn lichaam;
[1:45] en zalig is zij die geloofd heeft, want volbracht zal worden, wat haar vanwege den Heere is gezegd! 
[1:46]  En Maria zeide: Mijn ziel maakt den Heere groot,
[1:47] en mijn geest verheugt zich over God, mijn Verlosser,
[1:48] omdat Hij nedergezien heeft op de geringheid van zijn dienstmaagd; want zie, van nu af zullen alle geslachten mij zalig spreken!
[1:49] omdat de Almachtige aan mij groote dingen heeft gedaan; en zijn Naam is heilig,
[1:50] en zijn barmhartigheid is van geslachte tot geslachte over degenen die Hem vreezen.
[1:51] Hij heeft kracht gedaan door zijn arm; Hij heeft verstrooid die hoogmoedig zijn in de gedachten hunner harten;
[1:52] Hij heeft machtigen van de troonen gestooten en geringen verhoogd,
[1:53] hongerigen heeft Hij met goederen vervuld en rijken ledig weggezonden.
[1:54] Hij heeft Israël, zijn knecht, opgenomen, om te gedenken aan de barmharheden,
[1:55] — gelijk Hij tot onze vaderen heeft gesproken— aan Abraham en zijn nakomelingen tot in eeuwigheid!
[1:56] Maria nu bleef bij haar omtrent drie maanden, en zij keerde terug naar haar huis. 
[1:57]  En de tijd van Elisabet werd vervuld dat zij baren zou, en zij baarde een zoon.
[1:58] En de geburen en haar familie hoorden dat de Heere zijn barmhartigheid aan haar groot gemaakt had, en zij verblijdden zich met haar.
[1:59] En het geschiedde op den achtsten dag dat zij kwamen om het jongsken te besnijden, en zij noemden het naar den naam zijns vaders, Zacharias.
[1:60] En zijn moeder antwoordde en zeide: Neen, maar het zal Johannes genoemd worden!
[1:61] En zij zeiden tot haar: Er is niemand in uw familie die alzoo genoemd wordt!
[1:62] Zij wenkten dan zijn vader, hoe die zou willen dat het genoemd werd.
[1:63] En hij vroeg om een schrijfbordje en schreef, zeggende: Johannes is zijn naam; en allen verwonderden zich.
[1:64] En op eens werd zijn mond en tong geopend en hij sprak, lovende God.
[1:65] En er kwam vreeze over allen die daar omtrent woonden, en in het gansche gebergte van Judea werd over al deze dingen gesproken.
[1:66] En allen die het hoorden bewaarden het in hun harten, zeggende: Wat zal toch dit kindeken wezen? Want ook de hand des Heeren was met hem. 
[1:67]  En Zacharias, zijn vader, werd vervuld met den Heiligen Geest en profeteerde, zeggende:
[1:68] Geprezen zij de Heere, de God van Israël, omdat Hij zijn volk heeft bezocht en vrijgekocht,
[1:69] en omdat Hij een hoorn der verlossing ons heeft opgericht in het geslacht van David, zijn knecht,
[1:70] — gelijk Hij gesproken heeft door den mond zijner heilige profeten van de oudste tijden af, —
[1:71] verlossing van onze vijanden en uit de hand van allen die ons haten,
[1:72] om barmhartigheid te doen aan onze vaderen, en om te gedenken aan zijn heilig verbond,
[1:73] aan den eed dien Hij gezworen heeft aan Abraham onzen vader, om ons te geven:
[1:74] dat wij, uit de hand onzer vijanden verlost zijnde, Hem onbevreesd dienen zouden,
[1:75] in heiligheid en rechtvaardigheid voor zijn aangezicht, al onze dagen.
[1:76] En gij, kindeken! een profeet des Allerhoogsten zult gij genoemd worden; want gij zult gaan voor het aangezicht des Heeren om zijn wegen effen te maken,
[1:77] om aan zijn volk kennis der verlossing te geven in de vergiffenis hunner zonden,
[1:78] door de innerlijke barmhartigheden onzes Gods, waarmede ons bezocht heeft het schijnend Licht uit de hoogte;
[1:79] om te verschijnen aan degenen die gezeten zijn in de duisternis en in de schaduw des doods; om onze voeten te richten op den weg des vredes.
[1:80] Het kindeken nu groeide op en werd gesterkt naar den geest, en hij was in de woestijnen tot op den dag zijner optreding in Israël.  
[2:1] Het geschiedde nu in die dagen dat er een bevel uitging vanwege keizer Augustus, dat de geheele wereld zou opgeschreven worden.
[2:2] Deze eerste opschrijving geschiedde toen Cyrenius over Syrië landvoogd was.
[2:3] En allen gingen om opgeschreven te worden, een ieder naar zijn eigen stad.
[2:4] En ook Jozef ging op van Galilea, uit de stad Nazaret, naar Judea, tot de stad van David, Bethlehem genaamd, omdat hij was uit het huis en geslacht van David,
[2:5] om opgeschreven te worden met Maria, zijn bruid, die zwanger was.
[2:6] Toen zij daar nu waren geschiedde het dat de dagen werden vervuld dat zij zou baren.
[2:7] En zij baarde haar eerstgeboren Zoon, en wond Hem in doeken, en leide Hem neder in de kribbe, omdat er geen plaats voor hen was in de herberg. 
[2:8]  En er waren herders in die zelfde landstreek, die in het veld des nachts de wacht hielden over hun kudde.
[2:9] En zie, een engel des Heeren stond bij hen en de glorie des Heeren omscheen hen en zij vreesden met groote vreeze.
[2:10] En de engel zeide tot hen: Vreest niet, want ziet, ik verkondig u een groote blijdschap, die voor het geheele volk is bestemd,
[2:11] dat u heden geboren is de Zaligmaker, welke is Christus, de Heere, in de stad van David;
[2:12] en dit is u het teeken: Gij zult een kindeken vinden, in doeken gewonden, liggende in een kribbe.
[2:13] En schielijk was daar met den engel een menigte van het hemelsch heirleger, die God loofden, zeggende:
[2:14] Glorie aan God in het allerhoogste, en op de aarde vrede, in menschen des welbehagens!
[2:15] En het geschiedde als de engelen van hen weggegaan waren naar den hemel, dat de herders tot malkander zeiden: Laat ons dan heengaan naar Bethlehem en laat ons zien de zaak die geschied is, welke de Heere ons heeft bekend gemaakt.
[2:16] En zij gingen met spoed en vonden Maria en Jozef, en het kindeken liggende in de kribbe.
[2:17] En het gezien hebbende, maakten zij het woord bekend dat hun gezegd was aangaande dit kindeken.
[2:18] En allen die het hoorden verwonderden zich over hetgeen tot hen gezegd was door de herders.
[2:19] Doch Maria bewaarde al deze dingen en overleide die in haar harte.
[2:20] En de herders keerden weder aan God glorie en lof gevende over alles wat zij gehoord en gezien hadden, gelijk tot hen gesproken was. 
[2:21]  En toen er acht dagen vervuld waren dat men het kindeken besnijden zou, werd zijn naam Jezus genoemd, welke door den engel genoemd was, vóórdat Hij in het lichaam ontvangen was. 
[2:22]  En toen de dagen hunner zuivering volgens de wet van Mozes vervuld waren, brachten zij Hem naar Jerusalem om Hem den Heere voor te stellen,
[2:23] gelijk er geschreven is in de wet des Heeren: Alle eerstgeborene, van het mannelijk geslacht, zal den Heere heilig genaamd worden.
[2:24] En om een offerande te geven volgens hetgeen in de wet des Heeren gezegd is: Een paar tortelduiven of twee jonge duiven. 
[2:25]  En ziet, er was een mensch in Jerusalem, wiens naam was Simeon. Deze mensch was rechtvaardig en godvruchtig, verwachtende de vertroosting van Israël, en de Heilige Geest was op hem.
[2:26] En hem was een openbaring gegeven door den Heiligen Geest dat hij den dood niet zien zou vóórdat hij den Gezalfde des Heeren zou zien.
[2:27] En hij kwam door den Geest naar den tempel; en als de ouders het kindeken Jezus binnen brachten om met Hem te doen naar de gewoonte der wet,
[2:28] zoo nam hij het in zijn armen en loofde God en zeide:
[2:29] Heere! laat nu uw dienstknecht in vrede heengaan, naar uw woord,
[2:30] want mijn oogen hebben uw verlossing gezien,
[2:31] die Gij bereid hebt voor het aangezicht van al de volken;
[2:32] een licht tot openbaring voor de heidenen en tot glorie voor uw volk Israël.
[2:33] En Jozef en zijn moeder waren verwonderd over hetgeen aangaande Hem gezegd werd.
[2:34] En Simeon zegende hen en zeide tot Maria, zijn moeder: Zie, deze is gesteld tot een val en opstanding van velen in Israël, en tot een teeken dat wedersproken wordt;
[2:35] en ook u zelve zal een zwaard door de ziel gaan— opdat uit vele harten de overleggingen openbaar worden. 
[2:36]  Er was ook een profetesse, Anna, een dochter van Phanuël, uit den stam van Aser. Deze was hoog bejaard, en had van haar maagdelijken staat af zeven jaar met haar man geleefd.
[2:37] En zij was een weduwe van omstreeks vier en tachtig jaar, die den tempel niet verliet, en met vasten en gebeden God nacht en dag diende.
[2:38] Deze nu, ter zelfder ure daarbij komende, loofde evenzoo God en sprak van Hem tot allen die te Jerusalem de verlossing verwachtten.
[2:39] Toen zij nu volgens de wet des Heeren alles volbracht hadden, keerden zij terug naar Galilea, tot hun stad Nazaret.
[2:40] Het kindeken nu groeide op en werd versterkt, vervuld zijnde met wijsheid, en de genade Gods was op Hem. 
[2:41]  En zijn ouders gingen jaarlijks naar Jerusalem, met het paaschfeest.
[2:42] En toen Hij twaalf jaar oud was, gingen zij naar de gewoonte van het feest, op naar Jerusalem.
[2:43] En toen de dagen voleindigd waren keerden zij terug, maar het kind Jezus bleef in Jerusalem, zonder dat Jozef en zijn moeder het wisten.
[2:44] Maar meenende dat Hij was bij het reisgezelschap gingen zij een dagreize ver, om Hem te zoeken onder de familie en de bekenden.
[2:45] En Hem niet vindende keerden zij terug naar Jerusalem om Hem te zoeken.
[2:46] En het geschiedde na drie dagen dat zij Hem vonden in den tempel, zittende in het midden der leeraren, hen hoorende en vragende.
[2:47] Doch allen die Hem hoorden stonden verbaasd over zijn verstand en antwoorden.
[2:48] En Hem ziende stonden zij verslagen, en zijn moeder zeide tot Hem: Kind, waarom hebt Gij zoo met ons gedaan? Zie, uw vader en ik hebben met smart U gezocht!
[2:49] En Hij zeide tot hen: Waarom hebt gij Mij gezocht? Wist gij niet dat Ik moet bezig zijn in de dingen mijns Vaders?
[2:50] En zij verstonden het, woord niet dat Hij tot hen sprak.
[2:51] En Hij ging met hen af en kwam naar Nazaret en was hun onderdanig. En zijn moeder bewaarde al deze dingen in haar hart.
[2:52] En Jezus nam toe in wijsheid en in ouderdom, en in genade bij God en menschen.  
[3:1] In het vijftiende jaar nu der regeering van keizer Tiberius, als Pontius Pilatus stadhouder was over Judea, Herodes viervorst over Galilea, en Filippus zijn broeder viervorst over Iturea en het land van Trachonitis, en Lysanias viervorst over Abilene,
[3:2] ten tijde van het hoogepriesterschap van Annas en Kajafas, geschiedde het woord Gods tot Johannes, den zoon van Zacharias, in de woestijn.
[3:3] En hij kwam in den geheelen omtrek van den Jordaan, predikende den doop der boetvaardigheid tot vergiffenis van zonden,
[3:4] gelijk geschreven is in het boek der woorden van Jesaja den profeet: Een stem van een die roept in de woestijn: Bereidt den weg des Heeren, maakt recht zijn paden;
[3:5] ieder dal zal gevuld worden, en iedere berg en heuvel zal verlaagd worden, en wat krom is zal recht en de oneffene wegen zullen tot gebaande worden,
[3:6] en alle vleesch zal de verlossing Gods zien.
[3:7] Hij zeide dan tot de scharen die uitgingen om van hem gedoopt te worden: Gij adderengebroed, wie heeft u aangewezen te vlieden van den toekomenden toorn?
[3:8] brengt dan vruchten voort, der boetvaardigheid waardig; en begint niet met bij u zelven te zeggen: Wij hebben Abraham tot vader! want ik zeg u dat God uit deze steenen aan Abraham kinderen kan verwekken;
[3:9] en de bijl ligt ook reeds aan den wortel der boomen; iedere boom dus, die geen goede vrucht voortbrengt, wordt omgehouwen en in het vuur geworpen.
[3:10] En de scharen vroegen hem, zeggende: Wat moeten wij dan doen?
[3:11] En hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Die twee rokken heeft deele mede aan die er geen heeft, en die spijze heeft doe evenzoo.
[3:12] Er kwamen ook tollenaars om gedoopt te worden, en zij zeiden tot hem: Meester, wat moeten wij doen?
[3:13] En hij zeide tot hen: Eischt niet meer dan u gesteld is.
[3:14] En ook soldaten vroegen hem, zeggende: En wat moeten wij doen? en hij zeide tot hen: Doet niemand geweld of onrecht aan, en weest tevreden met uw krijgsloon.
[3:15] Daar nu het volk in verwachting was, en allen in hun harten overpeinsden of Johannes misschien niet de Christus zou zijn,
[3:16] antwoordde Johannes, zeggende tot allen: Ik doop u wel met water; maar Hij komt, die machtiger is dan ik, wien ik niet waardig ben zijn schoenriemen los te maken; die zal u doopen met den Heiligen Geest en met vuur.
[3:17] Zijn wan is in zijn hand om zijn dorschvloer geheel te zuiveren en het koren te verzamelen in zijn schuur, maar het kaf zal Hij verbranden met onuitbluschbaar vuur.
[3:18] En nog veel andere vermaningen gevende verkondigde hij den volke het Evangelie. 
[3:19]  Maar Herodes de viervorst, door Johannes bestraft zijnde om Herodias, de huisvrouw zijns broeders, en om al de slechte dingen die Herodes deed,
[3:20] heeft dit nog bij al het andere gevoegd, dat hij Johannes in de gevangenis opsloot. 
[3:21]  Het geschiedde nu toen al het volk gedoopt werd, en ook Jezus gedoopt en biddende was, dat de hemel werd geopend,
[3:22] en dat de Heilige Geest, in lichamelijke gedaante, zooals een duive, op Hem nederdaalde, en dat er een stem uit den hemel kwam: Gij zijt mijn Zoon, de Beminde: in U heb Ik welbehagen! 
[3:23]  En Jezus was, toen Hij optrad, omtrent dertig jaar oud en Hij was, zoo men meende, een zoon van Jozef, den zoon van Eli,
[3:24] den zoon van Matthat, den zoon van Levi, den zoon van Melchi, den zoon van Janna, den zoon van Jozef,
[3:25] den zoon van Mattathias, den zoon van Amos, den zoon van Nahum, den zoon van Esli, den zoon van Naggai,
[3:26] den zoon van Maath, den zoon van Mattathias, den zoon van Semeï, den zoon van Jozef, den zoon van Juda,
[3:27] den zoon van Johannes, den zoon van Resa, den zoon van Zorobabel, den zoon van Salathiël, den zoon van Neri,
[3:28] den zoon van Melchi, den zoon van Addi, den zoon van Kosam, den zoon van Elmadam, den zoon van Er,
[3:29] den zoon van Joses, den zoon van Eliëzer, den zoon van Jorim, den zoon van Matthat, den zoon van Levi,
[3:30] den zoon van Simeon, den zoon van Juda, den zoon van Jozef, den zoon van Jonan, den zoon van Eliakim,
[3:31] den zoon van Meleas, den zoon van Maïnan, den zoon van Mattath, den zoon van Nathan, den zoon van David,
[3:32] den zoon van Jesse, den zoon van Obed, den zoon van Boös, den zoon van Salmon, den zoon van Nahasson,
[3:33] den zoon van Aminadab, den zoon van Aram, den zoon van Esron, den zoon van Phares, den zoon van Juda,
[3:34] den zoon van Jakob, den zoon van Isaäk, den zoon van Abraham, den zoon van Therah, den zoon van Nahor,
[3:35] den zoon van Seruch, den zoon van Ragau, den zoon van Phalek, den zoon van Heber, den zoon van Sala,
[3:36] den zoon van Kaïnan, den zoon van Arfaxad, den zoon van Sem, den zoon van Noach, den zoon van Lamech,
[3:37] den zoon van Methusalem, den zoon van Henoch, den zoon van Jared, den zoon van Melaleël, den zoon van Kaïnan,
[3:38] den zoon van Enos, den zoon van Seth, den zoon van Adam, den zoon van God.  
[4:1] Jezus nu, vol zijnde des Heiligen Geestes, keerde weder van den Jordaan, en werd door den Geest in de woestijn gevoerd veertig dagen lang, bekoord zijnde van den duivel.
[4:2] En Hij at niets in die dagen; en toen zij voorbij waren kreeg Hij honger.
[4:3] En de duivel zeide tot Hem: Als Gij Gods Zoon zijt, zeg dan tot dezen steen dat hij brood worde.
[4:4] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Er staat geschreven dat de mensch niet bij brood alleen zal leven, maar bij alle woord Gods.
[4:5] En de duivel voerde Hem op een hoogen berg en toonde Hem al de koninkrijken der wereld, in een punt des tijds.
[4:6] En de duivel zeide tot Hem: Aan U zal ik al deze macht en glorie geven, want aan mij zijn zij overgegeven, en aan wien ik wil geef ik ze;
[4:7] indien Gij dan voor mij nederknielt zal alles van U zijn.
[4:8] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Er staat geschreven: Den Heere uw God zult gij aanbidden en Hem alleen zult gij dienen.
[4:9] En hij voerde Hem naar Jerusalem en stelde Hem op de spits des tempels en zeide tot Hem: Als Gij Gods Zoon zijt, werp U zelven van hier naar beneden;
[4:10] want er staat geschreven dat Hij zijn engelen aangaande U bevel zal geven om U te behoeden,
[4:11] en dat zij U op de handen zullen dragen opdat Gij uw voet niet zoudt stooten aan een steen.
[4:12] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Er is gezegd: Den Heere uw God zult gij niet tergen.
[4:13] En alle bekoring voleindigd hebbende, week de duivel een tijd lang van Hem. 
[4:14]  En Jezus keerde in de kracht des Geestes weder haar Galilea; en een gerucht van Hem ging uit door den geheelen omtrek.
[4:15] En Hij gaf onderwijs in hun synagogen, geprezen zijnde van allen.
[4:16] En Hij kwam te Nazaret, waar hij was opgevoed, en ging, naar zijn gewoonte, op den dag des sabbats naar de synagoge, en stond op om te lezen,
[4:17] En Hem werd gegeven het boek van den profeet Jesaja, en het boek open gedaan hebbende vond Hij de plaats waar geschreven stond:
[4:18] De Geest des Heeren is op Mij, omdat Hij Mij gezalfd heeft om aan de armen het Evangelie te verkondigen, om te genezen de gebrokenen van harte,
[4:19] Hij heeft Mij gezonden om aan de gevangenen vrijlating te prediken en aan de blinden het gezicht, om de verdrukten heen te zenden in vrijheid, om te prediken het aangename jaar des Heeren.
[4:20] En het boek toegedaan en den dienaar overgegeven hebbende, ging Hij zitten, en de oogen van allen in de synagoge waren op Hem gevestigd.
[4:21] En Hij begon tot hen te zeggen: Heden is deze Schrifture in uw ooren vervuld.
[4:22] En zij gaven Hem allen getuigenis en verwonderden zich over de woorden van genade die uit zijn mond kwamen, en zeiden: Is deze niet de zoon van Jozef?
[4:23] En Hij zeide tot hen: Zeker zult gij Mij dit spreekwoord toevoegen: Geneesmeester, genees u zelven! al wat wij gehoord hebben dat te Kapernaüm is geschied, doe dat ook hier in uw vaderland!
[4:24] Maar, zeide Hij, voorwaar Ik zeg u dat geen profeet aangenaam is in zijn vaderland.
[4:25] Maar naar waarheid zeg Ik u, dat er veel weduwen waren in Israël in de dagen van Elias, toen de hemel gesloten was drie jaar en zes maanden, zoodat er een groote hongersnood was over het geheele land.
[4:26] En tot geen van haar werd Elias gezonden, maar wel naar Sarepta bij Sidon tot een weduwvrouw.
[4:27] En veel melaatschen waren er in Israël ten tijde van Elisa, den profeet; en niemand van hen werd genezen, maar wel Naäman de Syriër.
[4:28] En zij werden allen in de synagoge met toorn vervuld, toen zij dit hoorden,
[4:29] en opstaande wierpen zij Hem uit, buiten de stad, en zij voerden Hem naar den top des bergs, waarop hun stad was gebouwd, om Hem naar beneden te werpen.
[4:30] Maar Hij ging midden door hen heen, en vertrok. 
[4:31]  En Hij ging af naar Kapernaüm, een stad van Galilea, en Hij onderwees hen op de sabbatdagen.
[4:32] En zij stonden verbaasd over zijn onderwijs, want zijn woord was met macht.
[4:33] En in de synagoge was er een man, die door een onzuiveren geest was bezeten en hij schreeuwde met een groote stem:
[4:34] Ha! wat hebben wij met U te doen, Jezus van Nazaret? zijt Gij gekomen om ons te verderven? ik ken U wie Gij zijt! de Heilige Gods!
[4:35] En Jezus bestrafte hem zeggende: Zwijg stil en ga van hem uit! En de booze geest, hem in het midden neder geworpen hebbende, ging van hem uit zonder hem iets te beschadigen.
[4:36] En er kwam een verbaasdheid over allen en zij spraken tot malkander zeggende: Welk een woord is dit, dat Hij met macht en kracht de onzuivere geesten gebiedt en zij gaan uit?
[4:37] En er ging een gerucht van Hem uit naar alle plaats van den omtrek. 
[4:38]  En Hij stond op en ging uit de synagoge naar het huis van Simon. De schoonmoeder nu van Simon was lijdende aan een zware koorts; en zij vroegen Hem voor haar.
[4:39] En over haar heen buigende bestrafte Hij de koorts, en deze verliet haar; en zij stond aanstonds op en bediende hen. 
[4:40]  En toen de zon onderging brachten allen die kranken hadden aan allerlei ziekten, dezen tot Hem; en Hij leide aan een ieder hunner de handen op en genas hen.
[4:41] En er gingen ook booze geesten uit van velen, schreeuwende en zeggende: Gij zijt de Zone Gods! En Hij bestrafte hen en liet hun niet toe te spreken, daar zij wisten dat Hij de Christus was.
[4:42] Als het nu dag was geworden ging Hij uit en vertrok naar een eenzame plaats; en de scharen zochten Hem en kwamen tot bij Hem, en zij hielden Hem tegen, opdat Hij niet van hen zou weggaan.
[4:43] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Ik moet ook aan de andere steden het Evangelie van het koninkrijk Gods verkondigen, want daartoe ben Ik uitgezonden.
[4:44] En Hij predikte in de synagogen van Galilea.  
[5:1] En het geschiedde, als de schare op Jezus aandrong om het woord Gods te hooren, en als Hij bij het meer Gennezaret stond,
[5:2] dat Hij twee schepen aan het meer zag liggen, waarvan de visschers waren uitgegaan om de netten te spoelen.
[5:3] Hij nu ging in een van die schepen, dat van Simon was, en verzocht hem een weinig van wal te steken; en nederzittende in het schip onderwees Hij de scharen.
[5:4] Als Hij nu ophield met spreken zeide Hij tot Simon: Steek af naar de diepte en werp uw netten uit om te vangen!
[5:5] En Simon antwoordde en zeide: Meester, den geheelen nacht door hebben wij gearbeid en niets gevangen; toch zal ik op uw woord het net uitwerpen.
[5:6] En dit gedaan hebbende vingen zij een zoo groote menigte visschen, dat hun net scheurde.
[5:7] En zij wenkten hun makkers in het andere schip om hen te komen helpen. En zij kwamen en vulden die beide schepen tot zinkens toe.
[5:8] Simon Petrus nu dit ziende, viel neder aan de knieën van Jezus, zeggende: Ga van mij weg, want ik ben een zondig man, Heere!
[5:9] Want verbaasdheid had hem bevangen, en allen die met hem waren, wegens de vangst der visschen die zij gedaan hadden;
[5:10] en zoo ook Jakobus en Johannes, de zonen van Zebedeüs, die Simons medgezellen waren. En Jezus zeide tot Simon: Vrees niet; van nu af zult gij menschen vangen.
[5:11] En de schepen naar den wal gestuurd hebbende verlieten zij alles en volgden Hem. 
[5:12]  En het geschiedde, toen Hij in een der steden was, zie, daar was een man vol melaatschheid; en Jezus ziende, viel hij op zijn aangezicht en smeekte Hem zeggende: Heere, als Gij wilt, kunt Gij mij zuiveren!
[5:13] En de hand uitstekende raakte Hij hem aan, zeggende: Ik wil, word gezuiverd! En terstond ging de melaatschheid van hem.
[5:14] En Hij gebood hem het aan niemand te zeggen, maar ga heen, vertoon u zelven aan den priester en offer voor uw zuivering, gelijk Mozes heeft geboden, hun tot een getuigenis.
[5:15] Maar het gerucht van Hem werd al meer verbreid, en veel scharen kwamen om te hooren en van hun ziekten genezen te worden.
[5:16] Maar Hij trok zich terug in de woestijnen en was biddende. 
[5:17]  En het geschiedde op een dag dat Hij bezig was te onderwijzen en dat er fariseërs zaten en wetgeleerden, die waren gekomen uit alle vlekken van Galilea, en Judea, en Jerusalem; en de kracht des Heeren was er om hen te genezen.
[5:18] En zie, eenige mannen brachten op een bed een mensch die verlamd was en zij zochten hem binnen te brengen en vóór Hem te leggen.
[5:19] En als zij ter oorzake van de schare niet vonden hoe ze hem zouden binnenbrengen, klommen zij op het dak en lieten hem met het bed door de tichelen neder in het midden vóór Jezus.
[5:20] En hun geloof ziende zeide Hij: Mensch, uw zonden zijn u vergeven!
[5:21] De schriftgeleerden nu en de fariseërs begonnen te overleggen, zeggende: Wie is deze die lastering spreekt? wie kan zonden vergeven dan God alleen?
[5:22] Maar Jezus hun overleggingen wetende, antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wat overlegt gij in uw harten?
[5:23] Wat is gemakkelijker? te zeggen: Uw zonden zijn u vergeven, of te zeggen: Sta op en wandel?
[5:24] Maar opdat gij weten moogt dat de Zoon des menschen macht heeft, om op aarde zonden te vergeven, — toen zeide Hij tot den lamme: Ik zeg u, sta op, en neem uw bed op, en ga heen naar uw huis.
[5:25] En terstond, voor hun oogen opstaande, nam hij op hetgeen waarop hij gelegen had en hij ging naar zijn huis, God de glorie gevende.
[5:26] En een verbazing greep hen allen aan, en zij gaven God de glorie, en werden vervuld met vreeze, zeggende: Wij hebben heden onbegrijpelijke dingen gezien! 
[5:27]  En daarna ging Hij uit en zag een tollenaar, met name Levi, aan het tolhuis zitten, en zeide tot hem: Volg Mij na!
[5:28] En alles verlatende, stond deze op en volgde Hem.
[5:29] En Levi bereidde voor Hem een grooten maaltijd in zijn huis, en er was een groote menigte van tollenaren en anderen die met hen aanlagen.
[5:30] En hun fariseërs en schriftgeleerden murmureerden tegen zijn discipelen, zeggende: Waarom eet en drinkt gij met de tollenaars en zondaars?
[5:31] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Niet de gezonden hebben een geneesmeester van noode, maar de zieken; 
[5:32] Ik ben niet gekomen om rechtvaardigen te roepen tot boetvaardigheid, maar zondaars. 
[5:33]  Zij nu zeiden tot Hem: De discipelen van Johannes vasten dikwijls en doen gebeden, evenals die van de fariseërs, maar de uwen eten en drinken?
[5:34] Maar Jezus zeide tot hen: Gij kunt toch de bruiloftsgasten niet doen vasten, terwijl de bruidegom bij hen is?
[5:35] Maar er zullen dagen komen, als de bruidegom van hen is weggenomen; dan zullen zij vasten in die dagen.
[5:36] Hij sprak tot hen ook een gelijkenis: Niemand scheurt een stuk van een nieuw kleed af en zet dat op een oud kleed, anders zou ook het nieuwe scheuren; en bij het oude zou het stuk van het nieuwe niet voegen; 
[5:37] en niemand giet jongen wijn in oude zakken, anders zou de jonge wijn de zakken doen barsten, en hij zou wegvloeien en de zakken zouden verloren zijn; 
[5:38] maar jongen wijn moet men in nieuwe zakken gieten, en dan worden beide te zamen bewaard; 
[5:39] en niemand die ouden gedronken heeft begeert jongen, want hij zegt: De oude is beter.  
[6:1] En het geschiedde eens op een sabbat dat Jezus ging door een korenveld en zijn discipelen plukten de aren en aten die, ze wrijvende met de handen.
[6:2] En sommigen van de fariseërs zeiden tot hen: Waarom doet gij wat men niet mag doen op den sabbat?
[6:3] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Hebt gij dan niet gelezen wat David deed toen hij en degenen die met hem waren honger hadden?
[6:4] hoe hij is ingegaan in het huis Gods en de toonbrooden heeft genomen en gegeten, en ook gegeven aan hen die met hem waren, ofschoon het niet geoorloofd is die te eten dan alleen aan de priesters?
[6:5] En Hij zeide tot hen: De Zoon des menschen is Heer ook van den sabbat. 
[6:6]  En op een anderen sabbat geschiedde het dat Hij in de synagoge ging en onderwees; en daar was een mensch wiens rechterhand stijf was.
[6:7] De schriftgeleerden nu en de fariseërs letten op Hem of Hij op den sabbat zou genezen, opdat zij een beschuldiging tegen Hem mochten vinden.
[6:8] Maar Hij kende hun overleggingen en zeide tot den man die de stijve hand had: Rijs op, en sta in het midden! En hij rees op en stond recht.
[6:9] En Jezus zeide tot hen: Ik vraag u: is het op den sabbat geoorloofd goed te doen of kwaad te doen, een ziel te behouden of te verderven?
[6:10] En hen allen rondom aangezien hebbende, zeide Hij tot den man: Steek uw hand uit! Hij nu deed het en zijn hand werd zoo gezond als de andere.
[6:11] En zij werden vol van uitzinnigheid en bespraken met elkander wat zij Jezus toch zouden doen. 
[6:12]  En het geschiedde in een van die dagen dat Hij naar een berg ging om te bidden, en Hij bracht den nacht door in het gebed tot God.
[6:13] En toen het dag werd riep Hij zijn discipelen tot zich en koos uit hen twaalf, die Hij ook apostelen noemde:
[6:14] Simon, dien Hij ook Petrus noemde, en Andreas zijn broeder; en Jakobus, en Johannes, en Filippus, en Bartholomeüs,
[6:15] en Mattheüs, en Thomas, en Jakobus den zoon van Alfeüs, en Simon genaamd de ijveraar,
[6:16] en Judas, den broeder van Jakobus, en Judas Iskariot, die de verrader is geworden. 
[6:17]  En met hen afgekomen zijnde, stond Hij op een vlakke plaats, alsmede een groote schare zijner discipelen, en een groote menigte volks van geheel Judea, en Jerusalem, en van den zeekant van Tyrus en Sidon, die gekomen waren om Hem te hooren en genezen te worden van hun ziekten.
[6:18] En zij die gekweld werden van onzuivere geesten werden genezen.
[6:19] En de geheele schare zocht Hem aan te raken, want er ging kracht van Hem uit en Hij genas hen allen. 
[6:20]  En Hij sloeg zijn oogen op naar zijn discipelen en zeide: Zalig, gij armen, want uwer is het koninkrijk Gods.
[6:21] Zalig, gij die nu honger hebt, want gij zult verzadigd worden. Zalig, gij die nu weent, want gij zult lachen.
[6:22] Zalig zijt gij als de menschen u zullen haten, en als zij u zullen afsnijden, en smaden, en uw naam als kwaad verwerpen, ter wille van den Zoon des menschen.
[6:23] Verblijdt u in dien dag, en verheugt u, want ziet, uw loon is groot in den hemel; want op dezelfde wijze deden hun vaderen aan de profeten.
[6:24] Daarentegen, wee u, gij rijken, want gij hebt uw troost weg!
[6:25] Wee u, die nu verzadigd zijt, want gij zult honger hebben. Wee u, die nu lacht, want gij zult treuren en weenen.
[6:26] Wee u, als alle menschen goed van u spreken, want op dezelfde wijze deden hun vaderen aan de valsche profeten.
[6:27] Maar tot u die hoort zeg Ik: Bemint uw vijanden, doet wel aan degenen die u haten,
[6:28] zegent ze die u vervloeken, bidt voor hen die u smadelijk bejegenen.
[6:29] Wie u op de wang slaat, biedt hem ook de andere, en wie uw mantel neemt, weigert hem ook den rok niet.
[6:30] Geeft aan allen die u iets vragen en eischt niet weder van hem die het uwe genomen heeft.
[6:31] En gelijk gij wilt dat de menschen u doen, doet gij hun ook alzoo.
[6:32] En als gij bemint die u beminnen, wat dank hebt gij dan? want ook de zondaars beminnen degenen die hen beminnen.
[6:33] Want indien gij ook weldoet aan degenen die u weldoen, wat dank hebt gij dan? ook de zondaars doen hetzelfde.
[6:34] En indien gij leent aan degenen van wie gij hoopt weder te ontvangen, wat dank hebt gij dan? ook zondaars leenen aan zondaars om hetzelfde terug te ontvangen.
[6:35] Bemint gij daarentegen uw vijanden en doet gij wel en leent zonder iets weder te hopen; dan zal uw loon groot zijn en gij zult kinderen zijn des Allerhoogsten, want deze is goedertieren over ondankbaren en boozen.
[6:36] Zijt dan barmhartig gelijk ook uw Vader barmhartig is.
[6:37] En oordeelt niet, en gij zult niet geoordeeld worden; en veroordeelt niet, en gij zult niet veroordeeld worden; spreekt vrij, en gij zult vrijgesproken worden.
[6:38] Geeft, en u zal gegeven worden; een goede, vastgedrukte, geschudde, overloopende maat zal men in uw schoot geven; want met de maat waarmede gij meet zal u weder gemeten worden.
[6:39] En Hij sprak ook een gelijkenis tot hen: Kan wel een blinde een anderen blinde leiden? Zullen zij niet beiden in een kuil vallen?
[6:40] Een leerling is niet boven zijn leermeester; maar ieder zal volleerd zijn als hij is gelijk zijn leermeester.
[6:41] Wat ziet gij toch den splinter die in het oog uws broeders is, maar den balk in uw eigen oog bemerkt gij niet?
[6:42] Hoe kunt gij zeggen tot uw broeder: Broeder, laat mij den splinter uit uw oog trekken, terwijl gij den balk in uw eigen oog niet ziet? Geveinsde! werp eerst den balk uit uw eigen oog, en dan moogt gij zien den splinter weg te doen uit uws broeders oog.
[6:43] Want het is geen goede boom die slechte vrucht voortbrengt, en wederom is het geen slechte boom die goede vrucht voortbrengt.
[6:44] Want iedere boom wordt gekend aan zijn eigen vrucht; van doornen plukt men toch geen vijgen, en van een braamstruik plukt men geen druiven!
[6:45] De goede mensch brengt uit den goeden schat des harten het goede voort, en de kwade mensch brengt uit den kwaden schat des harten het kwade voort, want uit den overvloed des harten spreekt zijn mond.
[6:46] Wat noemt gij Mij: Heere, Heere! en gij doet niet wat Ik zeg?
[6:47] Ieder die tot Mij komt en mijn woorden hoort en ze doet, Ik zal u toonen aan wien hij gelijk is.
[6:48] Hij is gelijk aan een mensch die een huis bouwde, die groef, en uitdiepte en het fundament leide op de rots; toen er nu een overstrooming kwam sloeg de stortvloed tegen dat huis aan en kon het niet bewegen, omdat het was gebouwd op een rots.
[6:49] Maar die mijn woorden hoort en ze niet doet, is gelijk aan een mensch die een huis bouwde op den grond, zonder fundament, waar de stortvloed tegenaan sloeg; en het viel terstond en de breuke van dat huis was groot.  
[7:1] Nadat Jezus nu al zijn woorden ten aanhoore van het volk geëindigd had, kwam Hij naar Kapernaüm.
[7:2] En de dienstknecht van zekeren hoofdman, die hem veel waard was, was krank en lag op sterven.
[7:3] En als hij van Jezus gehoord had zond hij oudsten der Joden tot Hem, om Hem te vragen dat Hij mocht komen en zijn knecht genezen.
[7:4] Deze nu hij Jezus komende verzochten Hem dringend, zeggende: Hij is waardig dat Gij hem dit doet,
[7:5] want hij bemint ons volk en hij heeft ons zelfs een synagoge gebouwd.
[7:6] Jezus dan ging met hen. Toen Hij nu niet ver meer van het huis af was zond de hoofdman vrienden tot Hem, zeggende: Heere, doe geen moeite, want ik ben niet waardig dat Gij onder mijn dak zoudt inkomen;
[7:7] daarom achtte ik ook mij zelven niet waardig om tot U te komen, maar zeg het maar met een woord, en mijn knecht zal genezen zijn.
[7:8] Want ook ik ben een mensch aan anderen ondergeschikt, en heb onder mij soldaten; en ik zeg tot dezen: Ga weg, en dan gaat hij; en tot een anderen: Kom hier, en dan komt hij; en tot mijn dienstknecht: Doe dit, en dan doet hij het.
[7:9] Als Jezus dit hoorde verwonderde Hij zich, en zich omkeerende tot de schare die Hem volgde, zeide Hij: Ik zeg u, zelfs in Israël heb Ik zoo groot een geloof niet gevonden.
[7:10] En toen de afgezondenen naar huis teruggekeerd waren vonden zij den dienstknecht gezond die krank was geweest. 
[7:11]  En op den volgenden dag geschiedde het dat Hij ging naar een stad genaamd Naïn, en met Hem gingen zijn discipelen en een groote schare.
[7:12] En als Hij dicht bij de poort der stad kwam, ziet, daar werd een doode uitgedragen, een eenige zoon zijner moeder, en zij was weduwe; en veel volks uit de stad was met haar.
[7:13] En toen de Heere haar zag werd Hij over haar bewogen en zeide tot haar: Ween niet!
[7:14] En toetredende raakte Hij de draagbaar aan; de dragers dan stonden stil, en Hij zeide: Jongeling, Ik zeg u, sta op!
[7:15] En de doode zat overeind en begon te spreken; en Hij gaf hem aan zijn moeder.
[7:16] En vreeze kwam over allen en zij prezen God, zeggende: Een groot profeet is onder ons opgestaan en God heeft zijn volk bezocht!
[7:17] En dit gerucht ging in geheel Judea van Hem uit en in het geheele omliggende land. 
[7:18]  En de discipelen van Johannes den Dooper boodschapten aan dezen al deze dingen.
[7:19] En twee zijner discipelen geroepen hebbende, zond Johannes hen tot Jezus om te zeggen: Zijt Gij degene die komen zou, of moeten wij een ander verwachten?
[7:20] Die mannen dan tot Hem komende, zeiden: Johannes de Dooper heeft ons tot U gezonden om te zeggen: Zijt Gij degene die komen zou, of moeten wij een ander verwachten?
[7:21] In die zelfde ure nu genas Jezus er velen van ziekten, en kwalen, en booze geesten, en aan vele blinden, gaf Hij het gezicht.
[7:22] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Gaat heen, boodschapt aan Johannes, wat gij gezien en gehoord hebt: Dat blinden ziende worden, kreupelen wandelen, melaatschen gezuiverd worden, dooven hooren, dooden opgewekt worden, aan armen het Evangelie verkondigd wordt; 
[7:23] en zalig is hij die zich aan Mij niet zal ergeren.
[7:24] Toen nu de boden van Johannes heengegaan waren, begon Hij tot de scharen aangaande Johannes te zeggen: Wat zijt gij in de woestijn gaan zien? Een riet dat door den wind heen en weer geschud wordt?
[7:25] Maar wat zijt gij gaan zien? Een mensch met schoone kleederen bekleed? Ziet, die in schoone kleederen en weelde leven, zijn in de paleizen.
[7:26] Maar wat zijt gij gaan zien? een profeet? — Ja, zeg Ik u, ook veel meer dan een profeet.
[7:27] Deze is het van wien is geschreven: Ziet, Ik zend mijn engel voor uw aangezicht die uw weg voor U uit bereiden zal.
[7:28] Ik zeg ulieden, onder die van vrouwen geboren zijn, is er geen profeet grooter dan Johannes de Dooper; maar de minste in het koninkrijk Gods is meer dan hij.
[7:29] En al het volk dat Hem hoorde, en de tollenaars rechtvaardigden God, daar zij gedoopt waren met den doop van Johannes.
[7:30] Maar de fariseërs en de wetgeleerden versmaadden den raad Gods over hen, daar zij niet door hem gedoopt waren.
[7:31] En de Heere zeide: Waarbij zal Ik toch de menschen van dit geslacht vergelijken, en waaraan zijn zij gelijk?
[7:32] Zij zijn gelijk aan de kinderkens die op de markt zitten en malkander toeroepen, zeggende: Op de fluit speelden wij voor u en gedanst hebt gij niet; klaagliederen hebben wij gezongen en gij hebt niet geweend!
[7:33] Want Johannes de Dooper is gekomen noch brood etende noch wijn drinkende, en gij zegt: Hij heeft den duivel!
[7:34] De Zoon des menschen is gekomen, etende en drinkende, en gij zegt: Ziet, een gulzigaard en dronkaard, een vriend van tollenaars en zondaars!
[7:35] En de wijsheid is gerechtvaardigd door al haar kinderen. 
[7:36]  En een der fariseërs noodigde Hem bij zich ten eten; en in het huis van den fariseër gegaan zijnde lag Hij aan.
[7:37] En ziet, er was een vrouw in de stad die een zondares was, en vernomen hebbende dat Hij aanlag in des fariseërs huis, nam zij een albasten flesch met balsem,
[7:38] en weenende achter bij zijn voeten staande, begon zij zijn voeten met tranen nat te maken en met haar hoofdhaar droogde zij ze af, en zij kuste zijn voeten en zalfde ze met den balsem.
[7:39] De fariseër nu, die Hem genoodigd had, dit ziende, sprak bij zich zelven, zeggende: Deze, zoo Hij een profeet was, zou wel weten wie en hoedanig deze vrouw is die Hem aanraakt, dat zij een zondares is!
[7:40] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Simon, Ik heb u wat te zeggen! Hij nu zeide: Meester, spreek!
[7:41] Een zekere bankier had twee schuldenaars; de een was hem vijfhonderd penningen schuldig en de ander vijftig.
[7:42] Alzoo zij nu niet hadden om te betalen schold hij het aan beiden kwijt. Wie van hen zal hem nu ‘t meest beminnen?
[7:43] Simon antwoordde en zeide: Ik denk, degene aan wien het meest kwijtgescholden is. En Jezus zeide tot hem: Gij hebt recht geoordeeld!
[7:44] En zich naar de vrouw keerende, zeide Hij tot Simon: Ziet gij deze vrouw? Ik ben in uw huis gekomen; water voor mijn voeten hebt gij Mij niet gegeven, maar zij heeft met tranen mijn voeten nat gemaakt en ze met haar hoofdhaar afgedroogd.
[7:45] Een kus hebt gij Mij niet gegeven, maar zij heeft van dat Ik binnenkwam niet opgehouden Mij de voeten te kussen.
[7:46] Met olie hebt gij mijn hoofd niet gezalfd, maar zij; heeft Mij de voeten met balsem gezalfd.
[7:47] Daarom zeg Ik u: Haar vele zonden zijn vergeven, omdat zij veel heeft bemind; maar wien weinig, vergeven wordt, die bemint weinig.
[7:48] En Hij zeide tot haar: Uw zonden zijn vergeven!
[7:49] En de medeaanliggenden begonnen bij zich zelven te zeggen: Wie is deze, die ook zonden vergeeft?
[7:50] En Hij zeide tot de vrouw: Uw geloof heeft u behouden; ga heen in vrede!  
[8:1] En naderhand geschiedde het dat Jezus rondtrok door steden en dorpen, predikende en verkondigende het Evangelie van het koninkrijk Gods; en de twaalven met Hem,
[8:2] alsmede eenige vrouwen die genezen waren van booze geesten en krankheden: Maria, genaamd Magdalena, uit wie zeven booze geesten waren uitgegaan,
[8:3] en Johanna, de vrouw van Chusas, den rentmeester van Herodes, en Suzanna en veel anderen, die Hem dienden van haar goederen. 
[8:4]  Toen nu een groote schare bijeengekomen was, ook van hen die van stad tot stad zich bij Hem voegden, zeide Hij door gelijkenis:
[8:5] De zaaier ging uit om zijn zaad te zaaien, en als hij zaaide viel er een deel bij den weg en het werd vertreden, en de vogelen des hemels pikten het op.
[8:6] En een ander deel viel op den rotsgrond en opgekomen zijnde verdorde het, omdat het geen vochtigheid had.
[8:7] En een ander deel viel in het midden der doornen, en de doornen mede opgroeiende verstikten het.
[8:8] En een ander deel viel op den goeden grond en opgewassen zijnde gaf het honderdvoudige vrucht. Dit zeggende, riep Hij: Wie ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore.
[8:9] Zijn discipelen nu vroegen Hem wat deze gelijkenis mocht beteekenen.
[8:10] En Hij zeide: U is het gegeven de verborgenheden van het koninkrijk Gods te verstaan, maar aan de anderen komt het in gelijkenissen, opdat zij ziende niet zien, en hoorende niet verstaan.
[8:11] Dit nu beteekent de gelijkenis: Het zaad is het woord Gods.
[8:12] De bij den weg gezaaiden zijn zij die hooren; daarna komt de duivel en hij neemt het woord uit hun harten weg, opdat zij niet zouden gelooven en behouden worden.
[8:13] De op den rotsgrond gezaaiden zijn zij die, als zij het hooren, met blijdschap het woord ontvangen, en dezen hebben geen wortel, want zij gelooven voor een tijd en in tijd van bekoring wijken zij af.
[8:14] En hetgeen in de doornen viel zijn zij die gehoord hebben, en naderhand door de zorgen en rijkdom en genietingen des levens verstikt worden en niets voldragen.
[8:15] En hetgeen in den goeden grond viel zijn zij die, als zij gehoord hebben, het woord in een oprecht en goed hart bewaren en in volharding vruchten dragen.
[8:16] Niemand, als hij een lamp heeft aangestoken, bedekt die met een vat of zet ze onder een bed; maar op een kandelaar zet hij ze, opdat de binnenkomenden het licht zouden zien.
[8:17] Want er is niets verborgen dat niet openbaar zal worden, noch geheim dat niet bekend zal worden en aan het licht komen.
[8:18] Ziet dan toe, hoe gij hoort! want zoo wie heeft, hem zal gegeven worden, en zoo wie niet heeft, ook wat hij meent te hebben zal van hem weggenomen worden. 
[8:19]  Zijn moeder nu en zijn broeders kwamen tot Hem en zij konden Hem niet genaken wegens de schare.
[8:20] En Hem werd geboodschapt: Uw moeder en uw broeders staan buiten en willen U zien.
[8:21] Maar Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Mijn moeder en mijn broeders zijn zij die het woord Gods hooren en doen. 
[8:22]  En het gebeurde op zekeren dag dat Hij en zijn discipelen in een schip gingen, en Hij zeide tot hen: Laat ons varen naar den anderen kant van het meer; en zij staken af.
[8:23] En terwijl zij voeren viel Hij in slaap; en er kwam een stormvlaag op het meer, zoodat zij vol waters en in gevaar raakten.
[8:24] Zij kwamen dan tot Hem en maakten Hem wakker, zeggende: Meester, Meester! wij vergaan! Maar wakker geworden bestrafte Hij den wind en de golven; en zij bedaarden en er kwam een stilte.
[8:25] Hij zeide dan tot hen: Waar is uw geloof? Maar zij vreesden en waren verwonderd, zeggende tot malkander: Wie is toch deze, dat Hij zelfs de winden en het water gebiedt, en zij gehoorzamen Hem? 
[8:26]  En zij voeren naar het land der Gerasenen, dat tegenover Galilea ligt.
[8:27] En als Hij aan wal gegaan was kwam Hem een zeker man te gemoet uit de stad, die van over langen tijd door booze geesten bezeten was, en die geen kleederen aanhad, noch in een huis woonde, maar in de graven.
[8:28] En Jezus ziende viel hij schreeuwende voor Hem neder en zeide met een groote stem: Wat heb ik met U te doen, Jezus, Zoon van God, den Allerhoogste? ik bid U, pijnig mij niet!
[8:29] Want Hij had den onreinen geest geboden uit den mensch te gaan. Want van over langen tijd had hij hem meegesleept; en hij werd gebonden met ketenen en voetboeien om bewaard te worden; en de banden verbrekende werd hij door den boozen geest naar de woestijnen gedreven.
[8:30] Jezus nu vroeg hem, zeggende: Wat is uw naam? En hij zeide: Legioen; want veel booze geesten waren in hem gevaren.
[8:31] En zij smeekten Hem dat Hij hun niet zou bevelen naar den afgrond te gaan.
[8:32] Er was daar omtrent een kudde van veel varkens weidende op den berg. En zij baden Hem dat Hij hun wilde toelaten om in deze te varen; en Hij liet het hun toe.
[8:33] En de booze geesten, van den mensch uitgaande, voeren in de varkens, en de kudde stortte van de steilte af in het meer en versmoorde.
[8:34] En die ze geweid hadden, ziende wat er geschied was, vluchtten en boodschapten het in de stad en op de dorpen.
[8:35] Zij gingen dan naar buiten om te zien wat er geschied was en kwamen bij Jezus en vonden den mensch van wien de booze geesten uitgegaan waren, daar zittende, gekleed en goed bij zijn verstand, aan de voeten van Jezus; en zij werden bevreesd.
[8:36] En zij die het gezien hadden boodschapten hun hoe de bezetene genezen was.
[8:37] En de geheele menigte uit den omtrek der Gerasenen verzocht Hem van hen weg te gaan, want zij waren zeer bevreesd. En Hij in het schip gegaan zijnde keerde terug.
[8:38] De man nu, van wien de booze geesten uitgegaan waren, smeekte Hem om met Hem te mogen gaan; maar Jezus liet hem heengaan, zeggende:
[8:39] Keer terug naar uw huis, en vertel wat groote dingen God u gedaan heeft. En hij ging heen en verkondigde door de geheele stad wat groote dingen Jezus hem gedaan had. 
[8:40]  En toen Jezus terugkeerde ontving de schare Hem, want allen verwachtten Hem.
[8:41] En ziet, er kwam een man tot Hem, met name Jaïrus, die een overste der synagoge was; en hij viel voor de voeten van Jezus en smeekte Hem naar zijn huis te komen,
[8:42] omdat hij een eenige dochter had van omtrent twaalf jaar oud, die op sterven lag. 
[8:43]  Toen Hij nu heenging verdrongen de scharen Hem; en een vrouw die twaalf jaar lang het bloedvloeien gehad had, die haar gansche bezitting had ten koste gelegd aan geneesmeesters, en door niemand had kunnen genezen worden,
[8:44] kwam van achteren tot Hem en raakte den boord van zijn kleed aan; en terstond hield haar bloedvloeiing op.
[8:45] En Jezus zeide: Wie heeft Mij aangeraakt? Maar terwijl allen het ontkenden zeide Petrus en die met hem waren: Meester, de scharen verdringen en drukken U, en Gij zegt: Wie heeft Mij aangeraakt?
[8:46] Maar Jezus zeide: Iemand heeft Mij aangeraakt, want Ik heb bemerkt dat er kracht van Mij is uitgegaan.
[8:47] Toen de vrouw nu zag dat zij niet onbekend kon blijven, kwam zij bevende en viel voor Hem neder, en verklaarde voor al het volk om welke reden zij Hem had aangeraakt en hoe zij terstond was genezen.
[8:48] En Hij zeide tot haar: Dochter, uw geloof heeft u behouden! ga heen in vrede! 
[8:49]  Terwijl Hij nog sprak kwam er iemand van den overste der synagoge om te zeggen: Uw dochter is gestorven, doe den Meester geen moeite aan!
[8:50] Maar Jezus hoorde dit en antwoordde hem: Vrees niet, geloof maar, en zij zal behouden worden!
[8:51] En komende in het huis liet Hij aan niemand toe mede binnen te gaan dan aan Petrus, Jakobus en Johannes, en den vader en de moeder van het kind.
[8:52] Zij nu weenden allen en betreurden haar, maar Hij zeide: Weent niet, zij is niet gestorven maar slaapt!
[8:53] En zij lachten Hem uit, wetende dat zij gestorven was.
[8:54] Maar Hij greep haar hand en riep, zeggende: Kind, sta op!
[8:55] En haar geest keerde terug en zij rees terstond op, en Hij gebood dat men haar te eten zou geven.
[8:56] En haar ouders verwonderden zich; maar Hij gebood hun aan niemand te zeggen wat er geschied was.  
[9:1] En Jezus riep zijn twaalf discipelen samen en gaf hun macht en kracht over al de booze geesten en om ziekten te genezen;
[9:2] en zond hen heen om te prediken het koninkrijk Gods en om kranken te genezen.
[9:3] En Hij zeide tot hen: Neemt niets mede op den weg, geen staf, geen reiszak, geen brood, geen geld en ook zal geen uwer twee rokken hebben; 
[9:4] en in welk huis gij zult ingaan, blijft daar totdat gij vandaar weggaat.
[9:5] En zoovelen u niet zullen ontvangen, schudt dan bij het weggaan uit die stad ook het stof van uw voeten af, tot een getuigenis tegen hen.
[9:6] En zij gingen heen en trokken door de dorpen, overal het Evangelie verkondigende en genezende. 
[9:7]  Herodes nu, de viervorst, hoorde al wat er geschied was en was in verlegenheid, omdat door sommigen gezegd werd dat Johannes was verrezen uit de dooden,
[9:8] en door sommigen dat Elias verschenen was, en door anderen dat een der oude profeten was verrezen.
[9:9] Herodes dan zeide: Johannes heb ik onthoofd! wie is dan deze van wien ik zulke dingen hoor? — En hij zocht Hem te zien. 
[9:10]  En toen de apostelen teruggekeerd waren, vertelden zij Hem al wat zij gedaan hadden. En Hij nam hen mede en vertrok naar de eenzaamheid, naar een stad genaamd Bethsaïda.
[9:11] Toen de scharen dit bemerkten volgden zij Hem, en Hij ontving hen en sprak tot hen over het koninkrijk Gods en die genezing van noode hadden maakte Hij gezond.
[9:12] En de dag begon te dalen. De twaalven nu kwamen tot Hem en zeiden: Laat de schare vertrekken, opdat zij in de omliggende dorpen en vlekken gaan overnachten en voedsel vinden, want hier zijn wij in een eenzame plaats.
[9:13] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Geeft gij hun te eten! Zij nu zeiden: Wij hebben niet meer dan vijf brooden en twee visschen, tenzij wij heengaan en spijze koopen voor al dit volk!
[9:14] Er waren nu omtrent vijf duizend mannen. Maar Hij zeide tot zijn discipelen: Doet hen nederzitten bij troepen, elk van vijftig.
[9:15] En zij deden alzoo en lieten allen nederzitten.
[9:16] En Hij nam de vijf brooden en de twee visschen en zag op naar den hemel en zegende die en brak ze, en gaf ze aan de discipelen om ze aan de schare voor te zetten.
[9:17] En zij zaten allen en werden verzadigd, en hetgeen hun aan brokken overschoot, werd opgenomen, twaalf korven. 
[9:18]  En het geschiedde toen Hij in de eenzaamheid biddende was, dat de discipelen bij Hem waren; en Hij vroeg hun, zeggende: Wie zeggen de scharen dat Ik ben?
[9:19] Zij antwoordden en zeiden: Johannes de Dooper; en anderen Elias; en anderen dat er een profeet van de oude tijden is verrezen.
[9:20] En Hij zeide tot hen: Maar gij, wie zegt gij dat Ik ben? En Petrus antwoordde en zeide: De Gezalfde Gods!
[9:21] En Hij beval hun streng dit aan niemand te zeggen,
[9:22] en zeide: De Zoon des menschen moet veel lijden en verworpen worden van de oudsten, en overpriesters, en schriftgeleerden, en gedood worden, en ten derden dage opgewekt worden.
[9:23] En Hij zeide tot allen: Zoo iemand achter Mij wil komen, die verloochene zich zelven, en neme zijn kruis dagelijks op, en volge Mij!
[9:24] Want zoo wie zijn leven zal willen behouden die zal het verliezen; maar zoo wie zijn leven zal verliezen om Mijnentwille, die zal het behouden.
[9:25] Want welk profijt heeft de mensch, als hij de geheele wereld wint, maar zich zelven verderft of te gronde richt?
[9:26] Want zoo wie zich over Mij en mijn woorden zal schamen, over dien zal ook de Zoon des menschen zich schamen, als Hij komt in zijn glorie en in die zijns Vaders en der heilige engelen.
[9:27] Maar Ik zeg u: Waarlijk, sommigen dergenen die hier staan zullen den dood in ‘t geheel niet smaken, totdat zij het koninkrijk Gods zullen gezien hebben! 
[9:28]  Omtrent acht dagen nu na deze woorden geschiedde het dat Hij Petrus en Johannes en Jakobus met zich nam en op den berg klom om te bidden.
[9:29] En terwijl Hij bad werd de gedaante van zijn aangezicht veranderd en zijn kleederen werden glinsterend wit.
[9:30] En ziet, twee mannen spraken met Hem; het waren Mozes en Elias.
[9:31] Deze, in glorie verschenen, zeiden Hem welk een uitgang Hij zou volbrengen in Jerusalem.
[9:32] Petrus nu en die met hem waren, waren zeer slaperig; maar wakker blijvende zagen zij zijn glorie en de twee mannen die bij Hem stonden.
[9:33] En toen deze van Hem zouden scheiden zeide Petrus tot Jezus: Meester, het is goed dat wij hier zijn, en laat ons drie tenten maken, een voor U, en een voor Mozes, en een voor Elias, niet wetende wat hij zeide.
[9:34] En terwijl hij dit zeide kwam er een wolk die hen overschaduwde; en toen zij de wolk ingingen werden zij bevreesd.
[9:35] En er kwam een stem uit de wolk die zeide: Deze is mijn Zoon, de Beminde, hoort Hem!
[9:36] En toen de stem geschied was werd Jezus alleen gevonden; en zij zwegen en vertelden in die dagen aan niemand iets van hetgeen zij gezien hadden. 
[9:37]  En het geschiedde den volgenden dag. toen zij van den berg afgekomen waren, dat een groote schare Hem te gemoet kwam.
[9:38] En ziet, een man uit het volk riep uit en zeide: Meester, ik smeek U, zie toch op mijn zoon, want hij is mijn eenige!
[9:39] En ziet, een geest neemt hem en dan schreeuwt hij in eens het uit; en hij smijt hem heen en weer totdat hij schuimbekt; en nauwelijks wijkt hij van hem terwijl hij hem beukt;
[9:40] En uw discipelen heb ik gesmeekt om hem uit te werpen, maar zij konden niet.
[9:41] Toen antwoordde Jezus en zeide: O, ongeloovig en verkeerd geslacht! tot hoelang zal Ik bij u zijn en u verdragen? breng uw zoon hier!
[9:42] En nog terwijl hij aankwam scheurde hem de booze geest en smeet hem heen en weer; maar Jezus bestrafte den onzuiveren geest, en genas den jongen en gaf hem aan zijn vader.
[9:43] En allen stonden versteld over de grootheid Gods. Toen nu allen zich verwonderden over alles wat Hij deed, zeide Jezus tot zijn discipelen:
[9:44] Legt gij deze woorden in uw ooren, want de Zoon des menschen zal worden overgeleverd in de handen der menschen.
[9:45] Maar zij verstonden dit woord niet en het was voor hen verborgen, zoodat zij het niet begrepen; en zij durfden Hem niet over dit woord vragen. 
[9:46]  Er ontstond nu een redeneering onder hen, wie van hen toch wel de grootste mocht zijn.
[9:47] Maar Jezus kende de redeneering van hun hart en nam een kind en stelde dat bij zich,
[9:48] en zeide tot hen: Zoo wie dit kind aanneemt in mijn Naam, die neemt Mij aan, en zoo wie Mij zal aannemen, neemt Hem aan die Mij heeft gezonden; want wie de minste onder u allen is, die is groot.
[9:49] Johannes nu antwoordde en zeide: Meester, wij hebben iemand in uw Naam booze geesten zien uitwerpen, en wij hebben het hem verboden, omdat hij U met ons niet volgt.
[9:50] Maar Jezus zeide tot hem: Verbiedt het niet, want wie niet tegen u is, die is vóór u. 
[9:51]  En toen de dagen vervuld werden dat Hij zou opgenomen worden, richtte Hij zijn aangezicht om naar Jerusalem te reizen,
[9:52] en Hij zond boden uit voor zijn aangezicht; en deze gingen uit en kwamen in een stad der Samaritanen om voor Hem herberg te bereiden.
[9:53] En zij ontvingen Hem niet, omdat zijn gelaat was gekeerd naar Jerusalem.
[9:54] De discipelen Jakobus en Johannes nu, dit ziende, zeiden: Heere, wilt Gij dat wij zeggen dat er vuur nederdale van den hemel en hen verslinde?
[9:55] Maar Hij keerde zich om en bestrafte hen, en zeide: Gij weet niet van welken geest gij zijt!
[9:56] Want de Zoon des menschen is niet gekomen om de zielen der menschen te verderven, maar te behouden. 
[9:57]  En zij gingen naar een ander dorp; en terwijl zij langs den weg gingen zeide iemand tot Hem: Ik zal U volgen, Heere, waar Gij ook heengaat!
[9:58] En Jezus zeide tot hem: De vossen hebben holen en de vogelen des hemels nesten, maar de Zoon des menschen heeft niet waar Hij het hoofd nederlegge!
[9:59] Hij nu zeide tot een ander: Volg Mij! Maar die zeide: Laat mij toe, Heere, eerst heen te gaan en mijn vader te begraven!
[9:60] Maar Jezus zeide tot hem: Laat de dooden hun dooden begraven; maar gij, ga heen en verkondig het koninkrijk Gods.
[9:61] En ook een ander zeide: Ik zal U volgen, Heere! maar laat mij eerst toe afscheid te nemen van mijn huisgenooten!
[9:62] Tot hem nu zeide Jezus: Niemand die zijn hand aan den ploeg geslagen heeft en omziet naar hetgeen achter is, is bekwaam voor Gods koninkrijk.  
[10:1] Na dezen wees de Heere nog zeventig anderen aan, en zond hen twee aan twee voor zijn aangezicht uit, naar iedere stad en plaats waar Hij zelf komen zou.
[10:2] En Hij zeide tot hen: De oogst is wel groot, maar er zijn weinig arbeiders; bidt dan den Heere van den oogst dat Hij arbeiders in zijn oogst uitzende.
[10:3] Gaat heen! ziet, Ik zend u als lammeren in het midden van wolven.
[10:4] Draagt geen beurs, geen reiszak, geen schoenen, en groet niemand bij den weg; 
[10:5] en in wat huis gij inkomt, zegt eerst: Vrede dezen huize!
[10:6] En als daar een zoon des vredes is, zal uw vrede op hem rusten; maar zoo niet, zoo zal die tot u wederkeeren.
[10:7] Maar blijft in dat huis, etende en drinkende van hetgeen zij hebben, want de arbeider is zijn loon waardig; gaat niet over van het eene huis naar het andere.
[10:8] En in welke stad gij komt en zij u ontvangen, eet wat u wordt voorgezet,
[10:9] en geneest de kranken die er in zijn en zegt tot hen: Het koninkrijk Gods is nabij u gekomen!
[10:10] Maar in welke stad gij zult inkomen en zij u niet ontvangen, gaat uit op haar straten en zegt:
[10:11] Ook het stof dat van uw stad ons aan de voeten hangt, schudden wij tegen u af; weet nochtans dat het koninkrijk Gods nabij is gekomen!
[10:12] Ik zeg u dat het Sodom in dien dag verdragelijker zal zijn dan die stad!
[10:13] Wee u, Chorazin! Wee u, Bethsaïda! Want zoo in Tyrus en Sidon de krachten waren geschied die in u geschied zijn, zij zouden al over lang in zak en assche zittende berouw gehad hebben.
[10:14] Maar het zal voor Tyrus en Sidon verdragelijker zijn in het oordeel dan voor ulieden!
[10:15] En gij, Kapernaüm, zijt gij niet tot den hemel toe verhoogd? — Tot het doodenrijk toe zult gij nedergestooten worden!
[10:16] Die u hoort, hoort Mij, en die u versmaadt, versmaadt Mij, en die Mij versmaadt, versmaadt Hem die Mij gezonden heeft. 
[10:17]  De zeventig nu keerden met vreugde terug en zeiden: Heere, zelfs de booze geesten waren ons onderworpen in uw Naam!
[10:18] En Hij zeide tot hen: Ik zag den Satan als een bliksem uit den hemel vallen!
[10:19] Ziet, Ik heb u de macht gegeven om op slangen en schorpioenen te treden, en over al de kracht van den vijand, en niets zal u schade doen.
[10:20] Maar verblijdt u niet daarover dat u de geesten onderworpen zijn, maar verblijdt u dat uw namen zijn geschreven in de hemelen.
[10:21] In die ure verheugde Jezus zich in den Heiligen Geest en zeide: Ik loof U, Vader! Heere des hemels en der aarde, dat Gij deze dingen hebt verborgen voor de wijzen en verstandigen, en ze den kinderkens hebt geopenbaard; ja, o Vader! want zóó is het welbehagelijk geweest voor uw aangezicht!
[10:22] Alle dingen zijn Mij overgegeven van mijn Vader en niemand weet wie de Zoon is dan de Vader, noch wie de Vader is dan de Zoon, en wien het de Zoon zal willen openbaren.
[10:23] En Hij keerde zich tot de discipelen afzonderlijk en zeide: Zalig de oogen die zien wat gij ziet.
[10:24] Want Ik zeg u dat veel profeten en koningen hebben gewenscht te zien wat gij ziet, en hebben het niet gezien; en te hooren wat gij hoort, en hebben het niet gehoord. 
[10:25]  En ziet, een zeker wetgeleerde stond op en zeide, om Hem te verzoeken: Meester, wat moet ik doen om het eeuwige leven te verkrijgen?
[10:26] En Hij zeide tot hem: Wat is er in de wet geschreven? hoe leest gij?
[10:27] Hij antwoordde en zeide: Gij zult liefhebben den Heere, uw God, met geheel uw hart, en met uw geheele ziel, en met geheel uw kracht, en met al uw verstand, en uw naaste als u zelven.
[10:28] En Hij zeide tot hem: Recht geantwoord! doe dit en gij zult leven!
[10:29] Maar hij wilde zich zelven rechtvaardigen en zeide tot Jezus: En wie is mijn naaste?
[10:30] En Jezus nam het woord en zeide: Een zeker mensch ging af van Jerusalem naar Jericho, en viel onder roovers, die hem uitplunderden en slagen gaven, en weggaande hem halfdood lieten liggen.
[10:31] Toevallig kwam er nu een zeker priester langs dien weg, die hem zag en voorbijging.
[10:32] Eveneens kwam er ook een Leviet aan die plaats, die hem zag en voorbijging.
[10:33] Maar een zeker Samaritaan, die op reis was, kwam bij hem en werd met barmhartigheid bewogen, toen hij hem zag,
[10:34] en ging naar hem toe en verbond zijn wonden, gietende daarop olie en wijn; en hem op zijn eigen lastdier zettende, bracht hij hem naar een herberg en zorgde voor hem.
[10:35] En den volgenden dag weggaande, nam hij twee penningen, en gaf die aan den waard, en zeide: Zorg voor hem en wat gij meer mocht voorschieten zal ik u teruggeven als ik wederkom.
[10:36] Wie van deze drie schijnt u toe de naaste te zijn geweest van hem die onder de roovers was gevallen?
[10:37] De wetgeleerde zeide: Die hem barmhartigheid heeft bewezen. — Jezus dan zeide tot hem: Gij ook, ga heen, en doe alzoo! 
[10:38]  En toen zij reisden geschiedde het dat Hij kwam in zeker dorp; en zekere vrouw, met name Martha, ontving Hem in haar huis.
[10:39] En deze had een zuster, met name Maria, die zich ook zette aan de voeten des Heeren om zijn woord te hooren.
[10:40] Maar Martha was druk bezig met veel bedienens, en zij trad toe en zeide: Heere, let Gij er niet op dat mijn zuster mij alleen laat dienen? zeg haar toch dat zij mij moet helpen!
[10:41] Maar de Heere antwoordde en zeide tot haar: Martha, Martha! gij zorgt en bekommert u over veel dingen!
[10:42] toch is er één ding noodig! Maria nu heeft het goede deel gekozen, dat niet van haar zal worden weggenomen.  
[11:1] En toen Jezus aan zekere plaats biddende was en ophield, geschiedde het dat een zijner discipelen tot Hem zeide: Heere, leer ons bidden zooals ook Johannes zijn discipelen heeft geleerd.
[11:2] En Hij zeide tot hen: Als gij bidt, zegt dan: Onze Vader, die in de hemelen zijt! geheiligd zij uw Naam! Uw koninkrijk kome! Uw wil geschiede, gelijk in den hemel, alzoo ook op de aarde!
[11:3] Geef ons elken dag ons dagelijksch brood!
[11:4] En vergeef ons onze zonden, want ook wij vergeven aan allen die ons schuldig zijn! En leid ons niet in bekoring! maar verlos ons van den kwade! 
[11:5]  En Hij zeide tot hen: Wie van u zal een vriend hebben en zal midden in den nacht tot hem gaan en zeggen: Vriend, leen mij drie brooden,
[11:6] omdat er een vriend van mij van de reis is gekomen en ik niets heb om hem voor te zetten.
[11:7] En zou deze dan van binnen antwoorden en zeggen: Val me niet lastig, de deur is al toe en mijn kinderen zijn met mij te bed; ik kan niet opstaan en u geven?
[11:8] Ik zeg ulieden: Al zou hij niet opstaan en hem geven omdat het zijn vriend is, dan zal hij toch, om zijn onbeschaamdheid, opstaan en hem geven zooveel hij noodig heeft.
[11:9] En Ik zeg ulieden: Bidt en u zal gegeven worden; zoekt, en gij zult vinden; klopt, en u zal opengedaan worden; 
[11:10] want al wie bidt, die ontvangt, en wie zoekt, die vindt, en wie klopt, hem zal opengedaan worden.
[11:11] En wat vader onder u, als zijn zoon hem vraagt om brood, zal hem een steen geven? of ook om een visch, zal hem, in plaats van visch, een slang geven?
[11:12] Of als hij om een ei vraagt, zal hem een schorpioen geven?
[11:13] Indien dan gij, die boos zijt, aan uw kinderen goede gaven weet te geven, hoeveel te meer zal uw Vader uit den hemel den Heiligen Geest geven aan hen die Hem bidden? 
[11:14]  En Hij wierp een boozen geest uit, en die was stom. En het geschiedde, toen de booze geest was uitgeworpen, dat de stomme sprak. En de scharen verwonderden zich.
[11:15] Maar sommigen van hen zeiden: Door Beëlzebul, den overste der booze geesten, werpt Hij de booze geesten uit!
[11:16] Anderen begeerden een teeken uit den hemel van Hem, om Hem te verzoeken.
[11:17] Maar Hij kende hun overleggingen en zeide tot hen: Ieder koninkrijk, dat tegen zich zelf verdeeld is, wordt verwoest, en ieder huis, tegen zich zelf verdeeld, valt.
[11:18] Indien nu de Satan tegen zich zelven verdeeld is, hoe zal dan zijn koninkrijk bestaan? want gij zegt dat Ik door Beëlzebul de booze geesten uitwerp!
[11:19] Indien Ik nu door Beëlzebul de booze geesten uitwerp, door wien werpen uw zonen ze dan uit? Daarom zullen die uw rechters zijn!
[11:20] Maar indien Ik door den vinger Gods de booze geesten uitwerp, zoo is dan het koninkrijk Gods tot u gekomen!
[11:21] Wanneer een sterke zijn hof gewapend bewaart dan zijn zijn goederen veilig.
[11:22] Maar als een sterkere dan hij hem overvalt en overwint, dan neemt deze hem zijn wapenen af, waarop hij vertrouwde, en verdeelt zijn buit.
[11:23] Zoo wie niet met Mij is, is tegen Mij, en die niet met Mij vergadert, die verstrooit.
[11:24] Wanneer de onreine geest van den mensch uitgegaan is, dan trekt hij door dorre plaatsen om rust te zoeken; en als hij die niet vindt, dan zegt hij: Ik zal wederkeeren naar mijn huis vanwaar ik ben uitgegaan; 
[11:25] en als hij daar komt vindt hij het schoongemaakt en versierd.
[11:26] Dan gaat hij heen en neemt zeven andere geesten mede, boozer dan hij zelf; en zij gaan binnen om daar te wonen; en het laatste van dien mensch wordt dan slechter dan het eerste. 
[11:27]  En terwijl Hij dit sprak geschiedde het dat een zekere vrouw uit de schare haar stem verhief en tot Hem zeide: Zalig het lichaam dat U droeg en de borsten die Gij gezogen hebt!
[11:28] Maar Hij zeide: Ja zeker, maar zalig die het woord Gods hooren en het bewaren!
[11:29] En toen de scharen toestroomden begon Hij te zeggen: Dit geslacht is een boos geslacht; het begeert een teeken, en geen teeken zal hun worden gegeven dan het teeken van Jonas, den profeet.
[11:30] Want gelijk Jonas voor de Ninivieten een teekenis geweest, zóó zal ook de Zoon des menschen voor dit geslacht zijn.
[11:31] De koningin van het Zuiden zal in het oordeel opstaan met de mannen van dit geslacht en zal ze veroordeelen; want zij is gekomen van de einden der aarde om te hooren de wijsheid van Salomo, en ziet, een meerdere dan Salomo is hier.
[11:32] Mannen van Ninivé zullen opstaan in het oordeel met dit geslacht en zullen het veroordeelen, want zij hebben boetvaardigheid gedaan op de prediking van Jonas, en ziet, een meerdere dan Jonas is hier.
[11:33] Niemand steekt een lamp aan en zet die in een kelder of onder een korenvat, maar op een kandelaar, opdat de binnenkomenden het licht zien mogen.
[11:34] De lamp van het lichaam is het oog; wanneer uw oog gezond is, dan is ook geheel uw lichaam verlicht; maar als het kwaad is, dan is ook geheel uw lichaam duister.
[11:35] Zie dan toe dat niet het licht, dat in u is, duisternis is!
[11:36] Want wanneer geheel uw lichaam verlicht is, zonder een duister deel te hebben, dan zal het zoo geheel verlicht zijn als wanneer een lamp u met haar licht beschijnt. 
[11:37]  Terwijl Hij nu sprak vroeg Hem een fariseër bij zich ter maaltijd, en Hij ging binnen en lag aan.
[11:38] De fariseër nu, toeziende, verwonderde zich dat Hij zich niet eerst gewasschen had, vóór den maaltijd.
[11:39] Maar de Heere zeide tot hem: Gij fariseërs! gij zuivert nu wel het buitenste van den beker en van den schotel, maar het binnenste van u is vol van roof en boosheid.
[11:40] Onzinnigen! heeft Hij, die het buitenste gemaakt heeft, ook niet het binnenste gemaakt?
[11:41] Maar wat daarin is moet gij als aalmoezen geven, en ziet, alles is u zuiver.
[11:42] Maar wee u, fariseërs! want gij geeft de tienden van de munte, en van de ruite, en van alle hofgewas, en gij gaat het oordeel en de liefde Gods voorbij; het eene nu moest gij doen en het andere niet nalaten.
[11:43] Wee u fariseërs! want gij zit gaarne vooraan in de synagogen en wordt gaarne gegroet op de markten.
[11:44] Wee u, gij schriftgeleerden en fariseërs, gij geveinsden! want gij zijt als de verborgen graven, en de menschen die er overheen gaan, weten het niet.
[11:45] En een der wetgeleerden antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Meester, dit zeggende smaadt Gij ook ons!
[11:46] Maar Hij zeide: Wee ook u, wetgeleerden! want gij belast de menschen met ondragelijke lasten, en zelf raakt gij met één van uw vingers die lasten niet aan.
[11:47] Wee u, want gij bouwt de graven der profeten op, en uw vaders hebben hen gedood.
[11:48] Alzoo getuigt gij dus ook toe te stemmen in de werken uwer vaderen, want zij hebben hen gedood en gij bouwt hun graven op.
[11:49] Daarom zegt ook de wijsheid Gods: Ik zal tot hen profeten zenden en apostelen, en van dezen zullen zij er dooden en wegjagen,
[11:50] opdat van dit geslacht worde afgeëischt het bloed van al de profeten, dat vergoten is van de schepping der wereld af; 
[11:51] van het bloed van Abel tot op het bloed van Zacharias, die gedood is tusschen den altaar en den tempel; ja, zeg Ik u, het zal worden afgeëischt van dit geslacht!
[11:52] Wee u, wetgeleerden! want gij hebt den sleutel der kennis weggenomen; zelf zijt gij niet binnengegaan en die zouden binnengaan verhindert gij!
[11:53] Als Hij nu dit tot hen sprak, begonnen de schriftgeleerden en de fariseërs hevig aan te houden en Hem uit te hooren over veel dingen;
[11:54] Hem strikken leggende, om iets uit zijn mond op te vangen om Hem te beschuldigen.  
[12:1] Terwijl nu duizenden der schare bijeengekomen waren, zoodat zij malkander vertraden, begon Jezus te zeggen tot zijn discipelen: Allereerst, wacht u zelven van den zuurdeesem der fariseërs, dat is geveinsdheid.
[12:2] Maar er is niets bedekt dat niet zal ontdekt worden, en verborgen dat niet bekend zal worden.
[12:3] Daarom al wat gij in de duisternis gezegd hebt, zal in het licht gehoord worden, en wat gij aan het oor gezegd hebt in de binnenkameren, dat zal gepredikt worden op de daken.
[12:4] En Ik zeg u, mijn vrienden: Vreest niet voor hen die het lichaam dooden en daarna geen macht hebben meer te doen.
[12:5] Maar Ik zal u toonen wien gij te vreezen hebt: Vreest hem die, nadat hij gedood heeft, macht heeft om in de hel te werpen; ja, zeg Ik u, dien moet gij vreezen.
[12:6] Worden niet vijf muschkens verkocht voor twee penningen? en niet één van deze is vergeten bij God.
[12:7] Maar zelfs de haren van uw hoofd zijn allen geteld; vreest dus niet, gij zijt meer waard dan veel muschkens.
[12:8] En Ik zeg u: Een ieder die Mij zal belijden voor de menschen, dien zal ook de Zoon des menschen belijden voor de engelen Gods.
[12:9] Maar die Mij zal verloochenen voor de menschen, die zal ook verloochend worden voor de engelen Gods.
[12:10] En al wie een woord spreekt tegen den Zoon des menschen, het zal hem vergeven worden, maar aan hem die tegen den Heiligen Geest zal gelasterd hebben, zal het niet vergeven worden.
[12:11] Wanneer zij u zullen overleveren voor de synagogen, en de overheden, en de machten, zijt dan niet bezorgd hoe gij u verdedigen of wat gij spreken zult,
[12:12] want de Heilige Geest zal u in die zelfde ure leeren wat gij moet zeggen. 
[12:13]  En iemand uit de schare zeide tot Hem: Meester, zeg tot mijn broeder dat hij met mij de erfenis deele!
[12:14] Maar Hij zeide tot hem: Mensch, wie heeft Mij aangesteld tot rechter of scheidsman over u?
[12:15] En Hij zeide tot hen: Ziet toe en wacht u van alle gierigheid, want iemands leven hangt niet af van den overvloed dien hij geniet uit zijn bezittingen.
[12:16] En Hij sprak een gelijkenis tot hen en zeide: Het land van zeker rijk mensch had veel opgeleverd,
[12:17] en hij overleide bij zich zelven, zeggende: Wat zal ik doen, want ik heb niet waar ik mijn vruchten kan verzamelen?
[12:18] En hij zeide: Dat zal ik doen; ik zal mijn schuren afbreken en grootere bouwen, en daarin zal ik al mijn gewas en goederen verzamelen,
[12:19] en ik zal tot mijn ziel zeggen: Ziel, gij bezit veel goederen, opgelegd voor veel jaren; neem rust, eet, drink, zijt vroolijk!
[12:20] Maar God zeide tot hem: Onverstandige! In dezen nacht zal men uw ziel van u afeischen; en wat gij bereid hebt, voor wien zal het zijn? 
[12:21]  Alzoo is het met hem die zich zelven schatten verzamelt en niet rijk is in God.
[12:22] Hij zeide nu tot zijn discipelen: Daarom zeg Ik ulieden, zijt niet bekommerd voor uw leven, wat gij eten zult, of voor uw lichaam, waarmede gij u kleeden zult.
[12:23] Het leven is meer dan het voedsel en het lichaam meer dan de kleeding.
[12:24] Let op de raven, dat zij niet zaaien of maaien, dat zij geen kelder of schuur hebben, en toch voedt God ze. Hoeveel zijt gij niet meer waard dan de vogelen?
[12:25] Wie toch van u kan, door bekommerd te zijn, een oogenblik tot zijn leeftijd toedoen?
[12:26] Indien gij dan ook het geringste niet kunt, wat zijt gij bekommerd voor het overige?
[12:27] Let op de leliën, hoe ze wassen! Zij arbeiden of spinnen niet, en Ik zeg u, dat zelfs Salomo in al zijn glorie niet was gekleed gelijk één van deze.
[12:28] Indien nu God het gras dat vandaag op het veld is en morgen in den oven geworpen wordt, alzoo kleedt, hoeveel te meer u, o kleingeloovigen!
[12:29] En gij, zoekt niet wat gij eten of drinken zult, en verontrust u niet!
[12:30] Want dit alles zoeken de volken der wereld, maar uw Vader weet dat gij het van noode hebt.
[12:31] Maar zoekt Gods koninkrijk, en al deze dingen zullen er u bijgevoegd worden.
[12:32] Vrees niet, klein kuddeke! want uws Vaders welbehagen is het, ulieden het koninkrijk te geven.
[12:33] Verkoopt uw goederen en geeft aalmoezen; maakt voor u beurzen die niet verslijten, een onvergankelijken schat in de hemelen, waar de dief niet bij komt en de mot niet verderft; 
[12:34] want waar uw schat is, daar zal ook uw hart zijn. 
[12:35]  Laat uw lenden omgord zijn en uw kaarsen brandende.
[12:36] En zijt gelijk aan menschen die op hun heer wachten, als hij van de bruiloft zal terugkeeren, opdat zij voor hem terstond opendoen als hij komt en aanklopt.
[12:37] Zalig die dienstknechten die de heer, als hij komt, zal wakende vinden! Waarlijk, Ik zeg u, dat hij zich zal omgorden, en hen doen aanliggen en hen zal komen bedienen.
[12:38] En of hij komt in de tweede, of in de derde nachtwake, en het alzoo bevindt, — zalig zijn die dienstknechten!
[12:39] Maar dit verstaat gij dat, als de huisheer geweten had in welke ure de dief zou komen, hij zou wakker gebleven zijn en niet hebben toegelaten dat zijn huis doorgraven werd.
[12:40] Zijt ook gij dan gereed, want in de ure dat gij het niet meent, komt de Zoon des menschen!
[12:41] Petrus nu zeide tot Hem: Heere, spreekt Gij deze gelijkenis tot ons, of ook tot allen?
[12:42] En de Heere zeide: Wie is dan de getrouwe, de verstandige huisverzorger, dien de heer zal stellen over zijn dienstboden, om elk op zijn tijd zijn deel van de spijze te geven?
[12:43] Zalig die dienstknecht, dien zijn heer, als deze komt, zal vinden alzoo doende.
[12:44] Waarlijk, Ik zeg u, dat hij hem zal stellen over al zijn goederen.
[12:45] Maar zoo die dienstknecht in zijn hart zou zeg hen: Mijn heer spoedt niet om te komen! en hij zou beginnen met de dienstknechten en dienstmaagden te slaan, en te eten en te drinken en zich dronken te maken,
[12:46] dan zal de heer van dien dienstknecht komen op een dag waarop deze het niet verwacht, en in een ure waarin hij het niet meent, en hij zal hem in stukken houwen, en zijn deel stellen met de ontrouwen.
[12:47] Die dienstknecht nu, die den wil van zijn heer geweten, maar zich niet gereedgemaakt heeft, of zijn wil gedaan heeft, zal veel slagen ontvangen; 
[12:48] maar die het niet geweten, doch strafwaardige dingen gedaan heeft, die zal weinig slagen ontvangen; want van een ieder, dien veel gegeven is, zal veel geëischt worden, en van hem dien veel toevertrouwd is, zal meer worden gevraagd. 
[12:49]  Ik ben gekomen om vuur op de aarde te werpen, en wat wil Ik, als het reeds ontstoken is?
[12:50] Maar Ik moet met een doop gedoopt worden, en hoe word Ik benauwd, totdat het volbracht is!
[12:51] Meent gij dat Ik gekomen ben om vrede te geven op aarde? Neen, zeg Ik u, maar veeleer verdeeldheid.
[12:52] Want van nu af zullen er vijf in één huis verdeeld zijn, drie tegen twee en twee tegen drie.
[12:53] Een vader zal tegen een zoon verdeeld zijn, en een zoon tegen een vader; een moeder tegen een dochter en een dochter tegen een moeder; een schoondochter tegen een schoonmoeder en een schoonmoeder tegen een schoondochter. 
[12:54]  En Hij zeide ook tot de scharen: Wanneer gij een wolk ziet opkomen uit het westen, dan zegt gij terstond dat er regen komt, en het geschiedt alzoo.
[12:55] En wanneer gij een zuidenwind ziet waaien, zegt gij dat het heet zal zijn, en het geschiedt.
[12:56] Geveinsden! de gesteltenis der aarde en des hemels weet gij te onderscheiden, maar hoe onderscheidt gij dan niet dezen tijd?
[12:57] En waarom oordeelt gij ook uit u zelven niet hetgeen rechtvaardig is? 
[12:58]  Want als gij met uw wederpartij tot de overheid gaat, doe dan onderweg uw best om van hem af te komen, opdat hij u misschien niet voor den rechter trekke, en de rechter u overgeve aan den gerechtsdienaar, en de gerechtsdienaar u in de gevangenis werpe!
[12:59] Ik zeg u, gij zult daar niet uitkomen, vóórdat gij den laatsten penning zult betaald hebben!  
[13:1] Terzelfder tijd kwamen eenigen aan Jezus boodschappen van de Galileërs, dat Pilatus hun bloed met hun offeranden had gemengd.
[13:2] En Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Meent gij dat die Galileërs grooter zondaars zijn geweest dan al de andere Galileërs, omdat zij dit geleden hebben?
[13:3] Neen, zeg Ik u, maar indien gij geen berouw hebt zult gij allen eveneens vergaan.
[13:4] Of die achttien, op wie de toren van Siloam viel en hen doodde, meent gij dat die grooter schuldenaars waren dan al de menschen die in Jerusalem waren?
[13:5] Neen, zeg Ik u, maar indien gij geen berouw hebt zult gij allen eveneens vergaan. 
[13:6]  En Hij sprak deze gelijkenis: Iemand had in zijn hof een vijgeboom geplant, en hij kwam om er vrucht op te zoeken en vond niets.
[13:7] Toen zeide hij tot den hovenier: Zie, drie jaar kom ik nu om vrucht te zoeken op dezen vijgeboom en ik vind niets; kap hem uit, waarom maakt hij den grond onvruchtbaar?
[13:8] Maar de hovenier zeide tot hem: Heer, laat hem dit jaar nog, totdat ik rond hem gespit en mest gelegd heb,
[13:9] of hij misschien nog vrucht voortbrengt; maar zoo niet, kap hem dan later uit. 
[13:10]  Jezus nu leerde op een sabbat in een der synagogen.
[13:11] En ziet, een vrouw was daar, die achttien jaar lang een geest van krankheid gehad had, en zij was zoo krom dat zij in ‘t geheel niet kon recht staan.
[13:12] En Jezus zag haar en riep haar toe en zeide tot haar: Vrouw, gij zijt verlost van uw krankheid!
[13:13] En Hij leide de handen op haar en terstond werd zij recht; en zij gaf aan God de glorie.
[13:14] De overste der synagoge nu, die het zeer kwaad opnam dat Jezus op den sabbat genas, antwoordde en zeide tot de schare: Er zijn zes dagen waarop men moet werken; komt dan op een van die dagen om genezen te worden en niet op den sabbatdag!
[13:15] Maar de Heere antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Geveinsde, maakt niet ieder van u op den sabbat zijn os of ezel van de kribbe los, om die heen te leiden om te doen drinken?
[13:16] Moest dan deze, die een dochter van Abraham is, die de satan nu al achttien jaar gebonden heeft, niet worden losgemaakt van dezen band op een sabbatdag?
[13:17] En als Hij dit zeide werden al zijn tegenstanders beschaamd; en de geheele schare was verblijd over al de loffelijke daden die door Hem gedaan werden. 
[13:18]  Hij zeide dan: Waaraan is het koninkrijk Gods gelijk en waarbij zal Ik dat vergelijken?
[13:19] Het is gelijk aan een mosterdzaad, dat een mensch nam en in zijn hof wierp, en het wies op en werd tot een boom, en de vogelen des hemels nestelden in zijn takken.
[13:20] En wederom zeide Hij: Waarbij zal Ik het koninkrijk Gods vergelijken?
[13:21] Het is gelijk aan een zuurdeesem, dien een vrouw nam en verborg in drie maten meels, totdat het geheel doorzuurd was. 
[13:22]  En Jezus trok door steden en dorpen, onderwijzende, en Hij sloeg den weg in naar Jerusalem.
[13:23] En iemand zeide tot Hem: Heere, zijn het weinigen, die behouden worden?
[13:24] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Strijdt gij om in te gaan door de enge poort, want velen, zeg Ik u, zullen zoeken in te gaan en zullen niet kunnen,
[13:25] nadat de huisheer zal zijn opgestaan en de deur zal hebben gesloten; en gij zult beginnen buiten te staan en aan de deur te kloppen, zeggende: Heere, Heere, doe ons open! en Hij zal antwoorden en tot u zeggen: Ik weet niet vanwaar gij zijt!
[13:26] Dan zult gij beginnen te zeggen: Wij hebben gegeten en gedronken voor uw oogen, en op onze straten hebt Gij geleerd!
[13:27] En Hij zal zeggen: Ik zeg ulieden, Ik weet niet vanwaar gij zijt! gaat van Mij weg, gij allen die de onrechtvaardigheid werkt!
[13:28] Daar zal het geween zijn en het tandengeknars, wanneer gij zien zult Abraham en Isaäk en Jakob en al de proleten in het koninkrijk Gods, maar u zelven buitengeworpen.
[13:29] En zij zullen komen van oost en west, en van noord en zuid, en zullen aanliggen in het koninkrijk Gods.
[13:30] En ziet, er zijn laatsten die de eersten zullen zijn, en er zijn eersten die de laatsten zullen zijn. 
[13:31]  Denzelfden dag kwamen sommige fariseërs tot Hem, zeggende: Ga weg, en trek van hier, want Herodes wil U dooden!
[13:32] En Hij zeide tot hen: Gaat heen, zegt tot dien vos: Zie, Ik werp booze geesten uit en maak kranken gezond, heden en morgen, en op den derden dag ben Ik ten einde.
[13:33] Maar Ik moet heden en morgen en den dag daarna reizen, want het kan niet zijn dat een profeet buiten Jerusalem wordt gedood!
[13:34] Jerusalem, Jerusalem! dat de profeten doodt en steenigt die tot u gezonden zijn! hoe dikwijls heb Ik uw kinderen willen bijeenvergaderen gelijk een klokhen haar kiekens bijeenvergadert onder de vleugelen, en gij hebt niet gewild!
[13:35] Zie, uw huis wordt u onbewoond gelaten! En Ik zeg u dat gij Mij niet zult zien, voordat de tijd komt dat gij zult zeggen: Gezegend Hij die komt in den Naam des Heeren!  
[14:1] En het geschiedde toen Jezus op een sabbat in het huis van een der oversten van de fariseërs was gekomen om brood te eten, dat zij Hem bespiedden.
[14:2] En ziet, een zeker waterzuchtig mensch stond voor Hem.
[14:3] En Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot de wetgeleerden en fariseërs: Is het geoorloofd op den sabbat te genezen of niet? maar zij zwegen stil.
[14:4] En Hij nam en genas hem en liet hem heengaan.
[14:5] En Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Wie van u, als zijn ezel of os in een put viel, zal dien niet terstond op een sabbatdag er uittrekken? 
[14:6]  En zij konden Hem hierop niet antwoorden.
[14:7] Hij sprak nu een gelijkenis tot de genoodigden, daar Hij bemerkte dat zij de voornaamste plaatsen verkozen, en zeide tot hen:
[14:8] Als gij door iemand ter bruiloft genoodigd zijt, neem dan niet de voornaamste plaats, opdat niet, als er misschien een aanzienlijker genoodigd is dan gij,
[14:9] en hij, die u en hem genoodigd heeft, zou komen en tot u zeggen: Maak voor dezen plaats! gij dan met schaamte zoudt beginnen de laatste plaats te nemen.
[14:10] Maar als gij genoodigd zijt, neem dan de laatste plaats, opdat, wanneer hij die u genoodigd heeft komt, hij tot u zegge: Vriend, ga hooger op! dan zal het u tot eer zijn voor allen die met u aanliggen.
[14:11] Want ieder die zich zelven verhoogt, zal vernederd worden, en wie zich zei ven vernedert, zal verhoogd worden. 
[14:12]  Hij sprak ook tot dengene die Hem genoodigd had: Als gij een middag– of avondmaal aanricht, noodig dan niet uw vrienden, of uw broeders, of uw bloedverwanten, of uw rijke geburen, opdat deze niet misschien ook u wedernoodigen en u vergelding geschiede.
[14:13] Maar als gij een maal aanricht, noodig dan armen, gebrekkelijken, kreupelen en blinden.
[14:14] Dan zult gij gelukkig zijn, omdat zij niet hebben om u wedervergelding te doen; u zal dan wedervergolden worden in de verrijzenis der rechtvaardigen. 
[14:15]  Als iemand der medeaanliggenden dit nu hoorde, zeide hij tot Hem: Zalig hij die brood eet in het koninkrijk Gods!
[14:16] En Hij zeide tot hem: Een zeker man richtte een grooten maaltijd aan en noodigde velen.
[14:17] En hij zond zijn dienstknecht uit ter ure van den maaltijd om den genoodigden te zeggen: Komt, want alles is nu gereed!
[14:18] En zij begonnen zich allen eenparig te verontschuldigen; de eerste zeide tot hem: Ik heb een akker gekocht en moet noodzakelijk uitgaan om dien te bezien; ik bid u, verschoon mij!
[14:19] En een ander zeide: Ik heb vijf gespan ossen gekocht en ga die beproeven; ik bid u, verschoon mij!
[14:20] En een ander zeide: Ik heb een vrouw getrouwd en daarom kan ik niet komen.
[14:21] En de dienstknecht kwam terug en boodschapte dit aan zijn heer. Toen werd de huisheer toornig en zeide tot zijn dienstknecht: Ga haastig uit naar de straten en stegen der stad, en breng de armen, en gebrekkelijken, en blinden, en kreupelen, hier binnen!
[14:22] En de dienstknecht zeide: Heer, wat gij bevolen hebt, is geschied en nog is er plaats.
[14:23] En de heer zeide tot den dienstknecht: Ga uit naar de wegen en paden, en houd aan dat ze binnenkomen, opdat mijn huisvol worde; 
[14:24] want ik zeg u dat niemand van die mannen, die genoodigd waren, van mijn maaltijd proeven zal! 
[14:25]  Vele scharen gingen met Hem, en Hij keerde zich om en zeide tot hen:
[14:26] Zoo iemand tot Mij komt en niet haat zijn vader, en moeder, en vrouw, en kinderen, en broeders, en zusters, ja ook zelfs zijn eigen leven, die kan mijn discipel niet zijn.
[14:27] En zoo wie zijn eigen kruis niet draagt en achter Mij komt, die kan mijn discipel niet zijn.
[14:28] Want wie uwer, die een toren wil bouwen, gaat niet eerst nederzitten om de kosten te berekenen, of hij genoeg heeft tot de voltooiing?
[14:29] Opdat niet misschien, als hij het fundament heeft gelegd, en niet kan voleindigen, allen die het zien hem beginnen te bespotten,
[14:30] zeggende: Deze mensch begon te bouwen en kon het niet voltooien!
[14:31] Of welke koning, als hij optrekt om tegen een anderen koning te oorlogen, gaat niet eerst nederzitten om te beraadslagen of hij wel bij machte is om met tien duizend man hem af te wachten die met twintig duizend man tegen hem optrekt?
[14:32] Zoo niet, dan zendt hij een gezantschap, terwijl de andere nog ver af is, en doet voorslagen van vrede.
[14:33] Alzoo dan, al wie van u niet afstand doet van al wat hij bezit, die kan mijn discipel niet zijn.
[14:34] Het zout is goed; maar als ook het zout zijn kracht verliest, waarmede zal het dan smakelijk gemaakt worden?
[14:35] Noch voor het land, noch voor mest deugt het; men werpt het weg. Die ooren heeft om te hooren, die hoore!  
[15:1] Al de tollenaars nu en de zondaars waren tot Jezus genaderd om Hem te hooren.
[15:2] En de fariseërs en de schriftgeleerden murmureerden, zeggende: Deze ontvangt zondaars, en eet met hen!
[15:3] En Hij sprak tot hen deze gelijkenis, zeggende:
[15:4] Zoo iemand van u honderd schapen heeft en één van deze verliest, laat hij dan niet de negen en negentig in de woestijn en gaat heen naar het verlorene totdat hij het vindt?
[15:5] En als hij het gevonden heeft, legt hij het met blijdschap op zijn schouders.
[15:6] En tehuis komende roept hij de vrienden en geburen samen, zeggende tot hen: Zijt blijde met mij, want ik heb mijn schaap gevonden dat verloren was!
[15:7] Ik zeg ulieden dat er alzoo meer blijdschap zal zijn in den hemel over één zondaar die tot berouw komt, dan over negen en negentig rechtvaardigen die geen berouw van noode hebben. 
[15:8]  Of, zoo een vrouw tien penningen heeft, en zij verliest één penning, steekt zij dan niet een lamp aan en veegt het huis en zoekt nauwkeurig, totdat zij hem vindt?
[15:9] En als zij den penning gevonden heeft, roept zij de vriendinnen en geburen samen, zeggende: Zijt blijde met mij, want ik heb mijn verloren penning gevonden!
[15:10] Alzoo, zeg Ik ulieden, is er blijdschap voor de engelen Gods over één zondaar, die tot berouw komt! 
[15:11]  En Jezus zeide: Een zeker mensch had twee zonen.
[15:12] En de jongste van deze zeide tot den vader: Vader, geef mij het mij toekomend deel van het goed! En hij verdeelde onder hen het vermogen.
[15:13] En weinig dagen later verzamelde de jongste zoon alles bijeen en vertrok naar een ver land, en daar verkwistte hij zijn goed door een losbandig leven.
[15:14] Toen nu alles doorgebracht was, kwam er een zware hongersnood in dat land en hij begon gebrek te lijden.
[15:15] En hij ging heen en vervoegde zich bij een der burgers van dat land, en die zond hem naar zijn velden om de varkens te hoeden.
[15:16] En hij wenschte zijn honger te stillen met den draf dien de varkens aten, maar niemand gaf hem dien.
[15:17] Maar tot zich zelven komende, zeide hij: Hoeveel daglooners mijns vaders hebben overvloed van brood, en ik verga hier van honger!
[15:18] Ik zal opstaan en naar mijn vader gaan en tot hem zeggen: Vader, ik heb gezondigd tegen den hemel en voor u,
[15:19] ik ben niet meer waardig uw zoon genoemd te worden; maak mij als een uwer daglooners!
[15:20] En hij stond op en ging naar zijn vader. Als hij nu nog verre af was, zag zijn vader hem en werd innerlijk bewogen, en liep toe en viel hem om den hals en kuste hem.
[15:21] De zoon nu zeide tot hem: Vader, ik heb gezondigd tegen den hemel en voor u; ik ben niet meer waardig uw zoon genoemd te worden.
[15:22] Maar de vader zeide tot zijn dienstknechten: Haalt spoedig het eerste kleed, en trekt het hem aan, en geeft een ring aan zijn hand en schoenen aan de voeten,
[15:23] en brengt het gemeste kalf, en slacht het, en laat ons eten en vroolijk zijn,
[15:24] want deze mijn zoon was dood en is weer levend geworden, hij was verloren en is gevonden. En zij begonnen vroolijk te zijn.
[15:25] Ondertusschen was zijn oudste zoon in het veld; en toen deze nu kwam en het huis naderde, hoorde hij de muziek en den dans,
[15:26] en hij riep een der knechten en vroeg wat dat mocht zijn.
[15:27] Deze nu zeide tot hem: Uw broeder is gekomen, en uw vader heeft het gemeste kalf geslacht omdat hij hem gezond heeft terug gekregen.
[15:28] Toen werd de oudste zoon toornig en wilde niet binnengaan. Maar zijn vader ginguit en vroeg het hem dringend.
[15:29] Maar hij antwoordde en zeide tot den vader: Zie, al zóóveel jaar dien ik u; en nimmer heb ik uw gebod overtreden, en mij hebt gij nooit eens een bokje gegeven om met mijn vrienden vroolijk te zijn.
[15:30] Maar nu deze uw zoon, die uw goed met hoeren heeft verkwist, is gekomen, nu hebt gij voor hem het gemeste kalf geslacht!
[15:31] Maar de vader zeide tot hem: Kind, gij zijt altijd bij mij, en al het mijne is het uwe.
[15:32] Men moest dan wel vroolijk en blijde zijn, want deze uw broeder was dood en is weer levend geworden; hij was verloren en is gevonden.  
[16:1] En Jezus sprak ook tot zijn discipelen: Er was een zeker rijk mensch die een rentmeester had; en deze werd voor hem beschuldigd dat hij zijn goederen verkwistte.
[16:2] En hij riep hem en zeide tot hem: Wat hoor ik van u? doe rekening van uw rentmeesterschap, want gij zult geen rentmeester meer kunnen zijn.
[16:3] Toen zeide de rentmeester bij zich zelven: Wat moet ik doen, daar mijn heer het rentmeesterschap van mij afneemt? graven kan ik niet, te bedelen schaam ik mij!
[16:4] Maar ik weet wat ik doen zal opdat zij mij in hun huizen ontvangen, als ik van het rentmeesterschap zal afgezet zijn!
[16:5] En hij riep de schuldenaars van zijn heer een voor een tot zich en zeide tot den een: Hoeveel zijt gij aan mijn heer schuldig?
[16:6] Hij zeide: Honderd vat olie. De rentmeester nu zeide tot hem: Neem uw handschrift en ga zitten, en schrijf haastig vijftig!
[16:7] Daarna zeide hij tot den anderen: En gij, hoeveel zijt gij schuldig? Deze zeide: Honderd mud tarwe. En hij zeide tot hem: Neem uw handschrift en schrijf tachtig!
[16:8] En de meester prees den onrechtvaardigen rentmeester omdat hij behendig had gedaan. Want de kinderen dezer eeuw zijn behendiger omtrent hun geslacht dan de kinderen des lichts.
[16:9] En Ik zeg ulieden: Maakt u vrienden uit den onrechtvaardigen rijkdom, opdat zij u ontvangen in de eeuwige tenten als gij gebrek zult hebben.
[16:10] Die in liet minste getrouw is, is ook in het groote getrouw, en die in het minste onrechtvaardig is, is ook in het groote onrechtvaardig.
[16:11] Indien gij dan niet getrouw zijt geweest in den onrechtvaardigen rijkdom, wie zal u het waarachtige toevertrouwen?
[16:12] En indien gij niet getrouw zijt geweest in het goed van een ander, wie zal u dan uw eigen goed geven? 
[16:13]  Geen huisknecht kan twee heeren dienen, want hij zal den een haten en den anderen beminnen, of hij zal den een aanhangen en den anderen verachten; gij kunt God niet dienen en te gelijk den rijkdom.
[16:14] Dit alles nu hoorden de fariseërs, die geldgierig waren, en zij lachten Hem uit.
[16:15] En Hij zeide tot hen: Gij zijt lieden die u zelven rechtvaardigt voor de menschen, maar God kent uw harten; want wat hoog is onder de menschen, is een gruwel voor God.
[16:16] De wet en de profeten gaan tot op Johannes; van toen af wordt het koninkrijk Gods gepredikt en ieder bestormt het.
[16:17] Toch is het lichter dat de hemel en de aarde voorbijgaan dan dat er één stipken van de wet zou vallen.
[16:18] Een ieder die zijn vrouw verlaat en een andere trouwt, doet overspel, en die een door haar man verlaten vrouw trouwt, doet overspel. 
[16:19]  Er was een zeker rijk mensch die gekleed was in purper en fijn lijnwaad, en die dagelijks wellustig leefde.
[16:20] En er was een zeker arme, met name Lazarus, die aan zijn poort lag, vol zweren.
[16:21] Deze wenschte verzadigd te worden van de kruimels die van de tafel des rijken vielen, maar zelfs de honden kwamen en likten zijn zweren.
[16:22] Het geschiedde nu dat de arme stierf en door de engelen werd overgedragen naar den schoot van Abraham. En de rijke stierf ook en werd begraven.
[16:23] En toen hij in het doodenrijk zijn oogen opsloeg, in smarten zijnde, zag hij Abraham van verre en Lazarus in zijn schoot.
[16:24] En hij riep en zeide: Vader Abraham! ontferm u mijner, en zend Lazarus, dat hij den punt van zijn vinger in het water steke en mijn tong afkoele, want ik lijd smarte in deze vlam!
[16:25] Maar Abraham zeide: Kind, gedenk dat gij het goede ontvangen hebt in uw leven, en Lazarus insgelijks het kwade; nu wordt hij hier vertroost, maar gij lijdt smarte.
[16:26] En daarenboven is er tusschen ons en u een groote afgrond gevestigd, zoodat zij die van hier zouden willen overgaan tot u, niet zouden kunnen, noch die daar zijn, tot ons zouden overkomen.
[16:27] Hij nu zeide: Ik bid u dan, vader! dat gij hem zendt naar mijns vaders huis,
[16:28] want ik heb vijf broeders; dat hij hen waarschuwe, opdat ook zij niet komen in deze plaats der smarte!
[16:29] Maar Abraham zeide tot hem: Zij hebben Mozes en de profeten! laat hen naar die hooren!
[16:30] Maar hij zeide: Neen, vader Abraham! maar als iemand van de dooden tot hen ging, dan zouden zij tot boetvaardigheid komen!
[16:31] Doch Abraham zeide tot hem: Indien zij niet hooren naar Mozes en de profeten, dan zullen zij zich niet laten overtuigen, al zou er iemand van de dooden verrijzen!  
[17:1] Jezus zeide nu tot zijn discipelen: Het is onmogelijk dat er geen ergernissen zouden komen, maar wee dengene, door wien zij komen!
[17:2] Het ware hem beter, dat hem een molensteen om den hals gehangen en hij in de zee geworpen werd, dan dat hij één van deze kleinen zou ergeren.
[17:3] Wacht u zelven! Indien uw broeder zondigt, bestraf hem, en als hij berouw heeft, vergeef het hem.
[17:4] En als hij zevenmaal per dag tegen u zondigt, en zevenmaal tot u wederkeert, zeggende: Ik heb berouw, zoo zult gij het hem vergeven! 
[17:5]  En de apostelen zeiden tot den Heere: Vermeerder ons geloof!
[17:6] Maar de Heere zeide: Zoo gij geloof hadt als een mosterdzaad, dan zoudt gij tot dezen moerbezieboom zeggen: Ontwortel u en verplant u in de zee! — en hij zou u gehoorzamen. 
[17:7]  En wie van u die een dienstknecht heeft, ploegende of de beesten hoedende, zal tot hem zeggen als hij van den akker komt: Kom en lig terstond mede aan?
[17:8] Zal hij niet liever tot hem zeggen: Maak mijn avondmaaltijd gereed, en omgord u, en bedien mij, totdat ik heb gegeten en gedronken, en daarna zult gij eten en drinken?
[17:9] Dankt hij dan dien dienstknecht omdat deze gedaan heeft wat hem bevolen was? Ik denk het niet.
[17:10] Alzoo ook gijlieden, als gij zult gedaan hebben alles wat u bevolen is, zegt dan: Onnutte dienstknechten zijn wij; wij hebben maar gedaan wat we verplicht waren te doen! 
[17:11]  En als Hij naar Jerusalem trok, geschiedde het dat hij midden tusschen Samaria en Galilea doorging.
[17:12] En als Hij naar zeker dorp kwam ontmoetten Hem tien melaatsche mannen, die van verre stonden,
[17:13] en zij verhieven hun stem, zeggende: Jezus, Meester, ontferm U onzer!
[17:14] En hen ziende zeide Hij tot Hen: Gaat heen, vertoont u zelven aan de priesters! En het geschiedde dat zij gereinigd werden terwijl zij weggingen.
[17:15] Toen nu één hunner zag dat hij genezen was, keerde hij terug, met groote stem God de glorie gevende.
[17:16] En hij viel op het aangezicht bij zijn voeten, Hem dankende. En deze was een Samaritaan.
[17:17] Jezus dan antwoordde en zeide: Zijn niet de tien gereinigd? En de negen, waar zijn ze?
[17:18] Zijn er geen gevonden die wederkeeren om Gode de glorie te geven, dan deze vreemdeling?
[17:19] En Hij zeide tot hem: Sta op, ga heen, uw geloof heeft u behouden! 
[17:20]  Gevraagd zijnde van de fariseërs wanneer het koninkrijk Gods zou komen, antwoordde Hij hun en zeide: Het koninkrijk Gods komt niet op zichtbare wijze.
[17:21] En men zal niet zeggen: Hier is het, of daar! want ziet, het koninkrijk Gods is in uw midden.
[17:22] Hij zeide dan tot de discipelen: Er zullen dagen komen dat gij zult verlangen één der dagen van den Zoon des menschen te zien, en gij zult dien niet zien.
[17:23] En men zal tot u zeggen: Ziet daar! ziet hier! Maar gaat niet heen, loopt niet na!
[17:24] Want gelijk de bliksem schittert, die van het eene einde des hemels tot het andere straalt, alzoo zal de Zoon des menschen zijn in zijn dag.
[17:25] Maar eerst moet Hij veel lijden en verworpen worden door deze natie.
[17:26] En gelijk het was in de dagen van Noach, zoo zal het ook zijn in de dagen van den Zoon des menschen:
[17:27] Zij aten, zij dronken, zij trouwden, zij werden getrouwd, tot op den dag dat Noach in de ark ging; en de zondvloed kwam en verdelgde allen.
[17:28] Desgelijks ook als het was in de dagen van Lot; zij aten, zij dronken, zij kochten, zij verkochten, zij plantten, zij bouwden; 
[17:29] maar op den dag dat Lot van Sodom uitging, regende er vuur en solfer van den hemel en verdelgde allen.
[17:30] Op dezelfde wijze zal het zijn op den dag dat de Zoon des menschen openbaar zal worden.
[17:31] In dien dag, wie op het dak is en zijn huisraad is in huis, hij kome niet naar beneden om het te grijpen, en die op den akker is keere ook niet terug tot hetgeen hij achterliet.
[17:32] Gedenkt aan de vrouw van Lot.
[17:33] Wie zijn leven zal zoeken te behouden, die zal het verliezen, en wie het zal verliezen, die zal het bewaren.
[17:34] Ik zeg ulieden: In dien nacht zullen er twee op één bed zijn; de een zal worden meegenomen en de andere achtergelaten.
[17:35] Twee zullen er samen aan het malen zijn; de eene zal worden meegenomen, maar de andere achtergelaten.
[17:36] Twee zullen er op den akker zijn; de een zal worden meegenomen en de andere achtergelaten.
[17:37] En zij antwoordden en zeiden tot Hem: Waar, Heere? En Hij zeide tot hen: Waar het lichaam is, daar zullen zich ook de arenden verzamelen.  
[18:1] En Jezus sprak een gelijkenis tot hen om hun te keren dat men altijd moet bidden en niet moedeloos worden,
[18:2] zeggende: Er was een rechter in zekere stad die God niet vreesde en geen mensch ontzag.
[18:3] En in die zelfde stad was een weduwe die tot hem kwam, zeggende: Doe mij recht tegen mijn wederpartij.
[18:4] En een tijd lang wilde hij niet; maar daarna zeide hij in zich zelven: Ofschoon ik God niet vrees en geen mensch ontzie,
[18:5] zal ik toch, omdat deze weduwe mij lastig valt, haar recht doen, opdat zij ten slotte niet kome en mij in het aangezicht sla.
[18:6] En de Heere zeide: Hoort gij wat de onrechtvaardige rechter zegt?
[18:7] En zal God dan geen recht doen aan zijn uitverkorenen, die dag en nacht tot Hem roepen? En zal hij hen lang laten wachten?
[18:8] Ik zeg ulieden dat Hij hun spoedig zal recht doen. Maar als de Zoon des menschen komt, zal Hij dan wel het geloof vinden op aarde? 
[18:9]  En Hij sprak ook tot sommigen, die van zich zelven waanden dat zij rechtvaardig waren en die de anderen verachtten, deze gelijkenis:
[18:10] Twee menschen gingen op naar den tempel om te bidden; de een was een fariseër en de andere een tollenaar.
[18:11] De fariseër stond recht en bad dit bij zich zelven: O God, ik dank U dat ik niet ben als de andere menschen, roovers, onrechtvaardigen, overspelers, of ook als deze tollenaar; 
[18:12] ik vast tweemaal per week, ik geef tienden van al wat ik bezit!
[18:13] Maar de tollenaar stond van verre en wilde zelfs de oogen niet ten hemel heffen, maar sloeg zich op de borst, zeggende: O God, zijt mij, den zondaar, genadig!
[18:14] Ik zeg ulieden: Deze ging gerechtvaardigd naar zijn huis, meer dan de andere; want al wie zich zelven verhoogt zal vernederd worden, maar wie zich zelven vernedert zal verhoogd worden. 
[18:15]  En zij brachten ook de kinderkens tot Hem opdat Hij ze mocht aanraken; doch de discipelen dit ziende bestraften hen.
[18:16] Maar Jezus riep hen tot zich, en zeide: Laat de kinderkens tot Mij komen en verhindert ze niet, want voor zoodanigen is het koninkrijk Gods.
[18:17] Voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Zoo wie het koninkrijk Gods niet aanneemt als een kindeken, die zal er geenszins ingaan. 
[18:18]  En een zeker overste vroeg Hem en zeide: Goede Meester, wat doende zal ik het eeuwige leven beërven?
[18:19] Maar Jezus zeide tot hem: Wat noemt gij Mij goed? niemand is goed dan de eenige God!
[18:20] De geboden kent gij: Gij zult geen overspel doen! gij zult niet doodslaan! gij zult niet stelen! gij zult geen valsch getuigenis geven! eer uw vader en moeder!
[18:21] En hij zeide: Dit alles heb ik onderhouden van mijn jeugd af!
[18:22] Jezus nu dit hoorende zeide tot hem: Nog één ding ontbreekt u! verkoop al wat gij hebt en deel het uit onder de armen, en gij zult een schat hebben in de hemelen, en kom, volg Mij na!
[18:23] Als hij nu dit hoorde, werd hij zeer bedroefd, want hij was zeer rijk.
[18:24] Jezus dan, ziende dat hij zeer bedroefd was geworden, zeide: Hoe bezwaarlijk zullen zij die goederen bezitten, in het koninkrijk Gods ingaan!
[18:25] Want het is lichter dat een kameel door het oog van een naald ga, dan dat een rijke het koninkrijk Gods ingaat.
[18:26] Toen zeiden zij, die dit gehoord hadden: Wie kan dan behouden worden?
[18:27] En Hij zeide: Wat onmogelijk is bij menschen, is bij God mogelijk!
[18:28] En Petrus zeide: Zie, wij hebben alles verlaten en zijn U gevolgd!
[18:29] En Hij zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, Ik zeg ulieden: Er is niemand die verlaten heeft huis, of ouders, of broeders, of vrouw, of kinderen, ter wille van het koninkrijk Gods,
[18:30] die het niet veelvuldig zal weder ontvangen in dezen tijd, en in de toekomende eeuw het eeuwige leven. 
[18:31]  En Jezus nam de twaalven tot zich en zeide tot hen: Ziet, wij gaan op naar Jerusalem en alles wat door de profeten geschreven is zal aan den Zoon des menschen volbracht worden.
[18:32] Want Hij zal aan de heidenen worden overgeleverd en Hij zal bespot, mishandeld en bespogen worden,
[18:33] en nadat zij Hem gegeeseld hebben, zullen zij Hem dooden, en op den derden dag zal Hij verrijzen.
[18:34] Doch zij verstonden niets hiervan, en dit woord was voor hen verborgen, en zij begrepen niet wat er gezegd werd. 
[18:35]  En het geschiedde, toen Hij dicht bij Jericho kwam, dat er een blinde bij den weg zat te bedelen.
[18:36] Toen deze nu de schare hoorde voorbijgaan, vroeg hij wat dit zijn mocht.
[18:37] En zij vertelden hem dat Jezus de Nazarener voorbijging.
[18:38] En hij riep, zeggende: Jezus, Zoon van David, ontferm U mijner!
[18:39] Zij dan die vooraan gingen bestraften hem, opdat hij zwijgen zou; maar hij riep des te meer: Zoon van David, ontferm U mijner!
[18:40] En Jezus bleef staan en gebood dat mem hem tot Hem brengen zou. En toen hij nabij gekomen was vroeg Hij hem:
[18:41] Wat wilt gij dat Ik u doen zal? En hij zeide: Heere, dat ik ziende mag worden!
[18:42] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Word ziende! uw geloof heeft u behouden.
[18:43] En terstond werd hij ziende en volgde Hem, God de glorie gevende. En al het volk, dat ziende, loofde God.  
[19:1] En Jezus kwam te Jericho en trok er door.
[19:2] En ziet, daar was een man, Zacheüs genaamd, en hij was een oppertollenaar en was rijk.
[19:3] En hij zocht Jezus te zien, wie Hij was, en kon niet vanwege de schare; want hij was klein van persoon.
[19:4] Hij liep dan vooruit en klom op een wilden vijgeboom om Hem te zien, want Hij zou daar langs komen.
[19:5] Toen Jezus nu bij die plaats kwam, zag Hij op en zeide tot hem: Zacheüs, spoed u om af te komen, want Ik moet vandaag in uw huis blijven!
[19:6] En hij kwam haastig af en ontving Hem met blijdschap.
[19:7] En allen die het zagen murmureerden en zeiden: Bij een zondigen man is Hij binnengegaan om te herbergen!
[19:8] Maar Zacheüs stond en zeide tot den Heere: Zie, de helft mijner goederen, Heere, geef ik aan de armen, en als ik iemand iets te veel heb afgenomen, dan geef ik het vierdubbel terug.
[19:9] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Heden is dezen huize verlossing geschied, omdat ook deze een zoon van Abraham is.
[19:10] Want de Zoon des menschen is gekomen om het verlorene te zoeken en te behouden! 
[19:11]  Terwijl zij nu dit hoorden voegde Hij er nog een gelijkenis bij, omdat Hij nabij Jerusalem was en omdat zij meenden dat het koninkrijk Gods terstond zou openbaar worden.
[19:12] Hij zeide dan: Zeker mensch van voorname geboorte reisde naar een vergelegen land om voor zich zelven een koninkrijk te verkrijgen en dan terug te keeren.
[19:13] En hij riep zijn tien dienstknechten en gaf hun tien ponden, en zeide tot hen: Drijf daar koophandel mede totdat ik terugkom!
[19:14] Maar zijn burgers haatten hem en zonden hem gezanten achterna, zeggende: Wij willen niet dat deze koning over ons zij!
[19:15] En toen hij teruggekomen was, nadat hij het koninkrijk verkregen had, liet hij die dienstknechten tot zich roepen aan wie hij het geld gegeven had, opdat hij weten zou welke zaken elk gedaan had.
[19:16] De eerste dan kwam en zeide: Heer, uw pond heeft er tien ponden bij gewonnen!
[19:17] En hij zeide tot hem: Wel gedaan! gij goede dienstknecht! omdat gij getrouw zijt geweest in het geringste, zult gij over tien steden macht hebben!
[19:18] En de tweede kwam en zeide: Uw pond, heer, heeft vijf ponden opgebracht!
[19:19] En hij zeide ook tot dezen: En gij, wees over vijf steden!
[19:20] En de andere kwam, zeggende: Heer, zie hier uw pond dat ik heb bewaard in een doek.
[19:21] Want ik vreesde u, omdat gij een gestreng mensch zijt; gij neemt weg wat gij niet gelegd hebt, en maait wat gij niet gezaaid hebt.
[19:22] En de heer zeide tot hem: Uit uw mond zal ik u oordeelen, gij booze dienstknecht! gij wist dat ik een gestreng mensch ben, wegnemende wat ik niet gelegd, en maaiende wat ik niet gezaaid heb?
[19:23] Waarom hebt gij dan mijn geld niet aan de wisselbank gegeven? dan zou ik, als ik kwam, het met winst hebben opgeëischt.
[19:24] En tot hen die daarbij stonden, zeide hij: Neemt het pond van hem af en geeft het aan hem die de tien ponden heeft!
[19:25] En zij zeiden tot hem: Heer, hij heeft al tien ponden!
[19:26] Ik zeg ulieden dat aan een ieder die heeft, zal gegeven worden, maar van hem die niet heeft, zal zelfs hetgeen hij heeft, ontnomen worden.
[19:27] Maar deze mijn vijanden, die niet hebben gewild dat ik over hen koning zou zijn, brengt ze hier en slaat ze dood voor mijn oogen.
[19:28] En toen Hij dit gezegd had trok Jezus vooruit, den weg op naar Jerusalem. 
[19:29]  En toen Jezus dicht bij Bethfage en Bethanië. gekomen was, aan den berg, die de Berg der Olijven wordt genoemd, zond Hij twee van zijn discipelen en zeide:
[19:30] Gaat naar het dorp daar vóór u, en als gij daar inkomt zult gij een veulen vastgebonden vinden, waarop nooit eenig mensch gezeten heeft; maakt dat los en brengt het hier.
[19:31] En als iemand u vraagt: Waarom maakt gij het los? dan moet gij zeggen: De Heere heeft het van noode!
[19:32] De afgezondenen nu gingen heen en vonden het zooals Hij hun gezegd had.
[19:33] Toen zij nu het veulen losmaakten zeiden de eigenaars tot hen: Waarom maakt gij het veulen los?
[19:34] Zij dan zeiden: De Heere heeft het van noode!
[19:35] En zij brachten het tot Jezus; en toen zij hun kleederen op het veulen geworpen hadden, deden zij Jezus opstijgen.
[19:36] En terwijl Hij voorttrok spreidden zij hun kleederen op den weg.
[19:37] Toen Hij nu al dicht bij de helling van den Berg der Olijven kwam, begon de geheele schare der discipelen verheugd en met luider stemme God te prijzen, wegens al de krachten die zij gezien hadden,
[19:38] en zij zeiden: Gezegend de Koning, die komt in den Naam des Heeren! In den hemel vrede! en glorie in het allerhoogste!
[19:39] En sommigen der fariseërs uit de schare zeiden tot Hem: Meester, bestraf uw discipelen!
[19:40] En Hij antwoordde en zeide: Ik zeg ulieden dat, wanneer dezen zwijgen, de steenen zullen roepen! 
[19:41]  En toen Hij nabij was gekomen, zag Hij de stad en weende over haar, zeggende:
[19:42] Och, of ook gij erkendet, zelfs nog in dezen uwen dag, wat tot uw vrede dient! Maar nu is het voor uw oogen verborgen!
[19:43] Want er zullen dagen over u komen, dat uw vijanden een verschansing rond u zullen opwerpen, en zij zullen u omringen en u van alle kanten benauwen; 
[19:44] en zij zullen u en uw kinderen in u, tot den grond toe verderven, en geen steen in u op den anderen laten, omdat gij niet erkend hebt den tijd waarin gij bezocht zijt! 
[19:45]  En Hij ging in den tempel en begon de koopers en verkoopers uit te drijven, en zeide tot hen:
[19:46] Er is geschreven: Mijn huis zal een huis des gebeds zijn! Maar gij hebt dat gemaakt tot een roovershol.
[19:47] En Hij leerde dagelijks in den tempel; maar de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden zochten Hem te dooden, zoowel als de voornaamsten des volks,
[19:48] en zij vonden niet, wat te doen; want het geheele volk hing Hem aan als het Hem hoorde.  
[20:1] En in een van die dagen geschiedde het, toen Jezus het volk in den tempel onderwees en het Evangelie verkondigde, dat de priesters en de schriftgeleerden met de oudsten Hem overvielen,
[20:2] en tot Hem spraken, zeggende: Zeg ons door welke macht doet Gij deze dingen, of wie is het, die U deze macht gegeven heeft?
[20:3] Hij nu antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Ik zal u ook iets vragen, en zegt Mij dat:
[20:4] De doop van Johannes, was die uit den hemel of uit de menschen?
[20:5] Zij nu overleiden bij zich zelven, zeggende: Als wij zeggen: Uit den hemel, — dan zal Hij zeggen: Waarom hebt gij hem dan niet geloofd?
[20:6] En als wij zeggen: Uit de menschen, — dan zal het geheele volk ons steenigen; want zij houden het voor zeker dat Johannes een profeet was.
[20:7] En zij antwoordden dat zij niet wisten vanwaar.
[20:8] Toen zeide Jezus tot hen: Dan zeg Ik u ook niet door welke macht Ik deze dingen doe. 
[20:9]  Toen begon Hij tot het volk deze gelijkenis te zeggen: Een mensch plantte een wijngaard en verhuurde dien aan landlieden en ging voor een langen tijd buitenslands.
[20:10] En toen het tijd was zond hij een dienstknecht naar de landlieden, opdat zij hem van de vrucht des wijngaards geven zouden; maar de landlieden mishandelden dezen en zonden hem ledig weg.
[20:11] En nogmaals zond hij een anderen dienstknecht, maar ook dezen mishandelden en smaadden zij, en zonden zij ledig weg.
[20:12] En hij zond wederom een derden, maar ook dezen verwondden zij en wierpen zij uit.
[20:13] Toen zeide de eigenaar van den wijngaard: Wat zal ik doen? ik zal mijn geliefden zoon zenden; misschien, als zij dezen zien, zullen ze ontzag voor hem hebben.
[20:14] Maar toen de landlieden hem zagen, overleiden zij onder elkander, zeggende: Deze is de erfgenaam; laat ons hem dooden, opdat de erfenis de onze worde!
[20:15] En zij wierpen hem buiten den wijngaard en doodden hem. Wat zal dan de eigenaar van den wijngaard hun doen?
[20:16] Hij zal komen en die landlieden ombrengen, en zal den wijngaard aan anderen geven. — En dit hoorende, zeiden zij: Dat zij verre!
[20:17] Maar Hij zag hen aan en zeide: Wat is het dan dat geschreven is: De steen dien de bouwlieden verworpen hebben, die is geworden tot hoeksteen?
[20:18] Ieder die op dezen steen valt, zal verpletterd worden, en op wien hij valt, dien zal hij vermorzelen.
[20:19] En de schriftgeleerden en de overpriesters zochten in die zelfde ure aan Hem de handen te slaan, doch zij vreesden het volk; want zij verstonden dat hij deze gelijkenis op hen had gesproken. 
[20:20]  En zij bespiedden Hem, en zonden eenigen uit, die door hen opgestookt waren, die, veinsden dat zij rechtvaardigen waren, opdat zij Hem op een woord mochten vatten, om zoodoende Hem over te leveren aan de overheid en aan de macht van den stadhouder.
[20:21] En zij vroegen Hem, zeggende: Meester, wij weten dat Gij oprecht spreekt en leert, en dat Gij den persoon niet aanneemt, maar den weg Gods in waarheid leert.
[20:22] Is het ons geoorloofd den keizer schatting te geven of niet?
[20:23] Maar Hij bemerkte hun listigheid en zeide tot hen: Wat verzoekt gij Mij?
[20:24] toont Mij een penning! — Wiens beeld en opschrift draagt hij? — Zij zeiden: Van den keizer!
[20:25] En Hij zeide tot hen: Geeft dan aan den keizer wat den keizer, en aan God wat Gode toekomt.
[20:26] En zij konden Hem voor het volk in zijn woord niet vatten; en zij verwonderden zich over zijn antwoord, en zwegen stil. 
[20:27]  Sommigen nu van de sadduceërs, die ontkennen dat er een verrijzenis is, kwamen tot Hem en vroegen Hem, zeggende:
[20:28] Meester, Mozes heeft ons voorgeschreven, dat, wanneer iemands broeder, die een vrouw heeft, zonder kinderen sterft, dat dan zijn broeder de vrouw moet nemen, en zijn broeder nakomelingschap verwekken.
[20:29] Er waren nu zeven broeders; en de eerste nam een vrouw en stierf zonder kinderen.
[20:30] En de tweede nam die vrouw, en stierf ook zonder kinderen.
[20:31] En de derde nam haar, en desgelijks lieten ook al de zeven geen kinderen na, en stierven.
[20:32] Ten laatste stierf ook de vrouw.
[20:33] Bij de verrijzenis dan, van wien wordt zij dan de vrouw? want die zeven hebben haar tot vrouw gehad!
[20:34] En Jezus zeide tot hen: De kinderen van deze eeuw trouwen en worden ten huwelijk gegeven; 
[20:35] maar zij die waardig geacht zullen zijn om die eeuw te verwerven en de verrijzenis uit de dooden, zullen niet trouwen of ten huwelijk gegeven worden; 
[20:36] want zij kunnen ook niet meer sterven, omdat zij aan engelen gelijk zijn; en zij zijn kinderen Gods, dewijl zij kinderen der verrijzenis zijn.
[20:37] Maar dat de dooden verrijzen heeft ook Mozes aangetoond bij den braambosch, als hij den Heere noemt: Den God van Abraham, en den God van Isaäk, en den God van Jakob.
[20:38] Hij is toch geen God van dooden, maar van levenden, want voor Hem leven zij allen.
[20:39] Sommigen nu van de schriftgeleerden antwoordden en zeiden: Meester, Gij hebt goed gesproken!
[20:40] Want zij durfden Hem niets meer vragen. 
[20:41]  En Hij zeide tot hen: Hoe zegt men dat de Christus de zoon is van David?
[20:42] David zelf toch zegt in het Boek der Psalmen: De Heere heeft tot mijn Heere gesproken: Zit aan mijn rechterhand,
[20:43] totdat Ik uw vijanden gezet heb tot een voetbank uwer voeten?
[20:44] David noemt Hem dus Heere, en hoe is Hij dan zijn Zoon? 
[20:45]  Ten aanhoore nu van het geheele volk zeide Hij tot de discipelen:
[20:46] Wacht u voor de schriftgeleerden, die gaarne in lange kleederen wandelen, en zich gaarne laten groeten op de markten, en vooraanzitten in de synagogen, en op de eerste plaatsen aanliggen bij de maaltijden,
[20:47] die de huizen der weduwen opeten en voor den schijn lange gebeden doen; dezen zullen een zwaarder oordeel ontvangen.  
[21:1] En als Hij opkeek zag Jezus de rijken hun giften in de schatkist werpen.
[21:2] En Hij zag ook een behoeftige weduwe daar twee penningskens inwerpen.
[21:3] En Hij zeide: Waarlijk, Ik zeg u, dat deze arme weduwe meer dan allen daarin wierp; 
[21:4] want deze allen hebben van hun overvloed bij de gaven Gods geworpen, maar zij heeft van haar armoede, al haar leeftocht dien zij had, daarin geworpen! 
[21:5]  En toen sommigen tot Hem spraken van den tempel, dat die met schoone steenen en kostbare giften versierd was, zeide Hij:
[21:6] Wat gij daar ziet— er zullen dagen komen waarin geen steen op den andere zal gelaten worden, die niet zal afgebroken worden!
[21:7] En zij vroegen Hem, zeggende: Meester, wanneer zal dat dan zijn? en wat is het teeken wanneer dit geschieden zal?
[21:8] En Hij zeide: Ziet toe, dat gij u niet laat misleiden! Velen toch zullen komen onder mijn Naam, zeggende: Ik ben het, en de tijd is nabij! — Maar gaat hen niet achterna!
[21:9] Als gij nu zult hooren van oorlogen en oorlogsgeruchten, verschrikt dan niet! want dit moet eerst geschieden, maar niet terstond is het einde daar.
[21:10] Toen zeide Hij tot hen: Het eene volk zal opstaan tegen het andere, en het eene koninkrijk tegen het andere,
[21:11] en er zullen allerwege groote aardbevingen zijn, en hongersnooden, en pest; en vreeselijke dingen en groote teekenen zullen van den hemel geschieden.
[21:12] Maar vóór dit alles zal men aan u de handen slaan en u vervolgen, daar men u zal overleveren aan de synagogen en gevangenissen, en u zal stellen voor koningen en stadhouders om mijns Naams wil.
[21:13] En dit zal u overkomen tot een getuigenis aangaande Mij.
[21:14] Neemt u dan voor in uw harten om vooraf niet te overdenken hoe gij u zult verdedigen,
[21:15] want Ik zal u mond en wijsheid geven, die al uw tegenstanders niet zullen kunnen wederspreken of wederstaan.
[21:16] Gij zult worden overgeleverd zelfs door ouders, en broeders, en bloedverwanten, en vrienden, en zij zullen er uit u dooden,
[21:17] en gij zult door allen gehaat worden om mijns Naams wil.
[21:18] Doch geen haar van uw hoofd zelfs zal verloren gaan!
[21:19] Door uw volharding zult gij uw leven gewinnen.
[21:20] Wanneer gij nu zien zult dat Jerusalem door legers omringd wordt, weet dan dat zijn verwoesting nabij is.
[21:21] Die in Judea zijn, moeten dan vluchten naar de bergen, en die binnen Jerusalem zijn, moeten er uitgaan, en die op de akkers zijn, moeten er niet binnenkomen.
[21:22] Want dat zijn dagen van wrake, opdat vervuld worde al wat er geschreven is.
[21:23] Doch wee den zwangeren en den zogenden in die dagen, want er zal groote nood zijn op aarde, en toorn over dit volk!
[21:24] En zij zullen vallen door het scherpe zwaard en in ballingschap weggevoerd worden onder al de volken, en Jerusalem zal door de volken vertrapt worden, totdat de tijden der volken vol zullen zijn.
[21:25] En er zullen teekenen zijn in de zon, en in de maan, en in de sterren, en op aarde benauwdheid der volken in radeloosheid, als het bruisen der zee en golven,
[21:26] terwijl den menschen het harte wegzinkt van vreeze en afwachting der dingen die over de wereld gaan komen, want de krachten der hemelen zullen bewogen worden.
[21:27] En alsdan zullen zij den Zoon des menschen zien komen in een wolk, met veel kracht en glorie.
[21:28] Als nu deze dingen beginnen te geschieden, zoo ziet omhoog en heft uw hoofden op, omdat uw verlossing nabij is!
[21:29] En Hij zeide een gelijkenis tot hen: Ziet den vijgeboom en al de boomen!
[21:30] Als zij nu uitbotten en gij ziet het, dan weet gij van u zelven dat de zomer al nabij is.
[21:31] Alzoo ook gij, wanneer gij deze dingen ziet geschieden, dan weet gij dat het koninkrijk Gods nabij is.
[21:32] Voorwaar Ik zeg u dat deze natie niet zal voorbijgaan, totdat het alles is geschied!
[21:33] De hemel en de aarde zullen voorbijgaan, maar mijn woorden zullen niet voorbijgaan. 
[21:34]  Maar wacht u, dat niet misschien uw harten bezwaard worden door brasserij en dronkenschap en de zorgen des levens, en dat die dag u niet onverwacht overvalle, als een strik!
[21:35] Want hij zal komen over allen die op den geheelen aardbodem woonachtig zijn!
[21:36] Waakt dan ten allen tijde, en bidt dat gij moogt waardig geacht worden om te ontvlieden aan al die dingen die zullen geschieden, en om te staan voor den Zoon des menschen. 
[21:37]  Overdag nu was Jezus in den tempel en leerde, maar des nachts ging Hij naar buiten en vernachtte op den berg die de Berg der Olijven genoemd wordt.
[21:38] En al het volk kwam dés morgens tot Hem in den tempel om Hem te hooren.  
[22:1] En het feest der ongedeesemde brooden, het Pascha genaamd, naderde.
[22:2] en de overpriesters en schriftgeleerden zochten hoe zij Hem zouden ombrengen; want zij vreesden het volk.
[22:3] De Satan nu voer in Judas, Iskariot genoemd, die een der twaalven was.
[22:4] En hij ging heen en besprak met de overpriesters en hoofdmannen hoe hij Hem aan hen zou overleveren.
[22:5] En zij waren verblijd en kwamen overeen wegens het geld dat zij hem zouden geven.
[22:6] En hij stemde toe, en zocht een geschikte gelegenheid om Hem aan hen over te leveren zonder volksoploop. 
[22:7]  De dag nu der ongedeesemde brooden kwam, waarop het Pascha moest geslacht worden.
[22:8] En Hij zond Petrus en Johannes uit en zeide: Gaat heen, bereidt ons het Pascha, opdat wij het eten.
[22:9] En zij zeiden tot Hem: Waar wilt Gij dat wij het bereiden?
[22:10] En Hij zeide tot hen: Ziet, als gij de stad inkomt zal u een mensch ontmoeten die een kruik met water draagt; volgt hem naar het huis waar hij ingaat.
[22:11] En zegt tot den huisheer van dat huis: De Meester zegt u: Waar is de zaal, waar Ik het Pascha zal eten met mijn discipelen?
[22:12] En hij zal u een groote gereed gemaakte bovenzaal wijzen; daar moet gij het bereiden.
[22:13] Zij nu gingen heen en vonden het zooals Hij hun gezegd had, en zij bereidden het Pascha. 
[22:14]  En toen de ure gekomen was lag Hij aan, en de twaalf apostelen met Hem.
[22:15] En Hij zeide tot hen: Ik heb zeer begeerd dit Pascha met u te eten vóórdat Ik lijde; 
[22:16] want Ik zeg ulieden dat Ik het niet meer eten zal, totdat het vervuld is in het koninkrijk Gods.
[22:17] En als Hij een beker genomen en gedankt had zeide Hij: Neemt dezen en deelt hem onder ulieden!
[22:18] Want Ik zeg u, dat Ik van nu af niet meer drinken zal van de vrucht des wijnstoks totdat het koninkrijk Gods zal gekomen zijn.
[22:19] En Hij nam brood, en gedankt hebbende brak Hij het en gaf het hun, zeggende: Dat is mijn lichaam, dat voor u gegeven wordt; doet dit tot mijn gedachtenis!
[22:20] Evenzoo gaf Hij den beker, na den maaltijd, en zeide: Deze beker is het nieuwe verbond in mijn bloed, dat voor u vergoten wordt!
[22:21] Doch ziet, de hand van mijn verrader is met Mij aan de tafel!
[22:22] De Zoon des menschen gaat toch wel heen, gelijk bepaald is; maar wee dien mensch, door wien Hij wordt verraden!
[22:23] En zij begonnen onder malkander te onderzoeken, wie van hen het toch wel mocht zijn die dat doen zou? 
[22:24]  Er ontstond ook een strijd onder hen, wie van hen moest geacht worden de meeste te zijn.
[22:25] En Hij zeide tot hen: De koningen der volken heerschen over hen, en die over hen macht hebben worden weldoeners genoemd.
[22:26] Doch gij niet alzoo; maar de meeste onder u worde als de minste, en de voorganger als de dienaar; 
[22:27] want wie is meer, die aanligt of die dient? — immers dié aanligt? Ik nu ben in uw midden als een dienaar.
[22:28] Maar gij zijt het die bij Mij zijt gebleven in mijn bekoringen.
[22:29] En Ik beschik ulieden een koninkrijk, gelijk mijn Vader Mij beschikt heeft,
[22:30] opdat gij eet en drinkt aan mijn tafel in mijn koninkrijk; en gij zult zitten op troonen, oordeelende de twaalf stammen van Israël. 
[22:31]  En de Heere zeide: Simon, Simon! zie, de Satan heeft ulieden voor zich begeerd, om u te ziften als de tarwe!
[22:32] Doch Ik heb voor u gebeden opdat uw geloof niet bezwijke; en gij, eens bekeerd zijnde, versterk dan uw broeders.
[22:33] En hij zeide tot Hem: Heere, met U ben ik bereid zelfs de gevangenis en den dood in te gaan!
[22:34] Maar Hij zeide: Ik zeg u, Petrus, de haan zal heden niet kraaien, vóórdat gij driemaal geloochend hebt, dat gij Mij kent!
[22:35] En Hij zeide tot hen: Toen Ik ulieden uitzond zonder geldbeurs, of reiszak, of schoenen, heeft u wel iets ontbroken? Zij zeidén: Niets!
[22:36] Toen zeide Hij tot hen: Maar nu, wie een geldbeurs heeft, neme die, alsmede een reiszak; en die er geen heeft, die verkoope zijn kleed en koope een zwaard!
[22:37] Want Ik zeg ulieden dat hetgeen geschreven is, aan Mij moet volbracht worden, dit namelijk: En Hij is met de booswichten gerekend! want ook dit, aangaande Mij, wordt vervuld.
[22:38] Zij nu zeiden: Heere, ziehier twee zwaarden! En Hij zeide tot hen: ’t Is wel! 
[22:39]  En Hij ging uit en begaf zich, volgens zijn gewoonte, naar den Berg der Olijven; en Hem volgden ook de discipelen.
[22:40] En toen Hij aan die plaats gekomen was, zeide Hij tot hen: Bidt, dat gij niet in bekoring komt.
[22:41] En Hij verwijderde zich van hen, omtrent een steenworp ver, en knielde neder, en bad, zeggende:
[22:42] Vader! och, of Gij dezen beker van Mij wildet wegnemen! doch niet mijn wil, maar de uwe geschiede!
[22:43] En Hem verscheen een engel van den hemel, die Hem versterkte.
[22:44] En in hevige benauwdheid zijnde, bad Hij te vuriger; en zijn zweet werd als dikke bloeddroppels die op den grond vielen.
[22:45] En van het gebed opgestaan zijnde, kwam Hij tot de discipelen en vond hen slapende van droefheid,
[22:46] en Hij zeide tot hen: Wat slaapt gij? Staat op, en bidt, opdat gij niet in bekoring komt. 
[22:47]  Terwijl Hij nog sprak, ziet daar een schare, en de genoemde Judas, één van de twaalven, ging vóór hen uit, en naderde tot Jezus om Hem te kussen.
[22:48] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Judas, ‘t is met een kus dat gij den Zoon des menschen verraadt?
[22:49] Toen nu zij, die bij Hem waren, zagen wat er ging gebeuren, zeiden zij tot Hem: Heere, zullen wij met het zwaard er op inslaan?
[22:50] En één uit hen sloeg des hoogepriesters dienstknecht, en hieuw hem het rechteroor af.
[22:51] Doch Jezus antwoordde en zeide: Tot zoover! En Hij raakte zijn oor aan en genas hem.
[22:52] Jezus zeide dan tot de overpriesters, en de hoofdmannen des tempels, en de oudsten, die op Hem afgekomen waren: Als tegen een roover zijt gij uitgegaan met zwaarden en stokken?
[22:53] Toen Ik dagelijks met u in den tempel was, hebt gij de handen niet tegen Mij uitgestoken! Maar dit is uw ure, en de macht der duisternis! 
[22:54]  Zij namen Hem dan gevangen en voerden Hem weg, en brachten Hem naar het huis van den hoogepriester. En Petrus volgde van verre.
[22:55] En toen zij vuur ontstoken hadden in het midden van de voorplaats, en samen nederzaten, zat Petrus midden onder hen.
[22:56] En een zekere dienstmaagd, die bij het licht hem zag zitten en hem goed aankeek, zeide: Ook deze was met Hem!
[22:57] Doch hij verloochende Hem en zeide: Ik ken Hem niet, vrouw!
[22:58] En kort daarna zag hem een ander en zeide: Ook gij zijt een van die! Maar Petrus zeide: Mensch, ik ben niet!
[22:59] En na verloop van omtrent één ure verzekerde een ander en zeide: Zeker, ook deze was met Hem, want hij is ook een Galileër!
[22:60] Maar Petrus zeide: Mensch, ik weet niet wat gij zegt! En terstond, als hij nog sprak, kraaide de haan.
[22:61] En de Heere keerde zich om en zag Petrus aan. En Petrus werd indachtig aan het woord des Heeren, hoe Hij gezegd had: Heden, nog vóórdat de haan zal kraaien, zult gij Mij driemaal verloochenen!
[22:62] En Petrus ging naar buiten en weende bitter. 
[22:63]  En de mannen die Jezus vasthielden, bespotten en sloegen Hem.
[22:64] En zij blinddoekten Hem, en sloegen Hem in het gezicht, en vroegen Hem zeggende: Profeteer, wie is het die U geslagen heeft?
[22:65] En veel andere dingen zeiden zij, lasterend, tegen Hem. 
[22:66]  En toen het dag was geworden, vergaderde de Raad des volks, de overpriesters en schriftgeleerden, en zij voerden Hem naar hun vergadering, en zeiden: Zoo Gij de Christus zijt, zeg het ons!
[22:67] En Hij zeide tot hen: Als Ik het u zou zeggen, zoudt gij het toch niet gelooven,
[22:68] en zoo Ik u iets vroeg, gij zoudt toch niet antwoorden of Mij loslaten; 
[22:69] van nu af zal de Zoon des menschen gezeten zijn aan de rechterhand der kracht Gods!
[22:70] En allen zeiden: Gij zijt dan de Zoon van God? En Hij zeide tot hen: Gij zegt het, want Ik ben het!
[22:71] Zij nu zeiden: Wat hebben wij nog getuigenis van noode? want wij zelven hebben het uit zijn mond gehoord!  
[23:1] En de gansche menigte van hen stond op en voerde Jezus naar Pilatus.
[23:2] Zij begonnen Hem dan te beschuldigen, zeggende: Wij hebben bevonden dat deze ons volk verleidt en verbiedt aan den keizer schatting te geven, en dat Hij zegt dat Hij de Christus, de koning is!
[23:3] Pilatus vroeg Hem dan en zeide: Gij zijt de koning der Joden? Hij antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Gij zegt het.
[23:4] Pilatus dan zeide tot de overpriesters en de benden: Ik vind geen schuld bij dezen mensch.
[23:5] Doch zij hielden te sterker aan en zeiden: Hij zet het volk op, leerende door geheel Judea, van Galilea af begonnen zijnde, tot hier toe!
[23:6] Toen Pilatus nu van Galilea hoorde vroeg hij of deze mensch een Galileër was.
[23:7] En vernemende dat Hij uit het gebied van Herodes was, zond hij Hem naar Herodes, die zelf in die dagen te Jerusalem was.
[23:8] Toen nu Herodes Jezus zag werd hij zeer verblijd, want reeds langen tijd was hij begeerig Hem te zien, om hetgeen hij van Hem hoorde, en hij hoopte eenig teeken van Hem te zien doen.
[23:9] En hij ondervroeg Hem met veel woorden, maar Jezus antwoordde hem niets.
[23:10] En de overpriesters en de schriftgeleerden stonden daar en beschuldigden Hem heftig.
[23:11] En Herodes met zijn soldaten smaadden en bespotten Hem; en, na Hem een blinkend kleed aangedaan te hebben, zond hij Hem terug naar Pilatus.
[23:12] Herodes nu en Pilatus werden op dien dag vrienden met malkander; want te voren waren zij met malkander in vijandschap. 
[23:13]  Pilatus dan riep de overpriesters, en de oversten, en het volk bijeen en zeide tot hen:
[23:14] Gij hebt dezen mensch tot mij gebracht als een volksverleider, en ziet, ik heb Hem in uw tegenwoordigheid verhoord en ik heb dezen mensch niet schuldig bevonden aan iets waarvan gij Hem beschuldigt;
[23:15] maar ook Herodes niet, want ik heb u tot hem gezonden, en ziet, er is niets door Hem gedaan dat den dood verdient;
[23:16] ik zal Hem dan kastijden en loslaten.
[23:17] En hij moest hun op het feest één loslaten.
[23:18] Doch de geheele menigte schreeuwde te zamen, zeggende: Weg met dezen! laat ons Barabbas los!
[23:19] Deze was om zeker oproer, dat in de stad had plaats gehad, en om een moord, in de gevangenis geworpen.
[23:20] Wederom riep Pilatus hun toe, willende Jezus loslaten,
[23:21] Maar zij riepen daar tegen in, zeggende: Kruisig, kruisig Hem!
[23:22] Voor de derde maal dan zeide hij tot hen: Welk kwaad heeft deze dan toch gedaan? ik heb geen schuld des doods in Hem gevonden! ik zal Hem dan kastijden en loslaten!
[23:23] Maar zij hielden aan en eischten met groot geschreeuw dat Hij zou gekruisigd worden; en hun geschreeuw, met dat der overpriesters, kreeg de overhand.
[23:24] En Pilatus besliste dat hun eisch geschieden zou,
[23:25] en hij liet dien los die om oproer en moord in de gevangenis was geworpen, welken zij eischten; maar Jezus gaf hij over aan hun wil. 
[23:26]  En toen zij Hem wegvoerden grepen zij zekeren Simon van Cyrene, die van den akker kwam, en leiden hem het kruis op om het achter Jezus te dragen.
[23:27] En Hem volgde een groote menigte van het volk en van vrouwen, die Hem beklaagden en beweenden.
[23:28] Maar Jezus keerde zich tot haar en zeide: O dochters van Jerusalem! weent niet over Mij, maar weent over u zelven en over uw kinderen; 
[23:29] want ziet, er komen dagen waarin men zal zeggen: Zalig de onvruchtbaren en de lichamen die niet gebaard, en de borsten die niet gezoogd hebben!
[23:30] Dan zal men beginnen te zeggen tot de bergen: Valt op ons! en tot de heuvelen: Bedekt ons!
[23:31] want indien zij dit doen aan het groene hout, wat moet dan aan het dorre geschieden?
[23:32] En er werden ook nog twee kwaaddoeners weggeleid om met Hem gedood te worden. 
[23:33]  En toen zij gekomen waren aan de plaats die de Schedelplaats genoemd wordt, kruisigden zij Hem aldaar, en dé kwaaddoeners, den een ter rechter– en den andere ter linkerhand.
[23:34] En Jezus zeide: Vader, vergeef het hun, want zij weten niet wat ze doen! En zijn kleederen verdeelende wierpen zij er het lot over.
[23:35] En het volk stond het aan te zien. De oversten nu beschimpten Hem, zeggende: Anderen heeft Hij verlost! dat Hij zich zelven verlosse, als Hij de Christus is, Gods uitverkorene!
[23:36] En ook de soldaten bespotten Hem, toen zij daarbij kwamen om Hem azijn te brengen,
[23:37] en zij zeiden: Zoo Gij de koning der Joden zijt, verlos U zelven!
[23:38] En er was ook een opschrift boven Hem geschreven, met grieksche, en romeinsche, en hebreeuwsche letters: De koning der Joden is deze. 
[23:39]  En een der gehangen kwaaddoeners lasterde Hem, zeggende: Zijt Gij de Christus niet? Verlos U zelven en ons!
[23:40] Maar de andere antwoordde en bestrafte hem, zeggende: Ook gij vreest God niet, daar gij toch in hetzelfde oordeel zijt?
[23:41] En wij wel naar recht, want wij ontvangen loon naar werken, maar deze heeft niets onbillijks gedaan!
[23:42] En hij zeide tot Jezus: Heere, gedenk mijner als Gij in uw koninkrijk gekomen zijt!
[23:43] En Jezus zeide tot hem: Voorwaar zeg Ik u, heden zult gij met Mij in het paradijs zijn! 
[23:44]  En het was omtrent de zesde ure en er werd duisternis over de geheele aarde tot de negende ure toe.
[23:45] En de zon werd verduisterd, en het voorhangsel des tempels scheurde door midden.
[23:46] En met een groote stem roepende, zeide Jezus: Vader, aan uw handen geef Ik mijn geest over! En als Hij dit gezegd had, gaf Hij den geest.
[23:47] De hoofdman nu, toen hij gezien had wat er geschied was, gaf God de glorie en zeide: Waarlijk, deze mensch was rechtvaardig!
[23:48] En al de scharen, die tot dit schouwspel samengekomen waren, toen zij gezien hadden wat er geschied was, keerden zij terug, slaande op hun borsten.
[23:49] En al zijn bekenden stonden van verre dit aan te zien, en ook de vrouwen die Hem van Galilea gevolgd waren. 
[23:50]  En ziet, een man met name Jozef, die raadsheer was, een goed en rechtvaardig man,
[23:51] — deze had niet ingestemd met hun raad en handeling— van Arimathea, een stad der Joden, die ook het koninkrijk Gods verwachtte,
[23:52] kwam tot Pilatus en verzocht om het lichaam van Jezus.
[23:53] En het afgenomen hebbende wond hij het in lijnwaad, en leide het in een uitgehouwen grafstede, waar nog nooit iemand in gelegen had.
[23:54] En het was de dag der voorbereiding, en de sabbat brak aan.
[23:55] En ook de vrouwen volgden, die met Hem uit Galilea gekomen waren, en bezagen de grafstede en hoe zijn lichaam gelegd was.
[23:56] En teruggekeerd zijnde, bereidden zij specerijen en balsem. En op den sabbat rustten zij volgens de wet.  
[24:1] Op den eersten dag nu der week, in den vroegen morgen, gingen de vrouwen naar het graf, dragende de specerijen die zij bereid hadden.
[24:2] En zij vonden den steen van het graf afgewenteld.
[24:3] En daarin gegaan zijnde, vonden zij het lichaam van den Heere Jezus niet.
[24:4] En het geschiedde, toen zij daarover in verlegenheid waren, ziet, twee mannen stonden bij haar in schitterende kleeding.
[24:5] En daar zij bevreesd werden en het aangezicht naar den grond sloegen, zeiden zij tot haar: Wat zoekt gij den levende bij de dooden?
[24:6] Hij is hier niet, maar Hij is verrezen; gedenkt hoe Hij tot u gesproken heeft als Hij nog in Galilea was,
[24:7] zeggende: De Zoon des menschen moet overgeleverd worden in de handen van zondige menschen, en gekruisigd worden, en op den derden dag verrijzen.
[24:8] En zij herinnerden zich zijn woorden.
[24:9] En zij keerden terug van het graf en boodschapten dit alles aan de elven en aan al de anderen.
[24:10] Het waren Maria Magdalena, en Johanna, en Maria, de moeder van Jakobus, en de anderen met haar, die dit tot de apostelen zeiden.
[24:11] En deze woorden schenen hun toe als zot geklap, en zij geloofden haar niet.
[24:12] Doch Petrus stond op en liep naar het graf; en hij bukte en zag de linnen doeken afzonderlijk liggen; en hij ging heen, zich verwonderende over hetgeen geschied was. 
[24:13]  En ziet, twee van hen waren dien zelfden dag op weg naar een dorp dat zestig stadiën van Jerusalem lag, met name Emmaüs,
[24:14] en zij bespraken met elkander al hetgeen er was voorgevallen.
[24:15] En terwijl zij samen spraken en redetwistten, geschiedde het dat Jezus zelf naderde en met hen ging.
[24:16] Doch hun oogen werden gehouden, dat zij Hem niet herkenden.
[24:17] Hij nu zeide tot hen: Wat voor reden zijn dit, die gij al wandelende met malkander wisselt? en waarom ziet gij zoo droevig?
[24:18] De een nu, wiens naam was Kleopas, antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Gij alleen zijt dan een vreemdeling in Jerusalem, en weet niet wat daar dezer dagen geschied is?
[24:19] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wat dan? Zij zeiden tot Hem: Wel, met Jezus den Nazarener, die een profeet was, machtig in werk en woord, voor God en het geheele volk,
[24:20] en hoe onze overpriesters en oversten Hem hebben overgeleverd tot de doodstraf en Hem gekruisigd hebben;
[24:21] wij nu hoopten dat Hij het was die Israël zou verlossen; doch bij dit alles is het vandaag de derde dag dat dit geschied is;
[24:22] maar ook eenige vrouwen uit ons hebben ons doen verschrikken, die vroeg in den morgen naar het graf zijn geweest,
[24:23] en daar zij zijn lichaam niet vonden, kwamen zij zeggen dat haar engelen waren verschenen, die zeiden dat Hij leeft;
[24:24] en sommigen van de onzen gingen heen naar het graf en vonden het juist zooals de vrouwen hadden gezegd; maar Hem zagen zij niet!
[24:25] En Jezus zeide tot hen: O, gij onverstandigen en tragen van hart, om te gelooven in alles wat de profeten gezegd hebben!
[24:26] Moest dan de Christus dit niet lijden en in zijn glorie ingaan?
[24:27] En Hij begon van Mozes en van al de profeten, en verklaarde hun in al de Schriften wat er van Hem geschreven stond.
[24:28] En zij kwamen bij het dorp waar zij naar toe gingen, en Hij deed alsof Hij verder zou gaan.
[24:29] En zij drongen Hem, zeggende: Blijf bij ons, want het is tegen den avond en de dag is al gedaald! En Hij ging binnen, om bij hen te blijven.
[24:30] En het geschiedde, toen Hij met hen aanlag, en het brood nam en dankte, en het brak om hun te geven,
[24:31] dat hun oogen werden geopend, en dat zij Hem herkenden; en Hij verdween uit hun midden.
[24:32] En zij zeiden tot elkander: Was ons hart niet brandende in ons, toen Hij op den weg tot ons sprak, en toen Hij voor ons de Schriften opende?
[24:33] En terzelfder ure opstaande, keerden zij terug naar Jerusalem, en zij vonden de elven en die met hen waren, samen vergaderd,
[24:34] die zeiden: Waarlijk, de Heere is verrezen, en aan Simon verschenen!
[24:35] En zij vertelden wat op den weg was geschied en hoe Hij hun was bekend geworden in het breken van het brood. 
[24:36]  Toen zij nu hierover spraken, stond Jezus zelf in hun midden en zeide tot hen: Vrede zij ulieden!
[24:37] En zij, bevreesd en verschrikt geworden zijnde, meenden een geest te zien.
[24:38] En Hij zeide tot hen: Wat zijt gij ontroerd, en waarom klimmen er bedenkingen op in uw hart?
[24:39] Ziet mijn handen en mijn voeten, want Ik ben het zelf; betast Mij en ziet; want een geest heeft geen vleesch en beenen, zooals gij Mij ziet hebben.
[24:40] En dit zeggende toonde Hij hun de handen en voeten.
[24:41] Toen zij nu van blijdschap nog niet geloofden en zich verwonderden, zeide Hij tot hen: Hebt gij hier iets te eten?
[24:42] Zij nu gaven Hem een stuk gebakken visch en van een honigraat.
[24:43] En Hij nam het en at het op voor hun oogen.
[24:44] En Hij zeide tot hen: Dit zijn mijn woorden, die Ik tot u sprak, toen Ik nog met ulieden was; want alles moet vervuld worden wat in de wet van Mozes en de Profeten en Psalmen van Mij geschreven is.
[24:45] Toen opende Hij hun verstand om de Schriften te verstaan,
[24:46] en zeide tot hen: Alzoo is er geschreven, dat de Christus zou lijden en uit de dooden verrijzen ten derden dage,
[24:47] en dat er in zijn Naam zou gepredikt worden boetvaardigheid tot vergiffenis van zonden aan al de volken, te beginnen van Jerusalem.
[24:48] Gij nu zijt getuigen van deze dingen.
[24:49] En ziet, Ik zend de belofte mijns Vaders op ulieden; maar blijft gij in de stad Jerusalem totdat gij zult bekleed zijn met kracht uit de hoogte! 
[24:50]  En Hij leidde hen naar buiten tot aan Bethanië, en hief zijn handen op en zegende hen.
[24:51] En terwijl Hij hen zegende, geschiedde het dat Hij van hen scheidde en naar den hemel werd opgenomen.
[24:52] En zij aanbaden Hem en keerden terug naar Jerusalem met groote vreugde.
[24:53] En zij waren altijd in den tempel, lovende en prijzende God. Amen.   

### John

[1:1] In den beginne was het Woord, en het Woord was bij God, en het Woord was God.
[1:2] Dit was in den beginne bij God.
[1:3] Alle dingen zijn door datzelve geworden, en zonder dat is niets geworden van al wat er geworden is.
[1:4] In hetzelve was Leven; en het Leven was het Licht der menschen.
[1:5] En het Licht schijnt in de duisternissen de duisternis heeft het niet begrepen. 
[1:6]  Er was een mensch, van God gezonden; zijn naam was Johannes.
[1:7] Deze kwam tot een getuigenis, om van het Licht te getuigen, opdat allen door hem zouden gelooven.
[1:8] Die was het Licht niet maar kwam om van het Licht te getuigen.
[1:9] Dat was het waarachtige Licht, dat, komende tot de wereld, iederen mensch verlicht.
[1:10] Hij was in de wereld, en de wereld is door Hem geworden, en de wereld heeft Hem niet gekend.
[1:11] Tot het zijne kwam Hij, en de zijnen hebben Hem niet aangenomen.
[1:12] Maar zoovelen als Hem hebben aangenomen, dien heeft Hij macht gegeven om kinderen Gods te worden, aan hen die in zijn Naam gelooven;
[1:13] die niet uit den bloede, noch uit den wille des vleesches, noch uit den wille des mans, maar uit God geboren zijn. 
[1:14]  En het Woord is vleesch geworden en heeft onder ons woning gemaakt; en wij hebben zijn glorie aanschouwd, een glorie als van den Eeniggeborene bij den Vader, vol van genade en waarheid.
[1:15] Johannes getuigde van Hem en heeft uitgeroepen, zeggende: Deze was het van wien ik zeide: Die achter mij komt, is vóór mij geworden, want Hij was eer dan ik.
[1:16] Want uit zijn volheid hebben wij allen ontvangen, en dat genade voor genade.
[1:17] Want de wet is door Mozes gegeven; de genade en de waarheid zijn door Jezus Christus geworden.
[1:18] Niemand heeft ooit God gezien; de eeniggeboren Zoon, die in den schoot des Vaders is, die heeft Hem bekend gemaakt. 
[1:19]  En dit is de getuigenis van Johannes, toen de Joden priesters en levieten van Jerusalem tot hem afzonden, om hem te vragen: Gij, wie zijt gij?
[1:20] En hij beleed en loochende niet, en beleed: Ik ben de Christus niet!
[1:21] En zij vroegen hem: Wat dan? zijt gij Elias? En hij zeide: Ik ben die niet! Zijt gij dan de profeet? En hij antwoordde: Neen!
[1:22] Zij zeiden dan tot hem: Wie zijt gij, opdat wij antwoord mogen geven aan degenen die ons gezonden hebben? Wat zegt gij van u zelven?
[1:23] En hij zeide: Ik ben de stem van een die roept in de woestijn: Maakt den weg des Heeren recht! zooals Jesaja de profeet heeft gezegd.
[1:24] En de afgezondenen waren uit de fariseërs.
[1:25] En zij vroegen hem en zeiden tot hem: Wat doopt gij dan, als gij de Christus niet zijt, noch Elias, noch de profeet?
[1:26] En Johannes antwoordde hun en zeide: Ik doop met water; doch midden onder u staat Hij dien gij niet kent.
[1:27] Deze is het die achter mij komt, die vóór mij geworden is, dien ik niet waardig ben zijn schoenriem los te maken!
[1:28] Deze dingen zijn geschied in Bethanië, aan de overzijde van den Jordaan, waar Johannes was doopende. 
[1:29]  Des anderen daags zag Johannes Jezus tot zich komen en zeide: Zie, het Lam Gods, dat de zonde der wereld wegdraagt!
[1:30] Deze is het van wien ik zeide: Achter mij komt een man, die vóór mij is geworden, want Hij was eer dan ik.
[1:31] En ik kende Hem niet, maar opdat Hij aan Israël zou bekend worden, daarom ben ik komen doopen met water.
[1:32] En Johannes getuigde en zeide: Ik heb den Geest uit den hemel zien nederdalen als een duive, en Hij bleef op Hem.
[1:33] En ik kende Hem niet, maar die mij gezonden heeft om met water te doopen, die had tot mij gezegd: Op wien gij den Geest zult zien nederdalen en blijven, die is het die doopt met den Heiligen Geest.
[1:34] En ik heb gezien en getuigd dat deze is de Zoon van God! 
[1:35]  Des anderen daags stond Johannes daar weder en twee van zijn discipelen.
[1:36] En hij zag Jezus daar wandelen en zeide: Zie, het Lam Gods!
[1:37] En die twee discipelen hoorden hem dat zeggen en zij volgden Jezus.
[1:38] En Jezus keerde zich om en ziende dat zij Hem volgden, zeide Hij tot hen: Wat zoekt gij? 
[1:39] Zij nu zeiden tot Hem: Rabbi, (dat wil zeggen: Meester) waar woont Gij?
[1:40] Hij zeide tot hen: Komt en ziet! Zij kwamen dan en zagen waar Hij woonde. En zij bleven dien dag bij Hem. Het was omtrent de tiende ure.
[1:41] Andreas, de broeder, van Simon Petrus, was een van de twee die het van Johannes gehoord hadden en Jezus gevolgd waren.
[1:42] Deze nu vond eerst zijn eigen broeder Simon en zeide tot hem: Wij hebben den Messias gevonden, (dat wil zeggen: Den Christus.)
[1:43] Hij leidde hem tot Jezus. En Jezus hem ziende zeide tot hem: Gij zijt Simon, de zoon van Jonas; gij zult genoemd worden Kefas, (dat wil zeggen: Petrus.)
[1:44] Des anderen daags wilde Jezus naar Galilea vertrekken, en vond Filippus; en Jezus zeide tot hem: Volg Mij!
[1:45] Filippus nu was van Bethsaïda, de stad van Andreas en Petrus.
[1:46] Filippus vond Nathanaël en zeide tot hem: Waar Mozes in de wet van geschreven heeft en de profeten, dien hebben wij gevonden, Jezus, Jozefs zoon van Nazaret.
[1:47] En Nathanaël zeide tot hem: Uit Nazaret kan er wat goeds komen? Filippus zeide tot hem: Kom en zie!
[1:48] Jezus zag Nathanaël tot zich komen en zeide van hem: Ziedaar waarlijk een Israëliet, in wien geen bedrog is!
[1:49] Nathanaël zeide tot Hem: Vanwaar kent Gij mij? Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Vóór dat Filippus u riep, toen gij onder den vijgeboom waart, zag Ik u.
[1:50] Nathanaël antwoordde Hem: Rabbi, Gij zijt de Zone Gods! Gij zijt de Koning Israëls!
[1:51] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Omdat Ik tot u gezegd heb dat Ik u onder den vijgeboom zag, daarom gelooft gij? — Grootere dingen dan deze zult gij zien!En Hij zeide tot hem: Voorwaar, voorwaar zeg Ik ulieden: Gij zult den hemel geopend zien en de engelen Gods opklimmende en nederdalende op den Zoon des menschen.  
[2:1] En op den derden dag was, er een bruiloft te Kana in Galilea, en de moeder van Jezus was aldaar.
[2:2] En ook Jezus was tot de bruiloft genoodigd met zijn discipelen.
[2:3] En toen er wijn te kort kwam zeide de moeder van Jezus tot Hem: Zij hebben geen wijn!
[2:4] Jezus zeide tot haar: Wat heb Ik met u te doen, vrouwe? mijn ure is nog niet gekomen.
[2:5] Zijn moeder zeide tot de dienaars: Al wat Hij tot u zegt, doet dat!
[2:6] Nu stonden daar zes steenen kruiken, tot reiniging naar het gebruik der Joden, die elk twee of drie maten inhielden.
[2:7] Jezus zeide tot hen: Vult de kruiken met water! En zij vulden ze tot boven toe.
[2:8] En Hij zeide tot hen: Schept nu en brengt het den hofmeester. En zij brachten het,
[2:9] Toen nu de hofmeester het water geproefd had, dat wijn was geworden, — en hij wist niet vanwaar die was, maar de dienaars die bat water geschept hadden wisten het— toen riep de hofmeester den bruidegom en zeide tot hem:
[2:10] Iedereen zet eerst den goeden wijn op, en den minderen als men goed gedronken heeft; maar gij hebt den goeden wijn tot nu toe bewaard!
[2:11] Dit eerste zijner mirakelen deed Jezus te Kana is Galilea, en Hij openbaarde zijn glorie; en zijn discipelen geloofden in Hem. 
[2:12]  Daarna ging Hij af naar Kapernaüm, Hij en zijn moeder, en zijn broeders, en zijn discipelen, en daar bleven zij niet vele dagen. 
[2:13]  En het Paaschfeest der Joden was nabij, en Jezus ging op naar Jerusalem.
[2:14] En Hij vond in den tempel de ossen– en schapen– en duivenverkoopers, en de wisselaars, die daar zaten.
[2:15] En Hij maakte een zweep van koorden en wierp allen uit den tempel, ook de schapen en de ossen, en het geld der wisselaars goot Hij uit en dé tafels wierp Hij omver.
[2:16] En tot de duivenverkoopers zeide Hij: Neemt die dingen vanhier weg! maakt mijns Vaders huis niet tot een huis van koopmanschap!
[2:17] En zijn discipelen werden indachtig dat er geschreven is: De ijver van uw huis verteert Mij!
[2:18] De Joden dan antwoordden en zeiden tot Hem: Welk mirakel toont Gij ons, dat Gij dit doet?
[2:19] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Breekt dezen tempel, en in drie dagen zal Ik hem opbouwen.
[2:20] De Joden dan zeiden: Zes en veertig jaar is er over dezen tempel gebouwd, en Gij zult dien in drie dagen opbouwen?
[2:21] Maar Hij sprak van den tempel zijns lichaams.
[2:22] Daarom, toen Hij uit de dooden was verrezen, werden zijn discipelen indachtig dat Hij dit gezegd had, en zij geloofden de Schrifture en het woord dat Jezus gesproken had. 
[2:23]  Terwijl Hij nu te Jerusalem op het paaschfeest was, geloofden velen in zijn Naam, toen zij de mirakelen zagen die Hij deed.
[2:24] Maar Jezus zelf vertrouwde zich onder hen niet, omdat Hij allen kende,
[2:25] en omdat Hij niet van noode had dat iemand Hem van den mensch getuigenis gaf, want Hij zelf wist wat in den mensch was.  
[3:1] Er was nu een mensch uit de fariseërs, Nikodemus genaamd, een overste van de Joden.
[3:2] Deze kwam des nachts tot Jezus en zeide tot Hem: Rabbi, wij weten dat Gij als leeraar van God gekomen zijt, want niemand kan deze mirakelen doen die Gij doet, als God niet met hem is.
[3:3] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Voorwaar, voorwaar, zeg Ik u: Als iemand niet van boven geboren wordt, hij kan het koninkrijk Gods niet zien!
[3:4] Nikodemus zeide tot Hem: Hoe kan een mensch geboren worden als hij oud is? Hij kan toch niet andermaal in zijn moeders lichaam ingaan en geboren worden?
[3:5] Jezus antwoordde: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg u: Als iemand niet geboren wordt uit water en Geest, hij kan het koninkrijk Gods niet ingaan!
[3:6] Wat uit het vleesch geboren is, dat is vleesch en wat uit den Geest geboren is, dat is geest.
[3:7] Verwonder u niet, omdat Ik tot u zeide: Gijlieden moet van boven geboren worden.
[3:8] De Geest blaast waar Hij wil, en zijn stem hoort gij, maar gij weet niet vanwaar Hij komt en waar Hij heengaat; zóó is het met ieder die uit den Geest geboren is.
[3:9] Nikodemus antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Hoe kan dat geschieden?
[3:10] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Gij zijt de leeraar Israëls en deze dingen weet gij niet?
[3:11] Voorwaar, voorwaar zeg Ik u: Wat wij weten spreken wij en wat wij gezien hebben getuigen wij, en ons getuigenis neemt gij niet aan!
[3:12] Als Ik u de aardsche dingen zeg en gij gelooft niet, hoe zult gij dan gelooven als Ik u de hemelsche zou zeggen?
[3:13] En niemand is opgeklommen naar den hemel, dan die uit den hemel is nedergedaald, de Zoon des menschen, die in den hemel is.
[3:14] En gelijk Mozes de slang in de woestijn heeft verhoogd, alzoo moet de Zoon des menschen verhoogd worden,
[3:15] opdat al wie in Hem gelooft, niet verga, maar eeuwig leven hebbe.
[3:16] Want alzoo heeft God de wereld bemind, dat Hij zijn eeniggeboren Zoon heeft gegeven, opdat al wie in Hem gelooft niet verga, maar eeuwig leven hebbe.
[3:17] Want God heeft zijn Zoon niet tot de wereld gezonden om de wereld te veroordeelen, maar opdat de wereld door Hem behouden zou worden.
[3:18] Die in Hem gelooft wordt niet veroordeeld; die niet gelooft is al veroordeeld, omdat Hij niet geloofd heeft in den Naam van den eeniggeboren Zoon van God.
[3:19] Dit nu is het oordeel, dat het Licht tot de wereld is gekomen en dat de menschen de duisternis meer hebben bemind dan het Licht; want hun werken waren kwaad.
[3:20] Want al wie het kwaad doet; haat het Licht en komt niet tot het Licht, opdat zijn werken niet zouden bestraft worden; 
[3:21] maar die de waarheid doet komt tot het Licht, opdat zijn werken bekend worden, dat zij in God gedaan zijn. 
[3:22]  Na dezen kwam Jezus met zijn discipelen naar het land van Judea, en daar vertoefde Hij met hen en doopte.
[3:23] En ook Johannes doopte in Enon, nabij Salim, omdat daar veel water was. En zij kwamen daar en werden gedoopt.
[3:24] Want Johannes was nog niet in de gevangenis geworpen.
[3:25] Er ontstond dan tweedracht tusschen de discipelen van Johannes met de Joden over de zuivering.
[3:26] En zij kwamen tot Johannes en zeiden tot hem: Rabbi! Hij die met u was aan den overkant van den Jordaan, aan wien gij getuigenis gegeven hebt, zie, die doopt en allen komen tot Hem!
[3:27] Johannes antwoordde en zeide: Een mensch kan niets ontvangen tenzij het hem gegeven is uit den hemel.
[3:28] Gij zelven geeft mij getuigenis dat ik gezegd heb: Ik ben de Christus niet, maar ik ben vóór Hem afgezonden.
[3:29] Die de bruid heeft is de bruidegom, maar de vriend van den bruidegom, die staat en hem aanhoort, verblijdt zich ten uiterste om de stem des bruidegoms. Deze blijdschap dan, die de mijne is, is vervuld.
[3:30] Hij moet toenemen, maar ik afnemen.
[3:31] Die van boven komt is boven allen; die uit de aarde is, is uit de aarde en spreekt uit de aarde; die uit den hemel komt is boven allen.
[3:32] Wat Hij gezien en gehoord heeft dat getuigt Hij, en zijn getuigenis neemt niemand aan.
[3:33] Die zijn getuigenis heeft aangenomen, die heeft onderteekend dat God waarachtig is.
[3:34] Want dien God gezonden heeft die spreekt de woorden Gods, want God geeft den Geest niet met mate.
[3:35] De Vader bemint den Zoon en heeft alles in zijn hand gegeven.
[3:36] Die in den Zoon gelooft heeft eeuwig leven, maar die den Zoon ongehoorzaam is zal geen leven zien, maar de gramschap Gods blijft op hem.  
[4:1] Toen dan Jezus vernomen had dat de fariseërs hadden gehoord dat Hij meer discipelen maakte en doopte dan Johannes,
[4:2] alhoewel Jezus zelf niet doopte, maar zijn discipelen,
[4:3] zoo verliet Hij Judea en vertrok wederom naar Galilea.
[4:4] En Hij moest door Samaria gaan.
[4:5] Hij kwam dan aan een stad van Samaria, genaamd Sichar, nabij het stuk grond dat Jakob aan zijn zoon Jozef gaf.
[4:6] En aldaar was de put van Jakob; en omdat Jezus vermoeid was van de reize, zette Hij zich bij den put neder. Het was omtrent de zesde ure. 
[4:7]  Daar kwam een vrouw uit Samaria om water te putten. Jezus zeide tot haar: Geef mij wat drinken!
[4:8] Want zijn discipelen waren naar de stad gegaan om spijze te koopen.
[4:9] De samaritaansche vrouw zeide tot Hem: Wat? gij, die een Jood zijt, vraagt drinken van mij, die een samaritaansche vrouw ben? (Want de Joden gaan niet om met de Samaritanen.)
[4:10] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot haar: Als gij de gifte Gods kendet, en wie Hij is die tot u zegt: Geef mij wat drinken! — dan zoudt gij van Hem hebben gevraagd en Hij zou u levend water gegeven hebben.
[4:11] De vrouw zeide tot Hem: Heer, Gij hebt geen emmer om te putten, en de put is diep; vanwaar hebt Gij dan levend water?
[4:12] Zijt Gij meer dan onze vader Jakob, die ons den put gegeven heeft, en er zelf uit gedronken heeft, met zijn zonen, en zijn vee?
[4:13] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot haar: Al wie drinkt van dit water, zal wederom dorst krijgen.
[4:14] Maar zoo wie drinkt van het water, dat Ik hem zal geven, die zal in eeuwigheid geen dorst krijgen; maar het water dat Ik hem zal geven zal in hem worden een fontein van water, dat springt tot in het eeuwige leven!
[4:15] De vrouw zeide tot: Hem: Heer! geef mij dat water, opdat ik geen dorst krijge, en niet naar hier moet komen putten!
[4:16] Jezus zeide tot haar: Ga heen, roep uw man en kom naar hier!
[4:17] De vrouw antwoordde en zeide: Een man heb ik niet! Jezus zeide tot haar: Dat is goed gezegd, dat gij geen man hebt.
[4:18] Want vijf mannen hebt gij gehad, en dien ge nu hebt is uw man niet; daar zegt gij de waarheid aan!
[4:19] De vrouw zeide tot Hem: Heer! ik zie dat Gij een profeet zijt!
[4:20] Onze vaders hebben op dezen berg aangebeden, en gij, Joden, zegt dat in Jerusalem de plaats is waar men moet aanbidden?
[4:21] Jezus zeide tot haar? Geloof mij vrouwe! dat er een ure komt wanneer gij noch op dezen berg, noch in Jerusalem den Vader zult aanbidden.
[4:22] Gijlieden aanbidt wat gij niet weet; wij aanbidden wat wij weten, want de verlossing is uit de Joden.
[4:23] Maar er komt een ure, en zij is nu, dat de ware aanbidders den Vader zullen aanbidden in geest en waarheid, want ook de Vader zoekt dezulken die Hem aanbidden.
[4:24] Een geest is God, en die Hem aanbidden, moeten Hem in geest en waarheid aanbidden!
[4:25] De vrouw zeide tot Hem: Ik weet dat de Messias komt, dat wil zeggen: De Christus; als die gekomen is zal Hij ons alles verkondigen!
[4:26] Jezus zeide tot haar: Ik, die met u spreek, ben het! 
[4:27]  En hierop kwamen zijn discipelen en waren verwonderd dat Hij met een vrouw sprak; maar niemand zeide: Wat vraagt Gij of wat spreekt Gij met haar?
[4:28] De vrouw dan liet haar watervat achter en ging naar de stad, en zeide tot de menschen:
[4:29] Komt, ziet een mensch die mij gezegd heeft alles wat ik gedaan heb; deze is toch de Christus niet?
[4:30] Zij gingen dan uit de stad en kwamen tot Hem.
[4:31] Ondertusschen vroegen de discipelen Hem, zeggende: Meester, eet!
[4:32] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Ik heb een spijze om te eten die gij niet kent.
[4:33] De discipelen zeiden dan tot malkander: Zou iemand Hem eten gebracht hebben?
[4:34] Jezus zeide tot hen: Mijn spijze is dat Ik doe den wil van Hem die Mij gezonden heeft en dat Ik zijn werk volbrenge.
[4:35] Zegt gij niet: Nog vier maanden en dan komt de oogst aan? — Ziet, Ik zeg u: Heft uw oogen op en aanschouwt de velden, hoe wit zij al zijn tot den oogst!
[4:36] De maaier ontvangt loon en vergadert vrucht ten eeuwigen leven, opdat de zaaier en de maaier zich te zamen verblijden.
[4:37] Want hierin is het woord waarachtig: De een zaait en de andere maait.
[4:38] Ik heb u uitgezonden om te oogsten wat gij niet bearbeid hebt; anderen hebben den arbeid gedaan en gij zijt tot hun arbeid ingegaan. 
[4:39]  Uit die stad nu geloofden velen van de Samaritanen in Hem, op het woord der vrouw die getuigde: Hij heeft mij gezegd al wat ik gedaan heb.
[4:40] Toen dan de Samaritanen tot Hem gekomen waren, verzochten zij Hem bij hen te blijven. En Hij bleef daar twee dagen.
[4:41] En er geloofden nog veel meer om zijns woords wil,
[4:42] en zeiden tot de vrouw: Het is nu niet meer om uw zeggen, dat wij gelooven; want wij hebben zelf gehoord en weten dat deze waarlijk is de Verlosser der wereld. 
[4:43]  Na die twee dagen nu ging hij vandaar naar Galilea.
[4:44] Want Jezus zelf getuigde dat een profeet in zijn eigen vaderland geen achting heeft.
[4:45] Als Hij dan in Galilea gekomen was, ontvingen de Galileërs Hem, die alles gezien hadden wat Hij op het feest in Jerusalem had gedaan; want ook zij waren naar het feest gegaan. 
[4:46]  Jezus kwam dan wederom te Kana in Galilea, waar Hij het water tot wijn gemaakt had. En daar was een koninklijk beambte, wiens zoon krank was in Kapernaüm.
[4:47] Deze, gehoord hebbende dat Jezus uit Judea naar Galilea gekomen was, ging; tot Hem, en vroeg dat Hij zou afkomen en zijn zoon genezen, want hij lag op sterven.
[4:48] Jezus dan zeide tot hem: Als gijlieden geen teekenen en mirakelen ziet, dan zijt gij niet gelooven!
[4:49] De koninklijke beambte dan zeide tot Hem: Heere, kom toch af, eer mijn kind sterft!
[4:50] Jezus zeide tot hem: Ga heen, uw zoon leeft! En de man geloofde in het woord dat Jezus tot hem sprak, en ging heen.
[4:51] En toen hij wegging kwamen zijn dienstknechten hem al tegen en boodschapten hem dat zijn zoon leefde.
[4:52] Hij vroeg hun dan de ure waarin hij beter was geworden. En zij zeiden tot hem: Gisteren ter zevender ure verliet hem de koorts.
[4:53] De vader erkende dan dat het dezelfde ure was waarin Jezus tot hem had gezegd: Uw zoon leeft! En hij zelf geloofde en geheel zijn huisgezin.
[4:54] Dit tweede mirakel heeft Jezus wederom gedaan als Hij uit Judea naar Galilea was gekomen.  
[5:1] Na dezen was er een feest der Joden en Jezus ging naar Jerusalem.
[5:2] In Jerusalem nu is er bij de Schaapspoort een vijver, in ‘t hebreeuwsch genaamd Bethesda, die vijf gaanderijen heeft,
[5:3] waarin lag een menigte van kranken, blinden, kreupelen, lammen, wachtende op de roering des waters; 
[5:4] want een engel daalde op een bepaalden tijd neder in den vijver en roerde het water; die dan het eerst daarin kwam, na de roering van het water, die werd gezond, welke ziekte hij ook had.
[5:5] Aldaar nu was een zeker man die acht en dertig jaar krank was.
[5:6] Jezus zag dezen liggen en wetende dat hij al langen tijd zoo was, zeide Hij tot hem: Wilt gij gezond worden?
[5:7] De kranke antwoordde Hem: Heere, ik heb niemand, om mij, als het water geroerd is, in den vijver te werpen; en terwijl ik aankom, gaat er een ander vóór mij daarin!
[5:8] Jezus zeide tot hem: Sta op, neem uw bed op en wandel!
[5:9] En terstond werd de man gezond en nam zijn bed op en wandelde. En het was sabbat op dien dag. 
[5:10]  De Joden dan zeiden tot hem die genezen was: Het is sabbat en het is u niet geoorloofd het bed op te nemen!
[5:11] Hij antwoordde hun: Die mij gezond gemaakt heeft, die heeft tot mij gezegd: Neem uw bed op en wandel!
[5:12] Zij vroegen hem: Wie is de man die tot u gezegd heeft: Neem uw bed op en wandel?
[5:13] Maar de genezene wist niet wie Hij was, want Jezus was de schare ontweken die in die plaats was.
[5:14] Naderhand vond Jezus hem in den tempel en zeide tot hem: Zie, gij zijt gezond geworden; zondig niet meer, opdat u niet wat ergers overkome!
[5:15] De man ging heen en boodschapte aan de Joden dat het Jezus was die hem gezond had gemaakt.
[5:16] En daarom vervolgden de Joden Jezus, omdat Hij dit op een sabbat deed.
[5:17] Maar Jezus antwoordde hun: Mijn Vader werkt tot nu toe, en Ik werk ook.
[5:18] Daarom zochten de Joden te meer Hem te dooden, omdat Hij niet alleen den sabbat schond, maar ook God zijn eigen Vader noemde, zich zelven gelijk makende aan God. 
[5:19]  Jezus dan antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: De Zoon kan niets van zich zelven doen, dan hetgeen Hij den Vader ziet doen; want wat deze doet, dat doet ook de Zoon desgelijks.
[5:20] Want de Vader bemint den Zoon, en al wat Hij zelf doet toont Hij Hem, en nog grooter werken dan deze zal Hij Hem toonen, opdat gij u verwondert.
[5:21] Want gelijk de Vader de dooden opwekt en levend maakt, zoo maakt ook de Zoon levend die Hij wil.
[5:22] Want ook de Vader oordeelt niemand, maar al het oordeel heeft Hij aan den Zoon gegeven,
[5:23] opdat zij allen den Zoon eeren, zooals zij den Vader eeren. Die den Zoon niet eert, die eert den Vader niet die Hem gezonden heeft.
[5:24] Voorwaar, voorwaar zeg Ik ulieden: Die mijn woord hoort en gelooft in Hem die Mij heeft gezonden, die heeft het eeuwige leven; en in het oordeel komt hij niet, maar hij is overgegaan uit den dood naar het leven.
[5:25] Voorwaar, voorwaar zeg Ik ulieden: Er komt een ure en zij is er nu, dat de dooden hooren zullen de stem des Zoons van God, en die gehoord hebben, zullen leven.
[5:26] Want zooals de Vader leven heeft in zich zelven, zoo heeft Hij ook den Zoon gegeven leven in zich zelven te hebben,
[5:27] en heeft Hem macht gegeven om het oordeel te houden, omdat Hij eens menschen zoon is.
[5:28] Zijt daarover niet verwonderd, want er komt een ure waarin allen, die in de graven zijn, zijn stem zullen hooren,
[5:29] en zullen uitgaan, die het goede gedaan hebben, tot de verrijzenis des levens, en die het kwade gedaan hebben, tot de verrijzenis des oordeels,
[5:30] Ik kan niets doen van Mij zelven. Zooals Ik hoor, oordeel Ik, en mijn oordeel is rechtvaardig, omdat Ik niet mijn wil zoek, maar den wil desgenen die Mij gezonden heeft.
[5:31] Indien Ik getuig van Mij zelven, zoo is mijn getuigenis niet waarachtig.
[5:32] Een ander is er die van Mij getuigt, en Ik weet dat de getuigenis die Hij van Mij getuigt, waarachtig is.
[5:33] Gijlieden hebt gezonden tot Johannes, en hij heeft aan de waarheid getuigenis gegeven.
[5:34] Wat Mij aangaat, Ik neem geen getuigenis van een mensch, maar dit zeg Ik opdat gij zoudt behouden worden.
[5:35] Johannes was de brandende en lichtgevende fakkel, en gij hebt u voor een ure in zijn licht willen verheugen.
[5:36] Maar de getuigenis die Ik heb, is meer dan die van Johannes, want de werken die Mij de Vader heeft gegeven om te volbrengen, die werken zelven die Ik doe, getuigen van Mij, dat de Vader Mij gezonden heeft.
[5:37] En de Vader, die Mij gezonden heeft, die heeft van Mij getuigd. Nooit hebt gij zijn stem gehoord, of zijn gedaante gezien.
[5:38] En zijn woord hebt gij niet in u blijvende, omdat gij Hem niet gelooft, dien Hij gezonden heeft.
[5:39] Gij onderzoekt de Schrifturen, omdat gij daarin eeuwig leven meent te hebben; en die zijn het die van Mij getuigen,
[5:40] en tot Mij komen wilt gij niet, om het leven te hebben!
[5:41] Glorie van menschen neem Ik niet aan.
[5:42] Maar Ik ken u, dat gij de liefde Gods niet hebt in u zelven.
[5:43] Ik ben gekomen in den Naam mijns Vaders en gij neemt Mij niet aan; als er een ander komt in zijn eigen naam, dien zult gij aannemen!
[5:44] Hoe kunt gijlieden gelooven, gij die glorie van malkander aanneemt, en de glorie, die van den eenigen God komt, zoekt gij niet!
[5:45] Meent niet dat Ik u zal beschuldigen bij den Vader! Er is er een die u beschuldigt, dat is Mozes, op wien gij hoopt.
[5:46] Want zoo gij in Mozes geloofdet, dan zoudt gij ook in Mij gelooven, want van Mij heeft hij geschreven.
[5:47] Maar als gij in zijn schriften niet gelooft, hoe zult gij dan mijn woorden gelooven?  
[6:1] Na dezen vertrok Jezus naar den overkant der zee van Galilea, of van Tiberias.
[6:2] Een groote schare nu volgde Hem, omdat zij de mirakelen zagen die Hij deed aan de kranken.
[6:3] Jezus dan ging op den berg, en daar zat Hij neder met zijn discipelen.
[6:4] En het was kort bij Paschen, het feest der Joden.
[6:5] Jezus dan, de oogen opheffende en ziende dat een groote schare tot Hem kwam, zeide tot Filippus: Vanwaar zullen wij brooden koopen, opdat dezen eten?
[6:6] Dit zeide Hij om hem op de proef te stellen, want Hij wist zelf wel wat Hij zou doen.
[6:7] Filippus antwoordde Hem: Voor tweehonderd penningen broods is voor dezen niet genoeg, opdat elk een stuksken krijge!
[6:8] Een uit zijn discipelen, Andreas de broeder van Simon Petrus, zeide tot Hem:
[6:9] Hier is een jongsken, dat vijf gerstenbrooden heeft en twee vischkens; maar wat is dat voor zóóvelen!
[6:10] Jezus zeide: Doet de menschen nederzitten! — Nu was er veel gras op die plaats. — De mannen dan gingen nederzitten, omtrent vijf duizend in getal.
[6:11] Jezus dan nam de brooden en gedankt hebbende gaf Hij ze aan die nedergezeten waren, en insgelijks van de vischkens, zooveel zij wilden.
[6:12] Toen zij nu verzadigd waren, zeide Hij tot zijn discipelen: Verzamelt de overgeschoten brokken, opdat er niets verloren ga!
[6:13] Zij verzamelden ze dan en vulden twaalf korven met brokken van de vijf gerstenbrooden, die overgeschoten waren van hen die gegeten hadden. 
[6:14]  De menschen dan, gezien hebbende het mirakel dat Jezus gedaan had, zeiden: Deze is waarlijk de profeet die in de wereld komen moest!
[6:15] Jezus dan, wetende dat zij zouden komen en Hem met geweld nemen om Hem koning te maken, vluchtte wederom naar den berg, Hij alleen. 
[6:16]  Toen het nu avond was geworden, gingen zijn discipelen af naar de zee,
[6:17] en zij gingen in een schip en voeren de zee over naar Kapernaüm. Maar het was al donker geworden, en nog was Jezus niet tot hen gekomen.
[6:18] En de zee werd onstuimig omdat er een sterke wind waaide.
[6:19] Toen zij nu omtrent vijf en twintig of dertig stadiën geroeid hadden, zagen zij Jezus op de zee wandelen en kort bij het schip komen; en zij werden bevreesd.
[6:20] Maar Hij zeide tot hen: Ik ben het, vreest niet!
[6:21] Zij wilden Hem dan in het schip nemen, en terstond kwam het schip aan het land waar zij naar toe voeren. 
[6:22]  Des anderen daags stond de schare aan den overkant der zee en had gezien dat aldaar geen ander scheepken was dan dat ééne, en dat Jezus met zijn discipelen niet was meegegaan in het schip, maar dat zijn discipelen alleen waren vertrokken.
[6:23] Maar er kwamen scheepkens uit Tiberias kort bij de plaats waar zij het brood gegeten hadden, toen de Heere gedankt had.
[6:24] Toen de schare dan zag dat Jezus daar niet was, noch zijn discipelen, gingen zij zelven in die scheepkens en kwamen naar Kapernaüm, Jezus zoekende.
[6:25] En toen zij Hem gevonden hadden aan den overkant der zee, zeiden zij tot Hem: Rabbi, wanneer zijt Gij hier gekomen?
[6:26] Jezus antwoordde hun en zeide: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Gij zoekt Mij, niet omdat gij mirakelen gezien hebt, maar omdat gij gegeten hebt van de brooden en verzadigd zijt.
[6:27] Werkt niet om de spijze die vergaat, maar om de spijze die ten eeuwigen leven blijft, die de Zoon des menschen ulieden geven zal; want dezen heeft de Vader, dat is God, met zijn zegel bekrachtigd.
[6:28] Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Wat moeten wij doen, om de werken Gods te doen?
[6:29] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Dit is het werk Gods, dat gij gelooft in Hem dien Hij gezonden heeft.
[6:30] Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Welk mirakel doet Gij dan, opdat wij het zien en U gelooven? Wat werkt Gij?
[6:31] Onze vaders hebben het manna gegeten in de woestijn, zooals er geschreven is: Brood uit den hemel gaf Hij hun te eten.
[6:32] Jezus zeide dan tot hen: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Niet Mozes heeft u het brood uit den hemel gegeven, maar mijn Vader geeft u het waarachtige brood uit den hemel.
[6:33] Want het brood Gods is dat, wat uit den hemel nederdaalt en aan de wereld leven geeft!
[6:34] Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Heere, geef ons altijd dat brood!
[6:35] Jezus dan zeide tot hen: Ik ben het Brood des levens; die tot Mij komt zal geenszins honger hebben, en die in Mij gelooft zal nooit meer dorst hebben.
[6:36] Maar Ik heb uliede gezegd dat gij Mij gezien hebt, en toch gelooft gij niet.
[6:37] Al wat de Vader Mij geeft zal tot Mij komen, en dengene, die tot Mij komt, zal Ik geenszins uitwerpen
[6:38] Want Ik ben nedergedaald van den hemel, niet; om mijn wil te doen, maar? den wil van Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[6:39] Dit nu is de wil des Vaders die Mij gezonden heeft, dat van al wat Hij: Mij gegeven heeft, Ik niets late verloren gaan, maar; dat doe verrijzen ten laatsten dage.
[6:40] Want dit is de wil, mijns Vaders, die Mij gezonden heeft, dat een ieder die den Zoon aanschouwt, en in Hem gelooft, eeuwig leven hebbe, en Ik zal hem doen verrijzen ten laatsten dage.
[6:41] De Joden dan murmureerden over Hem, omdat Hij zeide: Ik ben het brood dat uit den hemel is nedergedaald!
[6:42] En zij zeiden: Deze is Hij niet Jezus, de zoon van Jozef, wiens vader en moeder wij kennen? Hoe, zegt deze dan nu: Uit den hemel ben Ik nedergedaald?; 
[6:43] Maar Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Murmureert niet onder malkander!
[6:44] Niemand kan tot Mij komen, als de Vader, die Mij gezonden heeft, hem niet trekt; en Ik zal hem doen verrijzen ten laatsten dage.
[6:45] Er is geschreven in de profeten: En zij zullen allen van God geleerd zijn. — Ieder dan die van den Vader gehoord en geleerd heeft, komt tot Mij.
[6:46] Niet dat iemand den Vader gezien heeft, dan Hij die van God is: Die heeft den Vader gezien.
[6:47] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Die in Mij gelooft, heeft eeuwig leven.
[6:48] Ik ben het Brood des levens.
[6:49] Uw vaders hebben in de woestijn het manna gegeten en zijn gestorven.
[6:50] Dit is het brood, dat uit den hemel nederdaalt, opdat iemand er van ete en niet sterve.
[6:51] Ik ben dat levende Brood, dat uit den hemel is nedergedaald; als iemand eet van dit brood, zal hij leven tot in eeuwigheid; en het brood dat Ik geven zal voor het leven der wereld, is mijn vleesch.
[6:52] De Joden dan streden onder malkander, zeggende: Hoe kan deze ons zijn vleesch te eten geven?
[6:53] Jezus dan zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Als gij niet het vleesch van den Zoon des menschen eet en zijn bloed drinkt, dan hebt gij geen leven in u zelven.
[6:54] Die mijn vleesch eet en mijn bloed drinkt, die heeft eeuwig leven, en Ik zal hem doen verrijzen ten laatsten dage.
[6:55] Want mijn vleesch is waarlijk spijze en mijn bloed is waarlijk drank.
[6:56] Die mijn vleesch eet en mijn bloed drinkt, die blijft in Mij en Ik in hem.
[6:57] Zooals de levende Vader Mij gezonden heeft, en Ik door den Vader leef, zoo zal ook hij, die Mij eet, leven door Mij.
[6:58] Dit is het brood dat uit den hemel is nedergedaald; niet zooals de vaders het manna hebben gegeten en zijn gestorven; die dit brood eet zal leven tot in eeuwigheid.
[6:59] Deze dingen sprak Hij in de synagoge, toen Hij in Kapernaüm leerde. 
[6:60]  Velen dan van zijn discipelen, die Hem gehoord hadden, zeiden: Deze rede is hard; wie kan ze hooren?
[6:61] Jezus nu wist bij zich zelven dat zijn discipelen daarover murmureerden, en zeide tot hen: Dat ergert ulieden?
[6:62] Indien gij dan den Zoon des menschen eens zaagt opvaren, waar Hij vroeger was?
[6:63] Het is de Geest die levend maakt, het vleesch dient tot niets! De woorden, die Ik tot u gesproken heb, zijn geest en leven.
[6:64] Maar sommigen zijn er onder u die niet gelooven. Jezus toch wist van den beginne, wie zij waren die niet geloofden, en wie hij was die Hem zou verraden.
[6:65] En Hij zeide: Daarom heb Ik ulieden gezegd dat niemand tot Mij kan komen, zoo het hem niet gegeven is uit den Vader.
[6:66] Van toen af gingen velen zijner discipelen terug en wandelden niet meer met Hem. 
[6:67]  Jezus zeide dan tot de twaalven: Wilt ook gij niet weggaan?
[6:68] Simon Petrus antwoordde Hem: Heere! tot wien zouden wij gaan? Gij hebt woorden van eeuwig leven,
[6:69] en wij hebben geloofd, en erkend dat Gij zijt de Christus, de Zoon des levenden Gods!
[6:70] Jezus antwoordde hun: Heb Ik u niet alle twaalf uitverkoren? en één uit u is er een duivel!
[6:71] Dit nu zeide Hij van Judas Iskariot, den zoon van Simon; deze toch was het die Hem zou verraden, die één was van de twaalven.  
[7:1] Na dezen wandelde Jezus in Galilea, want Hij wilde niet in Judea wandelen, omdat de Joden Hem zochten te dooden.
[7:2] En het feest der Joden, het loofhuttenfeest, was nabij.
[7:3] Zijn broeders zeiden dan tot Hem: Vertrek vanhier, en ga naar Judea, opdat ook uw discipelen uw werken zien, die Gij doet;
[7:4] want niemand doet iets in het verborgen, als hij zelf zoekt bekend te zijn. Als Gij dit doet, vertoon U dan aan de wereld!
[7:5] Want ook zijn broeders geloofden niet in Hem.
[7:6] Jezus zeide tot hen: Mijn tijd is nog niet gekomen, maar uw tijd is altijd gereed.
[7:7] De wereld kan u niet haten, maar Mij haat zij, omdat Ik van haar getuig dat haar werken kwaad zijn.
[7:8] Gaat gij op naar het feest! Ik ga niet op tot dit feest, omdat mijn tijd nog niet vervuld is.
[7:9] Dit gezegd hebbende, bleef Hij in Galilea. 
[7:10]  Toen nu zijn broeders waren opgegaan naar het feest, toen ging Hij zelf ook op, niet openlijk, maar in het verborgen.
[7:11] De Joden dan zochten Hem op het feest en zeiden: Waar is Hij?
[7:12] En er was veel gemompels van Hem onder de schare; sommigen zeiden: Hij is goed! anderen zeiden: Neen, maar Hij verleidt de schare!
[7:13] Niemand sprak nochtans vrij uit van Hem uit vreeze voor de Joden. 
[7:14]  Als het nu al midden in het feest was, ging Jezus op naar den tempel en onderwees.
[7:15] De Joden dan verwonderden zich en zeiden: Hoe kent deze de Schrifturen? Hij die niet heeft gestudeerd!
[7:16] Jezus dan antwoordde hun en zeide: Mijn leer is niet de mijne, maar van Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[7:17] Zoo iemand wil zijn wil doen, die zal van deze leer erkennen, of zij uit God is, dan of Ik uit Mij zelven spreek.
[7:18] Die uit zich zelven spreekt, die zoekt zijn eigen glorie; maar die de glorie zoekt van dengene, die hem gezonden heeft, die is waarachtig en onrecht is er in hem niet.
[7:19] Heeft Mozes ulieden niet de wet gegeven? en niemand uit u doet de wet! — Waarom zoekt gij Mij te dooden?
[7:20] De schare antwoordde: Gij zijt bezeten! Wie zoekt U te dooden?
[7:21] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Eén werk heb Ik gedaan en gij allen verwondert u!
[7:22] Mozes heeft u de besnijdenis gegeven— niet dat zij uit Mozes is, maar uit de vaderen— en op een sabbat besnijdt gij wel een mensch!
[7:23] Als iemand de besnijdenis ontvangt op sabbat, opdat de wet van Mozes niet gebroken zou worden, zijt gij dan op Mij verbitterd omdat Ik een geheelen mensch heb gezond gemaakt op een sabbat?
[7:24] Oordeelt toch niet naar den schijn, maar oordeelt een rechtvaardig oordeel!
[7:25] Eenigen dan uit de Jerusalemmers zeiden: Is deze het niet dien zij zoeken te dooden?
[7:26] En zie, vrij uit spreekt Hij, en men zegt Hem niets! Zouden de oversten waarlijk erkend hebben dat deze de Christus is?
[7:27] Maar van dezen weten wij vanwaar Hij is; maar van den Christus, als Hij komt, zal niemand weten vanwaar Hij is!
[7:28] Jezus dan riep uit, in den tempel leerende, en zeide: Mij kent gij, en gij weet vanwaar Ik ben! En van Mij zelven ben Ik niet gekomen, maar Hij is waarachtig, die Mij gezonden heeft, dien gij niet kent!
[7:29] Ik ken Hem, want Ik ben van Hem, en Hij heeft Mij gezonden!
[7:30] Zij zochten dan Hem te grijpen, en niemand leide de hand op Hem, omdat zijn ure nog niet was gekomen.
[7:31] Doch velen uit de schare geloofden in Hem, en zeiden: De Christus, als Hij zal komen, zal die wel meer mirakelen doen dan deze doet? 
[7:32]  De fariseërs hoorden de schare dit van Hem mompelen, en de overpriesters en de fariseërs zonden dienaren af, om Hem te grijpen.
[7:33] Jezus dan zeide: Nog een korten tijd ben Ik bij ulieden, en dan ga Ik tot Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[7:34] Gij zult Mij zoeken en niet vinden, en waar Ik ben kunt gijlieden niet komen. 
[7:35]  De Joden dan zeiden tot malkander: Waar zal deze heengaan, dat wij Hem niet vinden zullen? Hij zal toch niet naar de verstrooiden gaan, onder de Grieken, en de Grieken leeren?
[7:36] Wat is dat woord dat Hij zegt: Gij zult Mij zoeken en niet vinden? en waar Ik ben kunt gijlieden niet komen? 
[7:37]  Op den laatsten dag nu, den grootste van het feest, stond Jezus en riep, zeggende: Als iemand dorst heeft, die kome tot Mij en drinke!
[7:38] die in Mij gelooft, zooals de Schrifture zegt: Stroomen van levend water zullen uit zijn binnenste vloeien!
[7:39] Dit nu zeide Hij van den Geest, dien ontvangen zouden degenen die in Hem gelooven; want de Geest was nog niet uitgestort, omdat Jezus nog niet in zijn glorie was. 
[7:40]  Uit de schare dan zeiden sommigen, die deze woorden gehoord hadden: Deze is waarlijk de profeet!
[7:41] Anderen zeiden: Deze is de Christus! — Anderen zeiden: Het is toch niet uit Galilea dat de Christus komt?
[7:42] Zegt de Schrifture dan niet dat het uit het geslacht van David is, en van het dorp Bethlehem, vanwaar David was, dat de Christus komt?
[7:43] Er kwam dan tweedracht onder de schare, om zijnentwil.
[7:44] Sommigen nu uit hen wilden Hem grijpen, maar niemand leide de handen op Hem. 
[7:45]  De dienaars dan kwamen tot de overpriesters en fariseërs, en die zeiden tot hen: Waarom hebt gij Hem niet meegebracht?
[7:46] De dienaars antwoordden: Nooit heeft eenig mensch gesproken, zooals deze mensch spreekt!
[7:47] De fariseërs antwoordden hun: Ook gij zijt toch niet verleid?
[7:48] Heeft wel iemand uit de oversten in Hem geloofd, of uit de fariseërs?
[7:49] Maar die schare die de wet niet kent, — vervloekt zijn ze!
[7:50] Nikodemus— die des nachts tot Jezus gekomen was— die één uit hen was, zeide tot hen:
[7:51] Oordeelt onze wet wel iemand als zij niet eerst van hem hoort en weet wat hij doet?
[7:52] Zij antwoordden en zeiden tot hem: Gij zijt toch ook niet uit Galilea? onderzoek en zie, dat er uit Galilea geen profeet is opgestaan!
[7:53] En een ieder ging naar zijn huis, maar Jezus ging naar den Berg der Olijven.  
[8:1] En des morgens vroeg kwam Hij wederom naar den tempel, en al het volk kwam tot Hem, en als Hij nedergezeten was onderwees Hij hen.
[8:2] En de schriftgeleerden en de fariseërs brachten tot Hem een vrouw, die in overspel was bevonden en stelden haar in het midden,
[8:3] en zeiden tot Hem: Meester, deze vrouw is op heeter daad in overspel bevonden.
[8:4] In de wet nu heeft Mozes ons bevolen dezulken te steenigen! Gij dan, wat zegt Gij?
[8:5] Zij nu zeiden dit om Hem op de proef te stellen, opdat zij wat zouden hebben om Hem te beschuldigen. Doch Jezus bukte neder en schreef met den vinger op den grond.
[8:6] Maar toen zij Hem bleven vragen, richtte Hij zich op en zeide tot hen: Die onder u zonder zonde is, werpe het eerst een steen op haar!
[8:7] En wederom bukte Hij neder en schreef op den grond.
[8:8] En zij, dit gehoord hebbende, en van hun konscientie beschuldigd zijnde, gingen weg, een voor een, van de oudsten af tot de laatsten. En Jezus bleef alleen, en de vrouw die in het midden stond.
[8:9] En Jezus richtte zich op en zag niemand dan de vrouw; en Hij zeide tot haar: Vrouw! waar zijn die beschuldigers van u? niemand heeft u veroordeeld?
[8:10] Zij nu zeide: Niemand, Heere! En Jezus zeide tot haar: Ook Ik veroordeel u niet! ga heen, en zondig niet meer! 
[8:11]  Jezus dan sprak wederom tot hen, zeggende: Ik ben het Licht der wereld; die Mij volgt, zal niet wandelen in de duisternis, maar zal het licht des levens hebben.
[8:12] De fariseërs dan zeiden tot Hem: Gij geeft getuigenis van u zelven; uw getuigenis is niet waarachtig!
[8:13] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Ook als Ik van Mij zelven getuig, is mijn getuigenis waarachtig, omdat Ik weet vanwaar Ik gekomen ben en waarheen Ik ga! maar gijlieden weet niet vanwaar Ik kom of waarheen Ik ga!
[8:14] Gijlieden oordeelt naar het vleesch; Ik oordeel niemand.
[8:15] En wanneer Ik ook oordeel, is mijn oordeel waarachtig, want Ik ben niet alleen, maar Ik en de Vader die gezonden heeft.
[8:16] Ook in uw wet is geschreven dat de getuigenis van twee menschen waarachtig is.
[8:17] Ik ben het die van Mij zelven getuigenis geef, en van Mij getuigt de Vader die Mij gezonden heeft.
[8:18] Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Waar is uw Vader? Jezus antwoordde: Noch Mij kent gij, noch mijn Vader. Als gij Mij kendet, dan zoudt gij ook mijn Vader kennen.
[8:19] Deze woorden sprak Jezus in de schatkamer, toen Hij onderwijs gaf in den tempel. En niemand greep Hem, omdat zijn ure nog niet was gekomen.
[8:20] Jezus dan zeide wederom tot hen: Ik ga heen en gij zult Mij zoeken, en in uw zonden zult gij sterven; waar Ik heenga, kunt gijlieden niet komen.
[8:21] De Joden dan zeiden: Hij zal toch zich zelven niet dooden? omdat Hij zegt: Waar Ik heenga kunt gijlieden niet komen!
[8:22] En Hij zeide tot hen: Gijlieden zijt van beneden, Ik ben van boven! gijlieden zijt uit deze wereld, Ik ben niet uit deze wereld.
[8:23] Daarom zeide Ik ulieden dat gij zult sterven in uw zonden; want als gij niet gelooft dat Ik het ben zult gij sterven in uw zonden.
[8:24] Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Wie zijt Gij? — Jezus zeide tot hen: Wat Ik u van den beginne ook gezegd heb!
[8:25] Veel heb ik van ulieden te zeggen en te oordeelen, maar die Mij gezonden heeft is waarachtig, en wat Ik van Hem gehoord heb, dat spreek Ik tot de wereld.
[8:26] Zij verstonden niet dat Hij tot hen sprak van den Vader.
[8:27] Jezus dan zeide: Als gij den Zoon des menschen zult verhoogd hebben, dan zult gij verstaan dat Ik het ben, en dat Ik van Mij zelven niets doe, maar dat Ik deze dingen spreek zooals de Vader Mij geleerd heeft.
[8:28] En die Mij gezonden heeft is met Mij; de Vader heeft Mij niet alleen gelaten, omdat Ik altijd doe wat Hem behagelijk is. 
[8:29]  Toen Hij dit sprak, geloofden velen in Hem.
[8:30] Jezus dan zeide tot de Joden die in Hem geloofden: Indien gij in mijn woord blijft, dan zijt gij waarlijk mijn discipelen,
[8:31] en gij zult de waarheid verstaan, en de waarheid zal u vrijmaken.
[8:32] Zij antwoordden Hem: Wij zijn Abrahams nakomelingen en nooit hebben wij iemand gediend! hoe zegt Gij dan: Gij zult vrij worden?
[8:33] Jezus antwoordde hun: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Al wie de zonde doet, is een slaaf der zonde!
[8:34] De slaaf nu blijft niet eeuwig in het huis; de zoon blijft er eeuwig.
[8:35] Indien dan de Zoon u heeft vrijgemaakt, zult gij waarlijk vrij zijn.
[8:36] Ik weet dat gij Abrahams nakomelingen zijt; maar gij zoekt Mij te dooden, omdat mijn woord in u geen plaats vindt.
[8:37] Ik spreek wat Ik bij mijn Vader heb gezien, en gijlieden ook doet wat gij van uw vader gehoord hebt.
[8:38] Zij antwoordden en zeiden tot Hem: Onze vader is Abraham! — Jezus zeide tot hen: Als gij Abrahams kinderen zijt, doet dan Abrahams werken!
[8:39] Maar nu zoekt gij Mij te dooden, een mensch die u de waarheid gezegd heeft, die Ik van God gehoord heb; — dat deed Abraham niet!
[8:40] Gij doet de werken uws vaders. — Zij zeiden dan tot Hem: Wij zijn niet uit hoererij geboren; één Vader hebben we, God!
[8:41] Jezus zeide tot hen: Als God uw Vader was, dan zoudt gij Mij beminnen, want Ik ben uit God uitgegaan en gekomen; Ik ben toch niet van Mij zelven gekomen, maar Hij heeft Mij gezonden.
[8:42] Waarom kent gij mijn taal niet? — Omdat gij mijn woord niet kunt hooren.
[8:43] Gij zijt uit den vader den duivel, en de genegenheden uws vaders wilt gij doen. Die was een menschenmoordenaar van den beginne, en hij is in de waarheid niet staande gebleven, omdat er geen waarheid in hem is. Als hij den leugen spreekt dan spreekt hij uit zijn eigen, omdat hij een leugenaar is en de vader daarvan.
[8:44] Maar Mij gelooft gij niet, omdat Ik de waarheid zeg!
[8:45] Wie uit ulieden overtuigt Mij van zonde? — Als Ik waarheid spreek, waarom gelooft gij Mij niet?
[8:46] Die uit God is hoort de woorden Gods; daarom hoort gijlieden niet, omdat gij uit God niet zijt.
[8:47] De Joden antwoordden en zeiden tot Hem: Zeggen wij niet te recht dat Gij een Samaritaan zijt en een boozen geest hebt?
[8:48] Jezus antwoordde: Ik heb geen boozen geest, maar Ik eer mijn Vader en gij onteert Mij!
[8:49] Maar Ik zoek mijn glorie niet; daar is er Eén die ze zoekt en oordeelt.
[8:50] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Als iemand mijn woord bewaard zal hebben, dan zal hij den dood niet zien in der eeuwigheid!
[8:51] De Joden dan zeiden tot Hem: Nu weten wij dat Gij een boozen geest hebt! Abraham is gestorven en de profeten, en Gij zegt: Als iemand mijn woord bewaart, die zal den dood niet smaken in der eeuwigheid!
[8:52] Gij zijt toch niet meer dan onze vader Abraham, die gestorven is? en de profeten zijn gestorven; wien maakt Gij U zelven?
[8:53] Jezus antwoordde: Als Ik Mij zelven glorie gaf dan was mijn glorie niets; mijn Vader is het die Mij glorie geeft, dien gij zegt uw God te zijn.
[8:54] En gij kent Hem niet, maar Ik ken Hem; en als Ik zeide dat Ik Hem niet kende, dan zou Ik aan ulieden gelijk zijn, dat is een leugenaar; maar Ik ken Hem en zijn woord bewaar Ik.
[8:55] Abraham, uw vader, verheugde zich dat hij mijn dag zou zien, en hij heeft dien gezien en is verblijd.
[8:56] De Joden dan zeiden tot Hem: Nog geen vijftig jaar zijt Gij oud, en Gij hebt Abraham gezien?
[8:57] Jezus zeide tot hen: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Vóórdat Abraham was geboren, ben Ik!
[8:58] Zij namen dan steenen op, om die op Hem te werpen, maar Jezus verborg zich en ging uit den tempel.
[8:59]  
[9:1] En in het voorbijgaan zag Jezus een man die blind was van zijn geboorte af.
[9:2] En zijn discipelen vroegen Hem, zeggende: Meester! wie heeft er gezondigd, deze of zijn ouders, dat hij blind geboren werd?
[9:3] Jezus antwoordde: Noch deze heeft gezondigd, noch zijn ouders, maar in hem moesten de werken Gods openbaar worden.
[9:4] Ik moet de werken doen van Hem die Mij gezonden heeft zoolang het dag is; er komt een nacht wanneer niemand kan werken.
[9:5] Terwijl Ik in de wereld ben, ben Ik een Licht der wereld.
[9:6] Dit gezegd hebbende, spoog Hij op den grond en maakte slijk uit het speeksel, en streek hem het slijk op de oogen,
[9:7] en zeide tot hem: Ga heen, wasch u in den vijver van Siloam (die naam beteekent: Uitgezonden). Hij dan ging heen en waschte zich en kwam ziende terug.
[9:8] De geburen dan, en die hem vroeger hadden zien bedelen, zeiden: Is deze het niet, die daar zat te bedelen?
[9:9] Sommigen zeiden: Hij is het! Anderen zeiden: Neen, maar hij trekt wel op hem! Hij zelf zeide: Ik ben het!
[9:10] Zij zeiden dan tot hem: Hoe zijn u de oogen geopend?
[9:11] Hij antwoordde: De mensch, Jezus genaamd, maakte slijk en bestreek mijn oogen en zeide tot mij: Ga heen naar Siloam en wasch u! Ik ging dan heen, en heb mij gewasschen en werd ziende!
[9:12] Zij zeiden tot hem: Waar is die? Hij zeide: Ik weet niet! 
[9:13]  Zij brachten hem, die te voren blind was, tot de fariseërs.
[9:14] En het was sabbat op den dag dat Jezus slijk maakte en hem de oogen opende.
[9:15] Wederom vroegen hem dan ook de fariseërs, hoe hij ziende was geworden. En hij zeide tot hen: Hij leide mij slijk op de oogen, en ik heb mij gewasschen, en ik zie.
[9:16] Sommigen dan uit de fariseërs zeiden: Die mensch is van God niet, want den sabbat houdt Hij niet! Anderen zeiden: Hoe kan iemand, die een zondaar is, zulke mirakelen doen? — Er was tweedracht onder hen.
[9:17] Zij zeiden dan wederom tot den blinde: Gij, wat zegt gij van Hem, daar Hij u de oogen geopend heeft? — Hij nu zeide: Hij is een profeet.
[9:18] De Joden dan geloofden niet van hem, dat hij blind was geweest en ziende geworden, totdat zij de ouders hadden geroepen van hem die ziende was geworden.
[9:19] En zij vroegen hun, zeggende: Is dat uw zoon, dien gij zegt dat blind geboren is? Hoe ziet hij dan nu?
[9:20] Zijn ouders antwoordden dan en zeiden: Wij weten dat deze onze zoon is, en dat hij blind geboren is;
[9:21] doch hoe hij nu ziet, weten wij niet, of wie hem de oogen geopend heeft, wij weten het niet! Vraagt het hem, hij heeft zijn jaren, hij zal voor zich zelven spreken!
[9:22] Dit zeiden zijn ouders, omdat zij de Joden vreesden. Want alreeds hadden de Joden onder malkander besloten, dat zoo iemand Hem voor den Christus beleed, die uit de synagoge zou gebannen worden.
[9:23] Daarom zeiden zijn ouders: Hij heeft zijn jaren, ondervraagt hem!
[9:24] Zij riepen dan ten tweeden male den man, die blind was geweest, en zeiden tot hem: Geef de glorie aan God! wij weten dat die man een zondaar is.
[9:25] Hij dan antwoordde: Of Hij een zondaar is weet ik niet; één ding weet ik, dat ik blind was en nu zie!
[9:26] Zij zeiden dan tot hem: Wat heeft Hij u gedaan? hoe heeft Hij u de oogen geopend?
[9:27] Hij antwoordde hun: Ik heb het u al gezegd en gij hebt niet geluisterd; wat wilt gij het nog eens hooren? ook gij wilt toch niet zijn discipelen worden?
[9:28] Zij scholden hem en zeiden: Gij zijt een discipel van dezen, maar wij zijn discipelen van Mozes!
[9:29] Wij weten dat God tot Mozes heeft gesproken, maar wat dezen aangaat, wij weten niet vanwaar Hij is!
[9:30] De man antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Daarin is toch een mirakel, dat gij niet weet vanwaar Hij is, en toch heeft Hij mij de oogen geopend!
[9:31] Wij weten dat God geen zondaars hoort, maar als iemand godvruchtig is en zijn wil doet, dien hoort Hij.
[9:32] Van ouds af is het niet gehoord dat iemand de oogen geopend heeft van een blindgeborene.
[9:33] Als deze niet van God was, dan zou Hij niets kunnen doen.
[9:34] Zij antwoordden en zeiden tot hem: Gij zijt geheel in zonden geboren, en gij leert ons? — En zij wierpen hem buiten. 
[9:35]  Jezus hoorde dat ze hem buiten geworpen hadden, en vond hem, en zeide: Gelooft gij in den Zoon van God?
[9:36] Hij antwoordde en zeide: Wie is Hij, Heere, opdat ik in Hem geloove?
[9:37] Jezus zeide tot hem: En gij hebt Hem gezien, en die met u spreekt, die is het!
[9:38] Hij dan zeide: Ik geloof, Heere! — en hij knielde voor Hem neder.
[9:39] En Jezus zeide: Tot een oordeel ben Ik gekomen tot deze wereld, opdat zij die niet zien, zouden zien, en zij die zien, blind zouden worden!
[9:40] Eenigen uit de fariseërs, die bij Hem waren, hoorden dit en zeiden tot Hem: Wij zijn toch ook niet blind?
[9:41] Jezus zeide tot hen: Als gij blind waart, dan zoudt gij geen zonde hebben, maar nu gij zegt: Wij zien! zoo blijft uw zonde.  
[10:1] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Die niet ingaat door de deur naar den schaapstal, maar inklimt van elders, die is een dief en moordenaar.
[10:2] Maar die ingaat door de deur, is een herder der schapen.
[10:3] Aan dezen doet de deurwachter open, en de schapen hooren zijn stem, en zijn eigen schapen roept hij bij name en leidt ze uit.
[10:4] En als hij zijn eigen schapen uitgedreven heeft, dan gaat hij vóór hen, en de schapen volgen hem, omdat ze zijn stem kennen.
[10:5] Een vreemdeling nu zullen zij niet volgen, maar zij zullen van hem vluchten, omdat zij de stem der vreemdelingen niet kennen.
[10:6] Deze gelijkenis sprak Jezus tot hen, maar zij verstonden niet wat het was, waarover Hij tot hen sprak. 
[10:7]  Jezus dan zeide: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Ik ben de Deur der schapen!
[10:8] Allen, zooveel als er vóór Mij gekomen zijn, die zijn dieven en moordenaars, maar de schapen hebben naar hen niet gehoord.
[10:9] Ik ben de Deur; als iemand door Mij ingaat, die zal behouden worden, en hij zal ingaan, en uitgaan, en weide vinden.
[10:10] De dief komt niet dan om te stelen, en te slachten, en te verderven; Ik ben gekomen opdat zij leven hebben en overvloed hebben. 
[10:11]  Ik ben de Goede Herder; de goede herder legt zijn leven af voor de schapen.
[10:12] Maar de daglooner, en die geen herder is, aan wien de schapen niet toebehooren, ziet den wolf aankomen, en verlaat de schapen, en vlucht; en de wolf rooft en verjaagt de schapen.
[10:13] En de daglooner vlucht omdat hij daglooner is en zich de schapen niet aantrekt.
[10:14] Ik ben de Goede Herder, en Ik ken de mijnen en de mijnen kennen Mij,
[10:15] zooals de Vader Mij kent en Ik den Vader ken; en mijn leven leg Ik af voor de schapen.
[10:16] Nog andere schapen heb Ik, die niet zijn uit dezen stal; ook die moet ik toebrengen, en mijn stem zullen zij hooren, en het zal worden één kudde, één Herder.
[10:17] Daarom bemint de Vader Mij, omdat Ik mijn leven afleg, opdat Ik het wederom neme.
[10:18] Niemand neemt het van Mij af, maar Ik leg het van Mij zelven af; Ik heb macht om het af te leggen, en Ik heb macht om het wederom te nemen; dit gebod heb Ik ontvangen van mijn Vader. 
[10:19]  Wederom kwam er tweedracht onder de Joden om deze woorden.
[10:20] Velen dan uit hen zeiden: Hij heeft een boozen geest en is zot: Wat luistert gij naar Hem?
[10:21] Anderen zeiden: Dit zijn geen woorden van een bezetene! een booze geest kan toch niet der blinden oogen openen? 
[10:22]  En het was het feest der tempelwijding in Jerusalem; het was winter.
[10:23] En Jezus wandelde in den tempel, in de gaanderij van Salomo.
[10:24] De Joden dan omringden Hem en zeiden tot Hem: Tot wanneer houdt Gij onze ziel in twijfel? Als Gij de Christus zijt, zeg het ons dan vrij uit!
[10:25] Jezus antwoordde: Ik heb tot u gesproken, en gij gelooft niet; de werken die Ik doe in den Naam mijns Vaders, die getuigen van Mij.
[10:26] Maar gij gelooft niet, omdat gij niet van mijn schapen zijt.
[10:27] Mijn schapen hooren naar mijn stem, en Ik ken ze, en zij volgen Mij,
[10:28] en Ik geef hun eeuwig leven, en zij zullen geenszins verloren gaan in der eeuwigheid, en niemand zal ze rooven uit mijn hand.
[10:29] Mijn Vader die ze Mij gegeven heeft, is meer dan allen, en niemand kan ze rooven uit de hand mijns Vaders.
[10:30] Ik en de Vader zijn één. 
[10:31]  De Joden namen wederom steenen op om Hem te steenigen.
[10:32] Jezus antwoordde hun: Veel goede werken heb Ik ulieden getoond uit mijn Vader, om welk werk van die steenigt gij Mij?
[10:33] De Joden antwoordden Hem: Om een goed werk steenigen wij U niet, maar om lastering, en omdat Gij, die een mensch zijt, U zelven God maakt!;
[10:34] Jezus antwoordde hun: Is er niet geschreven in uw, wet: Ik heb gezegd, gij zijt goden?
[10:35] Als de wet dan die goden noemde, tot wie Gods woord: geschiedde, en de Schrifture niet kan gebroken worden,
[10:36] zegt gij dan tot Hem, dien de Vader heeft geheiligd en tot de wereld gezonden: Gij lastert! omdat Ik gezegd heb: Gods Zoon ben Ik?
[10:37] Als Ik de werken mijns Vaders niet doe, gelooft in Mij dan niet.
[10:38] Maar als Ik ze doe en gij gelooft in Mij niet, gelooft dan in de werken, opdat gij moogt weten en gelooven dat de Vader in Mij is en Ik in den Vader. 
[10:39]  Zij zochten Hem dan te grijpen, en Hij ontkwam uit hun hand.
[10:40] En Hij ging wederom over den Jordaan naar de plaats waar Johannes eerst, doopende was, en Hij bleef aldaar.
[10:41] En velen kwamen tot Hem en zeiden: Johannes deed wel geen mirakel, maar alles wat Johannes van dezen zeide, was waar.
[10:42] En velen geloofden aldaar in Hem.  
[11:1] Er was nu een zekere kranke, Lazarus van Bethanië, uit het dorp van Maria en Martha, haar zuster.
[11:2] Maria nu was het die den Heere zalfde met balsem en zijn voeten afdroogde met haar hoofdhaar, wier broeder Lazarus krank was.
[11:3] De zusters dan zonden tot Jezus, zeggende: Heere, zie, dien Gij bemint is krank!
[11:4] Toen Jezus dit hoorde zeide Hij: Deze krankheid is niet ten doode, maar om Gods glorie, opdat de Zone Gods door haar verheerlijkt worde!
[11:5] Jezus nu beminde Martha en haar zuster en Lazarus.
[11:6] Toen Hij dan gehoord had dat Lazarus krank was, bleef Hij twee dagen in de plaats waar Hij was.
[11:7] Maar daarna zeide Hij tot de discipelen: Laat ons wederom naar Judea gaan.
[11:8] De discipelen zeiden tot Hem: Meester! kortgeleden zochten de Joden U te steenigen, en wederom gaat Gij derwaarts?
[11:9] Jezus antwoordde: Zijn er niet twaalf uren in den dag? Als iemand bij dag wandelt dan struikelt hij niet, omdat hij het licht dezer wereld ziet; 
[11:10] maar als iemand bij nacht wandelt, dan struikelt hij, omdat het licht in hem niet is.
[11:11] Dit sprak Hij; en daarna zeide Hij tot hen: Lazarus, onze vriend, is ingeslapen, maar Ik ga hem wakker maken.
[11:12] De discipelen dan zeiden tot Hem: Heere, als hij is ingeslapen, zal hij genezen worden!
[11:13] Doch Jezus had gesproken van zijn dood, maar de discipelen meenden dat Hij sprak van de rust des slaaps.
[11:14] Toen zeide Jezus dan vrij uit tot hen: Lazarus is gestorven,
[11:15] en Ik verheug Mij om uwentwil dat Ik daar niet was, opdat gij gelooven moogt; maar laat ons tot hem gaan.
[11:16] Thomas dan, genaamd de Tweeling, zeide tot de medediscipelen: Laat ons ook gaan opdat wij met Hem sterven! 
[11:17]  Jezus dan kwam en bevond dat Lazarus al vier dagen in het graf lag.
[11:18] Bethanië nu was dicht bij Jerusalem, omtrent vijftien stadiën.
[11:19] Velen dan uit de Joden waren tot Martha en Maria gekomen, om haar over haar broeder te vertroosten.
[11:20] Martha dan, toen zij hoorde dat Jezus kwam, ging Hem te gemoet, doch Maria bleef in huis zitten.
[11:21] Martha dan zeide tot Jezus: Heere, als Gij hier geweest waart, dan zou mijn broeder niet zijn gestorven!
[11:22] Maar ook nu weet ik dat God U zal geven al wat Gij van God begeert!
[11:23] Jezus zeide tot haar: Uw broeder zal verrijzen!
[11:24] Martha zeide tot Hem: Ik weet dat hij zal verrijzen in de verrijzenis ten laatsten dage.
[11:25] Jezus zeide tot haar: Ik ben de verrijzenis en het leven; die in Mij gelooft, zal leven, ook al was hij gestorven,
[11:26] en alwie leeft en in Mij gelooft, zal geenszins sterven in eeuwigheid! — Gelooft gij dat?
[11:27] Zij zeide tot Hem: Ja Heere! ik heb geloofd dat Gij de Christus zijt, de Zone Gods, die tot de wereld komt!
[11:28] En dit zeggende, ging zij weg en riep Maria, haar zuster, in stilte zeggende: De Meester is daar en Hij roept u!
[11:29] Toen deze dit hoorde stond zij haastig op en kwam tot Hem.
[11:30] Jezus nu was nog niet gekomen tot aan het dorp, maar Hij was op de plaats waar Martha Hem te gemoet was gekomen.
[11:31] De Joden dan, die bij haar in het huis waren, en haar vertroostten, zagen Maria haastig opstaan en uitgaan, en zij volgden haar, meenende dat zij naar het graf ging om daar te weenen.
[11:32] Maria dan, zoodra zij kwam waar Jezus was, en Hem zag, viel voor zijn voeten en zeide tot Hem: Heere, als Gij hier geweest waart, dan zou mijn broeder niet gestorven zijn!
[11:33] Jezus dan, toen Hij haar zag weenen en de Joden die met haar gekomen waren, insgelijks weenen, werd verontwaardigd in den geest en ontroerde,
[11:34] en zeide: Waar hebt gij hem gelegd? — Zij zeiden tot Hem: Heere, kom en zie!
[11:35] Jezus weende.
[11:36] De Joden dan zeiden: Zie, hoe Hij hem beminde!
[11:37] Sommigen nu uit hen zeiden: Had deze, die de oogen des blinden opende, niet kunnen maken dat ook deze niet gestorven was?
[11:38] Jezus dan, wederom verontwaardigd zijnde in zich zelven, kwam tot het graf; en het was een spelonk en een steen was daarop gelegd.
[11:39] Jezus zeide: Neemt den steen weg! De zuster van den gestorvene, Martha, zeide tot Hem: Heere, hij riekt al, want al vier dagen is hij dood!
[11:40] Jezus zeide tot haar: Heb Ik u niet gezegd dat gij Gods glorie zoudt zien, als gij gelooft?
[11:41] Zij namen dan den steen weg. En Jezus sloeg de oogen naar boven en zeide: Vader, Ik dank U dat Gij Mij gehoord hebt; 
[11:42] doch Ik wist dat Gij Mij altijd hoort; maar ter wille van de schare die rondom staat, heb Ik gesproken, opdat zij zouden gelooven dat Gij Mij gezonden hebt.
[11:43] En dit gezegd hebbende, riep Hij met een luide stem: Lazarus, kom uit!
[11:44] De doode kwam uit, gebonden aan handen en voeten met windselen, en zijn aangezicht was bewonden met een zweetdoek. En Jezus zeide tot hen: Maakt hem los, en laat hem weggaan! 
[11:45]  Velen dan uit de Joden, die tot Maria gekomen waren en gezien hadden wat Jezus gedaan had, geloofden in Hem.
[11:46] Maar sommigen uit hen gingen heen tot de fariseërs en zeiden hun wat Jezus gedaan had. 
[11:47]  De overpriesters dan en de fariseërs vergaderden den Raad en zeiden: Wat gaan wij doen? Want deze mensch doet veel mirakelen!
[11:48] Als wij Hem zoo laten voortgaan, dan zullen allen in Hem gelooven, en de Romeinen zullen komen en onze plaats en ons volk beide wegnemen!
[11:49] En één uit hen, Kajafas, die dat jaar hoogepriester was, zeide tot hen: Gij verstaat niets,
[11:50] en gij bedenkt niet dat voor u beter is dat één mensch sterve voor het volk, en niet de geheele natie verloren ga
[11:51] — Dit nu zeide hij niet van zich zelven, maar, dat jaar hoogepriester zijnde, profeteerde hij dat Jezus zou sterven voor de natie,
[11:52] en niet alleen voor die natie, maar opdat Hij ook de kinderen Gods, die verstrooid waren, tot één zou vergaderen.
[11:53] Van dien dag af dan beraadslaagden zij om Hem te dooden. 
[11:54]  Jezus dan wandelde niet meer vrij onder de Joden, maar ging vandaar naar de landstreek, dicht bij de woestijn, naar een stad genaamd Efraïm; en daar verbleef Hij met de discipelen.
[11:55] Het Paaschfeest der Joden was nu nabij; en velen uit die landstreek gingen op naar Jerusalem voor het Paaschfeest, om zich te zuiveren.
[11:56] Zij zochten dan Jezus en zeiden onder malkander, toen ze in den tempel stonden: Wat dunkt u? zou Hij niet naar het feest komen?
[11:57] De overpriesters nu en de fariseërs hadden geboden dat, zoo iemand wist waar Hij was, hij het zou aanbrengen, opdat ze Hem vangen zouden.  
[12:1] Jezus dan kwam zes dagen vóór Paschen naar Bethanië, waar Lazarus was dien Hij had opgewekt uit de dooden.
[12:2] Zij maakten Hem dan aldaar een avondmaaltijd gereed, en Martha bediende, en Lazarus was een van degenen die met Hem aan de tafel lagen.
[12:3] Maria dan nam een pond balsem van zuiveren kostbaren nardus, en zalfde de voeten van Jezus, en droogde met haar hoofdhaar zijn voeten af; en het huis werd vervuld met den reuk des balsems.
[12:4] Judas Iskariot nu, een van zijn discipelen, die Hem zou verraden, zeide:
[12:5] Waarom dezen balsem niet verkocht voor driehonderd penningen, en den armen gegeven?
[12:6] Dit nu zeide hij, niet omdat hij voor de afmen bekommerd was, maar omdat hij een dief was, en de kas hield, en wegnam wat er werd in gedaan.
[12:7] Jezus zeide dan: Laat haar doen! opdat zij het beware tot den dag mijner begrafenis.
[12:8] Want de armen hebt gij altijd met u, maar Mij hebt gij niet altijd. 
[12:9]  Een groote schare dan uit de Joden vernam dat Hij daar was, en zij kwamen niet alleen om Jezus, maar opdat zij ook Lazarus zouden zien dien Hij uit de dooden verwekt had.
[12:10] De overpriesters dan hielden samen raad om ook Lazarus te dooden,
[12:11] want om zijnentwil gingen velen der Joden weg en geloofden in Jezus. 
[12:12]  Des anderen daags, toen een groote schare die naar het feest gekomen was, hoorde dat Jezus naar Jerusalem kwam,
[12:13] namen zij takken van palmboomen en gingen uit Hem te gemoet, en riepen: Hosannah! Geprezen Hij, die komt in den Naam des Heeren, de Koning Israëls!
[12:14] Jezus nu vond een jongen ezel en ging daarop zitten, zooals geschreven is:
[12:15] Vrees niet, dochter Sions! zie, uw Koning komt, gezeten op het jong van een ezelin!
[12:16] Dit verstonden zijn discipelen in het eerst niet, maar toen Jezus in zijn glorie was, toen werden zij indachtig dat dit van Hem geschreven was en dat men Hem dit gedaan had.
[12:17] De schare dan, die bij Hem was, getuigde dat Hij Lazarus uit het graf had geroepen en hem uit de dooden verwekt had.
[12:18] Daarom ook ging de schare Hem te gemoet, omdat zij gehoord hadden dat Hij dit mirakel gedaan had.
[12:19] De fariseërs dan zeiden tot malkander: Gij ziet dat gij niets wint; zie, de geheele wereld loopt Hem na! 
[12:20]  Er waren nu eenige Grieken uit degenen die opgekomen waren om op het feest te aanbidden.
[12:21] Dezen dan wendden zich tot Filippus, die van Bethsaïda was in Galilea, en vroegen hem, zeggende: Heer, wij wilden Jezus wel zien!
[12:22] Filippus kwam en zeide het aan Andreas, en Andreas en Filippus kwamen en zeiden het aan Jezus. 
[12:23]  Jezus nu antwoordde en zeide tot hen: De ure is gekomen dat de Zoon des menschen de glorie zal ontvangen.
[12:24] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Als het tarwegraan niet in de aarde valt en sterft, dan blijft het alleen, maar als het sterft dan draagt het veel vrucht!
[12:25] Die zijn leven bemint zal het verliezen, en die zijn leven haat in deze wereld, die zal het bewaren ten eeuwigen leven.
[12:26] Indien iemand Mij dient, die volge Mij, en waar Ik ben, daar zal ook mijn dienaar zijn; wanneer iemand Mij dient, de Vader zal hem eeren. 
[12:27]  Nu is mijn ziel ontroerd, en wat zal Ik zeggen? — Vader, verlos Mij uit deze ure? — Maar hierom ben Ik in deze ure gekomen!
[12:28] Vader, verheerlijk uw Naam! — Er kwam dan een stem uit den hemel: En Ik heb Hem verheerlijkt en zal Hem wederom verheerlijken!
[12:29] De schare dan, die daar stond en het hoorde, zeide dat het een donderslag was geweest; anderen zeiden: Een engel heeft tot Hem gesproken!
[12:30] Jezus antwoordde en zeide: Niet om mijnentwil is deze stem geschied, maar om uwentwil!
[12:31] Nu is er een oordeel over deze wereld; nu zal de overste dezer wereld buiten geworpen worden.
[12:32] En Ik, als Ik van de aarde zal verhoogd zijn, zal allen tot Mij trekken!
[12:33] Dit nu zeide Hij, te kennen gevende welken dood Hij zou sterven. 
[12:34]  De schare dan antwoordde Hem: Wij hebben gehoord uit de wet dat de Christus in eeuwigheid blijft; en hoe zegt Gij dan dat de Zoon des menschen moet verhoogd worden? Wie is die Zoon des menschen?
[12:35] Jezus dan zeide tot hen: Nog een korten tijd is het licht onder ulieden; wandelt als die het licht hebt, opdat geen duisternis u overvalle; en die wandelt in de duisternis, weet niet waar hij heengaat.
[12:36] Als die het licht hebt; gelooft in het licht, opdat gij kinderen des lichts moogt, worden. 
[12:37]  Dit sprak Jezus en Hij ging weg en verbergde zich van hen. Hoewel Hij nu zooveel mirakelen gedaan had voor hun oogen, zoo geloofden zij toch niet in Hem;
[12:38] opdat het woord van Jesaja, den profeet, zou vervuld worden, dat hij gesproken heeft: Heere! wie heeft onze prediking geloofd? en de arm des Heeren, aan wien is hij geopenbaard?
[12:39] Daarom konden zij niet gelooven, want Jesaja zeide wederom:
[12:40] Hij heeft hun de oogen verblind, en het harte verhard, opdat zij niet zouden zien met de oogen en verstaan met het harte, en zich bekeeren en Ik hen geneze.
[12:41] Dit zeide Jesaja omdat hij zijn glorie zag en van Hem sprak. 
[12:42]  Nochtans geloofden ook velen van de oversten in Hem, maar om der fariseërs wil beleden zij het niet, om niet uit de synagoge geworpen te worden.
[12:43] Want zij beminden de glorie der menschen meer dan de glorie Gods.
[12:44] Jezus nu riep en zeide: Die in Mij gelooft, gelooft niet in Mij, maar in Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[12:45] En die Mij ziet, ziet Hem die Mij gezonden heeft!
[12:46] Ik, het Licht, ben tot de wereld gekomen opdat al wie in Mij gelooft, niet in de duisternis blijve.
[12:47] En als iemand mijn woorden hoort en niet bewaart, Ik oordeel hem niet, want Ik ben niet gekomen om de wereld te oordeelen, maar om de wereld te behouden.
[12:48] Die Mij verwerpt en mijn woorden niet aanneemt, die heeft zijn rechter; het woord dat Ik sprak, dat zal hem oordeelen ten laatsten dage.
[12:49] Want uit Mij zelven heb Ik niet gesproken, maar die Mij gezonden heeft, de Vader zelf, heeft Mij een gebod gegeven wat Ik zeggen en wat Ik spreken zou; 
[12:50] en Ik weet dat zijn gebod eeuwig leven is. Wat Ik dan spreek, spreek Ik zooals de Vader Mij gezegd heeft.  
[13:1] Voor het Paaschfeest nu, wetende dat zijn ure was gekomen om uit deze wereld over te gaan tot den Vader, heeft Jezus, de zijnen die in de wereld waren bemind hebbende, hen bemind tot het einde.
[13:2] En onder den maaltijd, toen de duivel aan Judas, Simons zoon Iskariot, reeds in het hart gegeven had om Hem te verraden,
[13:3] en wetende dat de Vader Hem alle dingen in de handen had gegeven, en dat Hij van God was uitgegaan en tot God heenging,
[13:4] stond Jezus op van den maaltijd en leide zijn kleederen af, en Hij nam een linnen doek en bond dien om zijn midden.
[13:5] Daarna goot Hij water in het bekken en begon de voeten der discipelen te wasschen en af te droogen met den linnen doek, dien Hij om zijn midden had.
[13:6] Hij kwam dan tot Simon Petrus. Die zeide tot Hem: Heere! Gij zult mij de voeten wasschen?
[13:7] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Wat Ik doe weet gij nu niet, maar hierna zult gij het verstaan!
[13:8] Petrus zeide tot Hem: Mij zult Gij de voeten niet wasschen in eeuwigheid! — Jezus antwoordde hem: Als Ik u niet wassche, dan hebt gij geen deel met Mij!
[13:9] Simon Petrus zeide tot Hem: Heere, niet mijn voeten alleen, maar ook de handen en het hoofd!
[13:10] Jezus zeide tot hem: Die een bad genomen heeft, heeft niet noodig dan zich de voeten te laten wasschen, maar is dan geheel rein; en gijlieden zijt rein, doch niet allen.
[13:11] Want Hij kende dengene die Hem verraden zou; daarom zeide Hij: Gij zijt niet allen rein.
[13:12] Toen Hij dan hun voeten gewasschen en zijn kleederen genomen had en wederom aanzat, zeide Hij tot hen: Verstaat gij wat Ik u gedaan heb?
[13:13] Gij noemt Mij den Meester en den Heer, en gij zegt dit te recht, want Ik ben het.
[13:14] Maar als Ik, de Heer en de Meester, u dan de voeten heb gewasschen, dan zijt ook gij verplicht malkander de voeten te wasschen.
[13:15] Een voorbeeld toch heb Ik u gegeven, opdat ook gij doet zooals Ik aan u gedaan heb. 
[13:16]  Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Een dienstknecht is niet meer dan zijn heer, en een gezant niet meer dan hij die hem gezonden heeft.
[13:17] Zoo gij deze dingen weet, zalig zijt gij als gij ze doet.
[13:18] Niet van u allen spreek Ik; Ik weet wie Ik heb uitverkoren; maar de Schrifture moet vervuld worden: Die met Mij het brood eet, heeft tegen Mij achteruit geslagen.
[13:19] Van nu af zeg Ik het ulieden, vóórdat het geschiedt, opdat gij gelooft, wanneer het geschiedt, dat Ik het ben.
[13:20] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Die ontvangt dengene dien Ik zenden zal, die ontvangt Mij, en die Mij ontvangt, ontvangt Hem die Mij gezonden heeft.
[13:21] Toen Jezus dit gezegd had ontroerde Hij naar den geest, en getuigde en zeide: Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden, dat een uit u Mij verraden zal!
[13:22] De discipelen zagen op malkander, niet wetende van wien Hij sprak.
[13:23] Een uit zijn discipelen nu lag in den schoot van Jezus, dien Jezus liefhad.
[13:24] Simon Petrus dan gaf dezen een wenk en zeide tot hem: Zeg, wie is het van wien Hij spreekt?
[13:25] Deze dan leunende aan de borst van Jezus, zeide tot Hem: Heere, wie is het?
[13:26] Jezus antwoordde: Die is het, wien Ik de bete zal indoopen en hem geven. — Hij doopte dan de bete in, en nam ze, en gaf ze aan Judas, Simons zoon Iskariot.
[13:27] En na de bete, toen voer de Satan in dezen. Jezus dan zeide tot hem: Wat gij doet, doe het spoedig!
[13:28] Doch niemand der aanliggenden verstond waartoe Hij hem dat zeide.
[13:29] Want sommigen meenden, omdat Judas de kas hield, dat Jezus tot hem zeide: Koop wat wij voor het feest van noode hebben, of, dat hij den armen wat zou geven.
[13:30] Hij dan, de bete genomen hebbende, ging spoedig uit. — En het was nacht. 
[13:31]  Toen hij dan uitgegaan was, zeide Jezus: Nu heeft de Zoon des menschen de glorie ontvangen, en God heeft in Hem de glorie ontvangen.
[13:32] Als God in Hem de glorie heeft ontvangen, dan zal God Hem ook in zich zelven de glorie doen ontvangen, en zal Hem terstond de glorie doen ontvangen!
[13:33] Kinderkens! nog een korten tijd ben Ik met ulieden. Gij zult Mij zoeken, en gelijk Ik den Joden gezegd heb: Waar Ik heenga kunt gij niet komen, zoo zeg Ik het nu ook aan ulieden!
[13:34] Een nieuw gebod geef Ik u, dat gij malkander bemint; dat gij malkander bemint zooals Ik ulieden bemind heb.
[13:35] Hierdoor zullen allen bekennen dat gij mijn discipelen zijt, als gij liefde hebt onder malkander. 
[13:36]  Simon Petrus zeide tot Hem: Heere, waar gaat Gij heen? Jezus antwoordde: Waar Ik heenga kunt gij Mij nu niet volgen, maar later zult gij Mij volgen.
[13:37] Petrus zeide tot Hem: Heere! waarom kan ik U nu niet volgen? mijn leven zal ik voor U stellen!
[13:38] Jezus antwoordde: Gij zult uw leven voor Mij stellen? — voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg u: De haan zal niet kraaien voordat Gij Mij driemaal verloochend hebt!  
[14:1] Uw hart zij niet ontroerd; gij gelooft in God, gelooft ook in Mij.
[14:2] In het huis mijns Vaders zijn veel woningen; zoo niet, dan zou Ik het u, gezegd hebben! — Want Ik ga voor ulieden plaats bereiden.
[14:3] En als Ik heengegaan zal zijn en voor u plaats bereid zal hebben, dan kom Ik weder en Ik zal u tot Mij nemen, opdat gij ook zijn moogt waar Ik ben.
[14:4] En waar Ik heenga weet gij, en den; weg weet gij. 
[14:5]  Thomas zeide tot Hem: Heere! wij weten niet waar Gij heengaat, en hoe kunnen wij den weg weten?
[14:6] Jezus zeide tot hem: Ik ben de weg, en de waarheid, en het leven; niemand komt tot den Vader dan door Mij.
[14:7] Als gij Mij gekend hadt dan zoudt gij ook mijn Vader gekend hebben; en van nu af kent gij Hem en hebt gij Hem gezien. 
[14:8]  Filippus zeide tot Hem: Heere, laat ons den Vader zien, en het is ons genoeg!
[14:9] Jezus zeide tot hem: Zoo langen tijd ben Ik bij u, en gij kent Mij niet, Filippus? — Die Mij heeft gezien, die heeft den Vader gezien; hoe zegt gij: Laat ons den Vader zien?
[14:10] Gelooft gij niet dat Ik in den Vader ben en de Vader in Mij is? De woorden die Ik spreek tot ulieden, die spreek Ik niet van Mij zelven, maar de Vader die in Mij blijft, doet zelf de werken.
[14:11] Gelooft Mij, Ik ben in den Vader, en de Vader is in Mij; en zoo niet, gelooft dan om de werken zelven.
[14:12] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Die in Mij gelooft, de werken die Ik doe, zal hij ook doen en grootere dan deze zal hij doen, omdat Ik tot den Vader ga; 
[14:13] en wat gij ook zult begeeren in mijn Naam, dat zal Ik doen, opdat de Vader in den Zoon de glorie ontvange.
[14:14] Indien gij in mijn Naam iets begeeren zult, Ik zal het doen. 
[14:15]  Indien gij Mij bemint, zoo zult gij mijn geboden bewaren,
[14:16] en Ik zal den Vader vragen, en een anderen Bijstand zal Hij u geven, opdat Hij bij u zij tot in eeuwigheid; 
[14:17] den Geest der waarheid, dien de wereld niet kan ontvangen, omdat zij Hem niet ziet, noch Hem kent; maar gij kent Hem, omdat Hij bij u blijft en in u zal zijn. 
[14:18]  Niet als weezen zal Ik u laten! Ik kom tot u.
[14:19] Nog een weinig en de wereld ziet Mij niet meer maar gij ziet Mij, omdat Ik leef en gij zult leven.
[14:20] In dien dag zult gij weten dat Ik in mijn Vader ben, en gij in Mij, en Ik in u.
[14:21] Die mijn geboden heeft en ze bewaart, die is het die Mij bemint; en die Mij bemint, zal door mijn Vader bemind worden, en Ik zal hem beminnen en Mij zelven aan hem openbaren.
[14:22] Judas— niet Iskariot— zeide tot Hem: Heere, wat zal er gebeuren, dat Gij U zelven zult openbaren aan ons, en niet aan de wereld?
[14:23] Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Als iemand Mij bemint, dan zal hij mijn woord bewaren, en mijn Vader zal hem beminnen, en tot hem zullen Wij komen en woonplaats bij hem maken.
[14:24] Die Mij niet bemint, die bewaart mijn woorden niet; en het woord dat gij hoort is niet het mijne, maar des Vaders die Mij gezonden heeft. 
[14:25]  Dit heb Ik tot ulieden gesproken terwijl Ik bij u blijf.
[14:26] Maar de Bijstand, de Heilige Geest, dien de Vader zal zenden in mijn Naam, die zal u alles leeren en zal u in gedachtenis brengen alles wat Ik u gezegd heb.
[14:27] Vrede laat Ik u; mijn vrede geef Ik u; niet zooals de wereld geeft, geef Ik u. Uw harte zij niet ontroerd, noch bevreesd!
[14:28] Gij hebt gehoord dat Ik tot u gezegd heb: Ik ga heen en Ik kom tot u. — Als gij Mij bemindet, dan zoudt gij u verblijden, omdat Ik tot den Vader ga, want de Vader is meer dan Ik.
[14:29] En nu heb Ik het u gezegd, eer het gebeurt, opdat gij zoudt gelooven als het gebeurd is.
[14:30] Niet veel zal Ik met u meer spreken; want de overste der wereld komt, en in Mij heeft hij niets.
[14:31] Maar opdat de wereld wete dat Ik den Vader bemin, en dat Ik zoo doe als Mij de Vader geboden heeft: Staat op, laat ons vanhier gaan!  
[15:1] Ik ben de ware Wijnstok, en mijn Vader is de Landman.
[15:2] Alle ranke in Mij, die een vrucht draagt, die neemt Hij weg, en al die vrucht draagt, die reinigt Hij, opdat zij meer vrucht drage.
[15:3] Gijlieden zijt al rein, om het woord dat Ik tot u gesproken heb.
[15:4] Blijft in Mij, en Ik in u. Evenals de ranke geen vrucht kan dragen uit zich zelve, als zij niet blijft in den wijnstok, alzoo ook gij niet, als gij in Mij niet blijft.
[15:5] Ik ben de Wijnstok; gij zijt de ranken. Die in Mij blijft, en Ik in hem, die draagt veel vrucht, omdat gij zonder Mij niets kunt doen.
[15:6] Als iemand niet in Mij blijft, die wordt buiten geworpen, zooals de ranke, en verdroogt; en men vergadert ze en werpt ze in het vuur, en zij verbrandt.
[15:7] Zoo gij in Mij blijft en mijn woorden blijven in u, zoo wat gij wilt, moogt gij begeeren, en het zal u geschieden.
[15:8] Hierin ontvangt mijn Vader de glorie, dat gij veel vrucht draagt, en gij zult mijn discipelen worden.
[15:9] Gelijk de Vader Mij heeft bemind, heb Ik ook u bemind. Blijft gij in mijn liefde!
[15:10] Als gij mijn geboden onderhoudt, dan blijft gij in mijn liefde, gelijk ook Ik mijns Vaders geboden onderhouden heb, en blijf in zijn liefde. 
[15:11]  Dit heb Ik tot u gesproken opdat mijn blijdschap in u zij, en uw blijdschap volkomen worde.
[15:12] Dit is mijn gebod, dat gij elkander bemint zooals Ik u bemind heb.
[15:13] Grooter liefde heeft niemand dan deze, dat hij zijn leven stelt voor zijn vrienden!
[15:14] Gij zijt vrienden van Mij, als gij doet wat Ik u gebied.
[15:15] Ik noem u geen dienstknechten meer, want de dienstknecht weet niet wat zijn heer doet; maar u heb Ik vrienden genoemd, want al wat Ik heb gehoord van den Vader, dat heb Ik u bekend gemaakt.
[15:16] Niet gij hebt Mij uitverkoren, maar Ik heb ulieden uitverkoren, en u gesteld opdat gij zoudt heengaan, en vrucht dragen, en dat uw vrucht zou blijven, opdat, wat gij ook van den Vader zoudt begeeren in mijn Naam, Hij u dat geve.
[15:17] Dit gebied Ik u, opdat gij malkander bemint. 
[15:18]  Als de wereld u haat, weet dan dat zij Mij eer gehaat heeft, dan u.
[15:19] Als gij uit de wereld waart, dan zou de wereld het hare beminnen; maar omdat gij uit de wereld niet zijt, maar Ik u heb uitverkoren uit de wereld, daarom haat u de wereld.
[15:20] Weest mijn woord indachtig dat Ik tot u gesproken heb: Een dienstknecht is niet meer dan zijn heer. Als zij Mij vervolgd hebben, zullen zij ook u vervolgen; als zij mijn woord bewaard hebben, zullen zij ook het uwe bewaren.
[15:21] Maar dit alles zullen zij doen tegen u om mijn Naam, omdat zij Hem niet kennen die Mij gezonden heeft.
[15:22] Als Ik niet was gekomen en tot hen had gesproken, dan hadden zij geen zonde gehad. Maar nu hebben zij geen verontschuldiging voor hun zonde.
[15:23] Die Mij haat, haat ook mijn Vader.
[15:24] Als Ik onder hen de werken niet had gedaan, die niemand anders gedaan heeft, dan hadden zij geen zonde gehad. Maar nu hebben zij ze gezien, en toch Mij en mijn Vader gehaat.
[15:25] Maar dit geschiedt opdat het woord vervuld worde, dat in hun wet is geschreven: Zij hebben Mij gehaat zonder reden.
[15:26] Maar als de Bijstand zal gekomen zijn, dien Ik u zal zenden van den Vader, den Geest der waarheid, die van den Vader uitgaat, die zal getuigenis geven van Mij; 
[15:27] en ook gij zult getuigenis geven, omdat gij van den beginne met Mij zijt.  
[16:1] Dit heb Ik tot u gesproken opdat gij u niet ergert.
[16:2] Zij zullen u uit de synagogen verbannen; er zal zelfs een ure komen dat al wie u zal dooden, zal meenen Gode een dienst te doen.
[16:3] En dit zullen zij doen, omdat zij den Vader niet gekend hebben, noch Mij.
[16:4] Maar dit heb Ik tot u gesproken, opdat, als de ure zal gekomen zijn, gij er aan gedenken zoudt, dat Ik het u gezegd heb. Dit heb Ik u van den beginne af niet gezegd, omdat Ik met u was. 
[16:5]  Maar nu ga Ik heen tot Hem die Mij gezonden heeft, en niemand uit u vraagt Mij: Waar gaat Gij heen?
[16:6] Maar omdat Ik dit tot u gesproken heb, heeft de droefheid uw harte vervuld.
[16:7] Toch zeg Ik u de waarheid: Het is u tot voordeel dat Ik wegga, want als Ik niet wegga dan zal de Bijstand tot, u niet komen; maar als Ik wegga dan zal Ik Hem tot u zenden.
[16:8] En als die gekomen is dan zal Hij de wereld overtuigen van zonde, en van rechtvaardigheid, en van oordeel.
[16:9] Van zonde, omdat zij in Mij niet gelooven.
[16:10] Van rechtvaardigheid, omdat Ik tot den Vader ga, en gij Mij niet meer zult zien.
[16:11] Van oordeel, omdat de overste der wereld geoordeeld is.
[16:12] Nog veel heb Ik u te zeggen, maar gij kunt het nu niet verdragen.
[16:13] Maar als die zal gekomen zijn, de Geest der waarheid, die zal u leiden in de geheele waarheid; want van zich zelven zal Hij niet spreken, maar al wat Hij hoort zal Hij spreken, en de toekomende dingen zal Hij u verkondigen.
[16:14] Die zal Mij glorie toebrengen, want uit het mijne zal Hij nemen en ulieden verkondigen.
[16:15] Al wat de Vader heeft is het mijne; daarom zeide Ik dat Hij uit het mijne neemt en ulieden verkondigt. 
[16:16]  Een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij niet meer zien, en wederom een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij zien, want Ik ga heen tot den Vader.
[16:17] Eenigen uit zijn discipelen zeiden dan tot malkander: Wat is het, dat Hij tot ons zegt: Een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij niet zien, en wederom een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij zien, en: Want Ik ga heen tot den Vader?
[16:18] Zij zeiden dan: Wat is dat, wat Hij zegt: Een korten tijd? — Wij weten niet wat Hij zegt!
[16:19] Jezus bemerkte dat zij Hem wilden vragen, en zeide tot hen: Onderzoekt gij daarover met malkander dat Ik gezegd heb: Een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij niet zien, en wederom een korten tijd, en gij zult Mij zien?
[16:20] Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Gij zult weenen en schreien, maar de wereld zal zich verblijden; gijlieden zult bedroefd zijn, maar uw droefheid zal tot blijdschap worden!
[16:21] Wanneer de vrouw baart heeft zij droefheid, omdat haar ure is gekomen; maar als zij het kindeken gebaard heeft, dan gedenkt zij niet meer aan de smarte, vanwege de blijdschap dat er een mensch ter wereld is geboren.
[16:22] Ook gij dan hebt nu wel droefheid, maar Ik zal u wederom zien, en uw harte zal zich verblijden, en uw blijdschap zal niemand van u wegnemen.
[16:23] En in dien dag zult gij Mij niets vragen. Voorwaar, voorwaar Ik zeg ulieden: Al wat gij den Vader bidden zult, zal Hij u geven in mijn Naam.
[16:24] Tot nu toe hebt gij om niets gebeden in mijn Naam. — Bidt, en gij zult ontvangen, opdat uw blijdschap volkomen zij! 
[16:25]  Dit heb Ik tot u gesproken in gelijkenissen; er komt een ure, dat Ik niet meer in gelijkenissen tot u zal spreken, maar u vrij uit van den Vader zal verkondigen.
[16:26] In dien dag zult gij bidden in mijn Naam, en Ik zeg u niet dat Ik den Vader voor u zal bidden,
[16:27] want de Vader zelf bemint u, omdat gij Mij bemind hebt, en geloofd hebt dat Ik van God ben uitgegaan.
[16:28] Ik ben uit den Vader uitgegaan en gekomen tot de wereld: Wederom verlaat Ik de wereld en ga Ik tot den Vader.
[16:29] Zijn discipelen zeiden: Zie, nu spreekt Gij vrij uit, en geen gelijkenis spreekt Gij!
[16:30] Nu weten wij dat Gij alles weet en niet van noode hebt dat iemand U vraagt; daardoor gelooven wij dat Gij van God zijt uitgegaan.
[16:31] Jezus antwoordde hun: Nu gelooft gij?
[16:32] Ziet, er komt een ure en die is gekomen, dat gij zult verstrooid worden, een ieder naar het zijne, en dat gij Mij alleen zult laten. En toch, Ik ben niet alleen, want de Vader is met Mij.
[16:33] Dit heb Ik tot u gesproken opdat gij in Mij vrede hebt. In de wereld hebt gij verdrukking, maar houdt moed! Ik heb de wereld overwonnen.  
[17:1] Dit sprak Jezus, en zijn oogen opheffende naar den hemel, zeide Hij: Vader, de ure is gekomen; geef aan uw Zoon de glorie, opdat uw Zoon U de glorie geve,
[17:2] gelijk Gij Hem macht hebt gegeven over alle vleesch, opdat Hij aan allen, die Gij Hem gegeven hebt, eeuwig leven geve!
[17:3] Dit nu is het eeuwige leven dat zij U kennen, den eenigen waarachtigen God en dien Gij gezonden hebt, Jezus Christus.
[17:4] Ik heb U de glorie gegeven op de aarde; het werk heb Ik volbracht dat Gij Mij hebt gegeven om te doen.
[17:5] En nu, geef Gij Mij de glorie, o Vader! bij U zelven, de glorie die Ik bij U had, eer de wereld was. 
[17:6]  Ik heb uw Naam bekend gemaakt aan de menschen die Gij Mij gegeven hebt uit de wereld. De uwen waren zij en aan Mij hebt Gij hen gegeven, en uw woord hebben zij bewaard.
[17:7] Nu erkennen zij dat alles van U is, wat Gij Mij gegeven hebt.
[17:8] Want de woorden, die Gij Mij hebt gegeven, heb Ik hun gegeven, en zij hebben ze aangenomen, en zij hebben waarlijk erkend dat Ik van U uitgegaan ben en zij hebben geloofd dat Gij Mij gezonden hebt.
[17:9] Ik bid voor hen; niet voor de wereld bid Ik, maar voor hen die Gij Mij gegeven hebt, want zij zijn de uwen.
[17:10] En al het mijne is het uwe, en het uwe is het mijne, en Ik heb in hen mijn glorie.
[17:11] En Ik ben niet meer in de wereld, maar dezen zijn in de wereld, en Ik kom tot U, Heilige Vader! bewaar hen in uw Naam dien Gij Mij gegeven hebt, opdat zij één zijn, zooals Wij.
[17:12] Toen Ik met hen was bewaarde Ik hen in uw Naam dien Gij Mij gegeven hebt; en Ik heb hen bewaard, en niemand uit hen is verloren, maar wel de zoon des verderfs, opdat de Schrifture vervuld worde.
[17:13] Maar nu kom Ik tot U, en dit spreek Ik in de wereld, opdat zij mijn blijdschap volkomen mogen hebben in zich zelven.
[17:14] Ik heb hun uw woord gegeven, en de wereld heeft hen gehaat, omdat zij niet zijn uit de wereld, zooals Ik niet ben uit de wereld.
[17:15] Ik bid niet dat Gij hen wegneemt uit de wereld, maar dat Gij hen bewaart van den kwade.
[17:16] Uit de wereld zijn zij niet, zooals Ik niet uit de wereld ben.
[17:17] Heilig ze in de waarheid: Uw woord is waarheid!
[17:18] Gelijk Gij Mij tot de wereld hebt gezonden, heb Ik ook hen tot de wereld gezonden,
[17:19] en voor hen heilig Ik Mij zelven, opdat ook zij geheiligd mogen zijn in waarheid. 
[17:20]  Doch niet voor dezen alleen bid Ik, maar ook voor degenen die door hun woord in Mij gelooven,
[17:21] opdat zij allen één mogen zijn, gelijk Gij, Vader, in Mij, en Ik in U, dat ook dezen één zijn in ons, opdat de wereld geloove dat Gij Mij hebt gezonden.
[17:22] En Ik heb hun de glorie gegeven die Gij Mij gegeven hebt, opdat zij één zijn, zooals Wij één zijn.
[17:23] Ik in hen, en Gij in Mij, opdat zij volmaakt zijn tot één, opdat de wereld bekenne dat Gij Mij hebt gezonden en dat Gij hen bemind hebt, zooals Gij Mij bemind hebt.
[17:24] Vader! die Gij Mij hebt gegeven, die wil Ik, dat ook met Mij zijn waar Ik ben, opdat zij mijn glorie aanschouwen mogen die Gij Mij hebt gegeven, omdat Gij Mij bemind hebt vóór de schepping der wereld. 
[17:25]  Rechtvaardige Vader! de wereld heeft U niet gekend, maar Ik heb U gekend, en dezen hebben erkend dat Gij Mij gezonden hebt; 
[17:26] en Ik heb hun uw Naam bekend gemaakt, en Ik zal hem bekend maken, opdat de liefde waarmede Gij Mij bemind hebt, in hen zij en Ik in hen.  
[18:1] Toen Jezus dit gesproken had, ging Hij met zijn discipelen uit over de beek Kedron, waar een hof was, naar denwelken Hij ging, Hij en zijn discipelen.
[18:2] Judas nu, de verrader, wist ook die plaats, omdat Jezus aldaar dikwijls met zijn discipelen vergaderd was. 
[18:3]  Judas dan nam de bende en dienaars van de overpriesters en fariseërs, en kwam aldaar met lantaarns, en fakkels, en wapenen.
[18:4] Jezus dan, wetende al wat over Hem komen zou, ging uit en zeide tot hen: Wien zoekt gij?
[18:5] Zij antwoordden Hem: Jezus, den Nazarener! — Jezus zeide tot hen: Ik ben het! — Judas nu, de verrader, stond ook bij hen.
[18:6] Toen Jezus dan tot hen zeide: Ik ben het! gingen zij achteruit, en vielen op den grond.
[18:7] Wederom dan vroeg Jezus hun: Wien zoekt Gij? — Zij zeiden: Jezus, den Nazarener!
[18:8] Jezus antwoordde: Ik heb u gezegd dat Ik het ben! als gij Mij dan zoekt, laat dezen weggaan!
[18:9] Opdat zou vervuld worden het woord dat Hij gezegd had: Van degenen die Gij Mij gegeven hebt, heb Ik niemand verloren! 
[18:10]  Simon Petrus dan had een zwaard, en trok het uit, en sloeg naar den dienstknecht des hoogepriesters, en kapte hem het rechteroor af. — De naam van den knecht was Malchus.
[18:11] Maar Jezus zeide tot Petrus: Steek uw zwaard in de scheede! den drinkbeker, dien de Vader Mij gegeven heeft, zou Ik dien niet drinken? 
[18:12]  De bende dan, en de hoofdman, en de dienaars der Joden, grepen Jezus en bonden Hem vast;
[18:13] en voerden Hem eerst naar Annas; want deze was de schoonvader van Kajafas, die hoogepriester was in dat jaar.
[18:14] Kajafas nu was het die den Joden den raad gegeven had, dat het voordeelig was dat één mensch zou sterven voor het volk. 
[18:15]  Simon Petrus dan volgde Jezus, en een ander discipel. Deze discipel nu was bekend met den hoogepriester, en ging met Jezus mede naar den binnenhof van den hoogepriester.
[18:16] En Petrus stond buiten bij de deur. De andere discipel dan, die bij den hoogepriester bekend was, kwam naar buiten en sprak met de deurbewaarster en bracht Petrus binnen.
[18:17] De dienstmaagd dan, de deurbewaarster, zeide tot Petrus: Zijt ook gij niet uit de discipelen van dezen mensch? — Hij zeide: Neen!
[18:18] De dienaren nu en de knechten stonden bij het kolenvuur dat zij aangestoken hadden omdat het koud was, en warmden zich; en ook Petrus stond bij hen en warmde zich. 
[18:19]  De hoogepriester dan vroeg Jezus over zijn discipelen en over zijn leering.
[18:20] Jezus antwoordde hem: Ik heb in het openbaar in de wereld gesproken; Ik heb altijd geleerd in de synagoge en in den tempel, waar al de Joden samenkomen, en in het heimelijk heb Ik niets gesproken.
[18:21] Wat vraagt gij Mij? vraag hun die Mij gehoord hebben, wat Ik tot hen gesproken heb! Zie, die weten wat Ik gezegd heb.
[18:22] Toen Hij dit gezegd had gaf een der dienaren die daarbij stond, aan Jezus een slag met een stok en zeide: Antwoordt gij den hoogepriester alzoo?
[18:23] Jezus antwoordde hem: Als Ik kwaad gesproken heb, geef dan reden van het kwade; maar indien goed, wat slaat gij Mij dan?
[18:24] Annas zond Hem dan gebonden naar Kajafas den hoogepriester. 
[18:25]  Simon Petrus nu stond en warmde zich. Zij zeiden dan tot hem: Zijt ook gij niet uit de discipelen van dezen? — En hij loochende het en zeide: Neen!
[18:26] Een uit de dienstknechten des hoogepriesters, die van de familie was van hem dien Petrus het oor had afgekapt, zeide: Heb ik ook u niet gezien in den hof met Hem?
[18:27] Wederom dan loochende het Petrus. En terstond kraaide een haan. 
[18:28]  Zij brachten dan Jezus van Kajafas naar het rechthuis. — Het was ‘s morgens vroeg. — En de Joden zelf gingen niet naar het rechthuis, opdat zij niet besmet zouden worden, maar het pascha zouden mogen eten.
[18:29] Pilatus dan ging uit naar buiten tot hen en zeide: Welke beschuldiging brengt gij tegen dezen mensch?
[18:30] Zij antwoordden en zeiden tot hem: Als deze geen kwaaddoener was, dan zouden wij Hem aan u niet overgeleverd hebben.
[18:31] Pilatus dan zeide tot hen: Neemt gij Hem dan en oordeelt Hem naar uw wet! — De Joden dan zeiden tot hem: Ons is het niet geoorloofd iemand te dooden!
[18:32] Opdat het woord van Jezus zou volbracht worden, dat Hij gesproken had, om te kennen te geven hoedanigen dood Hij zou sterven. 
[18:33]  Pilatus dan ging wederom naar het rechthuis en riep Jezus en zeide tot Hem: Gij zijt de koning der Joden?
[18:34] Jezus antwoordde: Zegt gij dat uit u zelven, of hebben anderen u over Mij gesproken?
[18:35] Pilatus antwoordde: Ik ben toch geen Jood? uw eigen volk en overpriesters hebben U aan mij overgeleverd! — Wat hebt Gij gedaan?
[18:36] Jezus antwoordde: Mijn koninkrijk is niet uit deze wereld! — Als mijn koninkrijk uit deze wereld was, dan zouden mijn dienaren strijden, opdat Ik niet ware overgeleverd aan de Joden; — doch nu, mijn koninkrijk is niet van hier.
[18:37] Pilatus dan zeide tot Hem: Gij zijt dan toch een koning? — Jezus antwoordde: Gij zegt het, want een koning ben Ik! — Ik ben daartoe geboren en daartoe tot de wereld gezonden, opdat Ik aan de waarheid zou getuigenis geven. — Al wie uit de waarheid is, hoort naar mijn stem.
[18:38] Pilatus zeide tot Hem: Wat is waarheid? — En dit gezegd hebbende, ging hij wederom naar buiten tot de Joden en zeide tot hen: Ik vind in Hem geen schuld! 
[18:39]  Maar gij zijt gewend dat ik u op het paaschfeest één gevangene loslaat; wilt gij dan, dat ik u den koning der Joden loslate?
[18:40] Zij schreeuwden dan allen wederom, zeggende: Niet dezen, maar Barabbas! — Barabbas nu was een moordenaar.  
[19:1] Toen nam Pilatus dan Jezus en deed Hem geeselen.
[19:2] En de soldaten vlochten een kroon uit doornen en zetten Hem die op het hoofd, en wierpen Hem een purperen kleed om,
[19:3] en zij gingen tot Hem en zeiden: Wees gegroet, koning der Joden! — En zij gaven Hem stokslagen. 
[19:4]  Pilatus kwam wederom uit naar buiten en zeide tot hen: Ziet, ik breng Hem tot u naar buiten, opdat gij weet dat ik in Hem geen schuld vind.
[19:5] Jezus dan kwam naar buiten, dragende de doornen kroon en het purperen kleed. En Pilatus zeide tot hen: Ziet, de mensch!
[19:6] Toen de overpriesters en de dienaren Hem dan zagen, schreeuwden zij: Kruisig, kruisig Hem! — Pilatus zeide tot hen: Neemt gij Hem en kruisigt Hem, want ik vind in Hem geen schuld!
[19:7] De Joden antwoordden: Wij hebben een wet, en volgens die wet moet Hij sterven, omdat Hij zich zelven Gods Zoon gemaakt heeft! 
[19:8]  Toen dan Pilatus dit woord hoorde werd hij te meer bevreesd,
[19:9] en ging wederom naar het rechthuis en zeide te Jezus: Vanwaar zijt Gij? — Maar Jezus gaf hem geen antwoord.
[19:10] Pilatus zeide tot Hem: Gij spreekt tot mij niet? — weet gij niet dat ik macht heb U te kruisigen en macht heb U los te laten?
[19:11] Jezus antwoordde: Gij zoudt geen macht tegen Mij hebben indien het u niet van boven gegeven ware; daarom, die Mij aan u heeft overgeleverd, heeft grooter zonde.
[19:12] Hierop zocht Pilatus Hem los te laten; maar de Joden schreeuwden, zeggende: Als gij dezen loslaat, zijt gij geen vriend des keizers; al wie zich zelven koning maakt, verklaart zich tegen den keizer! 
[19:13]  Pilatus dan, deze woorden gehoord hebbende, bracht Jezus naar buiten en ging zitten op den rechterstoel, op de plaats genaamd: Het Plaveisel, in het hebreeuwsch: Gabbatha.
[19:14] En het was de voorbereiding voor het paaschfeest en omtrent de zesde ure. — En hij zeide tot de Joden: Ziet, uw koning!
[19:15] Dezen dan schreeuwden: Neem weg, kruisig Hem! — Pilatus zeide tot hen: Uw koning zal ik kruisigen? — De overpriesters antwoordden: Wij hebben geen koning, maar wel een keizer!
[19:16] Toen gaf hij Hem dan aan hen over om gekruisigd te worden. 
[19:17]  Zij namen dan Jezus en voerden Hem weg; en deze, zijn kruis dragende, ging uit naar de zoogenaamde plaats der doodshoofden, in het hebreeuwsch Golgotha genoemd,
[19:18] alwaar zij Hem kruisigden en met Hem twee anderen, aan elke zijde één, en Jezus in het midden. 
[19:19]  En Pilatus schreef ook een opschrift en stelde dat boven aan het kruis. En er was geschreven: Jezus, de Nazarener, de Koning der Joden.
[19:20] Dit opschrift dan lazen velen van de Joden, want de plaats, waar Jezus gekruisigd werd, was nabij de stad, en het was geschreven in het hebreeuwsch, grieksch en latijn.
[19:21] De overpriesters der Joden dan zeiden tot Pilatus: Schrijf niet: De koning der Joden, maar dat Hij gezegd heeft: Ik ben koning der Joden.
[19:22] Pilatus antwoordde: Wat ik geschreven heb, dat heb ik geschreven. 
[19:23]  De soldaten dan, toen zij Jezus gekruisigd hadden, namen zijn kleederen, en maakten vier deelen, voor elken soldaat een deel, en ook het onderkleed. Het onderkleed nu was zonder naad, van boven af uit één stuk geweven.
[19:24] Zij zeiden dan tot malkander: Laat ons dit niet scheuren, maar laat ons er over loten van wien het zijn zal. Opdat de Schrifture vervuld zou worden, die zegt: Zij hebben mijn kleederen onder malkander verdeeld en over mijn gewaad het lot geworpen. — Dit deden dan de soldaten. 
[19:25]  Bij het kruis van Jezus nu stonden zijn moeder en de zuster zijner moeder, Maria, de vrouw van Klopas, en Maria Magdalena.
[19:26] Jezus dan zag zijn moeder, en den discipel dien Hij beminde bij haar staande, en zeide tot zijn moeder: Vrouw, zie uw zoon!
[19:27] Daarna zeide Hij tot den discipel: Zie, uw moeder! En van die ure afnam de discipel haar in zijn eigen huls. 
[19:28]  Na dezen zeide Jezus, die wist dat nu alles volbracht was, opdat de Schrifture zou vervuld worden: Ik heb dorst!
[19:29] Er stond daar een vat vol azijn, en zij staken een spons vol azijn op een hijsopriet en brachten dat aan zijn mond.
[19:30] Toen Hij dan den azijn genomen had, zeide Hij: Het is volbracht! En Hij boog het hoofd en gaf den geest. 
[19:31]  De Joden dan, — omdat het voorbereiding voor den sabbat was, en opdat de lichamen niet op den sabbat aan het kruis zouden blijven, want de dag van dien sabbat was een hoogdag— vroegen Pilatus dat aan de gekruisigden de beenen gebroken, en zij afgenomen zouden worden.
[19:32] De soldaten dan kwamen, en braken wel de beenen van den eersten en van den anderen, die met Hem gekruisigd waren.
[19:33] Maar als zij bij Jezus kwamen en zagen dat hij al gestorven was, braken zij Hem de beenen niet,
[19:34] maar een der soldaten stak Hem met een lans in de zijde, en terstond kwam er bloed en water uit.
[19:35] En die het gezien heeft, heeft er getuigenis van gegeven, en zijn getuigenis is waarachtig, en hij weet dat hij waarheid spreekt, opdat ook gij zoudt gelooven.
[19:36] Want dit is geschied opdat de Schrifture zou vervuld worden: Geen been van Hem zal gebroken worden.
[19:37] En wederom een andere Schrifture zegt: Zij zullen zien dien zij doorstoken hebben. 
[19:38]  Na dezen vroeg Jozef van Arimathea, — die een discipel van Jezus was, maar in het heimelijk, om de vreeze voor de Joden— aan Pilatus, dat hij het lichaam van Jezus zou mogen afnemen; en Pilatus liet het toe. Hij kwam dan en nam het lichaam van Jezus af.
[19:39] En ook Nikodemus kwam, — die vroeger des nachts tot Jezus gekomen was— en bracht een mengsel van mirrhe en aloë, omtrent honderd pond.
[19:40] Zij namen dan het lichaam van Jezus en bonden het in linnen doeken met de specerijen, gelijk het bij de Joden de gewoonte is van te begraven.
[19:41] Er was nu ter plaatse waar Hij gekruisigd was een hof, en in dien hof een nieuw graf, waarin nog nooit iemand gelegd was.
[19:42] Aldaar dan leiden zij Jezus, wegens de voorbereiding der Joden, omdat het graf nabij was.  
[20:1] Op den eersten dag der week kwam Maria Magdalena vroeg, als het nog donker was, naar het graf, en zag den steen van het graf weggenomen.
[20:2] Zij liep dan heen en kwam tot Simon Petrus en tot den anderen discipel, dien Jezus beminde, en zeide tot hen: Zij hebben den Heere uit het graf weggenomen, en wij weten niet waar zij Hem gelegd hebben!
[20:3] Petrus dan ging uit en de andere discipel, en zij gingen naar het graf.
[20:4] Die twee nu liepen te gelijk, en de andere discipel liep sneller dan Petrus vooruit, en kwam het eerst tot het graf.
[20:5] En hij bukte en zag de linnen doeken liggen, maar ging er niet in.
[20:6] Simon Petrus dan, die hem volgde, kwam aan en ging in het graf, en zag de linnen doeken liggen,
[20:7] en den zweetdoek, die op zijn hoofd was geweest, zag hij niet liggen bij de linnen doeken, maar ter zijde samengerold op één plaats.
[20:8] Toen ging dan ook de andere discipel binnen, die het eerst aan het graf gekomen was, en hij zag en geloofde.
[20:9] Want nog verstonden zij de Schrifture niet, dat Hij moest verrijzen uit de dooden.
[20:10] De discipelen dan gingen wederom naar huis. 
[20:11]  Doch Maria stond buiten bij het gaf te weenen. Terwijl zij dan weende, bukte zij in het graf,
[20:12] en zag twee engelen zitten in witte kleederen, een aan het hoofdeinde en een aan het voeteneinde, waar het lichaam van Jezus gelegen had.
[20:13] Deze zeiden tot haar: Vrouw, waarom weent gij? — Zij zeide tot hen: Omdat zij mijn Heere hebben weggenomen, en ik weet niet waar zij Hem gelegd hebben!
[20:14] Dit gezegd hebbende keerde zij zich om en zag Jezus staan, en zij wist niet dat het Jezus was.
[20:15] Jezus zeide tot haar: Vrouw, waarom weent gij? wien zoekt gij? — Zij nu, meenende dat Hij de hovenier was, zeide tot Hem: Heer, als gij Hem hebt weggedragen, zeg mij dan waar gij Hem gelegd hebt, en ik zal Hem wegnemen!
[20:16] Jezus zeide tot haar: Maria! — Zij zich omkeerende zeide tot Hem in het hebreeuwsch: Rabboeni! dat is te zeggen: Meester.
[20:17] Jezus zeide tot haar: Raak Mij niet aan, want Ik ben nog niet opgeklommen tot mijn Vader! maar ga heen tot mijn broeders en zeg tot hen: Ik klim op tot mijn Vader en uw Vader, en tot mijn God en uw God.
[20:18] Maria Magdalena dan ging boodschappen aan de discipelen dat zij den Heere gezien had, en dat Hij dit tot haar gesproken had. 
[20:19]  Toen het dan avond was geworden op dien eersten dag der week, en toen de deuren gesloten waren, waar de discipelen waren, uit vreeze voor de Joden, — kwam Jezus en stond in het midden, en zeide tot hen: Vrede zij ulieden!
[20:20] En dit gezegd hebbende, toonde Hij hun zijn handen en zijde. De discipelen dan waren verblijd dat zij den Heere zagen.
[20:21] Hij zeide dan wederom tot hen: Vrede zij ulieden! gelijk de Vader Mij gezonden heeft, alzoo zend Ik ook ulieden.
[20:22] En dit gezegd hebbende, blies Hij op hen en zeide tot hen: Ontvangt den Heiligen Geest!
[20:23] Als gij iemands zonden vergeeft, dien worden zij vergeven; als gij iemands zonden houdt, dien zijn zij gehouden.
[20:24] Thomas nu, een van de twaalven, die de Tweeling genoemd wordt, was niet bij hen toen Jezus kwam.
[20:25] De andere discipelen dan zeiden tot hem: Wij hebben den Heere gezien! — Maar hij zeide tot hen: Als ik in zijn handen niet zie de gaten van de nagelen, en mijn vinger niet steke in de plaats der nagelen, en mijn hand niet steke in zijn zijde, zoo zal ik niet gelooven. 
[20:26]  En acht dagen later waren zijn discipelen wederom binnen en Thomas met hen. Jezus kwam, toen de deuren gesloten waren en stond in het midden en zeide: Vrede zij ulieden!
[20:27] Daarna zeide Hij tot Thomas: Breng uw vinger hier en zie mijn handen, en breng uw hand en steek ze in mijn zijde, en zijt niet ongeloovig maar geloovig.
[20:28] Thomas antwoordde en zeide tot Hem: Mijn Heere en mijn God!
[20:29] Jezus zeide tot hem: Omdat gij Mij gezien hebt, Thomas, zoo hebt gij geloofd? Zalig zij, die niet gezien hebben, en toch hebben geloofd! 
[20:30]  Nog wel veel andere mirakelen heeft Jezus gedaan voor de oogen der discipelen, die niet staan geschreven in dit boek,
[20:31] maar deze zijn geschreven opdat gij gelooft dat Jezus de Christus is, de Zoon van God, en opdat gij die gelooft, het leven zoudt hebben in zijn Naam.  
[21:1] Naderhand vertoonde Jezus zich wederom aan de discipelen bij de zee van Tiberias. Hij vertoonde zich aldus:
[21:2] Er waren te zamen Simon Petrus, en Thomas die de Tweeling genoemd wordt; en Nathanaël van Kana in Galilea, en de zonen van Zebedeüs en twee anderen uit zijn discipelen.
[21:3] Simon Petrus zeide tot hen: Ik ga visschen! Zij zeiden tot hem: Wij gaan ook met u! — Zij gingen heen en kwamen aan boord, en in dien nacht vingen zij niets.
[21:4] Toen het nu al morgenstond geworden was stond Jezus op den oever, maar de discipelen wisten niet dat het Jezus was.
[21:5] Jezus zeide dan tot hen: Kinderkens! hebt gij wel wat toespijze! Zij antwoordden Hem: Neen!
[21:6] Hij zeide tot hen: Werpt het net aan den rechterkant van het schip, en gij zult vinden! — Zij wierpen het dan en nu konden zij het niet optrekken vanwege de menigte van visschen.
[21:7] De discipel dan, dien Jezus beminde, zeide tot Petrus: Het is de Heere! — Simon Petrus dan, hoorende dat het de Heere was, sloeg het bovenkleed om— want hij was naakt— en wierp zich in de zee.
[21:8] Maar de andere discipelen kwamen per schip, — want zij waren niet ver van den wal, maar omtrent tweehonderd ellen, en zij sleepten het net met de visschen.
[21:9] Toen zij dan aan wal gegaan waren, zagen zij een kolenvuur liggen en visch daarop gelegd, en brood.
[21:10] Jezus zeide tot hen: Brengt van de visschen die gij nu gevangen hebt!
[21:11] Simon Petrus ging op het schip en trok liet net aan wal vol met groote visschen, honderd drie en vijftig; en al waren er ook zooveel, het net scheurde toch niet.
[21:12] Jezus zeide tot hen: Komt, neemt het middagmaal! En niemand der discipelen durfde Hem vragen: Wie zijt Gij want zij wisten dat het de Heere was.
[21:13] Jezus nu kwam en nam het brood en gaf het hun, en evenzoo den visch.
[21:14] Dit was nu de derde keer dat Jezus aan de discipelen verschenen is, nadat Hij uit de dooden was verrezen. 
[21:15]  Toen zij dan het middagmaal gehouden hadden zeide Jezus tot Simon Petrus: Simon, Jonas zoon, bemint gij Mij meer dan dezen? — Hij zeide tot Hem: Ja, Heere! Gij weet dat ik U bemin! — Jezus zeide tot hem: Weid mijn lammeren!
[21:16] Wederom zeide Jezus tot hem voor den tweeden keer: Simon, Jonas zoon, bemint gij Mij? — Hij zeide tot Hem: Ja Heere! Gij weet dat ik U bemin! — Jezus zeide tot hem: Hoed mijn schapen!
[21:17] Jezus zeide tot hem voor den derden keer: Simon Jonas zoon, bemint gij Mij? — Petrus werd bedroefd, omdat Hij voor den derden keer tot hem zeide: Bemint gij Mij? — en hij zeide tot Hem: Heere, Gij weet alles, Gij weet dat ik U bemin! — Jezus zeide tot hem: Weid mijn schapen!
[21:18] Voorwaar, voorwaar zeg Ik u: Toen gij jonger waart zoo gordet gij zelven en gij wandeldet waar gij wildet; maar als gij oud zult geworden zijn, dan zult gij uw handen uitstrekken, en een ander zal u gorden en u brengen waar gij niet wilt!
[21:19] Dit nu zeide Hij om te kennen te geven met hoedanigen dood hij God zou de glorie geven. En dit gesproken hebbende, zeide Hij tot hem: Volg Mij na!
[21:20] En toen Petrus zich omkeerde, zag hij den discipel volgen, dien Jezus beminde, die ook bij den maaltijd aan zijn borst lag en zeide: Heere, wie is hij die u verraadt?
[21:21] Toen Petrus dan dezen zag zeide hij tot Jezus: Heere, wat zal van dezen geworden?
[21:22] Jezus zeide tot hem: Zoo Ik wil dat hij blijve totdat Ik kom, — wat raakt u dat? volg gij Mij?
[21:23] Dit gerucht dan liep onder de broeders dat die discipel niet zou sterven. — Doch Jezus had tot hem niet gezegd dat hij niet sterven zou, maar: Zoo Ik wil dat hij blijve totdat Ik kom, wat raakt u dat? 
[21:24]  Deze is de discipel die getuigenis geeft van deze dingen, en ze geschreven heeft, en wij weten dat zijn getuigenis waarachtig is.
[21:25] Er zijn ook nog veel andere dingen, die Jezus gedaan heeft, en zoo die een voor een geschreven werden, ik meen dat zelfs de wereld de geschreven boeken niet zou bevatten.   

### Acts

[1:1] Het eerste boek heb ik opgesteld, o Theofilus! over alles wat Jezus begonnen is te doen en te leeren,
[1:2] tot op den dag dat Hij opgenomen werd, nadat Hij aan de Apostelen, die Hij verkozen had, door den Heiligen Geest bevelen had gegeven;
[1:3] aan wie Hij ook, na zijn lijden, zich zelven levend heeft vertoond, in vele kenteekenen, daar Hij veertig dagen lang aan hen verscheen en sprak van de dingen die het koninkrijk Gods aangaan. 
[1:4]  Toen Hij nu met hen samen was, gebood Hij hun van Jerusalem niet weg te gaan, maar de belofte des Vaders af te wachten, die gij, zeide Hij, van Mij gehoord hebt; 
[1:5] want Johannes doopte wel met water, maar gijlieden zult met den Heiligen Geest gedoopt worden niet veel dagen na dezen.
[1:6] Zij nu die samengekomen waren vroegen Hem, zeggende: Heere, is het in dezen tijd dat Gij het koninkrijk aan Israël zult herstellen?
[1:7] En Hij zeide tot hen: Het komt u niet toe de tijden of stonden te weten, die de Vader in zijn eigen macht heeft gesteld,
[1:8] maar gij zult kracht ontvangen, als de Heilige Geest over u zal gekomen zijn, en gij zult Mij tot getuigen zijn te Jerusalem, en in geheel Judea en Samaria, en tot aan het einde der aarde.
[1:9] En toen Hij dit gezegd had werd Hij opgenomen, terwijl zij het zagen, en een wolk nam Hem weg uit hun oogen.
[1:10] En toen zij naar den hemel opzagen, terwijl Hij heenvoer, ziet, twee mannen stonden bij hen in witte kleederen,
[1:11] die ook zeiden: Gij Galilesche mannen! wat staat gij naar den hemel te zien? deze Jezus, die van u is opgenomen naar den hemel, zal alzoo komen, gelijkerwijs gij Hem hebt zien heenvaren naar den hemel. 
[1:12]  Toen keerden zij terug naar Jerusalem van den berg, die de Berg der Olijven genoemd wordt, die dicht bij Jerusalem is, een sabbatsreize vandaar.
[1:13] En toen zij binnengekomen waren, gingen zij naar de bovenzaal, waar zij gewoonlijk hun verblijf hielden, namelijk Petrus, en Johannes, en Jakobus, en Andreas, Filippus en Thomas, Bartholomeüs en Mattheüs, Jakobus, de zoon van Alfeüs, en Simon de IJveraar, en Judas, de zoon van Jakobus.
[1:14] Deze allen waren eendrachtig volhardende in het gebed met eenige vrouwen, en met Maria de moeder van Jezus, en met zijn broeders. 
[1:15]  En in die dagen stond Petrus op in het midden der broederen en sprak, terwijl er een schare bijeen was van omtrent honderd en twintig personen:
[1:16] Mannen broeders! de Schrifture moest vervuld worden, die de Heilige Geest heeft voorzegd door den mond van David, aangaande Judas, die de aanvoerder geworden is van hen die Jezus gevangen namen.
[1:17] Want hij was toch onder ons gerekend en had het lot dezer bediening ontvangen.
[1:18] Deze nu had voor den loon der onrechtvaardigheid een akker verworven, en voorover gevallen zijnde, is hij door midden gebarsten en al zijn ingewanden zijn uitgestort,
[1:19] hetgeen ook bekend is aan al de bewoners van Jerusalem, zoodat die akker in hun eigen taal genoemd wordt: Akeldama, dat is: Bloedakker.
[1:20] Want in het Boek der Psalmen staat er geschreven: Zijn woning worde woest en niemand wone daarin en: Zijn opzienersambt neme een ander.
[1:21] Het is dan noodig dat van de mannen, die met ons omgegaan hebben, al den tijd dien de Heere Jezus met ons in– en uitgegaan is,
[1:22] van den doop van Johannes af beginnende, tot op den dag waarin Hij van ons werd opgenomen, dat één van dezen met ons getuige worde van zijn verrijzenis.
[1:23] En zij stelden er twee, Jozef, genaamd Barsabbas, die bijgenoemd is de Rechtvaardige, en Matthias.
[1:24] En zij baden en zeiden: Gij, Heere, kenner der harten van allen! wijs aan wien Gij verkiest van deze twee,
[1:25] om aan te nemen de plaats van deze bediening en van het apostelschap, waarvan Judas is afgeweken, om te gaan naar zijn eigen plaats.
[1:26] En zij gaven hun loten, en het lot viel op Matthias; en hij werd medegekozen tot de elf apostelen.  
[2:1] En toen de dag van het Pinksterfeest aanbrak, waren allen gezamenlijk op dezelfde plaats.
[2:2] En er geschiedde op eens uit den hemel een gedruisch als van een geweldigen rukwind, en vervulde het geheele huis waar zij gezeten waren.
[2:3] En hun verschenen tongen, als van vuur, die zich verdeelden en op een ieder van hen zich nederzetten;
[2:4] en allen werden vervuld met den Heiligen Geest en begonnen met andere tongen te spreken, gelijk de Geest hun gaf uit te spreken. 
[2:5]  Er waren nu te Jerusalem Joden woonachtig, godvruchtige mannen van alle volk dat onder den hemel is.
[2:6] En als dit geluid geschied was, kwam de menigte zamen en ontroerde, omdat een ieder hen in zijn eigen taal hoorde spreken
[2:7] En zij stonden allen verbaasd en verwonderd, zeggende: Ziet, zijn deze allen, die daar spreken, niet Galileërs?
[2:8] En hoe hooren wij ze dan een iegelijk in ons eigen taal, waarin wij geboren zijn,
[2:9] Parthers, en Meders, en Elamieten, en inwoners van Mesopotamië, Judea en Kappadocië, Pontus en Asie,
[2:10] en Frygië en Pamfylië, Egypte en de landstreek van Libyë, dat bij Cyrene ligt, en hier verblijvende Romeinen, zoo Joden als proselieten,
[2:11] Kretensers en Arabieren— wij hooren hen in onze tongen Gods groote werken uitspreken!
[2:12] Allen stonden dan verbaasd en verlegen, zeggende tot malkander: Wat mag dit toch zijn?
[2:13] En anderen zeiden al spottende: Zij zijn vol zoeten wijn! 
[2:14]  Maar Petrus, daar staande met de elven, verhief zijn stem en zeide tot hen: Gij joodsche mannen, en gij allen die te Jerusalem woont! dit zij u bekend en neemt mijn woorden ter oore!
[2:15] Want dezen zijn niet dronken, zooals gij meent, want het is de derde uur van den dag.
[2:16] Maar dit is wat door den profeet Joël is gesproken:
[2:17] En het zal zijn in de laatste dagen, zegt God, dat Ik zal uitgieten van mijn Geest op alle vleesch; en uw zonen en uw dochteren zullen profeteeren en uw jongelingen zullen visioenen zien, en uw ouden zullen droomen droomen;
[2:18] ja zelfs op mijn dienstknechten en op mijn dienstmaagden zal Ik in die dagen van mijn Geest uitgieten, en zij zullen profeteeren;
[2:19] en Ik zal wonderen geven in den hemel boven, en teekenen op de aarde beneden, bloed, en vuur, en rookdamp;
[2:20] de zon zal veranderen in duisternis, en de maan in bloed, vóórdat de groote en doorluchtige dag des Heeren komt;
[2:21] en het zal zijn dat ieder, die den Naam des Heeren aanroept, zal behouden worden.
[2:22] Gij mannen Israëls! hoort deze woorden: Jezus den Nazarener, een man, dien God onder ulieden heeft aanzienlijk gemaakt door krachten, en mirakelen, en teekenen, die God door Hem in uw midden gedaan heeft, gelijk gij zelven weet,
[2:23] dezen, — naar Gods bepaalden raad en voorkennis overgeleverd zijnde— hebt gij genomen en door de handen der onrechtvaardigen gekruisigd en gedood.
[2:24] Dezen heeft God opgewekt, door de smarten des doods los te maken, omdat het niet mogelijk was dat Hij daardoor werd vastgehouden.
[2:25] Want David zegt met het oog op Hem: Ik zie den Heere gedurig voor mijn aangezicht, want Hij is aan mijn rechterzijde, opdat ik niet wankele;
[2:26] daarom is mijn hart verheugd en mijn tong juicht, ja zelfs mijn vleesch zal rusten,
[2:27] op hope dat Gij mijn ziel niet zult overlaten in het doodenrijk en niet zult toelaten dat uw Heilige verderving zie;
[2:28] Gij hebt mij de wegen des levens bekend gemaakt; Gij zult mij met blijdschap vervullen door uw aangezicht.
[2:29] Mannen broeders! laat mij toe met vrijmoedigheid tot u te zeggen van den patriarch David, dat hij gestorven is en begraven, en dat zijn graf bij ons is tot op dezen dag.
[2:30] Maar een profeet zijnde, en wetende dat God hem met een eed gezworen had, dat er een uit de vrucht zijner lenden op zijn troon zou zitten,
[2:31] zoo heeft hij, dit voorziende, gesproken van de verrijzenis van Christus, dat Hij niet in het doodenrijk is overgelaten, noch zijn vleesch verderving heeft gezien.
[2:32] Dezen Jezus heeft God opgewekt, waarvan wij allen getuigen zijn.
[2:33] Nadat Hij dan door Gods rechterhand was verhoogd, en de belofte des Heiligen Geestes van den Vader had ontvangen, heeft Hij dit uitgestort wat gij nu ziet en hoort.
[2:34] Want David is niet opgeklommen ten hemel, maar hij zegt zelf: De Heere heeft gezegd tot mijn Heere: Zit aan mijn rechterhand,
[2:35] totdat Ik uw vijanden stelle tot een voetbank uwer voeten.
[2:36] Met zekerheid wete dan het geheele huis Israëls, dat God Hem tot een Heere en Christus gemaakt heeft, dezen Jezus, dien gij gekruisigd hebt! 
[2:37]  Dit nu hoorende, sneed het hun door het hart; en zij zeiden tot Petrus en de andere Apostelen: Wat zullen wij doen, mannen broeders?
[2:38] En Petrus zeide tot hen: Doet boetvaardigheid, en een ieder van u late zich doopen op den Naam van Jezus Christus, tot vergiffenis uwer zonden, en gij zult de gifte des Heiligen Geestes ontvangen.
[2:39] Want voor u is de belofte, en voor uw kinderen, en voor allen die verre zijn, zoovelen de Heere, onze God, er toe roepen zal.
[2:40] En met meer andere woorden betuigde en vermaande hij hen, zeggende: Laat u redden van dit goddeloos geslacht!
[2:41] Zij nu, die zijn woord aannamen, lieten zich doopen, en op dien dag werden omstreeks drie duizend zielen toegebracht. 
[2:42]  En zij waren volhardende in de leer der Apostelen, en in de gemeenschap, en in het breken des broods, en in de gebeden.
[2:43] En er kwam vreeze over iedere ziel; en veel mirakelen en teekenen geschiedden door de Apostelen in Jerusalem, zoo dat er een groote vreeze was over allen.
[2:44] En allen die geloofden waren bijeen en hadden alles in het gemeen,
[2:45] en verkochten goederen en bezittingen, en deelden die uit aan een ieder, naar dat hij van noode had.
[2:46] En dagelijks eendrachtig volhardende in den tempel, en aan huis brood brekende, namen zij voedsel in blijdschap en eenvoudigheid des harten,
[2:47] en loofden God en hadden gunst bij het geheele volk. De Heere nu bracht er dagelijks toe tot de gemeente die behouden werden.  
[3:1] Petrus nu en Johannes gingen op naar den tempel, tegen de ure des gebeds, de negende.
[3:2] En een zeker man, kreupel van zijn moeders lichaam af, werd gedragen, dien men dagelijks zette bij de deur des tempels, die de Schoone genoemd wordt, om aalmoezen te vragen van hen die in den tempel gingen.
[3:3] Deze nu zag Petrus en Johannes, toen zij in den tempel zouden gaan, en vroeg om een aalmoes te mogen ontvangen.
[3:4] Maar Petrus zag hem sterk aan, met Johannes, en zeide: Zie ons aan!
[3:5] En hij zag hen aan, verwachtende van hen iets te zullen ontvangen.
[3:6] En Petrus zeide: Zilver en goud bezit ik niet; maar wat ik heb, dat geef ik u! In den Naam van Jezus Christus, den Nazarener, sta op en wandel!
[3:7] En hem grijpende bij de rechterhand trok hij hem op; en terstond werden zijn beenen en enkelen vast.
[3:8] En opspringende stond hij recht en wandelde, en hij ging met hen in den tempel, wandelende en springende en lovende God.
[3:9] En al het volk zag hem wandelen en God loven,
[3:10] en zij kenden hem, dat hij het was die om een aalmoes bij de Schoone poort des tempels had gezeten; en zij werden vol verbaasdheid en ontzetting over hetgeen hem overkomen was. 
[3:11]  En als hij Petrus en Johannes vasthield, liep al het volk tot hen samen, bij de gaanderij, die van Salomo genoemd, verbaasd zijnde.
[3:12] En Petrus dit ziende antwoordde den volke aldus: Gij mannen Israëls! wat verwondert gij u over dit, of wat ziet gij ons sterk aan, alsof wij door eigen kracht of godvruchtigheid dezen hadden doen wandelen?
[3:13] De God van Abraham, Isaäk en Jakob, de God onzer vaderen, heeft zijn knecht Jezus verheerlijkt, dien gij hebt overgeleverd en verloochend voor het aangezicht van Pilatus, die besloten had Hem los te laten.
[3:14] Doch gij hebt den Heilige en Rechtvaardige verloochend en begeerd dat u een moordenaar zou geschonken worden;
[3:15] en den Vorst des levens hebt gij gedood, dien God heeft opgewekt uit de dooden, waarvan wij getuigen zijn.
[3:16] En op het geloof in zijn Naam heeft zijn Naam dezen gesterkt, dien gij ziet en kent; en het geloof dat door Hem is, heeft hem deze volkomen gezondheid gegeven in uw aller tegenwoordigheid.
[3:17] En nu, broeders, ik weet dat gij het gedaan hebt uit onwetendheid, zooals ook uw oversten;
[3:18] maar God heeft datgene alzoo vervuld, wat Hij te voren verkondigd had door den mond van al de profeten, dat zijn Christus lijden zou.
[3:19] Hebt dan berouw en bekeert u, opdat uw zonden uitgewischt worden, ten einde de tijden der verkwikking mogen komen van het aangezicht des Heeren,
[3:20] en Hij u zende den u te voren bestemden Christus Jezus,
[3:21] wien de hemel moet ontvangen tot op den tijd der herstelling aller dingen, waarvan God heeft gesproken door den mond der heilige profeten van oudsher.
[3:22] Mozes toch heeft gezegd: De Heere, uw God, zal u een profeet verwekken, uit uw broederen, gelijk mij; naar hem zult gij hooren in alles wat hij tot u spreken zal;
[3:23] en het zal zijn dat alle ziel, die niet naar dien profeet hoort, zal worden uitgeroeid uit het volk.
[3:24] En al de profeten, van Samuel af, en de lateren, zooveel er gesproken hebben, hebben ook deze dagen voorzegd.
[3:25] Gij zijt de kinderen der profeten en des verbonds dat God met onze vaderen gemaakt heeft, zeggende tot Abraham: En in uw nakomelingschap zullen alle geslachten der aarde gezegend worden.
[3:26] Voor ulieden het eerst heeft God zijn knecht opgewekt en Hem gezonden, om u te zegenen daarin dat Hij een ieder uwer afkeere van uw boosheden.  
[4:1] Terwijl zij nu tot het volk spraken overvielen hen de priesters, en de hoofdman des tempels, en de sadduceërs,
[4:2] die zeer kwaad waren omdat zij het volk onderwijs gaven en in Jezus de verrijzenis uit de dooden predikten.
[4:3] En zij sloegen de handen aan hen en stelden hen in bewaring tot den volgenden dag, want het was reeds avond.
[4:4] Doch velen van hen die het woord gehoord hadden, geloofden, en het getal der mannen werd omtrent vijf duizend. 
[4:5]  Het geschiedde nu den volgenden dag dat hun oversten, en oudsten, en schriftgeleerden te Jerusalem vergaderden,
[4:6] en Annas de hoogepriester, en Kajafas, en Johannes, en Alexander, en allen die van de hoogepriesterlijke familie waren.
[4:7] En zij stelden hen in het midden en vroegen: In welke kracht of in welken naam hebt gij dit gedaan?
[4:8] Toen sprak Petrus, vervuld zijnde met den Heiligen Geest, tot hen: Gij oversten en oudsten des volks!
[4:9] Indien wij heden verhoord worden wegens een weldaad jegens een kranken mensch, waardoor deze is gezond geworden,
[4:10] zoo zij het u allen en het geheele volk van Israël bekend, dat in den Naam van Jezus Christus den Nazarener, dien gij hebt gekruisigd, dien God uit de dooden heeft opgewekt— door Hem staat deze gezond vóór u.
[4:11] Deze Jezus is de steen die door u, de bouwlieden, is veracht, die geworden is tot een hoeksteen.
[4:12] En in niemand anders is de behoudenis; want ook is er geen andere naam onder den hemel, die aan de menschen gegeven is, waarin wij moeten behouden worden. 
[4:13]  Toen zij nu de vrijmoedigheid van Petrus en Johannes zagen, en bevonden hadden dat zij ongeleerde en simpele menschen waren, verwonderden zij zich; en zij herkenden hen dat zij met Jezus geweest waren.
[4:14] En den mensch die genezen was bijeen ziende staan, hadden zij niets tegen te spreken.
[4:15] En zij geboden hun buiten de vergadering te gaan en overleiden met malkander, zeggende:
[4:16] Wat zullen wij dezen menschen doen? want dat er door hen een openbaar mirakel is geschied, dat is aan alle inwoners van Jerusalem bekend, en wij kunnen het niet loochenen.
[4:17] Maar opdat het niet verder onder het volk verbreid worde, laat ons hen streng bedreigen van niet meer te spreken tegen eenigen mensch in dezen Naam.
[4:18] En hen geroepen hebbende, geboden zij hun in ‘t geheel niet te spreken of onderwijs te geven in den Naam van Jezus.
[4:19] Maar Petrus en Johannes antwoordden en zeiden tot hen: Of het recht is voor Gods aangezicht, naar ulieden meer te hooren dan naar God, beoordeelt dat zelf!
[4:20] want ons is het onmogelijk niet te spreken van wat wij gezien en gehoord hebben!
[4:21] Maar zij dreigden hen nog meer en lieten hen los, om des volks wil, daar zij niets gevonden hadden hoe zij hen zouden straffen; want allen verheerlijkten God over het gebeurde.
[4:22] Want de mensch, aan wien dit mirakel der genezing geschied was, was meer dan veertig jaar oud. 
[4:23]  Zij nu losgelaten zijnde, kwamen bij de hunnen en verhaalden al wat de overpriesters en de oudsten tot hen gezegd hadden.
[4:24] En die dit hoorden verhieven eenparig de stem tot God en zeiden: Heere! Gij zijt het die den hemel en de aarde en de zee en al wat daarin is, geschapen hebt;
[4:25] die door den Heiligen Geest, door den mond van onzen vader David, uw knecht, gezegd hebt: Waarom woeden de heidenen en bedenken de volken ijdelheden?
[4:26] de koningen der aarde zijn opgestaan en de oversten zijn samenvergaderd tegen den Heere en tegen zijn Christus.
[4:27] Want in der waarheid, in deze stad zijn tegen uw heiligen knecht Jezus, dien Gij gezalfd hebt, opgestaan zoowel Herodes als Pontius Pilatus, met de heidenen en de volken Israëls,
[4:28] om te doen al wat uw hand en uw raad te voren bepaald had dat geschieden moest!
[4:29] En nu Heere! zie op hun dreigementen, en geef aan uw dienstknechten met alle vrijmoedigheid uw woord te spreken,
[4:30] door het uitstrekken van uw hand tot genezing, en door het geschieden van mirakelen en teekenen door den Naam van uw heiligen knecht Jezus.
[4:31] En als zij gebeden hadden, werd de plaats waarin zij vergaderd waren, bewogen, en allen werden vervuld met den Heiligen Geest, en spraken het woord Gods met vrijmoedigheid. 
[4:32]  En de menigte der geloovigen was één van hart en ziel; en niet één zeide dat iets van hetgeen hij bezat zijn eigendom was, maar alle dingen hadden zij gemeen.
[4:33] En met groote kracht gaven de Apostelen getuigenis van de verrijzenis van den Heere Jezus Christus; en groote genade was op hen allen.
[4:34] Want onder hen was niemand die gebrek had; want zoovelen als er bezitters waren van landerijen of huizen, verkochten die en brachten den prijs van het verkochte,
[4:35] en leiden dien aan de voeten der Apostelen; en aan ieder werd uitgedeeld naar dat hij van noode had.
[4:36] Jozef nu, door de Apostelen bijgenaamd Barnabas, (dat is te zeggen, zoon der vertroosting), een Leviet, afkomstig van Cyprus,
[4:37] die een akker had, verkocht dien en bracht het geld en leide het aan de voeten der Apostelen.  
[5:1] Een zeker man nu, met name Ananias, met Saffira zijn vrouw, verkocht een bezitting,
[5:2] en hield iets van den prijs achter, ook met medeweten van zijn vrouw, en bracht een zeker deel en leide dat aan de voeten der Apostelen.
[5:3] Doch Petrus zeide: Ananias, waarom heeft de Satan uw hart vervuld dat gij tegen den Heiligen Geest zoudt liegen en iets van den prijs des lands zoudt achterhouden?
[5:4] Bleef het onverkocht dan bleef het immers het uwe? en was het, verkocht zijnde, niet in uw macht. Waarom hebt gij deze daad in uw hart voorgenomen? Niet tegen de menschen maar tegen God hebt gij gelogen!
[5:5] Toen nu Ananias deze woorden hoorde, viel hij neder en gaf den geest; en er kwam een groote vrees over allen die het hoorden.
[5:6] En de jongelingen stonden op en bedekten hem, en droegen hem naar buiten en begroeven hem.
[5:7] En het geschiedde, omtrent drie uren daarna, dat ook zijn vrouw binnenkwam, niet wetende wat er geschied was.
[5:8] En Petrus antwoordde haar: Zeg mij, hebt gij het land voor zóóveel verkocht? Zij nu zeide: Ja, voor zóóveel!
[5:9] En Petrus zeide tot haar: Waarom zijt gij overeengekomen om den Geest des Heeren te verzoeken? Zie, de voeten van hen die uw man begraven hebben zijn bij de deur en zij zullen u uitdragen.
[5:10] En zij viel terstond voor zijn voeten en gaf den geest; en de jongelingen binnengekomen zijnde vonden haar dood, en droegen haar naar buiten en begroeven haar bij haar man.
[5:11] En een groote vrees kwam over de geheele gemeente en over allen die dit hoorden. 
[5:12]  Door de handen der Apostelen nu geschiedden veel teekenen en mirakelen onder het volk, en allen waren eensgezind in de gaanderij van Salomo.
[5:13] Doch niemand van de anderen durfde zich bij hen voegen, maar het volk verhief hen zeer.
[5:14] En steeds meer geloovigen werden den Heere toegevoegd, een menigte zoowel van mannen als van vrouwen,
[5:15] zoodat men zelfs de kranken naar de straten uitdroeg en nederleide op bedden en matrassen, opdat, als Petrus kwam, ten minste zijn schaduw iemand van hen zou overschaduwen.
[5:16] Ook de schare van de rondom liggende steden kwam naar Jerusalem, brengende kranken en door onreine geesten gekwelden, die allen werden genezen. 
[5:17]  Maar de hoogepriester stond op, en allen die met hem waren (de sekte der sadduceërs), en werden vervuld met nijdigheid,
[5:18] en sloegen de handen aan de Apostelen en zetten hen in een openbare gevangenis.
[5:19] Maar een engel des Heeren opende des nachts de deuren der gevangenis en leidde hen er uit en zeide:
[5:20] Gaat heen, en staat, en spreekt in den tempel tot het volk al de woorden van dit leven!
[5:21] Zij nu hoorden dit en gingen tegen den morgen naar den tempel en leerden. En de hoogepriester kwam, en die met hem waren, en riep den Raad te zamen en al de oudsten der kinderen Israëls; en zij zonden naar de gevangenis om hen te halen.
[5:22] Doch de dienstknechten, die kwamen, vonden hen in de gevangenis niet; en zij keerden terug en boodschapten, zeggende:
[5:23] De gevangenis vonden wij met alle verzekerdheid gesloten, en de wachters staande aan de deuren, maar die geopend hebbende vonden wij niemand binnen!
[5:24] Toen nu de hoogepriester en de hoofdman des tempels, en de overpriesters deze woorden hoorden, waren zij in verlegenheid over hen, wat er toch van worden mocht!
[5:25] Maar iemand kwam hun boodschappen: Ziet, de mannen die gij in de gevangenis gezet hebt, staan in den tempel het volk te leeren!
[5:26] Toen ging de hoofdman met de dienaren heen en haalde hen, zonder geweld, want zij vreesden het volk, om niet gesteenigd te worden.
[5:27] En hen gehaald hebbende stelden zij hen in den Raad, en de hoogepriester vroeg hun zeggende:
[5:28] Hebben wij u niet streng bevolen in dezen Naam niet te leeren, en ziet, gij hebt Jerusalem met uw leer vervuld en gij wilt over ons het bloed van dien mensch brengen!,
[5:29] Maar Petrus en de Apostelen antwoordden en zeiden: Men moet Gode meer gehoorzamen dan menschen;
[5:30] de God onzer vaderen heeft Jezus opgewekt, dien gij omgebracht hebt, Hem hangende aan een hout;
[5:31] dezen heeft God tot een Vorst en Verlosser door zijn rechterhand verhoogd, om boetvaardigheid en vergiffenis van zonden aan Israël te geven;
[5:32] en wij zijn getuigen van deze dingen, en ook de Heilige Geest, dien God gegeven heeft aan degenen die Hem gehoorzaam zijn. 
[5:33]  Toen zij dit nu hoorden werden zij woedend en beraadslaagden om hen te dooden.
[5:34] Maar een zeker fariseër stond op in den Raad, genaamd Gamaliël, een leeraar der wet, gezien bij het geheele volk, en gebood dat men de mannen wat zou doen buiten gaan.
[5:35] En hij zeide tot hen: Gij Israëlitische mannen, past op voor u zelven, met het oog op deze menschen, wat gij gaat doen!
[5:36] Want vóór deze dagen stond Theudas op, die van zich zelven zeide dat hij heel wat was, wien een getal van omtrent vierhonderd man aanhing; en hij is omgebracht, en allen die hem volgden zijn verstrooid en tot niet gebracht.
[5:37] Na hem stond Judas de Galileër op, in de dagen der opschrijving, en trok veel volks achter zich; ook hij is omgekomen en allen die hem volgden zijn verstrooid.
[5:38] En nu zeg ik u: Onthoudt u van deze menschen, en laat ze begaan; want is deze raad of dit werk uit menschen, dan zal het verbroken worden;
[5:39] maar is het uit God, dan kunt gij dat niet verbreken, opdat gij niet misschien bevonden zoudt worden tegen God te strijden!
[5:40] En zij luisterden naar hem, en riepen de Apostelen binnen en geeselden hen, en geboden hun niet te spreken in den Naam van Jezus, en lieten hen gaan.
[5:41] Dezen nu gingen verheugd van voor den Raad, verblijd dat zij waardig geacht waren voor dien Naam smaad te dragen.
[5:42] Den geheelen dag nu hielden zij in den tempel en bij de huizen niet op te leeren en Jezus Christus te prediken.  
[6:1] In die dagen nu, toen de discipelen vermenigvuldigden, ontstond er een murmuratie van de Hellenisten tegen de Hebreërs, dat hun weduwen bij de dagelijksche bediening werden voorbijgezien.
[6:2] De twaalven nu riepen de menigte der discipelen bijeen en zeiden: Het is niet behoorlijk dat wij het woord Gods verzuimen om tafelen te bedienen;
[6:3] ziet daarom uit, broeders! naar zeven mannen uit u, van goed getuigenis, vol van den Heiligen Geest en wijsheid, die wij stellen zullen over dit werk;
[6:4] wij zullen dan volharden in het gebed en in de bediening des woords.
[6:5] En dit woord behaagde aan de geheele menigte, en zij verkozen Stefanus, een man vol van geloof en van den Heiligen Geest, en Filippus, en Prochorus, en Nikanor, en Timon, en Parmenas, en Nikolaas, een proseliet van Antiochië,
[6:6] die zij voor de Apostelen stelden; en als deze gebeden hadden, leiden zij hun de handen op. 
[6:7]  En het woord Gods vermeerderde, en het getal der discipelen in Jerusalem nam zeer toe, en een groote schare der priesters werd gehoorzaam aan het geloof.
[6:8] Stefanus nu, vol van genade en kracht, deed groote mirakelen en teekenen onder het volk.
[6:9] En sommigen stonden op van de synagoge, genaamd der Libertijnen, en der Cyreneërs, en der Alexandrijnen, en van die uit Cilicië en Asië waren, en redetwistten met Stefanus;
[6:10] en zij konden de wijsheid en den Geest niet wederstaan waarmede hijsprak. 
[6:11]  Toen stookten zij mannen op, die zeiden dat zij hem lasterlijke woorden hadden hooren spreken tegen Mozes en God.
[6:12] En zij brachten het volk in oproer, met de oudsten en de schriftgeleerden en zij overvielen hem en sleepten hem mede en brachten hem voor den Raad,
[6:13] en zij stelden valsche getuigen, die zeiden: Deze mensch houdt niet op woorden te spreken tegen deze heilige plaats en de wet;
[6:14] want wij hebben hem hooren zeggen dat die Jezus de Nazarener deze plaats zal verwoesten en de gewoonten zal veranderen, die Mozes ons heeft overgeleverd!
[6:15] En allen die in den Raad zaten, keken hem aan en zagen zijn aangezicht als het aangezicht van een engel.  
[7:1] En de hoogepriester zeide: Is dit alzoo?
[7:2] En Stefanus zeide: Mannen broeders en vaders, luistert! De God der glorie verscheen aan onzen vader Abraham, die in Mesopotamië was, vóórdat hij in Haran woonde,
[7:3] en zeide tot hem: Ga uit uw land, en uit uw familie, en kom naar het land dat Ik u zal aanwijzen.
[7:4] Toen ging hij uit het land der Chaldeërs en woonde in Haran; en vandaar, nadat zijn vader gestorven was, deed God hem verhuizen naar het land dat gij nu bewoont.
[7:5] En Hij gaf hem geen erfdeel daarin, zelfs geen voet gronds, en beloofde hem dit tot een erfdeel te zullen geven, en aan zijn nakomelingen na hem, terwijl hij geen kind had.
[7:6] En God sprak alzoo, dat zijn nakomelingschap vreemd zou zijn in een vreemd land en dat zij het zouden dienstbaar maken en mishandelen vierhonderd jaar.
[7:7] En het volk, dat zij zullen dienen, zal Ik oordeelen, sprak God, en daarna zullen zij uittrekken en Mij dienen in deze plaats.
[7:8] En Hij gaf hem het verbond der besnijdenis; en alzoo gewon hij Isaäk en besneed hem op den achtsten dag; en Isaäk gewon Jakob, en Jakob de twaalf aartsvaders.
[7:9] En de aartsvaders waren jaloersch van Jozef en verkochten hem naar Egypte.
[7:10] En God was met hem en verloste hem uit al zijn verdrukkingen, en gaf hem gunst en wijsheid voor Farao, den koning van Egypte, en stelde hem tot een heerscher over Egypte en over geheel zijn huis.
[7:11] Er kwam nu een hongersnood over geheel Egypte en Kanaän, en een groote verdrukking, en onze vaders vonden geen voedsel.
[7:12] Doch toen Jakob gehoord had dat er koorn was in Egypte, zond hij onze vaders voor de eerste maal uit.
[7:13] En de tweede maal werd Jozef aan zijn broeders bekend, en het geslacht van Jozef werd aan Farao openbaar.
[7:14] Jozef nu zond heen om Jakob, zijn vader, te halen, en het geheele geslacht, vijf en zeventig zielen.
[7:15] En Jakob kwam af naar Egypte; en hij stierf en onze vaders,
[7:16] en zij werden overgebracht naar Sichem, en begraven in het graf dat Abraham voor een somme gelds had gekocht van de zonen van Heinor, in Sichem.
[7:17] Maar als nu de tijd der belofte naderde, die God aan Abraham met eede beloofd had, nam het volk toe en vermeerderde in Egypte,
[7:18] totdat er een andere koning over Egypte opstond, die Jozef niet had gekend.
[7:19] Deze ging listig te werk met ons geslacht, en mishandelde onze vaders, zoodat zij hun pasgeboren kinderen moesten wegdoen, opdat zij niet zouden voortplanten.
[7:20] In dien tijd werd Mozes geboren, en hij was Gode aangenaam; hij nu werd drie maanden opgevoed in het huis zijns vaders.
[7:21] Maar toen hij weggedaan, was nam de dochter van Farao hem op, en voedde hem op voor zich zelve tot een zoon.
[7:22] En Mozes werd onderwezen in alle wijsheid der Egyptenaars, en was machtig in zijn woorden en werken.
[7:23] Toen hij nu veertig jaar oud geworden was, kwam het in zijn hart op om zijn broeders, de kinderen Israëls te bezoeken.
[7:24] En toen hij iemand onrecht zag aandoen, beschermde hij hem en wreekte den verdrukte en versloeg den Egyptenaar.
[7:25] En hij meende dat zijn broeders zouden verstaan dat God door zijn hand hun verlossing zou geven; maar zij verstonden het niet.
[7:26] En den volgenden dag kwam hij bij eenigen die twist hadden, en hij drong hen tot vrede, zeggende: Mannen, gij zijt broeders! waarom doet gij malkander onrecht aan?
[7:27] Maar hij, die zijn naaste onrecht deed, stiet hem weg en zeide: Wie heeft u aangesteld tot overste en rechter over ons?
[7:28] Gij wilt mij toch niet ombrengen, zooals gij gisteren den Egyptenaar hebt omgebracht?
[7:29] Op dat woord nu nam Mozes de vlucht, en hij werd een vreemdeling in het land Midian, waar hij twee zonen gewon.
[7:30] En toen er veertig jaar verloopen waren, verscheen hem in de woestijn van den berg Sinaï een engel in de vuurvlam van een braambosch.
[7:31] Toen Mozes nu dit zag verwonderde hij zich over het visioen, en toen hij naderbij kwam om dat te bezien, sprak de stem des Heeren tot hem:
[7:32] Ik ben de God uwer vaderen, de God van Abraham en van Isaäk en van Jakob! En Mozes beefde en durfde het niet bezien.
[7:33] De Heere nu zeide tot hem: Doe de schoenen af van uw voeten, want de plaats, waarop gij staat, is heilige grond!
[7:34] Ik heb zeer wel de verdrukking gezien van mijn volk in Egypte, en hun zuchten heb Ik gehoord, en Ik ben nedergekomen om hen te verlossen; en nu, kom, u zal Ik naar Egypte zenden!
[7:35] Dezen Mozes, dien zij verworpen hadden, zeggende: Wie heeft u tot overste en rechter aangesteld? — dezen heeft God gezonden tot overste en verlosser onder leiding van den engel die hem was verschenen in den braambosch.
[7:36] Deze heeft hen uitgeleid, mirakelen en teekenen doende in Egypteland en in de Roode Zee en in de woestijn, veertig jaar lang.
[7:37] Deze is die Mozes die tot de kinderen Israëls sprak: Een profeet zal God u verwekken uit uw broeders, zooals mij; dien zult gij hooren.
[7:38] Deze is het, die in de vergadering in de woestijn met den engel was, die tot hem sprak op den berg Sinaï en met onze vaders; die levende woorden ontving om ons te geven;
[7:39] wien onze vaders niet wilden gehoorzaam zijn, maar zij verwierpen hem en keerden in hun harten weder naar Egypte,
[7:40] en zeiden tot Aäron: Maak ons goden, die vóór ons heengaan; want die Mozes, die ons uit het land Egypte geleid heeft, wij weten niet wat hem overkomen is!
[7:41] En zij maakten een kalf in die dagen en brachten een offerande aan den afgod, en waren vroolijk over de werken hunner handen.
[7:42] Maar God keerde zich om en gaf hen over om het heirleger des hemels te dienen, zooals geschreven is in het boek der profeten: Aan Mij hebt gij toch geen slachtoffers en offerande gebracht, veertig jaar in de woestijn, o huis van Israël?
[7:43] Hebt gij niet zelfs den tabernakel van Moloch en de ster van den God Remfan opgenomen, de beelden die gij gemaakt hebt om te aanbidden? Ik zal u ook wegvoeren naar de andere zijde van Babylon!
[7:44] Onze vaders hadden den tabernakel der getuigenis in de woestijn, zooals Hij had bevolen, die tot Mozes zeide, dat hij dien maken zou naar het voorbeeld dat hij gezien had.
[7:45] En dien namen ook onze vaderen en brachten hem met Josua in het land dat de heidenen bezaten, die God verdreven heeft voor het aangezicht onzer vaderen, tot de dagen van David toe.
[7:46] Deze vond genade voor Gods aangezicht en begeerde een woning te vinden voor den God Jakobs.
[7:47] En Salomo bouwde Hem een huis.
[7:48] Maar de Allerhoogste woont niet in hetgeen met handen gemaakt is, zooals de profeet zegt:
[7:49] De hemel is mijn troon en de aarde een voetbank mijner voeten! Welk huis zoudt gij Mij bouwen? zegt de Heere, — of welke is de plaats mijner ruste?
[7:50] Heeft niet mijn hand dit alles gemaakt?
[7:51] Hardnekkige en onbesnedenen van hart en ooren! altijd wederstaat gij den Heiligen Geest, gelijk uw vaders, alzoo ook gijlieden!
[7:52] Wien der profeten hebben uw vaders niet vervolgd? — Zij hebben zelfs hen gedood die vooraf spraken van de komst des Rechtvaardigen, van wien gij nu verraders en moordenaars zijt geworden!
[7:53] gij, die de wet ontvangen hebt, door bemiddeling der engelen, en ze niet hebt bewaard! 
[7:54]  Toen zij nu dit hoorden, barstte hun het harte, en zij knarsten de tanden tegen hem.
[7:55] Maar hij was vol van den Heiligen Geest, en hield de oogen naar den hemel, en zag de glorie Gods en Jezus, staande aan Gods rechterhand;
[7:56] en hij zeide: Ziet, ik zie de hemelen geopend, en den Zoon des menschen staan aan Gods rechterhand!
[7:57] Maar zij schreeuwden met luide stem, en stopten hun ooren en vielen eenparig op hem aan.
[7:58] En zij wierpen hem de stad uit en steenigden hem. En de getuigen leiden hun kleederen af aan de voeten van een jongeling, genaamd Saulus.
[7:59] En zij steenigden Stefanus, die aanriep en zeide: Heere Jezus! ontvang mijn geest!
[7:60] En hij viel op de knieën en riep met een luide stem: Heere! reken hun deze zonde niet toe! — En als hij dit gezegd had, ontsliep hij. — En Saulus stemde mede toe in zijn dood.  
[8:1] Te dien dage nu ontstond er een groote vervolging tegen de gemeente in Jerusalem; en zij werden allen verstrooid door de landen van Judea en Samaria, behalve de Apostelen.
[8:2] Eenige godvruchtige mannen nu begroeven Stefanus en maakten grooten rouw over hem.
[8:3] En Saulus verwoestte de gemeente, daar hij de huizen binnenging, en mannen en vrouwen wegslepende, leverde hij ze over in de gevangenis. 
[8:4]  Zij nu die verstrooid waren, trokken rond terwijl zij het woord verkondigden.
[8:5] En Filippus kwam af naar een stad van Samaria en predikte hun den Christus.
[8:6] En de scharen luisterden eenparig naar hetgeen door Filippus gezegd werd, terwijl zij de teekenen hoorden en zagen die hij deed.
[8:7] Want van velen, die onreine geesten hadden, gingen zij uit, roepende met luide stem, en veel lammen en kreupelen werden genezen;
[8:8] en er ontstond groote blijdschap in die stad. 
[8:9]  Een zeker man nu, met name Simon, hield zich te voren in de stad op met tooverij, en verleidde het volk van Samaria, zich zelven voor wat groots uitgevende.
[8:10] Naar wien allen, van klein tot groot, luisterden, zeggende: Deze is de kracht Gods, die de groote genaamd wordt!
[8:11] Zij luisterden dan naar hem omdat hij een langen tijd hen door tooverijen verleid had.
[8:12] Maar toen zij Filippus geloofden, die hun de goede tijding van het koninkrijk Gods verkondigde, en van den Naam van Jezus Christus, toen werden mannen en vrouwen gedoopt.
[8:13] En Simon geloofde zelf ook, en toen hij gedoopt was bleef hij steeds bij Filippus, en ziende de teekenen en groote krachten die geschiedden, verwonderde hij zich.
[8:14] Toen nu de Apostelen te Jerusalem hoorden dat Samaria het woord Gods had aangenomen, zonden zij Petrus en Johannes tot hen.
[8:15] Dezen, afgekomen zijnde, baden voor hen dat zij den Heiligen Geest mochten ontvangen.
[8:16] Want die was nog op niemand van hen gevallen; alleenlijk waren zij gedoopt in den Naam van den Heere Jezus.
[8:17] Toen leiden zij de handen op hen en zij ontvingen den Heiligen Geest.
[8:18] Toen nu Simon zag dat de Heilige Geest werd gegeven door de oplegging der handen van de Apostelen, zoo bood hij hun geld aan, zeggende:
[8:19] Geeft ook aan mij die macht, opdat hij, wien ik de handen opleg, den Heiligen Geest ontvange.
[8:20] Maar Petrus zeide tot hem: Uw geld ga met u ten verderve, omdat gij gemeend hebt dat de gave Gods voor geld is te verkrijgen;
[8:21] gij hebt geen deel of lot in deze zaak, want uw hart is niet onrecht voor God;
[8:22] heb dan berouw over deze uw boosheid, en bid God, of misschien u dit opzet uws harten vergeven worde,
[8:23] want ik zie dat gij zijt in een zeer bittere gal en in banden der onrechtvaardigheid.
[8:24] Doch Simon antwoordde en zeide: Bidt gijlieden voor mij tot den Heere, opdat niets over mij kome van hetgeen gij gezegd hebt! 
[8:25]  Zij dan, nadat zij het woord des Heeren betuigd en gesproken hadden, keerden terug naar Jerusalem, en verkondigden in vele dorpen der Samaritanen het Evangelie.
[8:26] En een engel des Heeren sprak tot Filippus en zeide: Sta op en ga naar het zuiden, op den weg die van Jerusalem naar Gaza leidt; deze is eenzaam.
[8:27] En hij stond op en ging heen. En zie, een man van Ethiopië, een kamerling van groot aanzien, van Kandace, een koningin der Ethiopiërs, die over haar geheelen schat gesteld was, was naar Jerusalem gekomen om te aanbidden.
[8:28] En hij keerde terug en zat op zijn wagen den profeet Jesaja te lezen,
[8:29] De Geest nu zeide tot Filippus: Ga, en voeg u bij dien wagen!
[8:30] En Filippus liep toe en hoorde hem den profeet Jesaja lezen, en zeide: Verstaat gij wel, wat gij leest?
[8:31] En hij zeide: Hoe zou ik dat kunnen, als niemand mij onderricht? En hij verzocht Filippus op te klimmen en bij hem te komen zitten.
[8:32] Het deel nu der Schrifture dat hij las, was dit: Als een schaap is Hij ter slachtbank gevoerd, en zooals een lam stom is voor hem die het scheert, alzoo doet Hij zijn mond niet open;
[8:33] in zijn vernedering is zijn oordeel weggenomen, en zijn geslacht, wie zal het verhalen? want zijn leven is van de aarde weggenomen.
[8:34] En de kamerling antwoordde Filippus en zeide: Ik bid u, van wien zegt de profeet dit? van zich zelven of van een ander?
[8:35] En Filippus opende zijn mond en begon van deze Schrifture en predikte hem Jezus.
[8:36] Toen zij nu langs den weg voortgingen, kwamen zij bij een water; en de kamerling zeide: Daar is water! wat belet mij gedoopt te worden?
[8:37] (En Fillippus zeide: Als gij van ganscher harte gelooft, is het geoorloofd! Hij nu antwoordde en zeide: Ik geloof dat Jezus Christus de Zoon van God is.)
[8:38] En hij gebood den wagen stil te houden, en zij daalden beiden af in het water, zoowel Filippus als de kamerling, en hij doopte hem.
[8:39] Toen zij nu opkwamen uit het water, voerde de Geest des Heeren Filippus weg, en de kamerling zag hem niet meer, want hij ging zijn weg met vreugde.
[8:40] Maar Filippus werd gevonden te Azote, en door trekkende verkondigde hij in alle steden het Evangelie totdat hij te Cesaréa kwam.  
[9:1] Saulus nu blies nog dreiging en moord tegen de discipelen des Heeren en ging naar den hoogepriester,
[9:2] en vroeg aan hem om brieven naar Damaskus aan de synagogen, opdat, zoo hij daar eenige aanhangers van Jezus vond, hij die, beide mannen en vrouwen, geboeid naar Jerusalem zou voeren. 
[9:3]  Onder de reis nu, toen hij Damaskus naderde, geschiedde het dat hem op eens een licht van den hemel omstraalde.
[9:4] En hij viel op den grond en hoorde een stem die tot hem zeide: Saul, Saul! wat vervolgt gij Mij!
[9:5] Hij dan zeide: Wie zijt Gij Heere? En de Heere sprak: Ik ben Jezus, dien gij vervolgt! Het is u hard achteruit te slaan tegen de prikkels.
[9:6] En hij, bevende en verbaasd zijnde, zeide: Heere, wat wilt Gij dat ik doen zal? En de Heere zeide tot hem: Sta op en ga naar de stad, en u zal gezegd worden wat gij doen moet.
[9:7] De mannen nu, die met hem reisden, stonden verstomd, daar ze wel de stem hoorden, maar niemand zagen.
[9:8] En Saulus stond van den grond op, en als hij zijn oogen open deed zag hij niets. En zij leidden hem bij de hand en brachten hem naar Damaskus.
[9:9] En hij was drie dagen dat hij niet zag, en hij at of dronk niet.
[9:10] Er was nu te Damaskus een zeker discipel, Ananias genaamd; en de Heere zeide tot hem in een visioen: Ananias! — En hij zeide: Zie, hier ben ik, Heere!
[9:11] En de Heere zeide tot hem: Sta op, ga naar de straat, de Rechte genaamd, en vraag in het huis van Judas naar een zekeren Saulus van Tarsus, want zie, hij bidt; 
[9:12] en hij heeft in een visioen een man gezien, met name Ananias, die tot hem kwam en hem de handen opleide opdat hij weder ziende zou worden.
[9:13] En Ananias antwoordde: Heere, ik heb van velen gehoord aangaande dezen man, hoeveel kwaads hij aan uw heiligen te Jerusalem heeft gedaan,
[9:14] en hoe hij hier volmacht heeft van de overpriesters om te binden allen die uw Naam aanroepen!
[9:15] Maar de Heere zeide tot hem: Ga heen, want deze is Mij een uitverkoren werktuig, om mijn Naam te dragen voor de volken, en koningen, en de kinderen Israëls!
[9:16] want Ik zal hem aantoonen hoeveel hij voor mijn Naam zal moeten lijden.
[9:17] Ananias nu ging heen, en kwam in het huis, en leide hem de handen op en zeide: Saul, broeder! de Heere heeft mij gezonden, Jezus, die u verscheen op den weg dien gij kwaamt, opdat gij weder ziende en met den Heiligen Geest vervuld zoudt worden.
[9:18] En terstond vielen er als schillen van zijn oogen, en hij werd weder ziende; en hij stond op en werd gedoopt; en hij nam spijs en werd versterkt. 
[9:19]  Saulus nu was eenige dagen in Damaskus bij de discipelen,
[9:20] en terstond predikte hij Jezus in de synagogen, dat Hij de Zoon van God is.
[9:21] En allen die het hoorden, stonden verbaasd, en zeiden: Is deze het niet, die te Jerusalem hen uitroeide die dezen Naam aanroepen, en die daarom hier gekomen is opdat hij hen gebonden naar de overpriesters zou voeren?
[9:22] Maar Saulus werd al meer bekrachtigd en beschaamde de Joden die in Damaskus woonden, daar hij bewees dat deze de Christus is. 
[9:23]  Toen er nu veel dagen verloopen waren, beraadslaagden de Joden om hem om het leven te brengen.
[9:24] Doch hun aanslag werd aan Saulus bekend. En zij bewaakten zelfs de poorten dag en nacht om hem om te brengen.
[9:25] Maar zijn discipelen namen hem en lieten hem des nachts door den muur neder, hem aflatende in een mand.
[9:26] Toen hij nu te Jerusalem was gekomen, trachtte hij zich bij de discipelen te voegen; en zij vreesden hem allen omdat zij niet geloofden dat hij een discipel was.
[9:27] Maar Barnabas nam hem en leidde hem tot de Apostelen, en verhaalde hun hoe hij op den weg den Heere gezien had en hoe deze tot hem gesproken had, en hoe hij te Damaskus vrijmoedig had gesproken in den Naam van Jezus.
[9:28] En hij was met hen in– en uitgaande te Jerusalem en sprak vrijmoedig in den Naam des Heeren.
[9:29] En hij sprak en redetwistte ook met de Hellenisten, maar die trachtten hem om te brengen.
[9:30] Maar toen de broeders dit bemerkten, geleidden zij hem naar Cesarea en zonden hem weg naar Tarsus. 
[9:31]  De gemeente dan door geheel Judea en Galilea en Samaria had vrede, en werd uitgebreid, daar zij werd opgebouwd en wandelde in de vreeze des Heeren en in de vermaning des Heiligen Geestes. 
[9:32]  Het geschiedde nu, toen Petrus overal heen trok, dat hij ook bij de heiligen kwam die te Lydda woonden.
[9:33] En daar vond hij een man, Eneas genaamd, die al acht jaar te bed had gelegen en lam was.
[9:34] En Petrus zeide tot hem: Eneas, Jezus Christus maakt u gezond! sta op en maak u zelven het bed! En hij stond dadelijk op.
[9:35] En allen die te Lydda en te Saron woonden, zagen hem en bekeerden zich tot den Heere. 
[9:36]  Te Joppe nu was een zekere discipelin, genaamd Tabitha, dat is overgezet: Dorkas. Deze was vol goede werken en aalmoezen, die zij deed.
[9:37] Het geschiedde nu in die dagen dat zij ziek werd en stierf; en als zij haar gewasschen hadden, leiden zij haar in een bovenkamer.
[9:38] Daar nu Lydda dicht bij Joppe was en de discipelen hoorden dat Petrus aldaar was, zonden zij twee mannen tot hem om hem dringend te vragen: Vertoef niet tot ons over te komen!
[9:39] En Petrus stond op en ging met hen; en toen hij aangekomen was brachten zij hem naar de bovenkamer; en al de weduwen stonden weenende bij hem en toonden hem de rokken en mantels die Dorkas gemaakt had toen zij bij haar was.
[9:40] Doch Petrus dreef haar allen uit en boog zijn knieën en bad; en hij keerde zich tot het lichaam en zeide: Tabitha, sta op! En zij opende haar oogen; en toen zij Petrus zag, ging zij recht zitten.
[9:41] En hij gaf haar de hand en deed haar opstaan; en de heiligen en de weduwen geroepen hebbende, stelde hij haar levend voor hen.
[9:42] En het werd bekend door geheel Joppe en velen geloofden in den Heere.
[9:43] En het geschiedde dat hij vele dagen te Joppe bleef bij zekeren Simon, een leerlooier.  
[10:1] Te Cesarea was een zeker man, Kornelius genaamd, een hoofdman uit den troep, die de Italiaansche werd genaamd;
[10:2] godvruchtig en vreezende God met geheel zijn huis; en hij gaf veel aalmoezen aan het volk en bad voortdurend tot God.
[10:3] En hij zag duidelijk in een visioen, omtrent de negende ure van den dag, een engel Gods, die tot hem inkwam en tot hem zeide: Kornelius!
[10:4] En hij zag hem bevreesd aan en zeide: Wat is er, Heere? En hij zeide tot hem: Uw gebeden en aalmoezen zijn tot gedachtenis opgeklommen voor Gods aangezicht;
[10:5] en nu, zend mannen naar Joppe en ontbied zekeren Simon, wiens bijnaam Petrus is;
[10:6] deze is geherbergd bij zekeren Simon, een leerlooier, wiens huis bij de zee is; deze zal u zeggen wat gij doen moet.
[10:7] Toen nu de engel, die tot Kornelius gesproken had, weggegaan was, riep hij twee zijner huisknechten en een godvruchtigen krijgsknecht, die steeds bij hem waren,
[10:8] en hun alles verhaald hebbende, zond hij hen naar Joppe. 
[10:9]  Den volgenden dag nu, terwijl dezen op weg waren en de stad naderden, klom Petrus op het dak om te bidden, omtrent de zesde ure.
[10:10] En hij kreeg honger en wilde wat eten. Maar terwijl zij het voor hem toebereidden, kwam er een geestverrukking over hem.
[10:11] En hij zag den hemel open en iets nederdalen als een groot linnen laken, dat bij vier hoeken werd nedergelaten op de aarde,
[10:12] waarin allerlei viervoetige– en wilde– en kruipende dieren der aarde waren, en vogelen des hemels.
[10:13] En er kwam een stem tot hem: Sta op, Petrus, slacht en eet!
[10:14] Maar Petrus zeide: Volstrekt niet, Heere, want nooit heb ik gegeten iets wat onheilig of onrein was!
[10:15] En wederom ten tweeden male kwam een stem tot hem: Wat God heeft gereinigd is voor u niet onheilig!
[10:16] Dit geschiedde dan tot driemaal toe, en terstond werd het laken opgenomen naar den hemel.
[10:17] Toen nu Petrus in zich zelven verlegen was, wat toch het visioen, dat hij gezien had, zijn mocht, ziet, de mannen die door Kornelius afgezonden waren, en naar het huis van Simon gevraagd hadden, stonden aan de poort;
[10:18] en zij riepen en vroegen, of Simon, bijgenaamd Petrus, daar geherbergd was?
[10:19] Terwijl nu Petrus op dit visioen peinsde, zeide de Geest tot hem: Zie, drie mannen zoeken u!
[10:20] maar sta op en ga naar beneden, en ga zonder bedenken met hen, want Ik heb hen gezonden!
[10:21] En Petrus ging naar beneden en zeide tot de mannen: Ziet, ik ben het dien gij zoekt; wat is de reden dat gij hier zijt?
[10:22] En zij zeiden: Kornelius, een hoofdman, een rechtvaardig en godvruchtig man, en die getuigenis heeft van het geheele volk der Joden, is door een heiligen engel van Gods wege vermaand om u naar zijn huis te ontbieden en van u woorden te hooren. En Petrus leidde hen binnen en herbergde hen. 
[10:23]  Den volgenden dag nu stond Petrus op en ging met hen; en sommigen der broederen van Joppe gingen met hem.
[10:24] En des anderen daags kwamen zij te Cesarea. En Kornelius was hen wachtende, en had zijn familie en naaste vrienden samengeroepen.
[10:25] En het geschiedde, toen Petrus binnenkwam, dat Kornelius hem te gemoet ging en aan zijn voeten vallende aanbad hij.
[10:26] Maar Petrus richtte hem op en zeide: Sta op, ik zelf ben ook een mensch!
[10:27] En al sprekende met hem ging hij binnen en vond er velen vergaderd.
[10:28] En hij zeide tot hen: Gijlieden weet dat het een joodsch man niet geoorloofd is zich te voegen of te gaan bij een vreemdeling; doch mij heeft God getoond geen mensch onheilig of onrein te houden.
[10:29] Daarom ben ik ook zonder tegenspreken gekomen toen ik ontboden was. Ik vraag dan: Waarom hebt gij mij ontboden?
[10:30] En Kornelius zeide: Vier dagen geleden was ik vastende tot op deze ure, en ter negender ure bad ik in mijn huis; en ziet, een man stond voor mij in een glinsterend kleed,
[10:31] en zeide: Kornelius, uw gebed is verhoord en uw aalmoezen zijn gedacht voor Gods aangezicht;
[10:32] zend dan naar Joppe en ontbied Simon, die Petrus bijgenaamd wordt; die is geherbergd in het huis van Simon, een leerlooier, bij de zee; die zal komen en tot u spreken.
[10:33] Ik heb dan terstond tot u gezonden, en gij hebt goed gedaan van te komen. Nu zijn wij dan allen hier voor Gods aangezicht om alles te hooren wat u door God bevolen is.
[10:34] En Petrus opende den mond en zeide: Waarlijk, ik bemerk dat God geen aannemer des persoons is,
[10:35] maar dat onder ieder volk Hem aangenaam is degene die Hem vreest en rechtvaardigheid doet!
[10:36] Dit is het woord dat Hij den kinderen Israëls heeft gezonden, verkondigende vrede door Jezus Christus; deze is een Heere van allen.
[10:37] Gij weet de zaak die door geheel Judea geschied is, begonnen van Galilea, na den doop dien Johannes heeft gepredikt;
[10:38] hoe God Jezus van Nazaret heeft gezalfd met den Heiligen Geest en kracht; die goeddoende rondtrok, en genezende allen die door den duivel overheerscht waren; want God was met Hem.
[10:39] En wij zijn getuigen van alles wat Hij gedaan heeft, zoowel in het land der Joden als te Jerusalem; dien zij ook aan een hout gehangen en omgebracht hebben.
[10:40] Dezen heeft God op den derden dag opgewekt en openlijk doen verschijnen,
[10:41] niet aan het geheele volk, maar aan ons, de getuigen, door God te voren verkozen, die met Hem gegeten en gedronken hebben nadat. Hij was verrezen uit de dooden.
[10:42] En Hij heeft ons geboden den volke te prediken en te betuigen dat Hij het is die door God is verordend tot een Rechter van levenden en dooden.
[10:43] Aan dezen geven al de profeten getuigenis, dat door zijn Naam vergiffenis van zonden ontvangt een ieder die in Hem gelooft. 
[10:44]  Terwijl Petrus nog deze woorden sprak, Adel de Heilige Geest op allen die het woord hoorden.
[10:45] En de geloovigen uit de besnijdenis, zoovelen als er met Petrus medegekomen waren, stonden verbaasd, dat ook op de heidenen de gave des Heiligen Geestes was uitgestort.
[10:46] Want zij hoorden hen met tongen spreken en God grootmaken.
[10:47] Toen antwoordde Petrus: Kan iemand wel het water weigeren, dat dezen niet zouden gedoopt worden, die toch den Heiligen Geest hebben ontvangen zooals ook wij?
[10:48] En hij gebood dat zij in den Naam van den Heere Jezus Christus zouden gedoopt worden. Toen verzochten zij hem eenige dagen te blijven.  
[11:1] De Apostelen nu en de broeders die in Judea waren, hoorden dat ook de heidenen het woord Gods hadden aangenomen.
[11:2] Maar toen Petrus te Jerusalem was gekomen twistten zij, die uit de besnijdenis waren, met hem,
[11:3] en zeiden: Gij zijt ingegaan tot onbesnedenen en hebt met hen gegeten! 
[11:4]  Maar Petrus begon het hun achtereenvolgens te verklaren en zeide:
[11:5] Ik was in de stad Joppe, biddende; en ik zag in een geestverrukking een visioen: er daalde een groot linnen laken, aan de vier hoeken nedergelaten, uit den hemel en het kwam tot bij mij;
[11:6] en ik keek daar nauwkeurig op en ik zag de viervoetige dieren der aarde, en de wilde– en de kruipende dieren, en de vogelen des hemels;
[11:7] en ik hoorde ook een stem tot mij zeggen: Sta op, Petrus, slacht en eet!
[11:8] maar ik zeide: Volstrekt niet Heere! want iets onheiligs of onreins is nooit in mijn mond gegaan!
[11:9] doch de stem antwoordde ten tweeden male uit den hemel: Wat God gereinigd heeft is voor u niet onheilig!
[11:10] dit geschiedde dan tot driemaal toe en alles werd weder opgenomen naar den hemel.
[11:11] En ziet, op hetzelfde oogenblik stonden er drie mannen voor het huis waar ik was, van Cesarea tot mij gezonden;
[11:12] en de Geest zeide mij zonder bedenken met hen te gaan. En met mij gingen ook deze zes broederen, en wij kwamen in des mans huis.
[11:13] En hij verhaalde ons hoe hij den engel in zijn huis had zien staan, die zeide: Zend naar Joppe en ontbied Simon, bijgenaamd Petrus,
[11:14] die zal woorden tot u spreken, waardoor gij en uw geheele huis zult behouden worden!
[11:15] En toen ik begon te spreken, viel de Heilige Geest op hen, zooals ook op ons in den beginne.
[11:16] Toen werd ik indachtig aan het woord des Heeren, hoe Hij zeide: Johannes doopte wel met water, maar gij zult worden gedoopt met den Heiligen Geest.
[11:17] Indien God dan gelijke gifte aan hen heeft gegeven gelijk als aan ons, die in den Heere Jezus Christus hebben geloofd— wie was ik toch die God zou kunnen verhinderen?
[11:18] Toen zij nu dit gehoord hadden, berustten zij erin, en gaven God de glorie, zeggende: Zoo heeft God dan ook aan de heidenen de boetvaardigheid ten leven gegeven! 
[11:19]  Zij nu die verstrooid waren, door de verdrukking die over Stefanus was geschied, trokken door tot Fenicië, en Cyprus, en Antiochië, tot niemand het woord sprekende dan alleen tot de Joden.
[11:20] Doch er waren onder hen eenige mannen van Cyprus en Cyrene, die naar Antiochië kwamen en ook tot de Grieken spraken, verkondigende den Heere Jezus.
[11:21] En de hand des Heeren was met hen, en een groot getal geloofde en bekeerde zich tot den Heere. 
[11:22]  En het gerucht van hen kwam ter ooren van de gemeente die te Jerusalem was; en zij zonden Barnabas uit, tot naar Antiochië toe.
[11:23] Deze nu, aldaar gekomen zijnde en de genade Gods ziende, verheugde zich en vermaande allen om met een hartelijk voornemen bij den Heere te blijven.
[11:24] Want hij was een goed man en vol des Heiligen Geestes en des geloofs. En een groote menigte werd den Heere toegevoegd. 
[11:25]  En Barnabas ging naar Tarsus om Saulus op te zoeken; en hij vond en geleidde hem naar Antiochië.
[11:26] En het gebeurde hun dat zij zelfs een geheel jaar samen waren in de gemeente en een groote schare onderwezen, en dat de discipelen te Antiochië het eerst christenen werden genoemd. 
[11:27]  In die dagen nu kwamen er profeten van Jerusalem naar Antiochië.
[11:28] En een van hen, Agabus genaamd, stond op en gaf door den Geest te kennen dat er een groote hongersnood zou komen over de geheele aarde; die ook gekomen is onder Klaudius.
[11:29] En de discipelen besloten dat ieder, naar zijn vermogen, onderstand zou zenden aan de broederen die in Judea woonden.
[11:30] En dit deden zij ook en zonden het naar de oudsten te Jerusalem door de hand van Barnabas en Saulus.  
[12:1] Omtrent dien tijd nu sloeg de koning Herodes de handen aan sommigen van de gemeente om hun kwaad te doen;
[12:2] en hij doodde Jakobus, den broeder van Johannes, met het zwaard. 
[12:3]  En toen hij zag dat dit den Joden welgevallig was, ging hij voort en nam ook Petrus gevangen; — het was in de dagen der ongezuurde brooden.
[12:4] En als hij hem gegrepen had zette hij hem in de gevangenis, en gaf hem ter bewaking aan vier wachten, elk van vier soldaten, met het plan om hem na het paaschfeest voor het volk te brengen.
[12:5] Petrus werd dus in de gevangenis bewaard, maar door de gemeente werd zonder ophouden een gebed tot God voor hem gedaan.
[12:6] Toen nu Herodes hem wilde voorbrengen, sliep Petrus dien zelfden nacht tusschen twee soldaten, gebonden met twee ketenen, en wachters vóór de deur bewaarden de gevangenis.
[12:7] En ziet, een engel des Heeren stond daar, en een licht scheen in het vertrek; en hij stiet Petrus in de zijde en maakte hem wakker, zeggende: Sta haastig op! — En hem vielen de ketenen van de handen.
[12:8] En de engel zeide tot hem: Omgord u en maak uw schoenen vast! En hij deed alzoo. En hij zeide tot hem: Sla uw mantel om en volg mij!
[12:9] En hij ging uit en volgde. En hij wist niet dat het waarachtig was wat door den engel geschiedde, maar hij meende dat hij een visioen zag.
[12:10] En toen zij de eerste en de tweede wacht waren doorgegaan, kwamen zij bij de ijzeren poort, die naar de stad leidt; en die ging vanzelf voor hen open, en zij gingen er uit en gingen een straat voort. En op eens scheidde de engel van hem.
[12:11] En Petrus kwam tot zich zelven en zeide: Nu weet ik waarlijk dat de Heere zijn engel heeft gezonden en mij verlost heeft uit de hand van Herodes, en uit al de verwachting van het volk der Joden.
[12:12] En overlegd hebbende ging hij naar het huis van Maria, de moeder van Johannes, bijgenaamd Markus, waar velen biddend vergaderd waren.
[12:13] En toen hij aan de deur der poort geklopt had, kwam er een dienstmaagd met name Rhode, om open te doen.
[12:14] En de stem van Petrus herkennende, deed zij van blijdschap de poort niet open, maar liep naar binnen en boodschapte dat Petrus voor de poort stond.
[12:15] Maar zij zeiden tot haar: Gij raast! Doch zij hield vol dat het zoo was. En zij zeiden: Het is zijn engel!
[12:16] Petrus nu bleef kloppen, en als zij hadden opengedaan, zagen ze hem en stonden verbaasd.
[12:17] En toen hij hun met de hand had gewenkt om te zwijgen, vertelde hij hoe de Heere hem uit de gevangenis had uitgeleid en zeide: Boodschapt dit aan Jakobus en de broeders. — En hij ging uit en vertrok naar een andere plaats. 
[12:18]  Als het nu dag was geworden, was er geen kleine beweging onder de soldaten, wat er toch van Petrus mocht geworden zijn.
[12:19] En als Herodes hem had gezocht maar niet gevonden, ondervroeg hij de wachters en gebood dat zij zouden weggevoerd worden. En hij ging af van Judea naar Cesarea en bleef daar. 
[12:20]  Herodes nu was in twist met de Tyriërs en de Sidoniërs; maar zij kwamen gezamenlijk bij hem en wonnen Blastus, die des konings kamerheer was, voor zich, en verzochten om vrede; want hun land werd gespijzigd van dat des konings.
[12:21] En op een bepaalden dag deed Herodes een koninklijk kleed aan, en zittende op den rechterstoel hield hij een rede tot hen.
[12:22] En het volk riep uit: De stem van een god en niet van een mensch!
[12:23] En op dat zelfde oogenblik sloeg hem een engel des Heeren, omdat hij Gode de glorie niet gaf; en door de wormen verteerd zijnde, gaf hij den geest. 
[12:24]  En het woord Gods nam toe en vermeerderde. 
[12:25]  Barnabas nu en Saulus keerden terug van Jerusalem, als zij den dienst volbracht hadden, en namen ook Johannes mede, die bijgenaamd wordt Markus.  
[13:1] En er waren te Antiochië in de gemeente die daar was, profeten en leeraars, als Barnabas en Simeon die Niger genoemd wordt, en Lukiüs de Cyreneër, en Manahen de zoogbroeder van den viervorst Herodes, en Saulus.
[13:2] En terwijl zij den Heere dienden en vastten, zeide de Heilige Geest: Zondert mij Barnabas en Saulus af tot het werk waartoe Ik hen geroepen heb!
[13:3] Toen vastten en baden zij en hun de handen opgelegd hebbende, lieten zij hen heengaan. 
[13:4]  Zij dan nu, door den Heiligen Geest uitgezonden zijnde, gingen af naar Seleucië, en vandaar voeren zij over naar Cyprus.
[13:5] En in Salamis zijnde verkondigden zij het woord Gods in de synagogen der Joden, en zij hadden ook Johannes tot een dienaar.
[13:6] En het geheele eiland doorgegaan zijnde tot Pafos toe, vonden zij zekeren toovenaar, een schijnprofeet, een Jood; Bar–Jezus genaamd;
[13:7] die was bij den Stadhouder Sergius Paulus, een verstandigen man. Deze riep Barnabas en Saulus tot zich en zocht zeer om het woord Gods te hooren.
[13:8] Maar Elymas de toovenaar (want zóó wordt zijn naam overgezet) stond hun tegen en zocht den stadhouder van het geloof af te keeren.
[13:9] Maar Saulus (ook Paulus genoemd), vol zijnde des Heiligen Geestes, zag hem sterk aan en zeide:
[13:10] O gij, die vol zijt van alle bedrog en van alle arglistigheid, gij, zoon des duivels, vijand van alle rechtvaardigheid! Zult gij niet ophouden de rechte wegen des Heeren te verkeeren?
[13:11] En nu zie, de hand des Heeren is tegen u! en gij zult blind zijn en een tijd lang de zon niet zien! — En terstond viel over hem nevel en duisternis; en rondtastende zocht hij een wegwijzer.
[13:12] Toen de stadhouder zag wat er geschied was, geloofde hij, en stond verslagen over de leer des Heeren. 
[13:13]  Paulus nu en die bij hem waren, van Pafos afgevaren zijnde, kwamen te Perge in Pamfylië. Maar Johannes nam afscheid van hen en keerde terug naar Jerusalem.
[13:14] En zij trokken door van Perge en kwamen te Antiochië in Pisidië, en gingen naar de synagoge op den dag des sabbats en zetten zich neder.
[13:15] Na het voorlezen nu van de wet en de profeten zonden de oversten der sinagoge tot hen, zeggende: Mannen broeders, indien gij eenig woord tot vermaning hebt tot het volk, spreekt dan!
[13:16] En Paulus stond op, en wenkte met de hand en zeide: Mannen Israëls, en gij die godvruchtigen zijt, luistert!
[13:17] De God van dit volk Israël verkoos onze vaderen, en verhoogde het volk toen het vreemdeling was in het land van Egypte, en met een opgeheven arm leidde Hij het daaruit;
[13:18] en omtrent veertig jaar lang verdroeg Hij hun gewoonten in de woestijn;
[13:19] en nadat Hij zeven volken had uitgeroeid in het land Kanaän, gaf Hij hun het land tot een erfdeel, omtrent vierhonderd en vijftig jaar lang;
[13:20] en daarna gaf Hij rechters, tot op Samuël den profeet;
[13:21] en van toen af eischten zij een koning; en God gaf hun Saul, den zoon van Kis, een man uit den stam van Benjamin, veertig jaar lang;
[13:22] en hem afgezet hebbende, verwekte Hij hun David tot koning, aan wien Hij ook getuigenis gaf, zeggende: Ik heb David gevonden, den zoon van Jesse, een man naar mijn hart, die geheel mijn wil zal doen.
[13:23] Uit de nakomelingschap van dezen heeft God, naar zijn belofte, voor Israël den Verlosser Jezus verwekt,
[13:24] nadat eerst Johannes, vóór zijn optreden, den doop der boetvaardigheid aan het geheele volk Israël gepredikt had;
[13:25] toen nu Johannes zijn loop volbracht had, zeide hij: Wie denkt gij, dat ik ben: Ik ben de Christus niet, maar ziet, Hij komt na mij wien ik niet waardig ben de schoenen zijner voeten los te maken!
[13:26] Mannen broeders! kinderen van Abrahams geslacht, en die onder u godvruchtigen zijt! tot u is het woord dezer verlossing gezonden!
[13:27] Want die te Jerusalem wonen en hun oversten hebben, daar zij dezen niet kenden, ook de uitspraken der profeten, die op iederen sabbat worden voorgelezen, vervuld, door Hem te veroordeelen;
[13:28] en geen doodschuld in Hem vindende, hebben zij van Pilatus geëischt dat Hij zou gedood worden;
[13:29] toen zij nu alles volbracht hadden wat van Hem geschreven is, namen zij Hem af van het kruis en leiden Hem in een graf;
[13:30] maar God heeft Hem opgewekt uit de dooden;
[13:31] En Hij verscheen vele dagen lang aan hen die met Hem van Galilea naar Jerusalem opgekomen waren en die nu zijn getuigen zijn bij het volk;
[13:32] en wij brengen u een goede tijding aangaande de belofte, die aan de vaderen is gedaan, dat God die vervuld heeft aan ons, hun kinderen, toen Hij Jezus heeft verwekt,
[13:33] zooals ook in den tweeden psalm is geschreven: Gij zijt mijn Zoon, heden heb Ik U verwekt!
[13:34] En dat Hij Hem uit de dooden heeft opgewekt, om niet meer tot verderf terug te keeren, heeft Hij alzoo gesproken: Ik zal ulieden het heilige Davids geven, dat zeker is.
[13:35] Daarom zegt Hij ook op een andere plaats: Gij zult uwen Heilige niet geven om verderf te zien.
[13:36] Want David, als hij in zijn eigen geslacht den raad Gods had gediend, is ontslapen en hij zijn vaderen gelegd, en heeft wel verderf gezien;
[13:37] maar Hij, wien God heeft opgewekt, heeft geen verderf gezien.
[13:38] Zoo zij u dan bekend, mannen broeders! dat door dezen aan ulieden vergiffenis van zonden wordt verkondigd;
[13:39] van alles toch, waarvan gij niet kondt gerechtvaardigd worden onder de wet van Mozes, kan een ieder die gelooft, gerechtvaardigd worden in Hem.
[13:40] Ziet dan toe, dat u niet overkome wat in de profeten gezegd is:
[13:41] Ziet, gij versmaders! en verwondert u, en verdwijnt! want Ik doe een werk in uw dagen, een werk dat gij niet zult gelooven, als iemand het u verhaalt!
[13:42] En als zij uitgingen verzochten zij dat op den volgenden sabbat dezelfde woorden tot hen zouden gesproken worden.
[13:43] Toen nu de synagoge uitgegaan was volgden veel Joden en godvruchtige proselieten Paulus en Barnabas, die tot hen spraken en hen bewogen om bij de genade Gods te blijven.
[13:44] Op den volgenden sabbat nu kwam bijna de geheele stad samen om het woord Gods te hooren. 
[13:45]  Maar toen de Joden de schare zagen, werden zij met jaloezie vervuld, en zij wederspraken wat door Paulus gezegd werd, tegensprekende en lasterende.
[13:46] Doch Paulus en Barnabas zeiden met vrijmoedigheid: Tot ulieden moest het woord Gods het eerst gesproken worden; maar omdat gij het verwerpt en u zelven des eeuwigen levens niet waardig oordeelt, ziet, wij keeren ons tot de heidenen!
[13:47] Zóó toch heeft ons de Heere geboden: Ik heb u gesteld tot een licht der heidenen om tot behoudenis te zijn tot de uitersten der aarde.
[13:48] Toen nu de heidenen dit hoorden waren zij verblijd en zij prezen het woord des Heeren, en zoovelen er verordineerd waren ten eeuwigen leven, geloofden.
[13:49] En het woord des Heeren werd verbreid door den geheelen omtrek. 
[13:50]  Maar de Joden stookten de aanzienlijke vrouwen op, die godsdienstig waren, en de voornaamsten der stad, en verwekten een vervolging tegen Paulus en Barnabas, en wierpen hen uit hun gebied.
[13:51] Doch zij schudden het stof der voeten tegen hen af en kwamen te Ikonium.
[13:52] En de discipelen werden vervuld met blijdschap en met den Heiligen Geest.  
[14:1] Het geschiedde nu in Ikonium dat zij samen gingen naar de synagoge der Joden, en dat zij zoodanig spraken dat een groote schare van Joden en Grieken geloofden.
[14:2] Maar de ongehoorzame Joden stookten de heidenen op en verbitterden hun zielen tegen de broederen.
[14:3] Een langen tijd dan bleven zij met vrijmoedigheid in den Heere spreken, die getuigenis gaf aan het woord zijner genade, en teekenen en mirakelen deed geschieden door hun handen.
[14:4] Het volk der stad nu werd verdeeld; en sommigen hielden het met de Joden en anderen met de Apostelen.
[14:5] Maar toen er een poging geschiedde, zoowel van de heidenen als van de Joden, met hun oversten, om hen te mishandelen en te steenigen,
[14:6] bemerkten zij dit en zij vluchtten naar de steden van Lykaonië, Lystre en Derbe, en den omtrek,
[14:7] en daar verkondigden zij het Evangelie. 
[14:8]  En er zat te Lystre een zeker man onmachtig aan de voeten, kreupel van zijn moeders lichaam af, die nooit gegaan had.
[14:9] Deze hoorde Paulus spreken, die hem sterk aankeek en zag dat hij geloof had om verlost te worden.
[14:10] En Paulus zeide met een luide stem: Sta recht op uw voeten! En hij sprong op en ging.
[14:11] En de scharen, ziende wat Paulus gedaan had, verhieven hun stem en zeiden in het Lykaonisch: De goden zijn aan menschen gelijk geworden en tot ons nedergedaald!
[14:12] En Barnabas noemden zij Jupiter en Paulus Merkurius, omdat deze de voornaamste spreker was.
[14:13] En de priester van Jupiter wiens tempel vóór de stad was, bracht stieren en kransen aan de poorten, en wilde met de scharen een offerande brengen.
[14:14] Maar toen de Apostelen Barnabas en Paulus dit hoorden, scheurden zij hun kleederen en sprongen naar buiten tot de schare, roepende en zeggende:
[14:15] Mannen! waarom doet gij dit? wij zijn toch menschen van gelijke natuur als gij, en wij prediken u dat gij van deze ijdelheden u zoudt bekeeren tot den levenden God, die gemaakt heeft den hemel, en de aarde, en de zee, en al wat daarin is;
[14:16] die in de voorgaande geslachten al de heidenen hun eigen wegen liet ingaan,
[14:17] hoewel Hij zich zelven niet onbetuigd heeft gelaten, daar Hij goed deed en u van den hemel regen gaf en vruchtbare tijden, u verzadigende met spijze en uw harten met vroolijkheid!
[14:18] En door dit te zeggen hielden zij de scharen met moeite terug van hun offeranden te brengen.
[14:19] Maar er kwamen eenige Joden daarbij van Antiochië en Ikonium, en nadat zij de scharen overreed en Paulus gesteenigd hadden, sleepten zij hem buiten de stad, meenende dat hij dood was.
[14:20] Maar toen de discipelen hem omringden, stond hij op en ging in de stad; en den volgenden dag ging hij met Barnabas naar Derbe. 
[14:21]  Toen zij nu aan deze stad het Evangelie verkondigd en velen tot discipelen gemaakt hadden, keerden zij terug naar Lystre, en naar Ikonium, en naar Antiochië,
[14:22] versterkende de zielen der discipelen, hen vermanende om te blijven in het geloof en dat wij door veel verdrukkingen het koninkrijk Gods moeten ingaan.
[14:23] Toen zij hun nu in elke gemeente door het opsteken der handen oudsten hadden verkozen, bevalen zij hen onder bidden met vasten aan den Heere, in wien zij geloofd hadden.
[14:24] En zij trokken door Pisidië en kwamen in Pamfylië.
[14:25] En als zij het woord in Perge gesproken hadden, gingen zij af naar Attalië.
[14:26] En vandaar voeren zij naar Antiochië, vanwaar zij aan de genade Gods bevolen waren tot het werk dat zij volbracht hadden.
[14:27] Toen zij nu daar gekomen waren en de gemeente vergaderd hadden, verhaalden zij hoe groote dingen God met hen had gedaan, en dat Hij voor de heidenen de deur des geloofs had geopend.
[14:28] En zij bleven geen korten tijd met de discipelen.  
[15:1] En sommigen, die van Judea afgekomen waren, leerden de broeders: Als gij niet besneden wordt naar de gewoonte van Mozes, dan kunt gij niet behouden worden.
[15:2] Toen nu Paulus en Barnabas in geen kleinen strijd en twist met hen geraakt waren, besloten de broederen dat Paulus en Barnabas, en eenige anderen uit hen, zouden opgaan naar Jerusalem, tot de Apostelen en oudsten, wegens deze twistvraag. 
[15:3]  Zij dan, door de gemeente uitgeleid zijnde, trokken door Fenicië en Samaria, verhalende de bekeering der heidenen, en deden al den broederen groote blijdschap aan.
[15:4] En te Jerusalem gekomen zijnde, werden zij ontvangen door de gemeente, en de Apostelen, en de oudsten, en zij verhaalden al wat God met hen gedaan had.
[15:5] Maar sommigen van de sekte der fariseërs, die geloofd hadden, stonden op en zeiden: Men moet hen besnijden en gebieden de wet van Mozes te onderhouden! 
[15:6]  De Apostelen nu en de oudsten vergaderden om deze zaak te overwegen.
[15:7] En toen er veel twist ontstaan was stond Petrus op en zeide tot hen: Mannen broeders, gij weet dat God lang geleden onder u mij verkozen heeft, om door mijn mond de heidenen het woord des Evangelies te doen hooren en gelooven.
[15:8] En God, de hartenkenner, heeft hun getuigenis geschonken, hun gevende den Heiligen Geest, gelijk aan ons;
[15:9] en Hij heeft geen onderscheid gemaakt tusschen ons en hen, daar Hij door het geloof hun harten heeft gezuiverd.
[15:10] Nu dan, wat verzoekt gij God, dat gij een juk zoudt leggen op den schouder der discipelen, dat noch onze vaderen noch wij hebben kunnen dragen?
[15:11] Maar door de genade van den Heere Jezus gelooven wij te zullen behouden worden op dezelfde wijze als zij.
[15:12] En de geheele menigte zweeg stil en hoorde Barnabas en Paulus verhalen wat al teekenen en mirakelen God door hen gedaan had onder de heidenen.
[15:13] En nadat dezen zwegen, antwoordde Jakobus en zeide: Mannen broeders, hoort mij!
[15:14] Simeon heeft verhaald hoe God het eerst heeft nedergezien, om uit de heidenen een volk te nemen voor zijn Naam.
[15:15] En hiermede komen de woorden der profeten over een, zooals geschreven is:
[15:16] Na dezen zal Ik wederkeeren en de hut van David, die vervallen is, weder opbouwen, en wat daarvan verwoest is zal Ik weder opbouwen en Ik zal haar weder oprichten,
[15:17] opdat de overige menschen den Heere zoeken, en al de heidenen over welken mijn Naam is aangeroepen, zegt de Heere, die deze dingen doet,
[15:18] die bekend zijn van eeuwigheid.
[15:19] Daarom ben ik van oordeel, dat men geen moeite moet aandoen aan diegenen van de heidenen die zich tot God bekeeren;
[15:20] maar dat men hun moet schrijven dat zij zich moeten onthouden van hetgeen door de afgoden is verontreinigd, en van de hoererij, en van hetgeen gestikt is, en van bloed.
[15:21] Want Mozes heeft er van oude tijden af in elke stad die hem prediken, daar hij in de synagogen op iederen sabbat voorgelezen wordt.
[15:22] Toen dacht het den Apostelen en den oudsten met de geheele gemeente goed, om mannen, uit hun midden gekozen, naar Antiochië te zenden met Paulus en Barnabas, namelijk Judas, bijgenaamd Barsabbas, en Silas; mannen die voorgangers waren onder de broederen.
[15:23] En zij schreven door hun hand: De Apostelen en de oudste broeders wenschen den broederen uit de heidenen in Antiochië, en Syrië, en Cilicië, geluk!
[15:24] Alzoo wij gehoord hebben dat sommigen uit ons gekomen zijnde, u door woorden ontroerd en uw zielen verslagen hebben, aan wie wij dit niet bevolen hadden,
[15:25] zoo heeft het ons, eendrachtig samen zijnde, goed gedacht eenige daartoe verkozen mannen tot u te zenden, met onze geliefden, Barnabas en Paulus,
[15:26] mannen die hun zielen hebben overgegeven voor den Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[15:27] Wij hebben dan Judas en Silas gezonden, die ook zelven u mondeling hetzelfde zullen zeggen.
[15:28] Want het heeft den Heiligen Geest en ons goedgedacht, geen meerderen last ulieden op te leggen dan dit noodzakelijke:
[15:29] Dat gij u onthoudt van hetgeen den afgoden is geofferd, en van bloed, en van hetgeen gestikt is, en van hoererij. Als gij u van deze dingen wacht, zult gij goed doen. Vaartwel! 
[15:30]  Zij kregen dan hun afscheid en kwamen te Antiochië; en de menigte vergaderd hebbende, gaven zij den brief over.
[15:31] En toen zij dien gelezen hadden, verheugden zij zich over de vermaning.
[15:32] Judas nu, zoowel als Silas, die ook zelven profeten waren, vermaanden en versterkten de broeders door veel woorden.
[15:33] En nadat zij daar eenigen tijd geweest waren, lieten de broeders hen met vrede gaan tot die hen afgezonden hadden.
[15:34] Maar Silas wilde liever aldaar blijven.
[15:35] Paulus nu en Barnabas bleven in Antiochië, leerende en verkondigende met veel anderen het woord des Heeren. 
[15:36]  Na sommige dagen nu zeide Paulus tot Barnabas: Laat ons nu terugkeeren en in elke stad, waar wij het woord des Heeren verkondigd hebben, de broeders bezoeken, om te zien hoe het hun gaat.
[15:37] En Barnabas wilde ook Johannes, bijgenaamd Markus, medenemen.
[15:38] Maar Paulus achtte het billijk om hem, die van Pamfylië van hen afgeweken, en niet met hen tot het werk was gegaan, niet mede te nemen.
[15:39] Er ontstond dan een verbittering, zoodat zij van malkander scheidden, en dat Barnabas Markus medenam en naar Cyprus voer.
[15:40] Maar Paulus verkoos Silas en vertrok, door de broederen aan de genade des Heeren bevolen zijnde.
[15:41] En hij trok door Syrië en Cilicië en versterkte de gemeenten.  
[16:1] En Paulus kwam te Derbe en te Lystre. En ziet, daar was een zeker discipel met name Timotheüs, de zoon van een geloovige joodsche vrouw, doch van een griekschen vader.
[16:2] Van dezen gaven de broeders in Lystre en Ikonium een goed getuigenis.
[16:3] Paulus nu wilde dat deze met hem zou vertrekken; en hij nam en besneed hem ter wille van de Joden die in die plaatsen waren; want allen wisten dat zijn vader een Griek was. 
[16:4]  Toen zij nu de steden doortrokken, gaven zij hun; de verordeningen over ter onderhouding, die van de Apostelen en oudsten in Jerusalem vastgesteld waren,
[16:5] De gemeenten dan werden versterkt in het geloof en vermeerderden dagelijks in getal.
[16:6] En nadat zij Frygië en het land van Galatië waren doorgetrokken, werden zij door den Heiligen Geest verhinderd om het woord in Asië te spreken.
[16:7] En zij kwamen bij Mysië en zochten naar Bithynië te gaan, en ook dit liet hun de Geest van Jezus, niet toe.
[16:8] En langs Mysië gegaan zijnde, kwamen zij af naar Troas. 
[16:9]  En aan Paulus verscheen des nachts een visioen: Een zeker Macedonisch man stond, en vroeg hem dringend, zeggende: Kom over naar Macedonië en help ons!
[16:10] Toen hij nu dit visioen had gezien, zochten wij terstond naar Macedonië te vertrekken, daaruit besluitende dat God ons geroepen had om hun het Evangelie te verkondigen. 
[16:11]  Van Troas dan afgevaren zijnde, liepen wij rechtuit naar Samothrace, en den volgenden dag naar Neapolis;
[16:12] en vandaar naar Filippi, dat de eerste stad is van dat deel van Macedonië, een kolonie.
[16:13] Wij bleven nu in die stad eenige dagen. En op den sabbatdag gingen wij buiten de poort, bij de rivier, waar wij meenden dat een bidplaats was. En nedergezeten zijnde, spraken wij tot de samengekomen vrouwen.
[16:14] En zekere vrouw, met name Lydia, een purperverkoopster van de stad Thyatire, die God vreesde, hoorde toe; en de Heere opende haar hart om acht te nemen op hetgeen door Paulus gesproken werd.
[16:15] Toen zij nu gedoopt was met haar huisgezin vroeg zij dringend, zeggende: Indien gij mij geoordeeld hebt den Heere getrouw te zijn, komt dan naar mijn huis en verblijft daar. En zij dwong ons.
[16:16] Het geschiedde nu, toen wij naar de bidplaats gingen, dat een zeker meisken, met een waarzeggenden geest, ons ontmoette, dat veel gewin aan haar meesters aanbracht door haar waarzeggen.
[16:17] Deze liep Paulus en ons achterna en riep, zeggende: Deze menschen zijn dienaars van den allerhoogsten God, die ons den weg der behoudenis verkondigen!
[16:18] Dit deed zij nu veel dagen lang; maar Paulus, daarover geërgerd zijnde, keerde zich om en zeide tot den geest: Ik beveel u in den Naam van Jezus Christus van haar uit te gaan! — En hij ging uit terzelfder ure.
[16:19] Toen nu haar meesters zagen dat hun hoop op winst weg was, grepen zij Paulus en Silas en sleepten hen naar de markt voor de oversten.
[16:20] En zij brachten hen tot de hoofdmannen en zeiden: Deze menschen, die Joden zijn, brengen onze stad in beroering,
[16:21] en zij verkondigen gebruiken die wij, Romeinen zijnde, niet mogen aannemen of navolgen!
[16:22] En de schare stond mede tegen hen op, en de hoofdmannen scheurden hun de kleederen af en geboden om hen met den stok te slaan.
[16:23] En toen zij hun veel slagen gegeven hadden, wierpen zij hen in de gevangenis en geboden den gevangenbewaarder hen gestreng te bewaren.
[16:24] Deze nu, zulk een gebod ontvangen hebbende, wierp hen in de binnenste gevangenis en sloot hun voeten in den blok. 
[16:25]  Tegen middernacht nu baden en zongen Paulus en Silas Gode lofzangen en de gevangenen luisterden naar hen.
[16:26] En plotseling geschiedde er een groote aardbeving, zoodat de fundamenten der gevangenis schudden, en al de deuren gingen terstond open, en aller boeien werden los.
[16:27] De gevangenbewaarder nu, wakker geworden zijnde, en de deuren der gevangenis open ziende, trok het zwaard en wilde zich zelven ombrengen, meenende dat de gevangenen ontvlucht waren.
[16:28] Maar met een luide stem riep Paulus, zeggende: Doe u zelven niets kwaads, want wij zijn allen hier!
[16:29] En toen hij licht gevraagd had sprong hij naar binnen, en bevende viel hij Paulus en Silas te voet.
[16:30] En hen buiten gebracht hebbende, zeide hij: Heeren! wat moet ik doen, opdat ik behouden worde?
[16:31] En zij zeiden: Geloof in den Heere Jezus Christus, en gij zult behouden worden, gij en uw huisgezin!
[16:32] En zij spraken het woord des Heeren tot hem en tot allen die in zijn huis waren.
[16:33] En in dezelfde ure van den nacht nam hij hen mede en wiesch hen van de striemen, en hij zelf werd terstond gedoopt en al de zijnen.
[16:34] En hij bracht hen in zijn huis en zette hun spijze voor en verheugde zich dat hij met zijn geheele huisgezin aan God geloovig was geworden.
[16:35] Toen het nu dag was geworden, zonden de hoofdmannen de stadsdienaars, zeggende: Laat die menschen los!
[16:36] De gevangenbewaarder dan boodschapte deze woorden aan Paulus: De hoofdmannen hebben gezonden om u los te laten; nu dan, gaat uit en vertrekt in vrede!
[16:37] Maar Paulus zeide tot hen: Ons die Romeinen zijn, hebben zij onveroordeeld in het openbaar gegeeseld en in de gevangenis geworpen! En nu zouden zij ons er in het geheim uitwerpen? — Neen, zóó niet! maar laat hen zelf komen en ons uitleiden!
[16:38] En de stadsdienaars boodschapten aan de hoofdmannen deze woorden. En zij werden bevreesd toen zij hoorden dat zij Romeinen waren.
[16:39] En zij kwamen en spraken hen toe; en hen uitgeleid hebbende, verzochten zij hen uit de stad te gaan.
[16:40] En uit de gevangenis gegaan zijnde, gingen zij naar Lydia; en toen zij de broeders gezien hadden, vermaanden zij hen en gingen weg.  
[17:1] En door Amfipolis en Apollonia gegaan zijnde, kwamen Paulus en Silas te Thessalonika, waar een synagoge der Joden was.
[17:2] En Paulus ging, volgens zijn gewoonte tot hen, en gedurende drie sabbatdagen handelde hij met hen over de Schrifturen,
[17:3] die verklarende en aanwijzende dat de Christus móest lijden en uit de dooden verrijzen en dat deze Jezus de Christus is, dien ik zeide hij ulieden verkondig.
[17:4] En sommigen van hen werden overtuigd en voegden zich bij Paulus en Silas; en van de godvruchtige Grieken een groote menigte, en niet weinigen van de aanzienlijke vrouwen.
[17:5] Maar de Joden werden nijdig en namen eenige booswichten uit het gemeene volk, en verwekten een volksopschudding en brachten de stad in roeren; en zij vielen aan op het huis van Jason en zochten de Apostelen tot het volk te brengen.
[17:6] Maar zij vonden hen niet en sleepten Jason en eenige broeders voor de oversten der stad, al schreeuwende: Dezen, die de geheele wereld in opstand hebben gebracht, zijn ook hier gekomen,
[17:7] en Jason heeft ze in zijn huis genomen! en deze allen handelen tegen de geboden van den keizer, zeggende dat er een andere koning is, een zekere Jezus!
[17:8] En zij stookten de menigte op en ook de oversten der stad die dit hoorden.
[17:9] Maar toen zij van Jason en de anderen voldoening hadden ontvangen, lieten zij hen gaan. 
[17:10]  De broeders nu zonden terstond des nachts Paulus en Silas naar Berea, die, toen zij daar gekomen waren, naar de synagoge der Joden gingen.
[17:11] Dezen nu waren edeler dan die in Thessalonika, daar zij het woord ontvingen met alle toegenegenheid, en dagelijks de Schrifturen onderzochten of deze dingen alzoo waren.
[17:12] Velen nu uit hen geloofden, ook van de aanzienlijke grieksche vrouwen, en van de mannen niet weinigen.
[17:13] Toen nu de Joden van Thessalonika vernomen hadden dat het woord Gods, door Paulus ook in Berea; werd verkondigd, kwame zij ook daar de scharen beroeren en opstoken.
[17:14] Doch terstond zonden de broeders toen Paulus weg om naar de zeekust te gaan. Maar Silas en Timotheüs bleven aldaar. 
[17:15]  Zij nu die Paulus uitgeleide deden, brachten hem naar Athene. En zij gingen terug, nadat zij bevel hadden gekregen voor Silas en Timotheüs dat zij zoo spoedig mogelijk tot hem zouden komen.
[17:16] Terwijl nu Paulus hen te Athene verwachtte, werd zijn geest in hem ontstoken, daar hij zag dat de stad zoo vol afgoderij was.
[17:17] Hij redetwistte dan in de synagoge met de Joden en met de godsdienstige heidenen, en alle dagen op de markt met degenen die hij daar aantrof.
[17:18] Sommigen nu van de Epikureïsche en Stoïcijnsche wijsgeeren twistten met hem en sommigen zeiden: Wat wil die klapper toch zeggen– En anderen zeiden: Hij schijnt een verkondiger van vreemde goden te zijn! omdat hij Jezus en de verrijzenis predikte.
[17:19] Zij namen hem dan en brachten hem op den Areopagus, zeggende: Kunnen wij ook weten welke de nieuwe leer is waarvan gij spreekt?
[17:20] want gij brengt eenige vreemde dingen tot onze ooren; wij willen dan weten wat dat toch mag zijn!
[17:21] Al de Atheners toch en de vreemdelingen die zich onder hen onthielden, besteedden hun tijd met niets anders dan met nieuwtjes te vertellen en te hooren.
[17:22] Paulus dan, midden op den Areopagus staande, zeide: Gij Atheensche mannen! ik zie dat gij in allen deele als overgodsdienstig zijt;
[17:23] want als ik rondging en uw heiligdommen beschouwde, vond ik ook een altaar waarop geschreven stond: Den onbekenden God. — Hem dan dien gij dient, zonder Hem te kennen, dien verkondig ik ulieden!
[17:24] De God die de wereld gemaakt heeft en al wat daarin is, deze, omdat Hij Heer is van hemel en aarde, woont niet in tempelen die met handen zijn gemaakt,
[17:25] en wordt ook niet van menschenhanden gediend alsof Hij iets van noode had; want Hij zelf geeft aan allen leven en adem en alle dingen;
[17:26] ook heeft Hij uit éénen bloede het geheele geslacht der menschen gemaakt, om te wonen op het geheele aardrijk, hun vaste tijden en de grenzen hunner woning bepaald hebbende,
[17:27] om God te zoeken, of ze Hem mochten gevoelen en vinden, alhoewel Hij niet verre is van een ieder onzer;
[17:28] in Hem toch leven wij, en bewegen wij ons, en bestaan wij, zooals ook sommigen van uw eigen dichters gezegd hebben: Want wij zijn ook zijn geslacht.
[17:29] Daar wij dan Gods geslacht zijn, moeten wij niet meenen dat het goddelijk Wezen gelijk is aan goud, of zilver, of steen, naar de kunst gesneden, en naar menschelijk vernuft!
[17:30] De tijden der onwetendheid dan overzien hebbende, verkondigt God nu aan alle menschen alom, tot berouw te komen,
[17:31] omdat Hij een dag heeft gesteld waarop Hij de bewoonde aarde in rechtvaardigheid zal oordeelen, door een man dien Hij daartoe geschikt heeft; waarvan Hij zekerheid gegeven heeft aan allen, door Hem op te wekken uit de dooden!
[17:32] Toen zij nu hoorden van de verrijzenis der dooden, lachten sommigen; maar anderen zeiden: Wij zullen u daarover nog een keer hooren!
[17:33] Zoo ging Paulus uit hun midden weg.
[17:34] Doch eenige mannen voegden zich bij hem en geloofden; waaronder ook Dionysius de Areopagiet, en een vrouw genaamd Damaris, en anderen met hen.  
[18:1] Na deze dingen vertrok Paulus van Athene en ging naar Korinthe.
[18:2] En hij vond een zekeren Jood, met name Aquila, geboortig van Pontus, die kort geleden uit Italië was gekomen, met Priscilla zijn vrouw, omdat Klaudius had geboden dat al de Joden uit Rome zouden vertrekken.
[18:3] En hij kwam bij hen, en omdat hij van hetzelfde beroep was, bleef hij bij hen en arbeidde, want zij waren tentenmakers van beroep. 
[18:4]  Op iederen sabbat nu redetwistte hij in de synagoge en hij overtuigde Joden en Grieken.
[18:5] Nadat nu Silas en Timotheüs van Macedonië afgekomen waren, sprak Paulus te vuriger, den Joden bewijzende dat Jezus is de Christus.
[18:6] Doch toen zij tegenstonden en lasterden, schudde hij zijn kleederen af en zeide tot hen: Uw bloed zij op uw hoofd! ik ben rein! van nu af zal ik tot de heidenen gaan!
[18:7] En vandaar ging hij weg en kwam in het huis van iemand met name Titus Justus, die godvruchtig was, wiens huis naast de synagoge stond.
[18:8] Krispus nu, de overste der synagoge, geloofde in; den Heere met geheel zijn huisgezin, en velen van de Korinthiërs hoorden, en geloofden, en werden gedoopt.
[18:9] En de Heere zeide des nachts in een visioen tot Paulus: Vrees niet, maar spreek en zwijg niet,
[18:10] Want Ik ben met u en niemand zal u grijpen om u kwaad te doen, want Ik heb veel volk in deze stad.
[18:11] Hij bleef dan een jaar en zes maanden, leerende onder hen het woord Gods. 
[18:12]  Maar toen Gallio stadhouder van Achaje was, stonden de Joden eenparig tegen Paulus op en brachten hem voor den rechterstoel,
[18:13] zeggende: Deze raadt den menschen aan om God te dienen tegen de wet!
[18:14] Toen nu Paulus zijn mond zou opendoen, zeide Gallio tot de Joden: Indien er eenige onrechtvaardigheid of schelmstuk gepleegd was, o Joden! dan zou ik met reden u aanhooren;
[18:15] maar als het een verschil is over een woord, en over namen, en over uw eigen wet, dan moet gij zelven daarin voorzien; daarover wil ik geen rechter zijn!
[18:16] En hij dreef hen weg van den rechterstoel.
[18:17] Doch zij allen grepen Sosthenes, den overste der synagoge, en sloegen hem voor den rechterstoel; en Gallio trok zich niets daarvan aan. 
[18:18]  Als nu Paulus nog vele dagen daar gebleven was, nam hij afscheid van de broeders en ging scheep naar Syrië, en met hem Aquila en Priscilla, nadat hij zich te Kenchrea het hoofd geschoren had, want hij stond onder een gelofte.
[18:19] Zij kwamen nu te Efesus en daar liet hij hen achter; maar hij zelf ging naar de synagoge om met de Joden te redetwisten.
[18:20] En toen dezen hem vroegen om nog langer te blijven, bewilligde hij niet,
[18:21] maar hij nam afscheid en zeide: Ik zal tot u terugkomen, als het God belieft. En hij voer af van Efesus;
[18:22] en te Cesarea gekomen zijnde trok hij op, en de gemeente gegroet hebbende kwam hij af naar Antiochië. 
[18:23]  En nadat hij daar eenigen tijd had doorgebracht ging hij heen en doorreisde het land van Galatië en Frygië, versterkende al de discipelen. 
[18:24]  Een zekere Jood nu, met name Apollos, geboortig van Alexandrië, een welsprekend man, kwam naar Efesus; en hij was machtig in de Schrifturen.
[18:25] Deze was onderwezen in den weg des Heeren, en vurig van geest zijnde, sprak en onderwees hij nauwkeurig de dingen aangaande Jezus; doch hij kende alleen den doop van Johannes.
[18:26] En deze begon vrijmoedig te spreken in de synagoge. Maar toen Priscilla en Aquila hem gehoord hadden, namen zij hem mede en leiden hem den weg Gods nauwkeuriger uit.
[18:27] Toen hij nu naar Achaje wilde gaan, moedigden de broeders hem aan, en schreven aan de discipelen dat zij hem zouden ontvangen. En daar gekomen zijnde, was hij zeer nuttig voor hen die geloofd hadden door de genade.
[18:28] Want met kracht overtuigde hij de Joden in het openbaar, bewijzende door de Schrifturen dat Jezus is de Christus.  
[19:1] Het geschiedde nu, terwijl Apollos te Korinthe was, dat Paulus, de bovenlanden doorreisd hebbende, naar Efesus kwam.
[19:2] En eenige discipelen vindende, zeide hij tot hen: Hebt gij den Heiligen Geest ontvangen toen gij geloofd hebt? — Doch zij zeiden tot hem: Maar wij hebben zelfs niet gehoord dat er een Heilige Geest is!
[19:3] En hij zeide: Waartoe zijt gij dan gedoopt? — En zij zeiden: Tot den doop van Johannes.
[19:4] En Paulus zeide: Johannes doopte den doop der boetvaardigheid, tot het volk zeggende dat zij moesten gelooven in dengene die na hem kwam, dat is, in Jezus.
[19:5] En nadat zij hem gehoord hadden, werden zij gedoopt in den Naam van den Heere Jezus.
[19:6] En toen Paulus hun de handen opgelegd had, kwam de Heilige Geest op hen, en zij spraken met tongen en profeteerden.
[19:7] Deze allen nu waren omtrent twaalf mannen.
[19:8] En hij ging in de synagoge en sprak met vrijmoedigheid drie maanden lang, hen onderwijzende en overtuigende aangaande de dingen van het Koninkrijk Gods.
[19:9] Maar toen sommigen zich verhardden en ongehoorzaam waren, kwaadsprekende van den weg des Heeren voor de schare, week hij van hen, en zonderde de discipelen af, en onderwees dagelijks in de school van een zekeren Tyrannus.
[19:10] En dit geschiedde twee jaar lang, zoodat allen die Asië bewoonden, het woord des Heeren hoorden, zoowel Joden als Grieken. 
[19:11]  En God deed buitengewone krachten door de handen van Paulus,
[19:12] zoodat zelfs doeken of gordels van zijn lichaam op de kranken gelegd werden; en de ziekten weken van hen en de booze geesten voeren uit.
[19:13] Eenigen nu van de rondtrekkende joodsche bezweerders durfden den Naam van den Heere Jezus noemen over degenen die booze geesten hadden, zeggende: Ik bezweer u bij Jezus, dien Paulus predikt!
[19:14] Zij dan die dit deden, waren zeven zonen van zekeren Sceva, een joodschen overpriester.
[19:15] Maar de booze geest antwoordde en zeide tot hen: Jezus ken ik, en van Paulus weet ik; maar gij, wie zijt gij?
[19:16] En de mensch, in wien de booze geest was, viel hun op het lijf, en werd twee van hen meester en overweldigde hen, zoodat zij naakt en gewond uit het huis vluchtten.
[19:17] En dit werd bekend aan alle Joden en Grieken die Efesus bewoonden; en er viel een vreeze over hen allen, en de Naam van den Heere Jezus werd groot gemaakt.
[19:18] En velen dergenen die geloofd hadden, kwamen hun daden belijden en verhalen;
[19:19] en velen van degenen die met tooverkunsten hadden omgegaan, brachten hun boeken bijeen en verbrandden die in aller tegenwoordigheid; en de waarde daarvan berekend zijnde, bevonden zij die vijftig duizend zilverstukken.
[19:20] Alzoo vermeerderde het woord des Heeren met kracht, en het kreeg de overhand. 
[19:21]  Toen dit nu geschied was, nam Paulus in den geest het plan om door Macedonië en Achaje naar Jerusalem te gaan, en zeide: Nadat ik daar geweest ben moet ik ook Rome zien.
[19:22] En hij zond twee dergenen die hem dienden, Timotheüs en Erastus, naar Macedonië; maar hij zelf bleef nog een tijd in Asië.
[19:23] Omtrent dien tijd nu ontstond er geen klein oproer ter oorzake van den weg des Heeren.
[19:24] Want iemand, met name Demetrius, een zilversmid, die zilveren tempelkens van Diana maakte, en dus niet weinig winst bracht aan degenen die van dat beroep waren,
[19:25] riep hen samen en ook de anderen, die in soortgelijke dingen werkten, en zeide: Mannen! gij weet dat wij uit dit werk onze welvaart hebben,
[19:26] en gij ziet en hoort dat die Paulus niet alleen te Efesus, maar in bijna geheel Asië een groote menigte volks overreedt en afvallig maakt, zeggende dat het geen goden zijn die met handen gemaakt worden;
[19:27] en niet alleen loopt ons beroep gevaar van in verachting te komen, maar ook zal de tempel van de groote godin Diana voor niets gerekend worden, en haar majesteit zal te niet gaan, die geheel Asië en de gansche bewoonde aarde vereert!
[19:28] Toen zij nu dit hoorden, werden zij vol van toorn en riepen: Groot is de Diana der Efesiërs!
[19:29] En de stad werd vol verwarring en zij liepen eenparig naar de schouwplaats, en sleepten Gajus en Aristarchus met zich, Macedoniërs die met Paulus gekomen waren.
[19:30] En Paulus wilde zich onder het volk begeven, maar de discipelen lieten het hem niet toe.
[19:31] En sommigen der oversten van Asië, die zijn vrienden waren, zonden tot hem en vroegen hem dringend dat hij zich toch niet naar de schouwplaats zou begeven.
[19:32] De een nu riep dit en de ander dat, want de vergadering was verward, en de meesten wisten niet waarom zij samengekomen waren.
[19:33] Ook werd een zekere Alexander uit de schare naar voren gedrongen, daar de Joden hem voortstieten. En Alexander gaf met de hand een teeken en wilde zich bij het volk verantwoorden.
[19:34] Maar toen zij bemerkten dat hij een Jood was ging er één stem op van allen, omtrent twee uren lang, roepende: Groot is de Diana der Efesiërs!
[19:35] En als de stadsschrijver de schare gestild had, zeide hij: Mannen van Efesus! welk mensch is er toch, die niet weet dat de stad der Efesiërs de tempelbewaarster is van de groote Diana, en van het beeld dat uit den hemel gevallen is?
[19:36] Daar dit dan ontegenzeggelijk is, zoo behoordet gij u stil te houden en niets lichtvaardig te doen.
[19:37] Want gij hebt deze mannen hier gebracht die geen tempelroovers zijn, noch onze godin lasteren.
[19:38] Als dan nu Demetrius, en de kunstenaars die met hem zijn, tegen iemand een klacht hebben, er worden rechtsdagen gehouden en er zijn stadhouders; laat hen malkander aanklagen!
[19:39] En als gij iets verlangt omtrent andere dingen, dat zal beslist worden in een wettige vergadering!
[19:40] Want wij loopen ook gevaar over het oproer van heden aangeklaagd te worden, daar er geen grond is waarop wij rekenschap zullen kunnen geven van deze samenspanning. En dit gezegd hebbende, deed hij de vergadering uiteen gaan.
[19:41]  
[20:1] Nadat nu het oproer gestild was, riep Paulus de discipelen tot zich en vermaande hen, en hen gegroet hebbende ging hij op reis naar Macedonië.
[20:2] En die landstreken doorreisd en hen met veel woorden vermaand hebbende, kwam hij naar Griekenland.
[20:3] En als hij daar drie maanden doorgebracht had, werd er door de Joden een komplot tegen hem gesmeed, toen hij naar Syrië wilde overvaren, zoodat hij besloot door Macedonië terug te keeren.
[20:4] En met hem gingen Sopater, de zoon van Pyrrus van Berea; en van de Thessalonikers: Aristarchus en Sekundus; en Gajus van Derbe; en Timotheüs; en van Asië: Tychikus en Trofimus.
[20:5] Dezen nu waren vooruitgegaan en wachtten ons te Troas.
[20:6] Wij voeren dan af van Filippi na de dagen der ongedeesemde brooden, en kwamen in vijf dagen bij hen te Troas, waar wij zeven dagen bleven. 
[20:7]  Toen wij nu op den eersten dag der week vergaderd waren om brood te breken, sprak Paulus tot hen, die des anderen daags vertrekken zou; en hij rekte zijn sermoen tot den middernacht.
[20:8] En er waren veel lampen in de bovenzaal waar wij vergaderd waren.
[20:9] En een zeker jongeling, met name Eutyches, die in het venster zat, viel in een diepen slaap, daar Paulus lang sprak; en door den slaap stortte hij neder en viel van de derde zoldering naar beneden; en werd dood opgenomen.
[20:10] Maar Paulus ging naar beneden en wierp zich op hem, en omhelsde hem, en zeide: Vreest niet, want zijn leven is in hem.
[20:11] En hij ging naar boven en brak het brood en at; en hij sprak lang tot hen, tot den dageraad toe, en alzoo vertrok hij.
[20:12] En zij brachten den jongen levend binnen, en waren niet weinig vertroost. 
[20:13]  Wij nu gingen vooruit naar het schip en voeren af naar Assus, waar wij Paulus zouden opnemen; zoo toch had hij het beschikt, daar hij zelf te voet wilde gaan.
[20:14] Toen hij nu te Assus zich bij ons gevoegd had, namen wij hem op en kwamen naar Mitylene;
[20:15] en vandaar afgevaren zijnde, kwamen wij den volgenden dag tegenover Chios, en des anderen daags staken wij over naar Samos, en den volgenden dag kwamen wij naar Milete.
[20:16] Want Paulus had besloten om Efesus voorbij te varen, om zijn tijd niet in Asië door te brengen, want hij spoedde zich om, als het hem mogelijk was, den Pinksterdag te Jerusalem te zijn.
[20:17] Van Milete nu zond hij naar Efesus en ontbood de oudsten der gemeente.
[20:18] En toen dezen bij hem gekomen waren, zeide hij tot hen: Gijlieden weet hoe ik van den eersten dag af dat ik in Asië ben gekomen, al den tijd met u geweest ben,
[20:19] dienende den Heere met alle nederigheid, en met tranen, en onder beproevingen die mij overkomen zijn door de aanslagen der Joden;
[20:20] hoe ik niets heb nagelaten van al hetgeen nuttig was, dat ik het u niet verkondigde en leerde, in het openbaar en bij de huizen;
[20:21] verkondigende, zoowel aan Joden als aan Grieken, de bekeering tot God en het geloof in onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[20:22] En nu, ziet, gebonden in den geest, ga ik naar Jerusalem, niet wetende wat mij daar zal overkomen;
[20:23] behalve dat de Heilige Geest mij van stad tot stad betuigt, zeggende dat banden en verdrukkingen mij verwachten;
[20:24] doch ik acht mijn leven niet kostelijk voor mij zelven, als ik maar mijn loop mag volbrengen, en de bediening die ik van den Heere Jezus heb ontvangen, om het Evangelie van Gods genade te verkondigen.
[20:25] En nu, ziet, ik weet dat, gij mijn aangezicht niet meer zult zien, gij allen, onder wie ik rondgaande het Koninkrijk Gods heb gepredikt.
[20:26] Daarom betuig ik u den dag van heden, dat ik rein ben van het bloed van allen
[20:27] want ik heb niet nagelaten ulieden den geheelen raad Gods te verkondigen.
[20:28] Let dan wel op u zelven, en op de geheele kudde, waarin de Heilige Geest u heeft gesteld tot opzieners, om de gemeente des Heeren te weiden, die Hij verkregen heeft door zijn eigen bloed.
[20:29] Ik weet toch dat er, na mijn vertrek, grijpende wolven tot u zullen komen, die de kudde niet sparen zullen;
[20:30] en uit uw eigen midden zullen mannen opstaan die verkeerde dingen spreken, om de discipelen achter zich af te trekken.
[20:31] Daarom waakt! en gedenkt dat ik drie jaar lang, nacht en dag, niet opgehouden heb een ieder met tranen te vermanen.
[20:32] En nu, ik beveel u aan God en aan het woord zijner genade, aan Hem die machtig is op te bouwen en het erfdeel onder al de geheiligden te geven.
[20:33] Niemands zilver, of goud, of kleeding heb ik begeerd.
[20:34] Gij zelven weet dat deze handen hebben gezorgd voor hetgeen ik noodig had en degenen die met mij zijn;
[20:35] in alles heb ik u het voorbeeld gegeven hoe men, aldus arbeidende, de zwakken moet ondersteunen, en gedenken aan de woorden van den Heere Jezus, hoe Hij zelf zeide: Zaliger is het te geven dan te ontvangen.
[20:36] En toen Paulus dit gezegd had, knielde hij neder en bad met hen allen.
[20:37] En zij weenden allen zeer, en vielen Paulus om den hals en kusten hem,
[20:38] allermeest bedroefd zijnde om het woord dat hij gezegd had, dat zij zijn aangezicht niet meer zouden zien. En zij vergezelden hem naar het schip.  
[21:1] Het geschiedde nu, toen wij ons van hen losgerukt hadden en afgevaren waren, dat wij rechtuit liepen en aan Kos kwamen, en den volgenden dag aan Rhodus, en vandaar aan Patara,
[21:2] En wij vonden een schip dat naar Fenicië overvoer en gingen aanboord en voeren af.
[21:3] Toen wij nu in het gezicht van Cyprus waren gekomen en dit links hadden laten liggen, voeren wij naar Syrië, en liepen binnen te Tyrus, want daar moest het schip zijn lading lossen.
[21:4] En wij vonden de discipelen en bleven daar zeven dagen. En dezen zeiden door den Geest tot Paulus dat hij niet naar Jerusalem moest opgaan.
[21:5] Toen wij nu die dagen hadden doorgebracht, vertrokken wij en gingen voort, terwijl allen met vrouwen en kinderen ons vergezelden tot buiten de stad; en nadat wij op den oever geknield en gebeden hadden,
[21:6] groetten wij malkander, en wij gingen scheep, maar zij keerden terug naar huis. 
[21:7]  Wij nu, de vaart van Tyrus volbracht hebbende, kwamen aan te Ptolemais, en de broeders groetende, bleven wij één dag bij hen.
[21:8] En den volgenden dag vertrokken wij en kwamen te Cesarea; en wij gingen in het huis van Filippus den evangelist, die één was van de zeven en bleven bij hem.
[21:9] Deze nu had vier dochters, die maagden waren en profeteerden.
[21:10] Terwijl wij daar nu verscheiden dagen bleven, kwam er een zekere profeet van Judea, met name Agabus;
[21:11] en hij kwam tot ons en greep den gordelriem van Paulus, en zich zelven de handen en voeten bindende, zeide hij: Dit zegt de Heilige Geest: Den man van wien deze gordelriem is, zullen de Joden in Jerusalem alzoo binden, en zij zullen hem overleveren in de handen der heidenen.
[21:12] Toen wij nu dit hoorden, vroegen, zoowel wij als zij die daar woonden, dringend dat hij toch niet zou opgaan naar Jerusalem.
[21:13] Toen antwoordde Paulus en zeide: Wat doet gij, met zoo te weenen en mijn hart week te maken? want ik ben gereed niet alleen om gebonden te worden, maar zelfs om te Jerusalem te sterven voor den Naam van den Heere Jezus.
[21:14] En daar hij zich niet liet afraden, berustten wij er in, zeggende: Des Heeren wille geschiede! 
[21:15]  Na die dagen nu maakten wij ons reisvaardig en gingen op naar Jerusalem.
[21:16] En er gingen ook eenigen der discipelen van Cesarea met ons mede, die zekeren Mnason van Cyprus medebrachten, een ouden discipel, bij wien wij zouden verblijven.
[21:17] Toen wij nu te Jerusalem gekomen waren, ontvingen de broeders ons met vreugde.
[21:18] En den volgenden dag ging Paulus met ons naar Jakobus; en al de oudsten waren daar gekomen.
[21:19] En als hij hen gegroet had, verhaalde hij van stuk tot stuk wat God door zijn bediening onder de heidenen had gedaan.
[21:20] En toen zij dit gehoord hadden, loofden zij God, en zeiden tot Paulus: Gij ziet, broeder! hoeveel tienduizenden onder de Joden er zijn die geloovig zijn geworden, en zij zijn allen ijveraars voor de wet.
[21:21] Nu is hun aangaande u verteld dat gij al de Joden, die onder de heidenen zijn, leert van Mozes af te vallen, zeggende dat zij hun kinderen niet moeten besnijden, noch, leven naar de gewoonten.
[21:22] Wat dan nu? Zonder twijfel zal het volk bijeenkomen, want zij zullen hooren dat gij gekomen zijt.
[21:23] Doe dan wat wij u zeggen: Er zijn vier mannen onder ons die onder een gelofte staan;
[21:24] neem die mede en zonder u af met hen, en draag voor hen de onkosten, opdat zij hun hoofd mogen scheren; en dan zullen allen weten dat er niets aan is van hetgeen hun aangaande u verteld is, maar dat gij ook zelf voortgaat met de wet te onderhouden.
[21:25] Wat nu de heidenen aangaat, die geloofd hebben, wij hebben ons oordeel geschreven, dat zij zich wachten moeten van hetgeen den afgoden is geofferd, en van bloed, en van het gestikte, en van hoererij.
[21:26] Toen nam Paulus die mannen den volgenden dag mede, en zich met hen afgezonderd hebbende, ging hij naar den tempel en kondigde den laatste van de dagen der afzondering aan, totdat voor ieder van hen de offerande zou geofferd worden. 
[21:27]  Toen nu de zeven dagen ten einde liepen, zagen de Joden van Asië hem in den tempel, en maakten de gansche schare op en sloegen de handen aan hem,
[21:28] roepende: Mannen Israëls! komt te hulp! deze is de man, die aan allen overal leert tegen het volk, en de wet, en deze plaats! ja, zelfs heeft hij Grieken naar den tempel gebracht en die heilige plaats ontwijd!
[21:29] Want zij hadden vroeger Trofimus den Efesiër met hem in de stad gezien, dien zij meenden dat Paulus in den tempel had gebracht.
[21:30] En de geheele stad kwam in opstand en het volk liep te hoop, en zij grepen Paulus en sleepten hem uit den tempel, en terstond werden de deuren gesloten.
[21:31] En terwijl zij hem zochten te vermoorden, kwam tot den overste van de wacht het bericht dat geheel Jerusalem in opstand was.
[21:32] Deze nu nam terstond soldaten en hoofdmannen, en liep op hen toe. En toen zij den overste en de soldaten zagen, hielden zij op van Paulus te slaan.
[21:33] Toen naderde de overste en greep hem, en gebood dat men hem met twee ketenen zou binden, en vroeg wie hij was en wat hij gedaan had.
[21:34] En onder het volk riep de een dit, de ander dat; maar omdat hij door het gewoel niets zekers kon te weten komen, beval hij om hem naar het kasteel te brengen.
[21:35] Toen Paulus nu aan de trappen was gekomen, was het zoodanig dat hij door de soldaten gedragen werd, wegens het geweld der menigte.
[21:36] Want de volksmenigte volgde, al schreeuwende: Weg met hem!
[21:37] Toen Paulus nu in het kasteel zou gebracht worden, zeide hij tot den overste: Is het mij geoorloofd iets tot u te zeggen? Deze nu zeide: Kent gij Grieksch?
[21:38] Zijt gij dan die Egyptenaar niet, die vóór deze dagen oproer maakte en de vier duizend bandieten naar de woestijn uitleidde?
[21:39] Maar Paulus zeide: Ik ben een joodsch man, van Tarsus in Cilicië, een burger van een niet onbekende stad; en ik bid u, laat mij toe tot het volk te spreken.
[21:40] Toen het hem dan toegelaten was, stond Paulus op de trappen en wenkte het volk toe met de hand. En toen er een groote stilte was gekomen, sprak hij hen aan in de hebreeuwsche taal, zeggende:  
[22:1] Mannen broeders en vaders! hoort nu mijn verdediging voor u!
[22:2] Toen zij nu hoorden dat hij hun in de hebreeuwsche taal toesprak, hielden zij zich nog meer stil.
[22:3] En hij zeide: Ik ben een joodsch man, geboortig van Tarsus in Cilicië, maar opgevoed in deze stad Jerusalem, aan de voeten van Gamaliël, onderwezen naar de gestrengheid der vaderlijke wet zijnde een ijveraar voor God, zooals gij allen heden zijt;
[22:4] en ik vervolgde die van dezen weg waren, tot den dood toe, bindende en in de gevangenissen werpende beiden mannen en vrouwen;
[22:5] gelijk ook de hoogepriester mij tot getuige is, en de geheele raad van oudsten; van wie ik ook brieven ontving aan de broeders; en ik reisde naar Damaskus om ook degenen, die daar waren, geboeid naar Jerusalem te brengen, opdat zij gestraft zouden worden.
[22:6] Het geschiedde nu, toen ik op reis was en Damaskus naderde, omtrent den middag, dat mij plotseling een groot licht van den hemel omstraalde;
[22:7] en ik viel op den grond en hoorde een stem tot mij zeggen: Saul, Saul! wat vervolgt gij Mij?
[22:8] en ik antwoordde: Wie zijt Gij, Heere? en Hij zeide tot mij: Ik ben Jezus de Nazarener, dien gij vervolgt!
[22:9] Zij nu die met mij waren zagen wel het licht, maar de stem van Hem die tot mij sprak, hoorden zij niet.
[22:10] En ik zeide: Wat zal ik doen, Heere? En de Heere zeide tot mij: Sta op, ga naar Damaskus! en daar zal tot u gesproken worden van al wat u bevolen is te doen.
[22:11] En alzoo ik door den glans van dat licht niet zien kon, werd ik bij de hand geleid door mijn metgezellen en kwam naar Damaskus.
[22:12] En een zekere Ananias, een godvruchtig man naar de wet, die een goed getuigenis had bij de aldaar wonende Joden,
[22:13] kwam tot mij en zeide, toen hij bij mij stond: Saul, broeder! word ziende! — En in dat zelfde oogenblik zag ik hem aan.
[22:14] En hij zeide: De God onzer vaderen heeft u verkozen om zijn wil te weten, en den Rechtvaardige te zien, en een stem te hooren uit zijn mond;
[22:15] want gij zult voor Hem getuige zijn bij alle menschen van hetgeen gij gezien en gehoord hebt;
[22:16] en nu, wat vertoeft gij? sta op, laat u doopen en uw zonden afwasschen, onder aanroeping van zijn Naam!
[22:17] Het geschiedde nu, toen ik teruggekeerd was naar Jerusalem en ik in den tempel bad, dat ik in een verrukking van zinnen geraakte,
[22:18] en dat ik Hem zag, en Hij tot mij zeide: Spoed u en ga haastig uit Jerusalem, want zij zullen uw getuigenis aangaande Mij niet aannemen!
[22:19] En ik zeide; Heere! zij zelven weten dat ik in de gevangenis wierp, en in de synagoge geeselde degenen die in u geloofden,
[22:20] en dat ik zelf er bijstond toen het bloed van uw getuige Stefanus werd vergoten, en er welbehagen in toonde, en de kleederen bewaarde van zijn moordenaars!
[22:21] En Hij zeide tot mij: Ga heen, want Ik zal u verre weg tot de heidenen zenden! 
[22:22]  Zij hoorden dan Paulus tot dit woord toe; en zij verhieven hun stem, zeggende: Weg van de aarde met zoo een! hij mag niet blijven leven!
[22:23] En alzoo zij schreeuwden en de kleederen van zich smeten en stof in de lucht wierpen,
[22:24] gebood de overste om hem naar het kasteel te voeren, en zeide dat hij door geeselen moest onderzocht worden, opdat hij zou weten om welke reden zij zoo tegen hem riepen. 
[22:25]  Toen zij hem nu vastgebonden hadden met koorden, zeide Paulus tot den hoofdman die daar stond: Is het u geoorloofd iemand te geeselen die Romein is en niet veroordeeld?
[22:26] Toen de hoofdman dit hoorde, ging hij naar den overste om hem dit te boodschappen, en zeide: Wat gaat gij doen? deze mensch is toch een Romein!
[22:27] De overste dan kwam bij hem en zeide: Zeg mij, zijt gij een Romein? En hij zeide: Ja!
[22:28] En de overste antwoordde: Ik heb voor een groot kapitaal dit burgerrecht gekocht! — Maar ik— zeide Paulus— ben Romein van geboorte!
[22:29] Terstond lieten zij, die hem pijnigen zouden, van hem af; en de overste vreesde ook toen hij vernam dat hij Romein was en dat hij hem had gebonden.
[22:30] Des anderen daags nu, daar hij nauwkeurig wilde weten waarvan hij door de Joden beschuldigd werd, liet hij hem de boeien afdoen en gebood dat de overpriesters en de geheele Raad zouden samenkomen; en hij bracht Paulus naar beneden en stelde hem voor hen.  
[23:1] Paulus nu, den Raad sterk aanziende, zeide: Mannen broeders! Ik heb tot op den dag van heden met een volkomen goede konsciëntie voor God verkeerd.
[23:2] Maar de hoogepriester Ananias beval aan degenen die bij hem stonden, om hem op den mond te slaan.
[23:3] Toen zeide Paulus tot hem: U zal God slaan, gij gewitte muur! Zit gij daar om mij te oordeelen naar de wet, en beveelt gij tegen de wet dat ik geslagen zal worden?
[23:4] En die daarbij stonden zeiden: Scheldt gij den hoogepriester Gods?
[23:5] Toén zeide Paulus: Ik wist niet, broeders! dat het de hoogepriester was; want er is geschreven: Van den overste uws volks zult gij geen kwaad spreken. 
[23:6]  En Paulus wist dat de eene helft van hen sadduceërs en de andere helft fariseërs waren, en hij riep in den Raad: Mannen broeders! ik ben fariseër, eens fariseërs zoon! over de hoop en de verrijzenis der dooden word ik geoordeeld
[23:7] Toen hij dit nu gezegd had, rees er een twist tusschen de fariseërs en sadduceërs, en de vergadering werd verdeeld.
[23:8] Want de sadduceërs zeggen dat er geen verrijzenis is, noch engel, noch geest; maar de fariseërs belijden beide.
[23:9] Er ontstond dan een groot geschreeuw, en sommige schriftgeleerden, van de partij der fariseërs, stonden op en streden, zeggende: Niets kwaads vinden wij in dezen mensch! en indien er eens een geest of engel tot hem gesproken heeft? 
[23:10]  Toen er nu een hevige twist was, vreesde de overste dat Paulus door hen zou verscheurd worden, en hij gebood dat het krijgsvolk zou afkomen en hem uit hun midden wegrukken en naar het kasteel brengen.
[23:11] En den volgenden nacht stond de Heere bij hem en zeide: Houd moed, Paulus! want evenals gij van Mij te Jerusalem hebt getuigd, zoo moet gij ook te Rome getuigen! 
[23:12]  Toen het nu dag was geworden, spanden de Joden samen, en vervloekten zich zelven, zeggende dat zij niet zouden eten of drinken vóórdat ze Paulus zouden vermoord hebben.
[23:13] En er waren meer dan veertig die deze samenzwering gemaakt hadden.
[23:14] En deze gingen tot de overpriesters en de oudsten en zeiden: Met een vervloeking hebben wij ons zelven verbonden, om niets te proeven vóórdat wij Paulus vermoord hebben.
[23:15] Nu dan, laat gij den overste met den Raad weten dat hij hem tot u afbrenge, alsof gij zijn zaak nauwkeuriger zoudt onderzoeken; en wij zijn gereed hem te vermoorden eer hij bij u komt.
[23:16] Doch de zoon van Paulus zuster hoorde van dezen aanslag, en hij kwam en ging in het kasteel en vertelde het aan Paulus.
[23:17] En Paulus riep een der hoofdmannen tot zich en zeide: Breng dezen jongeling naar den overste, want hij heeft hem wat te zeggen!
[23:18] Deze nu nam hem en bracht hem tot den overste en zeide: De gevangene Paulus heeft mij tot zich geroepen en gevraagd om dezen jongeling tot u te brengen, die u wat te zeggen heeft.
[23:19] De overste dan nam hem bij de hand en ging terzijde en vroeg: Wat hebt gij mij te boodschappen?
[23:20] En hij zeide: De Joden zijn overeengekomen om u te verzoeken dat gij morgen Paulus zoudt afbrengen naar den Raad, alsof ze wat nauwkeuriger zijn zaak zouden onderzoeken;
[23:21] maar geloof ze niet, want meer dan veertig mannen uit hen leggen hem lagen, die zich door een vervloeking verbonden hebben om niets te eten of te drinken vóórdat ze hem vermoord hebben; en nu zijn zij gereed en wachten op uw toezegging.
[23:22] De overste dan liet den jongeling gaan en gebood hem: Zeg aan niemand dat gij mij dit hebt verteld! 
[23:23]  En hij riep twee hoofdmannen tot zich en zeide: Maakt tweehonderd soldaten gereed om naar Cesarea te gaan, en zeventig ruiters, en tweehonderd lansiers, tegen de derde ure van den nacht,
[23:24] en zorgt voor zadelbeesten, om Paulus daarop te zetten en hem zonder letsel over te brengen naar den stadhouder Felix.
[23:25] En hij schreef een brief van dezen inhoud:
[23:26] Klaudius Lysias, aan den machtigen stadhouder Felix, geluk!
[23:27] Dezen man, die door de Joden is gegrepen, en die door hen zou vermoord zijn, heb ik verlost, door hen met het krijgsvolk te overvallen, toen ik vernam dat hij een Romein is;
[23:28] en de oorzaak willende weten waarom zij hem beschuldigden, heb ik hem in hun Raad gebracht,
[23:29] en bevonden dat hij werd beschuldigd over eenige vragen van hun wet, maar dat hij geen beschuldiging tegen zich had, die den dood of banden verdiende;
[23:30] maar toen mij te kennen gegeven werd dat er uit hen tegen den man een samenspanning was, heb ik hem terstond tot u gezonden, en ook zijn beschuldigers geboden voor u te zeggen wat ze tegen hem hadden. Vaarwel!
[23:31] De soldaten dan namen Paulus, zooals hun geboden was, en brachten hem des nachts naar Antipatris,
[23:32] en den volgenden dag lieten zij de ruiters met hem trekken, en zij keerden terug naar het kasteel.
[23:33] Dezen nu, in Cesarea aangekomen zijnde, en den brief aan den stadhouder overgegeven hebbende, stelden ook Paulus voor hem.
[23:34] Nadat hij nu den brief gelezen had, vroeg de stadhouder uit welke provincie Paulus was? en vernomen hebbende dat hij uit Cilicië was, zeide hij:
[23:35] Ik zal u verhooren, wanneer ook uw beschuldigers gekomen zijn. En hij gebood dat hij in het rechthuis van Herodes zou bewaard worden.  
[24:1] Na vijf dagen nu kwam de hoogepriester Ananias af met sommige oudsten en een redenaar Tertullus, en zij klaagden Paulus aan voor den stadhouder.
[24:2] En als hij geroepen was, begon Tertullus hem aldus te beschuldigen:
[24:3] Dat wij door u grooten vrede genieten, en dat er dezen volke door uw bestuur verbeteringen zijn aangebracht, erkennen wij altijd en overal, machtige Felix, met alle dankbaarheid!
[24:4] Maar opdat ik u niet te lang ophoude, zoo bid ik u dat gij ons, naar uw welwillendheid, kortelijk wilt aanhooren.
[24:5] Wij hebben toch bevonden dat deze man een pest is en een oproerstoker onder alle Joden over de geheele aarde, en een voorstander van de ketterij der Nazareners;
[24:6] die zelfs getracht heeft den tempel te ontheiligen; dien wij ook gegrepen hebben, en naar onze wet hebben willen oordeelen,
[24:7] maar de overste Lysias overviel ons met groot geweld en rukte hem uit onze handen,
[24:8] gebiedende zijn beschuldigers tot u te komen; van hem zelven zult gij kunnen te weten komen al datgene waarvan wij hem beschuldigen, indien gij hem onderzoekt.
[24:9] En ook de Joden vielen hem aan, en zeiden dat deze dingen zoo waren. 
[24:10]  En Paulus antwoordde, toen de stadhouder had gewenkt dat hij spreken zou: Wetende dat gij vele jaren rechter over dit volk geweest zijt, verantwoord ik mij welgemoed,
[24:11] omdat gij kunt vernemen dat het niet meer dan twaalf dagen is geleden dat ik opgegaan ben naar Jerusalem om te aanbidden;
[24:12] en zij hebben mij niet in den tempel gevonden met iemand redetwistende, of een oploop van volk makende, noch in de synagogen, noch in de stad;
[24:13] ook kunnen zij voor u niet bewijzen hetgeen waarvan zij mij nu beschuldigen.
[24:14] Maar dit beken ik voor u, dat ik, naar den weg dien zij ketterij noemen, den God der vaderen alzoo diene, geloovende al wat geschreven is in de wet en in de profeten,
[24:15] hebbende hope op God, die dezen zelf ook verwachten, dat er een verrijzenis zal zijn zoowel van rechtvaardigen als van onrechtvaardigen;
[24:16] daarin oefen ik ook mij zelven om altijd een onberispelijke konsciëntie te hebben voor God en de menschen.
[24:17] Na vele jaren nu ben ik gekomen om aalmoezen te doen aan mijn volk en offeranden;
[24:18] en hiermede bezigzijnde, nadat ik mij afgezonderd had, vonden mij eenige Joden van Asië in den tempel, doch zonder volk en zonder opschudding.
[24:19] Dezen nu behoorden voor u tegenwoordig te zijn en mij te beschuldigen, indien zij iets tegen mij hebben,
[24:20] of wel, laat dezen zelven zeggen welk onrecht zij in mij gevonden hebben, toen ik voor den Raad stond,
[24:21] tenware dit ééne woord dat ik uitriep toen ik onder hen stond: Over de verrijzenis der dooden word ik heden door u geoordeeld! 
[24:22]  Felix nu, die den weg des Heeren nauwkeuriger kende, stelde hen uit, zeggende: Als Lysias, de overste zal afgekomen zijn, dan zal ik uw zaken onderzoeken.
[24:23] En hij gebood den hoofdman om Paulus te bewaren en meer vrijheid te geven, en om niemand der zijnen te verhinderen om hem te dienen. 
[24:24]  Na eenige dagen nu kwam Felix met Drusilla, zijn vrouw, die een Jodin was, en hij liet Paulus halen en hoorde hem over het geloof in Christus Jezus.
[24:25] Doch toen Paulus sprak over rechtvaardigheid, en ingetogenheid, en het toekomend oordeel, werd Felix bevreesd en zeide: Ga voor ditmaal heen; ter gelegener tijd zal ik u tot mij roepen. 
[24:26]  Tegelijk ook hoopte hij dat hem door Paulus geld zou worden gegeven, waarom hij hem ook meermalen liet roepen en met hem sprak.
[24:27] Doch toen er twee jaar verloopen waren, kreeg Felix tot opvolger Porcius Festus; en daar Felix den Joden een gunst wilde bewijzen, liet hij Paulus gevangen achter.  
[25:1] Festus dan, in de provincie gekomen zijnde, ging drie dagen daarna van Cesarea naar Jerusalem.
[25:2] En de overpriesters en de voornaamsten der Joden brachten bij hem klachten in tegen Paulus,
[25:3] en zij verzochten hem, daar zij een gunst van hem begeerden, om Paulus naar Jerusalem terug te zenden, terwijl zij lagen leiden om hem onderweg te vermoorden.
[25:4] Doch Festus antwoordde dat Paulus te Cesarea bewaard werd, en dat hij zelf binnenkort daarheen zou gaan.
[25:5] Dat dan diegenen van u, zoo zeide hij, die aan het bestuur zijn, mede afkomen, en zoo er in den man iets onbehoorlijks is, dat ze hem aanklagen.
[25:6] En toen hij onder hen niet meer dan acht of tien dagen had doorgebracht ging hij af naar Cesarea; en den volgenden dag zette hij zich op den rechterstoel en gebood dat Paulus zou voorgebracht worden.
[25:7] En toen deze was binnengebracht, stonden de Joden, die van Jerusalem afgekomen waren, rond hem en brachten vele en zware beschuldigingen tegen hem in, die ze niet konden bewijzen,
[25:8] daar Paulus zich verdedigde en zeide: Noch tegen de wet der Joden, noch tegen den tempel, noch tegen den keizer heb ik iets misdaan. 
[25:9]  Maar Festus wilde den Joden een gunst bewijzen en antwoordde Paulus: Wilt gij naar Jerusalem opgaan om daar voor mij over deze dingen geoordeeld te worden?
[25:10] Doch Paulus zeide: Ik sta voor des keizers rechterstoel, waar ik moet geoordeeld worden; den Joden heb ik niets misdaan, zooals gij zelf zeer goed weet!
[25:11] Doe ik dan onrecht en heb ik iets gedaan dat den dood verdient, zoo weiger ik niet te sterven; maar zoo er niets waar is van hetgeen waarvan zij mij beschuldigen, dan kan niemand mij uit gunst aan hen overleveren; op den keizer beroep ik mij!
[25:12] Toen antwoordde Festus, nadat hij met den Raad gesproken had: Op den keizer hebt gij u beroepen; tot den keizer zult gij gaan! 
[25:13]  Toen er nu eenige dagen verloopen waren, kwamen koning Agrippa en Bernice naar Cesarea, om Festus te groeten.
[25:14] En alzoo zij vele dagen daar bleven, deelde Festus den koning de zaken aangaande Paulus mede, en zeide: Een zeker man is door Felix gebonden achtergelaten,
[25:15] om wien de overpriesters en de oudsten der Joden, toen ik te Jerusalem was, bij mij kwamen en een vonnis tegen hem eischten;
[25:16] maar ik antwoordde hun dat de Romeinen de gewoonte niet hebben van iemand uit gunst over te geven, vóórdat de beschuldigde zijn beschuldigers voor zich heeft, en gelegenheid heeft bekomen om zich te verdedigen tegen de beschuldiging.
[25:17] Toen zij dan hier samengekomen waren heb ik zonder uitstel, des anderen daags op den rechterstoel zittende, geboden den man voor te brengen.
[25:18] Doch de beschuldigers die er stonden, brachten geen beschuldiging aangaande hem in van hetgeen ik vermoedde;
[25:19] maar zij hadden met hem eenige verschillen over hun godsdienst en over zekeren Jezus, die dood is, dien Paulus zeide te leven.
[25:20] Ik dan, gansch verlegen over dat verschil, vroeg of hij naar Jerusalem wilde gaan, en daar over die dingen geoordeeld worden.
[25:21] Maar toen Paulus in beroep kwam, om bewaard te worden voor de beslissing der keizerlijke majesteit, heb ik geboden hem te bewaren, totdat ik hem naar den keizer zend.
[25:22] En Agrippa zeide tot Festus: Ik zelf zou dien man ook wel eens willen hooren! — Morgen, zeide hij, zult gij hem hooren.
[25:23] Des anderen daags dan, toen Agrippa en Bernice met groote pracht waren gekomen, en de gehoorzaal waren binnengegaan met de oversten en de voornaamste mannen der stad, werd Paulus op bevel van Festus voorgebracht.
[25:24] En Festus zeide: Koning Agrippa, en al gij mannen, die hier met ons zijt! daar ziet gij hem, over wien de geheele menigte der Joden, zoowel te Jerusalem als hier, mij aangesproken heeft, roepende dat hij niet meer behoorde te leven;
[25:25] maar ik heb bevonden dat hij niets gedaan heeft dat den dood verdient; doch daar hij zich beroepen heeft op de keizerlijke majesteit heb ik besloten hem te zenden.
[25:26] Maar ik heb niets zekers over hem aan den heer te schrijven; daarom heb ik hem voor ulieden gebracht, en voornamelijk voor u, koning Agrippa! opdat ik, na dit onderzoek, iets moge hebben om te schrijven;
[25:27] want het lijkt mij onredelijk, een gevangene te zenden en niet ook de beschuldiging tegen hem op te geven.  
[26:1] Agrippa nu zeide tot Paulus: Het is u geoorloofd voor u zelven te spreken. Toen strekte Paulus de hand uit en verantwoordde zich aldus:
[26:2] Koning Agrippa! ik acht mij zelven gelukkig dat ik heden mij voor u zal verantwoorden over alles, waarvan ik door de Joden word beschuldigd;
[26:3] te meer omdat gij bekend zijt met al de gewoonten en geschillen der Joden; daarom verzoek ik u dat gij mij geduldig aanhoort!
[26:4] Mijn leven dan van mijn jeugd af, zooals het van den beginne af onder mijn volk en te Jerusalem is geweest, is aan al de Joden bekend;
[26:5] want zij kennen mij vanouds af, indien zij het willen getuigen, dat ik naar de gestrengste sekte van onzen godsdienst heb geleefd als een fariseër;
[26:6] en nu sta ik voor het gericht om de hope op de belofte die door God aan onze vaderen is gedaan,
[26:7] tot welke onze twaalf stammen, God dag en nacht ijverig dienende, hopen te komen. Over deze hope nu word ik door de Joden beschuldigd, o koning!
[26:8] Wat? wordt het onder ulieden voor ongelooflijk gehouden, dat God dooden opwekt?
[26:9] Ik voor mij meende ook tegen den Naam van Jezus den Nazarener veel vijandschap te moeten toonen;
[26:10] en dat heb ik ook gedaan in Jerusalem, en ik heb velen der heiligen in de gevangenissen gesloten, toen ik van de overpriesters daartoe macht had ontvangen; en als zij omgebracht werden, keurde ik dat goed,
[26:11] en in alle synagogen heb ik hen dikwijls gestraft en hen gedwongen Jezus te lasteren; en uitermate tegen hen woedende, heb ik hen vervolgd tot zelfs in de buitenlandsche steden.
[26:12] Toen ik nu, daarin bezig zijnde, naar Damaskus reisde, met macht en gebod van de overpriesters,
[26:13] zag ik, o koning, midden op den dag, op den weg een licht, boven den glans der zon, dat mij en hen die met mij reisden, van den hemel omscheen;
[26:14] en toen wij allen op den grond gevallen waren hoorde ik een stem, die in de hebreeuwsche taal tot mij zeide: Saul, Saul! wat vervolgt gij Mij? Het is u hard, achteruit te slaan tegen de prikkels!
[26:15] En ik zeide: Wie zijt Gij, Heere? En de Heere zeide: Ik ben Jezus dien gij vervolgt!
[26:16] maar richt u op en sta op uw voeten, want daartoe ben Ik u verschenen om u tot een dienaar en getuige te stellen van de dingen die gij gezien hebt en van hetgeen Ik u van Mij zal openbaren,
[26:17] u verlossende van dit volk en van de heidenen, tot wie Ik u zend,
[26:18] om hun oogen te openen, opdat zij zich bekeeren van duisternis tot licht, en van de macht des Satans tot God, opdat zij vergiffenis van zonden ontvangen en een erfdeel onder de geheiligden door het geloof in Mij!
[26:19] Daarom, koning Agrippa! was ik niet ongehoorzaam aan dat hemelsch visioen,
[26:20] maar ik predikte eerst aan die te Damaskus waren, en te Jerusalem, en door het geheele land van Judea, en aan de heidenen dat zij tot boetvaardigheid zouden komen en zich bekeeren tot God, doende werken der boetvaardigheid waardig.
[26:21] Hierom nu hebben de Joden mij gevangen, toen ik in den tempel was en hebben zij gezocht mij te vermoorden.
[26:22] Doch de hulpe Gods verkregen hebbende, sta ik tot op dezen dag aan klein en groot te getuigen, zonder iets te zeggen dan wat de profeten en Mozes gesproken hebben dat geschieden zou:
[26:23] dat de Christus zou lijden en dat Hij, de eerste uit de verrijzenis der dooden, een licht zou verkondigen aan dit volk en aan de heidenen! 
[26:24]  Als hij zich nu aldus verdedigde, zeide Festus met een luide stem: Gij raast, Paulus! de groote geleerdheid brengt u tot razernij!
[26:25] Maar Paulus zeide: Ik raas niet, machtige Festus, maar ik spreek woorden van waarheid en gezond verstand!
[26:26] Want de koning weet van deze dingen, tot wien ik ook met vrijmoedigheid spreek; want ik houd mij verzekerd dat niets van deze dingen hem onbekend is, want ze zijn niet in een hoek geschied.
[26:27] Gelooft gij, koning Agrippa! in de profeten? — Ik weet dat gij gelooft! 
[26:28]  En Agrippa zeide tot Paulus: Binnenkort overtuigt gij mij nog, om mij christen te maken!
[26:29] En Paulus zeide: God gave dat in korten of langen tijd niet alleen gij, maar ook allen die mij heden hooren, zoodanig werdt als ik ben, deze banden uitgezonderd!
[26:30] En de koning stond op, en de stadhouder, en Bernice, en zij die met hen gezeten waren,
[26:31] en terzijde gegaan zijnde, spraken zij tot malkander zeggende: Deze mensch doet niets dat den dood of banden verdient.
[26:32] En Agrippa zeide tot Festus: Deze mensch kon losgelaten worden, als hij zich niet op den keizer had beroepen.  
[27:1] Toen het nu besloten was dat wij naar Italië zouden afvaren, gaven zij Paulus en eenige andere gevangenen over aan een hoofdman met name Julius, van het keizerlijk regiment.
[27:2] En gegaan zijnde op een schip van Adramyttium, dat naar de zeeplaatsen van Asië zou varen, staken wij af. En Aristarchus, een Macedoniër van Thessalonika, was met ons.
[27:3] En des anderen daags leiden wij aan te Sidon. En Julius handelde vriendelijk met Paulus, en liet hem toe om bij de vrienden te gaan en door hen verzorgd te worden.
[27:4] En vandaar afgevaren zijnde, voeren wij beneden Cyprus heen, omdat de wind tegen was.
[27:5] En wij voeren door de zee langs Cilicië en Pamfylië, en kwamen aan te Myra in Lycië;
[27:6] en daar vond de hoofdman een schip van Alexandrië, dat naar Italië voer, en deed ons daarop overgaan.
[27:7] En als wij vele dagen langzaam voortvoeren en met moeite tegenover Knidus gekomen waren, daar de wind ons niet gunstig was, zoo voeren wij onder Kreta langs, tegenover Salmone;
[27:8] en dit met moeite voorbij zeilende, kwamen wij naar een plaats genaamd Schoonhaven, waar de stad Lasea dicht bij lag.
[27:9] Toen er nu veel tijd verloopen en de scheepvaart reeds gevaarlijk was, want ook de vasten was reeds voorbij, vermaande Paulus hen, zeggende tot hen:
[27:10] Mannen, ik zie dat de vaart zal geschieden met hinder en groote schade, niet alleen van de lading en van het schip, maar ook van ons leven!
[27:11] Doch de hoofdman gaf meer gehoor aan den stuurman en den schipper, dan aan de woorden van Paulus.
[27:12] Dewijl nu de haven ongeschikt was om er te overwinteren, vonden de meesten het geraden om vandaar weg te varen, of zij misschien konden aankomen en overwinteren te Fenix, een haven van Kreta, naar het zuidwesten en noordwesten gelegen.
[27:13] Toen er nu een zachte zuidenwind begon te waaien en zij meenden dat zij hun doel bereikt hadden, lichtten zij het anker en zeilden langs Kreta, dicht onder de zeekust. 
[27:14]  Maar niet lang daarna sloeg er van dat eiland een stormwind neer, namelijk een noord–oostenwind.
[27:15] En daar het schip werd meegesleept en aan den wind geen wederstand kon bieden, gaven wij het op en dreven weg.
[27:16] En heenloopende onder zeker eilandje, genaamd Klauda, konden wij met moeite de boot machtig worden.
[27:17] En nadat deze opgehaald was, gebruikten zij alle hulpmiddelen, door het schip te ondergorden; en omdat zij vreesden op de zandbanken van de Syrtis te vervallen, streken zij het zeil en zoo dreven ze weg.
[27:18] Daar wij nu door den storm geweldig geslingerd; werden, wierpen zij den volgenden dag een deel der lading overboord.
[27:19] En op den derden dag wierpen zij met eigen hand het scheepsgereedschap overboord.
[27:20] En daar er vele dagen lang geen zon of gesternte te zien was, en geen kleine storm ons beukte, was ons alle hoop om behouden te worden, ontnomen.
[27:21] En alzoo men langen tijd zonder eten geweest was, stond Paulus op in hun midden en zeide: Mannen, gij hadt mij gehoor moeten geven, en van Kreta niet zijn afgevaren, om dezen hinder en schade niet te hebben!
[27:22] Doch ook nu vermaan ik u goedsmoeds te zijn, want er zal geen verlies zijn van iemands leven onder u, maar wel van het schip;
[27:23] want in dezen zelfden nacht stond bij mij een engel van den God wiens ik ben, en wien ik ook dien, zeggende:
[27:24] Vrees niet, Paulus! voor den keizer moet gij gesteld worden; en zie, God heeft u geschonken allen die met u varen.
[27:25] Daarom zijt goedsmoeds, mannen! want ik geloof God, dat het alzoo zijn zal als mij gezegd is;
[27:26] doch wij moeten op een zeker eiland geworpen worden.
[27:27] Toen nu de veertiende nacht gekomen was dat wij in de Adriatische zee ronddreven, meende het scheepsvolk des middernachts dat hun eenig land naderde.
[27:28] En zij peilden en vonden twintig vadem diepte, en een weinig verder peilden zij wederom en vonden vijftien vadem.
[27:29] En vreezende dat wij ergens op de klippen zouden vallen, wierpen zij van den achtersteven vier ankers uit en wenschten dat het dag werd.
[27:30] Toen nu het scheepsvolk uit het schip zocht te vluchten en de boot in zee neder liet, onder den schijn van de ankers uit te werpen van den voorsteven,
[27:31] zeide Paulus tot den hoofdman en de soldaten: Indien dezen niet in het schip blijven, kunt gij niet behouden worden!
[27:32] Toen kapten de soldaten de koorden van de boot en lieten haar vallen.
[27:33] En toen de dag begon aan te breken, vermaande Paulus allen om spijze te nemen, zeggende: Het zijn heden veertien dagen dat gij, al wachtende, zonder voedsel zijt en niets genomen hebt;
[27:34] daarom vermaan ik ulieden om spijze te nemen, want dat dient tot uw behoud; want van niemand uwer zal een haar van het hoofd verloren gaan!
[27:35] En dit gezegd hebbende, nam hij brood, en dankte God in aller tegenwoordigheid, en brak het en begon te eten.
[27:36] En zij werden allen goedsmoeds en namen zelf ook spijze.
[27:37] Wij waren nu in het schip in het geheel tweehonderd zes en zeventig zielen sterk.
[27:38] En nadat zij van spijze verzadigd waren, ontlastten zij het schip, door het koren in zee te werpen. 
[27:39]  En toen het dag geworden was, kenden zij het land niet, maar zij bemerkten een zekeren inham die een oever had, waartegen zij, indien het mogelijk was, het schip zochten aan te zetten.
[27:40] En zij kapten de ankers en lieten die aan de zee over, tegelijk de roerbanden losmakende; en zij haalden het razeil op naar den wind en hielden op den oever aan.
[27:41] Maar op een zandbank vervallende, zetten zij het schip daarop, en de voorsteven, daarin vastzittende, bleef onbewegelijk; maar de achtersteven werd uiteengeslagen door de branding.
[27:42] Het plan der soldaten nu was om de gevangenen te dooden, opdat niemand door zwemmen zou ontvluchten.
[27:43] Maar de hoofdman, die Paulus wilde behouden, belette hun dit, en gebood dengenen die zwemmen konden, zich het eerst overboord te werpen, en aan wal te komen.
[27:44] En de overigen, sommigen op planken, en anderen op stukken van het schip. En zoo geschiedde het dat zij allen behouden aan den wal kwamen.  
[28:1] En toen wij gered waren, vernamen wij dat het eiland Melite genaamd werd.
[28:2] En de barbaren bewezen ons een buitengewone vriendschap, want zij ontstaken een vuur en namen ons allen op om den invallenden regen en om de koude.
[28:3] En toen Paulus een hoop takjes had bijeengeraapt en op het vuur gelegd, kwam er een adder uit door de hitte en vatte zijn hand.
[28:4] En toen de barbaren het beest zagen hangen aan zijn hand, zeiden zij tot malkander: Deze mensch is zeker een moordenaar, die de wraak niet laat leven, nadat hij uit de zee is ontkomen.
[28:5] Hij dan schudde het beest af in het vuur en leed geen kwaad.
[28:6] En zij verwachtten dat hij zou opzwellen of terstond, dood nedervallen; maar toen zij, na lang wachten, zagen dat hem geen kwaad overkwam, veranderden zij van gedachte en zeiden dat hij een god was. 
[28:7]  In den omtrek nu van die plaats had de voornaamste van het eiland, met name Publius, een landgoed; en deze ontving ons, en herbergde ons vriendelijk drie dagen lang.
[28:8] En het geschiedde dat de vader van Publius met de koorts en dissenterie ziek lag; en Paulus ging tot hem, en gebeden hebbende leide hij hem de handen op en genas hem.
[28:9] Toen dit nu geschied was, kwamen ook de andere kranken uit het eiland en werden genezen.
[28:10] En zij bewezen ons veel eer, en toen wij wegvoeren, bezorgden zij ons wat wij van noode hadden. 
[28:11]  Na drie maanden nu zeilden wij heen in een schip van Alexandrië, dat op het eiland had overwinterd en de Dioscuren tot teeken had.
[28:12] En wij leiden te Syrakuse aan en bleven daar drie dagen.
[28:13] En vandaar omvarende, kwamen wij te Rhegium, en toen één dag later de wind zuid was geworden, kwamen wij den tweeden dag aan te Puteoli,
[28:14] waar wij broeders vonden en verzocht werden zeven dagen bij hen te blijven; en alzoo kwamen wij naar Rome.
[28:15] En vandaar kwamen de broeders, die van ons gehoord hadden, ons te gemoet tot aan Appiusmarkt en Drie Herbergen; en toen Paulus hen gezien had, dankte hij God en greep moed. 
[28:16]  Toen wij nu te Rome gekomen waren, werd het aan Paulus toegelaten op zich zelven te wonen, met den soldaat die hem bewaarde.
[28:17] En het geschiedde na drie dagen dat hij de voornaamste Joden samenriep; en als zij vergaderd waren zeide hij tot hen: Mannen broeders! ik, die niets gedaan heb tegen het volk of de vaderlijke gewoonten, ben gebonden uit Jerusalem overgeleverd in de handen der Romeinen,
[28:18] die mij wilden loslaten, nadat zij mij verhoord hadden, omdat er in mij geen schuld des doods was;
[28:19] maar toen de Joden daartegen opkwamen, ben ik genoodzaakt mij op den keizer te beroepen, doch niet alsof ik mijn volk van iets had te beschuldigen;
[28:20] om deze oorzaak nu heb ik ulieden samengeroepen, om u te zien en te spreken, want vanwege de hope Israëls ben ik in deze keten gebonden.
[28:21] En zij zeiden tot hem: Wij hebben aangaande u geen brieven ontvangen uit Judea, noch is er iemand der broeders overgekomen die iets kwaads aangaande u bericht of gesproken heeft;
[28:22] doch wij begeeren van u te hooren wat uw gevoelens zijn; want wat deze sekte aangaat, het is ons bekend dat zij overal wordt tegengesproken.
[28:23] En als zij hem een dag gesteld hadden, kwamen er nog meerderen naar zijn woning, voor wie hij de zaak uitleide, en getuigde van het koninkrijk Gods, en overtuigde hen aangaande Jezus uit de wet van Mozes en uit de profeten, van des morgens vroeg tot den avond toe.
[28:24] En sommigen geloofden wat er gezegd werd en anderen geloofden niet.
[28:25] En onder malkander verdeeld zijnde, scheidden zij van malkander, toen Paulus dit ééne woord gezegd had: Terecht heeft de Heilige Geest, door Jesaja den profeet, tot uw vaderen gesproken, zeggende:
[28:26] Ga tot dit volk en zeg: Met het gehoor zult gij hooren en geenszins verstaan; en ziende zult gij zien en geenszins bemerken;
[28:27] want het hart van dit volk is verstompt, en met de ooren hebben zij bezwaarlijk gehoord, en hun oogen hebben zij toegeknepen, opdat zij met de oogen niet zouden zien en met de ooren niet zouden hooren, en met het hart niet verstaan, en zij zich bekeeren en Ik hen geneze!
[28:28] U zij dan bekend dat deze behoudenis van God tot de heidenen is gezonden, en die zullen hooren!
[28:29] En als hij dit gezegd had, gingen de Joden weg, onder malkander veel twist hebbende. 
[28:30]  En Paulus bleef twee volle jaren in een eigen gehuurde woning en hij ontving allen die tot hem kwamen.
[28:31] En hij predikte het koninkrijk Gods en leerde de dingen aangaande den Heere Jezus Christus met alle vrijmoedigheid, onverhinderd.   

### Romans

[1:1] Paulus, een dienaar van Jezus Christus, geroepen tot apostel, afgezonderd tot het Evangelie van God,
[1:2] dat Hij vroeger beloofd had door zijn profeten, in de Heilige Schrifturen,
[1:3] aangaande zijn Zoon, — die voortgekomen is uit de nakomelingschap van David naar het vleesch,
[1:4] die met kracht als Zoon van God bewezen is, naar den Geest der heiligheid, uit de verrijzenis der dooden, — te weten Jezus Christus, onzen Heere,
[1:5] door wien wij genade hebben bekomen en het apostelschap, tot gehoorzaamheid des geloofs onder al de volken, voor zijn Naam,
[1:6] onder wie ook gijlieden zijt, geroepenen van Jezus Christus!
[1:7] Aan allen die in Rome zijt, beminden Gods, geroepen heiligen! Genade zij ulieden en vrede van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:8]  Vooreerst dan dank ik mijn God, door Jezus Christus, over u allen, omdat uw geloof bekend gemaakt wordt in de geheele wereld.
[1:9] Want God is mijn getuige wien ik in mijn geest dien, in het Evangelie zijns Zoons, hoe ik onophoudelijk van u melding maak,
[1:10] voortdurend in mijn gebeden smeekende, dat ik nog eens, naar Gods wil, het geluk mag hebben van tot u te komen.
[1:11] Want ik verlang u te zien, opdat ik u eenige geestelijke gave moge mededeelen, opdat gij zoudt versterkt worden;
[1:12] dat is, om onder u mede opgewekt te worden door ons gemeenschappelijk geloof, zoowel dat van u als van mij.
[1:13] Doch ik wil niet, broeders! dat het u onbekend zij hoe ik dikwijls heb voorgenomen tot u te komen, opdat ik ook in uw midden eenige vrucht zou hebben, zooals ook onder de andere volken; maar ik ben tot nog toe daarin verhinderd.
[1:14] Aan Grieken toch, zoowel als aan Barbaren, aan verstandigen zoowel als aan onkundigen, ben ik schuldig;
[1:15] zoodat ik voor mij ook bereidwillig ben om aan ulieden, die in Rome zijt, het Evangelie te verkondigen. 
[1:16]  Want ik schaam mij niet over het Evangelie, omdat het een kracht Gods is tot behoudenis voor een ieder die gelooft; den Jood eerst, en ook den Griek.
[1:17] Want Gods rechtvaardigheid wordt daarin geopenbaard uit geloof tot geloof, zooals geschreven is: de rechtvaardige zal uit geloof leven. 
[1:18]  Want Gods gramschap openbaart zich van den hemel over alle goddeloosheid en onrechtvaardigheid van de menschen die de waarheid in onrechtvaardigheid onderdrukken;
[1:19] omdat hetgeen van God kenbaar is, onder hen bekend is, want God heeft het hun bekend gemaakt.
[1:20] Want zijn onzichtbare deugden, te weten: zijn eeuwige kracht en godheid, worden van de schepping der wereld af door zijn werken bekend en gezien; zoodat zij niet onschuldig zijn,
[1:21] omdat zij, God kennende, Hem niet als God hebben de glorie gegeven of gedankt; maar zij zijn verdoold in hun redeneeringen en hun onverstandig hart is verduisterd;
[1:22] zich uitgevende voor verstandigen zijn zij onverstandigen geworden;
[1:23] en zij hebben de glorie van den onverderfelijken God verwisseld met de gelijkenis van het beeld van een verderfelijken mensch, en van vliegende en van viervoetige en van kruipende dieren.
[1:24] Daarom heeft God hen overgegeven in de lusten hunner harten, tot onreinheid, om hun lichamen onder elkander te onteeren;
[1:25] die de waarheid Gods hebben verwisseld met den leugen, en het schepsel hebben vereerd en gediend boven den Schepper, die is te prijzen tot in eeuwigheid, Amen.
[1:26] Daarom heeft God hen overgegeven tot schandelijke lusten. Want zelfs hun vrouwen hebben de natuurlijke gewoonte verwisseld met een tegennatuurlijke.
[1:27] Evenzoo ook de mannen, loslatende de natuurlijke gewoonte der vrouw, zijn in hun lust ontstoken jegens elkander, daar mannen onder mannen schandelijkheid bedrijven en de verdiende vergelding hunner doling in zich zelven ontvangen.
[1:28] En evenals zij niet verkozen hebben om God in erkentenis te houden, zoo heeft God hen overgegeven tot een verdorven zin om onbetamelijke dingen te doen.
[1:29] Hen die vol zijn van alle onrechtvaardigheid, slechtigheid, snoodheid, gierigheid, vol van nijdigheid, moorddadigheid, twist, bedrog, kwaadaardigheid,
[1:30] oorblazers, kwaadsprekers, godslasteraars, snoevers, grootsprekers, opgeblazenen, uitvinders van kwade dingen, den ouders ongehoorzamen,
[1:31] onverstandigen, trouweloozen, zonder liefde, onbarmhartigen,
[1:32] die, — ofschoon zij Gods oordeel kennen, dat die zulke dingen doen doodschuldig zijn, — niet alleen die dingen doen, maar zelfs hun goedkeuring geven aan die ze doen.  
[2:1] Daarom gij, o mensch die oordeelt! gij zijt niet onschuldig. Want waarin gij een ander oordeelt veroordeelt gij u zelven; want al oordeelende doet gij dezelfde dingen.
[2:2] Want wij weten dat Gods oordeel waarachtig is over degenen die zulke dingen doen.
[2:3] Maar meent gij dan, o mensch die oordeelt degenen die zulke dingen doen, terwijl gij ze zelf doet, dat gij Gods oordeel zult ontgaan?
[2:4] Of veracht gij den rijkdom zijner goedertierenheid en verdraagzaamheid en lankmoedigheid, terwijl gij niet weet dat de goedheid Gods u leidt tot boetvaardigheid?
[2:5] Doch naar uw hardnekkigheid en onboetvaardigheid vergadert gij u zelven een schat van gramschap ten dage der gramschap en der openbaring van Gods rechtvaardig oordeel,
[2:6] die een ieder zal vergelden naar zijn werken;
[2:7] namelijk eeuwig leven aan degenen die, met volharding in goeddoen, naar glorie en eer en onverderfelijkheid zoeken;
[2:8] maar gramschap en bitterheid aan degenen die twistgierig zijn en die aan de waarheid ongehoorzaam doch aan de onrechtvaardigheid gehoorzaam zijn.
[2:9] Verdrukking en benauwdheid over alle ziel des mensch en die het kwade doet, eerst van den Jood en ook van den Griek;
[2:10] maar glorie en eer en vrede over elk die het goede doet, eerst den Jood en ook den Griek. 
[2:11]  Want er is geen aanzien des persoons bij God.
[2:12] Want zoo velen als er zonder wet gezondigd hebben zullen ook zonder wet verloren gaan, en zoovelen als er onder de wet gezondigd hebben zullen door de wet geoordeeld worden;
[2:13] — want niet de hoorders van de wet zijn rechtvaardig bij God, maar de daders der wet zullen gerechtvaardigd worden.
[2:14] Want als volken die geen wet hebben van nature de dingen der wet doen, dan zijn dezen die geen wet hebben zich zelven tot wet,
[2:15] die toonen dat het werk der wet in hun harten is geschreven, terwijl hun konsciëntie mede getuigenis geeft en hun onderlinge redeneeringen hen beschuldigen of ook vrijspreken,
[2:16] in den dag dat God de geheime dingen der menschen zal oordeelen naar mijn Evangelie, door Jezus Christus. 
[2:17]  Indien gij dan nu den naam draagt van Jood, en steunt op de wet, en roemt in God,
[2:18] en kent zijn wil, en goedkeurt wat nuttig is, omdat gij onderwezen zijt uit de wet,
[2:19] en u zelven aanziet voor leidsman van blinden, een licht voor die in duisternis zijn,
[2:20] een opvoeder van onwetenden, een leermeester van kinderen, omdat gij in de wet den regel der kennis hebt en der waarheid,
[2:21] — gij dan die een ander onderwijs geeft, onderwijst gij u zelven niet? die predikt dat men niet stelen mag, steelt gij?
[2:22] die zegt dat men geen overspel mag doen, doet gij overspel? die de afgoden verfoeit, pleegt gij tempelroof?
[2:23] Gij die in de wet roemt, onteert gij God door de overtreding der wet?
[2:24] Want Gods Naam wordt om uwentwille gelasterd onder de volken, zooals er geschreven is.
[2:25] Want de besnijdenis is wel nuttig als gij de wet doet, maar als gij een overtreder der wet zijt dan is uw besnijdenis tot onbesnedenheid geworden.
[2:26] Wanneer dan de onbesnedene de inzettingen der wet bewaart, zal dan niet zijn onbesnedenheid tot besnijdenis gerekend worden?
[2:27] en zal de van nature onbesnedene, die de wet volbrengt, u niet oordeelen die, al hebt gij letter en besnijdenis, nochtans de wet overtreedt?
[2:28] Want niet hij is Jood die dit voor het uitwendige is, en niet dat is besnijdenis die uitwendig, in het vleesch is;
[2:29] maar Jood is hij die dat in het binnenste is, en besnijdenis is die des harten, in den geest, niet naar de letter. Diens roem is niet uit menschen maar uit God.  
[3:1] Wat is dan het voorrecht van den Jood, of wat is het profijt der besnijdenis?
[3:2] Veel, in alle manieren. Want in de eerste plaats zijn de uitspraken Gods hun toevertrouwd.
[3:3] Hoe toch? — Al zijn sommigen ontrouw geweest? Hun ontrouw zal toch Gods getrouwheid niet vernietigen?
[3:4] In het geheel niet! — Doch God zij waarachtig en elk mensch leugenachtig, zooals er geschreven is: opdat Gij wordt rechtvaardig bevonden in uw woorden, en overwint als Gij geoordeeld wordt.
[3:5] Maar als nu onze onrechtvaardigheid Gods rechtvaardigheid bewijst, wat zullen wij zeggen? Is God onrechtvaardig als Hij zijn gramschap laat gelden? — naar den mensch spreek ik.
[3:6] In het geheel niet! Hoe zou God anders de wereld oordeelen?
[3:7] Maar als de waarheid Gods door mijn leugen overvloedig is geworden tot zijn glorie, wat word ik dan nog als zondaar geoordeeld?
[3:8] En waarom zullen wij niet het kwade doen opdat daaruit het goede zou voortkomen? — zooals sommigen lasteren en zeggen dat wij leeren— wier veroordeeling rechtvaardig is. 
[3:9]  Wat dan? Hebben wij iets vooruit bij de andere volken? — In het geheel niet! want wij hebben vooraf Joden en Grieken beschuldigd dat zij allen onder de zonde zijn,
[3:10] zooals er geschreven is: er is geen rechtvaardige, niet één;
[3:11] er is geen verstandige; er is geen die God zoekt;
[3:12] allen zijn afgeweken; samen zijn zij onnuttig geworden; er is geen die goed doet; zelfs niet één;
[3:13] hun keel is een open graf: met hun tongen handelen zij bedriegelijk; slangenvergif is onder hun lippen;
[3:14] hun mond is vol van vloek en bitterheid;
[3:15] snel zijn hun voeten om bloed te vergieten;
[3:16] verwoesting en ellende is in hun wegen,
[3:17] en den weg des vredes kennen zij niet;
[3:18] er is geen vreeze Gods voor hun oogen. 
[3:19]  Wij weten nu dat de wet alles wat zij zegt, tot degenen spreekt die onder de wet zijn, opdat alle mond gestopt en de gansche wereld voor God strafschuldig zij.
[3:20] Daarom zal uit werken der wet geen mensch voor Hem worden gerechtvaardigd, want door de wet is er kennis van zonde.
[3:21] Maar nu is Gods rechtvaardigheid zonder wet geopenbaard, die getuigenis heeft van de wet en de profeten,
[3:22] en dat wel een rechtvaardigheid Gods door het geloof van Jezus Christus, tot allen die gelooven; want er is geen onderscheid.
[3:23] Want allen hebben gezondigd en missen Gods glorie,
[3:24] terwijl zij worden gerechtvaardigd om niet, uit zijn genade, door de verlossing die in Christus Jezus is,
[3:25] dien God heeft voorbestemd tot een verzoening in zijn bloed, door het geloof, tot betooning van zijn rechtvaardigheid, door het voorbijzien der zonden die onder de verdraagzaamheid Gods vroeger geschied zijn;
[3:26] tot betooning zijner rechtvaardigheid in dezen tegenwoordigen tijd, opdat Hij rechtvaardig zij en de rechtvaardigmaker van hem die uit het geloof van Jezus is. 
[3:27]  Waar is dan de roem? — Die is uitgesloten. — Door welke wet? — Van de werken? — Neen, maar door een wet des geloofs.
[3:28] Want wij besluiten dat een mensch door het geloof wordt gerechtvaardigd, zonder werken der wet.
[3:29] Of is God alleen de God van de Joden, en ook niet van de volken? — Ja, ook van de volken;
[3:30] indien er althans maar één God is, die de besnijdenis zal rechtvaardigen uit het geloof en de onbesnedenheid door het geloof.
[3:31] Vernietigen wij dan de wet door het geloof? — In het geheel niet, maar wij bevestigen de wet.  
[4:1] Wat dan zullen we zeggen dat Abraham, onze voorvader naar het vleesch, heeft gevonden?
[4:2] Want als Abraham uit werken gerechtvaardigd is dan heeft hij roem, maar niet bij God.
[4:3] Wat toch zegt de Schrifture? — En Abraham geloofde in God, en dat is hem gerekend tot rechtvaardigheid.
[4:4] Nu wordt aan hem die werkt het loon niet toegerekend naar genade, maar naar schuld;
[4:5] doch aan hem die niet werkt, maar gelooft in Hem die den goddelooze rechtvaardigt, wordt het geloof tot rechtvaardigheid gerekend;
[4:6] zooals ook David de zaligheid uitspreekt van den mensch aan wien God de rechtvaardigheid zonder de werken toerekent:
[4:7] Zalig zij wier onrechtvaardigheden vergeven en wier zonden bedekt zijn;
[4:8] zalig de man wiens zonde de Heere niet toerekent!
[4:9] Die zaligspreking dan, is die over de besnijdenis of ook over de onbesnedenheid? Want wij zeggen dat aan Abraham het geloof is toegerekend tot rechtvaardigheid.
[4:10] Hoe is die dan toegerekend? Toen hij besneden was, of onbesneden was? — Niet toen hij besneden, maar toen hij onbesneden was;
[4:11] en het teeken der besnijdenis heeft hij ontvangen als zegel van de rechtvaardigheid des geloofs, die hij had toen hij onbesneden was, opdat hij een vader zou zijn van allen die gelooven, ofschoon zij onbesneden zijn, opdat het hun tot rechtvaardigheid gerekend worde,
[4:12] en een vader der besnijdenis voor hen, die niet alleen uit de besnijdenis zijn, maar die ook wandelen in de voetstappen des geloofs van onzen vader Abraham dat hij had toen hij onbesneden was.
[4:13] Want niet door een wet kwam de belofte tot Abraham of tot zijn nakomelingschap, dat hij erfgenaam der wereld zou zijn, maar door de rechtvaardigheid des geloofs.
[4:14] Want als zij die uit de wet zijn erfgenamen zijn, dan is het geloof tevergeefs en de belofte is krachteloos.
[4:15] Want de wet brengt gramschap voort. Waar toch geen wet is, is ook geen overtreding.
[4:16] Daarom is het uit geloof, opdat het naar genade zij, ten einde de belofte vast zij voor de geheele nakomelingschap, niet alleen die uit de wet is, maar ook die uit het geloof van Abraham is, die een vader is van ons allen;
[4:17] — gelijk geschreven is: Ik heb u gesteld tot een vader van vele volken; — voor Hem in wien hij geloofde, God die de dooden levend maakt en roept de dingen die niet zijn als of ze waren.
[4:18] Deze heeft geloofd tegen hope op hope dat hij zou worden een vader van vele volken, naar hetgeen gezegd was: Alzoo zal uw nakomelingschap zijn;
[4:19] en zonder te verzwakken in het geloof lette hij op zijn eigen lichaam dat afgeleefd was, daar hij honderd jaar oud was, en op Sara die boven de jaren der vruchtbaarheid was;
[4:20] doch hij twijfelde niet aan Gods belofte door ongeloof, maar hij werd versterkt in het geloof, terwijl hij aan God de glorie gaf,
[4:21] en ten volle overtuigd was dat Hij die beloofd heeft ook machtig is om te volbrengen.
[4:22] Daarom ook is het hem tot rechtvaardigheid gerekend.
[4:23] Doch het is niet alleen om zijnentwille beschreven dat het hem is toegerekend,
[4:24] maar ook om onzentwille, aan wie het zal toegerekend worden, die gelooven in Hem die Jezus onzen Heere uit de dooden heeft opgewekt;
[4:25] die is overgeleverd om onze overtredingen en opgewekt om onze rechtvaardigmaking.  
[5:1] Aangezien wij dan gerechtvaardigd zijn uit het geloof, zoo laat ons vrede hebben bij God, door onzen Heere Jezus Christus;
[5:2] door wien wij ook den toegang hebben verkregen door het geloof tot deze genade waarin wij staan; en laat ons roemen op hope der glorie van God.
[5:3] En dat niet alleen, maar laat ons ook roemen in de verdrukkingen, daar wij weten dat de verdrukking volharding werkt,
[5:4] en de volharding beproefdheid, en de beproefdheid hope;
[5:5] en de hope beschaamt niet, omdat de liefde Gods in onze harten is uitgestort door den Heiligen Geest die ons is gegeven.
[5:6] Want Christus, toen wij nog zwak waren, is ter rechtertijd voor de goddeloozen gestorven.
[5:7] Nauwelijks toch zal iemand voor een rechtvaardige sterven; want voor den goede zal misschien iemand ondernemen te sterven.
[5:8] Doch hierin bevestigt God zijn liefde jegens ons, dat Christus voor ons is gestorven toen wij nog zondaars waren.
[5:9] Veelmeer dan, nu in zijn bloed gerechtvaardigd, zullen wij door Hem behouden worden van de gramschap.
[5:10] Want indien wij, toen wij vijanden waren, met God zijn verzoend door den dood zijns Zoons, dan zullen wij veelmeer, nu wij verzoend zijn, behouden worden in zijn leven.
[5:11] En dit niet alleen, maar wij zijn ook roemende in God door onzen Heere Jezus Christus, door wien wij nu de verzoening bekomen hebben. 
[5:12]  Daarom, gelijk door één mensch de zonde tot de wereld is ingekomen, en door de zonde de dood, en alzoo tot alle menschen de dood is doorgegaan, omdat allen gezondigd hebben …
[5:13] want tot op de wet was er wel zonde in de wereld, maar zonde wordt niet toegerekend als er geen wet is.
[5:14] Toch heeft de dood geheerscht van Adam tot op Mozes, zelfs over hen die niet hadden gezondigd naar de gelijkheid der overtreding van Adam, die een type is van Hem die komen zou.
[5:15] Maar niet zooals de overtreding, is ook de gifte der genade; want indien door de overtreding van dien éénen die velen gestorven zijn, dan is de genade Gods en de gifte in genade van den éénen mensch Jezus Christus veel meer overvloedig geworden over die velen.
[5:16] En de gifte is niet zóó als door éénen die gezondigd heeft; want het oordeel is uit één tot veroordeeling, maar de gifte der genade is uit vele overtredingen tot rechtvaardigheid.
[5:17] Want indien door de overtreding van dien éénen de dood geheerscht heeft door dien éénen, dan zullen veelmeer zij, die den overvloed der genade en van de gifte der rechtvaardigheid ontvangen, in het leven heerschen door dien éénen, Jezus Christus.
[5:18] Derhalve dan, gelijk het door één overtreding over alle menschen tot veroordeeling is, zoo is het ook door één rechtvaardigheid over alle menschen tot rechtvaardigmaking des levens.
[5:19] Want gelijk door de ongehoorzaamheid van dien éénen mensch die velen tot zondaars zijn gesteld, zoo ook zijn door de gehoorzaamheid van dien éénen die velen tot rechtvaardigen gesteld.
[5:20] En de wet is er nog bijgekomen, opdat de overtreding zou vermeerderen. Doch waar de zonde vermeerderde, is de genade meer overvloedig geworden,
[5:21] opdat zooals de zonde heerschte in den dood, alzoo ook de genade heerschen zou door rechtvaardigheid tot eeuwig leven, door Jezus Christus onzen Heere.  
[6:1] Wat zullen wij dan zeggen? — Zullen wij in de zonde blijven, opdat de genade meerder worde?
[6:2] In het geheel niet! Wij die der zonde zijn gestorven, hoe zullen wij nog in haar leven?
[6:3] Of weet gij niet dat wij allen die gedoopt zijn in Christus Jezus, in zijn dood zijn gedoopt?
[6:4] Wij zijn dan met Hem begraven door het doopsel in den dood, opdat, evenals Christus is opgewekt uit de dooden door de glorie des Vaders, wij ook alzoo in nieuwheid des levens zouden wandelen;
[6:5] want indien wij met Hem één zijn geworden in de gelijkheid van zijn dood, dan zullen wij het ook zijn in die zijner verrijzenis,
[6:6] omdat wij weten dat onze oude mensch mede gekruisigd is, opdat het lichaam der zonde machteloos worde, om ons niet meer de zonde te doen dienen;
[6:7] want die gestorven is, die is vrijgemaakt van de zonde.
[6:8] Doch indien wij nu met Christus gestorven zijn, dan gelooven wij dat wij ook met Hem zullen leven,
[6:9] omdat wij weten dat Christus, die uit de dooden is opgewekt, niet meer sterft; de dood heerscht over Hem niet meer;
[6:10] want wat Hij gestorven is, dat is Hij eens voor altijd der zonde gestorven, maar wat Hij leeft, dat leeft Hij Gode.
[6:11] Alzoo ook gijlieden, rekent u zelven dood te zijn voor de zonde, maar levende voor God in Christus Jezus. 
[6:12]  Dat dan de zonde niet heersche in uw sterfelijk lichaam, om te gehoorzamen aan zijn lusten,
[6:13] en stelt uw leden niet tot wapens der onrechtvaardigheid voor de zonde, maar stelt u zelven Gode als levenden uit de dooden, en uw leden tot wapens der rechtvaardigheid voor God;
[6:14] want de zonde zal over u niet heerschen omdat gij niet zijt onder een wet maar onder genade. 
[6:15]  Wat dan? — Zullen wij zondigen, omdat wij niet onder een wet zijn, maar onder genade? — In het geheel niet!
[6:16] Weet gij niet dat, wien gij u zelven stelt tot dienaren ter gehoorzaamheid, gij dienaars zijt desgenen dien gij gehoorzaamt, of van de zonde tot den dood, of van de gehoorzaamheid tot rechtvaardigheid?
[6:17] Maar Gode zij dank dat gij wel dienaars der zonde geweest zijt, maar nu van harte zijt gehoorzaam geworden naar hetgeen u als voorbeeld der leering is overgeleverd,
[6:18] en dat gij, vrijgemaakt zijnde van de zonde, aan de rechtvaardigheid dienstbaar zijt geworden.
[6:19] Op menschelijke wijze spreek ik, om de zwakheid uws vleesches. Want zooals gij uw leden dienstbaar hadt gesteld aan de onreinheid en aan de onrechtvaardigheid tot onrechtvaardigheid, al zoo stelt gij nu uw leden dienstbaar aan de rechtvaardigheid tot heiligmaking.
[6:20] Want toen gij dienaars waart van de zonde, waart gij vrij ten aanzien van de rechtvaardigheid.
[6:21] Want welke vrucht hadt gij toen? — Een vrucht waarover gij nu beschaamd zijt, want het einde van die dingen is de dood.
[6:22] Maar nu vrijgemaakt zijnde van de zonde en Gode dienstbaar geworden, hebt gij uw vrucht tot heiligmaking en het einde is het eeuwige leven;
[6:23] want het loon der zonde is de dood, maar de gifte van Gods genade is het eeuwig leven in Christus Jezus onzen Heere.  
[7:1] Of weet gij niet, broeders! — want ik spreek tot menschen die de wet kennen, — dat de wet heerscht over den mensch, zoolang hij leeft?
[7:2] Want de getrouwde vrouw is door de wet aan den levenden man verbonden. Maar als de man is gestorven dan is zij ontslagen van de wet des mans.
[7:3] Derhalve zal zij een echtbreekster genoemd worden, als zij aan een anderen man wordt verbonden terwijl haar man leeft; maar als de man gestorven is, dan is zij vrij van de wet, zoodat zij geen echtbreekster is als zij aan een anderen man wordt verbonden.
[7:4] Alzoo, mijn broeders! zijt gij ook gedood met betrekking tot de wet, door het lichaam van Christus, opdat gij zoudt verbonden worden aan een ander, die uit de dooden is opgewekt, opdat wij Gode vrucht dragen zouden.
[7:5] Want toen wij in het vleesch waren, werkten de lusten der zonden, die door de wet zijn, in onze leden om den dood vrucht te dragen;
[7:6] maar nu zijn wij ontslagen van de wet, omdat wij gestorven zijn aan datgene waarin wij gebonden waren, zoodat wij dienen in nieuwheid des geestes en niet in oudheid der letter. 
[7:7]  Wat zullen wij dan zeggen? — Is de wet zonde? — In het geheel niet! — Maar ik kende de zonde niet dan door de wet. Want ik had ook van de begeerlijkheid niet geweten, als de wet niet zeide: gij zult niet begeeren!
[7:8] Maar door het gebod aanleiding nemende, heeft de zonde in mij alle begeerlijkheid gewerkt; want zonder wet is de zonde dood.
[7:9] En ik leefde vroeger zonder wet; maar toen het gebod is gekomen is de zonde levend geworden,
[7:10] doch ik ben gestorven, en het gebod dat ten leven is, dat is voor mij ten doode bevonden.
[7:11] Want de zonde, die door het gebod aanleiding nam, heeft mij verleid en er mij door gedood.
[7:12] Zoo dan, de wet is heilig en het gebod is heilig, en rechtvaardig en goed.
[7:13] Het goede dan, is mij dat ten doode geworden? — In het geheel niet, maar wel de zonde; opdat zij als zonde zou openbaar worden, als die door het goede mij den dood werkt; opdat de zonde bovenmatig zondig zou worden door het gebod.
[7:14] Want wij weten dat de wet geestelijk is, doch ik ben vleeschelijk, onder de zonde verkocht.
[7:15] Want wat ik doe ken ik niet; want wat ik wil dat doe ik niet, maar wat ik haat dat doe ik.
[7:16] Als ik nu datgene doe wat ik niet wil, dan stem ik de wet toe dat zij goed is.
[7:17] Doch nu ben ik het niet meer die het doe, maar de zonde die in mij woont.
[7:18] Want ik weet dat in mij, dat is in mijn vleesch, geen goed woont; want het willen ligt mij wel bij, maar het goeddoen niet.
[7:19] Want wat ik wil, het goede, dat doe ik niet; maar wat ik niet wil, het kwade, dat doe ik.
[7:20] Indien ik nu doe datgene wat ik niet wil, dan ben ik het niet meer die het doe, maar de zonde die in mij woont.
[7:21] Ik vind dus deze wet, dat aan mij, die het goede wil doen, het kwade bijligt.
[7:22] Want ik verlustig mij in de wet Gods naar den inwendigen mensch.
[7:23] Maar ik zie een andere wet in mijn leden die strijd voert tegen de wet van mijn gemoed en die mij gevangen neemt in de wet der zonde die in mijn leden is.
[7:24] Ellendig mensch als ik ben! wie zal mij verlossen uit het lichaam van dezen dood?
[7:25] Gode zij dank door Jezus Christus, onzen Heere!Zoo dan, ik zelf ben naar het gemoed wel dienstbaar aan de wet Gods, maar naar het vleesch aan de wet der zonde.  
[8:1] Zoo is er dan nu geen veroordeeling voor hen die in Christus Jezus zijn, die niet wandelen naar het vleesch, maar naar den geest.
[8:2] Want de wet des Geestes des levens in Christus Jezus heeft mij vrijgemaakt van de wet der zonde en des doods.
[8:3] Want hetgeen voor de wet onmogelijk was, omdat zij door het vleesch zwak was, heeft God gedaan door zijn Zoon te zenden in gelijkheid aan het vleesch der zonde, en dat voor de zonde; namelijk, Hij heeft de zonde in het vleesch veroordeeld,
[8:4] opdat de eisch der wet zou vervuld worden in ons die niet wandelen naar het vleesch maar naar den geest.
[8:5] Want die naar het vleesch zijn bedenken de dingen des vleesches, maar die naar den geest zijn de dingen des geestes.
[8:6] Want het bedenken des vleesches is de dood, maar het bedenken des geestes is leven en vrede,
[8:7] omdat het bedenken des vleesches vijandschap is tegen God, want aan Gods wet onderwerpt het zich niet; ja, het kan ook niet;
[8:8] en zij die in het vleesch zijn, kunnen Gode niet behagen.
[8:9] Doch gijlieden zijt niet in het vleesch maar in den geest, indien namelijk de Geest Gods in ulieden woont. Maar als iemand den Geest van Christus niet heeft, die is de zijne niet.
[8:10] Maar als Christus in ulieden is, dan is wel het lichaam dood vanwege de zonde, maar de geest is leven vanwege de rechtvaardigheid.
[8:11] En indien de Geest in ulieden woont van Hem die Jezus uit de dooden verwekt heeft, dan zal Hij die Christus Jezus uit de dooden verwekt heeft ook uw sterfelijke lichamen levend maken door zijn in u wonenden Geest. 
[8:12]  Zoo dan, broeders! wij zijn niet schuldig aan het vleesch om naar het vleesch te leven;
[8:13] want als gij naar het vleesch leeft dan moet gij sterven, maar als gij door den geest de werkingen des lichaams doodt, dan zult gij leven;
[8:14] want zoovelen als door den Geest van God geleid worden, die zijn zonen Gods.
[8:15] Want gij hebt niet ontvangen een geest der dienstbaarheid wederom tot vreeze maar gij hebt ontvangen een Geest van het zoonschap waarin wij roepen: Abba, Vader!
[8:16] Die zelfde Geest getuigt met onzen geest dat wij kinderen Gods zijn;
[8:17] en indien kinderen, dan ook erfgenamen, zoowel erfgenamen van God als medeerfgenamen van Christus, indien wij althans mede lijden, opdat wij ook mede de glorie ontvangen. 
[8:18]  Want ik reken dat de smarten van den tegenwoordigen tijd niet te vergelijken zijn met de glorie die over ons zal geopenbaard worden.
[8:19] Want het reikhalzend verlangen der schepping verwacht de openbaarwording der zonen Gods.
[8:20] Want de schepping is aan de vergankelijkheid onderworpen, niet vrijwillig, maar door dengene die haar onderworpen heeft;
[8:21] op hope dat ook de schepping zelve zal worden vrijgemaakt van de dienstbaarheid des verderfs tot de vrijheid der glorie der kinderen Gods.
[8:22] Want wij weten dat geheel de schepping tot nu toe mede zucht en mede in barensweeën is.
[8:23] En dat niet alleen, maar zelfs wij die de eerstelingvrucht des Geestes hebben, ook wij zuchten in ons zelven, wachtende op het zoonschap, de losmaking van ons lichaam.
[8:24] In hope toch zijn wij behouden; maar een hope die gezien wordt is geen hope, want als iemand iets ziet, wat hoopt hij dan?
[8:25] maar als wij hopen op hetgeen wij niet zien, dan verwachten wij het met volharding. 
[8:26]  En desgelijks komt ook de Geest mede te hulp aan onze zwakheid; want wat wij bidden zullen zooals het zijn moet, weten wij niet, maar de Geest zelf treedt voor ons in met onuitsprekelijke verzuchtingen;
[8:27] en Hij die de harten doorzoekt weet wat de meening des Geestes is, omdat Hij naar den wil van God intreedt voor de heiligen.
[8:28] Want wij weten dat dengenen die God beminnen alles ten goede medewerkt, hun die naar zijn voornemen geroepen zijn;
[8:29] want die Hij te voren gekend heeft die heeft Hij ook te voren verordend tot gelijkvormigen aan het beeld van zijn Zoon, opdat deze zou zijn de Eerstgeborene onder veel broederen;
[8:30] en die Hij te voren verordend heeft die heeft Hij ook geroepen, en die Hij geroepen heeft die heeft Hij ook gerechtvaardigd, en die Hij gerechtvaardigd heeft die heeft Hij ook de glorie gegeven. 
[8:31]  Wat zullen we dan hierop zeggen? — Als God vóór ons is, wie is dan tegen ons?
[8:32] Hij toch, die zijn eigen Zoon niet gespaard heeft, maar dien voor ons allen heeft overgegeven, hoe? zal Hij ons met Hem niet alles schenken?
[8:33] Wie zal als beschuldiger optreden tegen Gods uitverkorenen? — God, die rechtvaardig maakt?
[8:34] Wie is het die veroordeelt? — Christus Jezus, die is gestorven, ja die zelfs is verrezen, die is aan Gods rechterhand, die zelfs voor ons intreedt?
[8:35] Wie zal ons scheiden van de liefde van Christus? Verdrukking, of benauwdheid, of vervolging, of honger, of naaktheid, of gevaar, of zwaard?
[8:36] Zooals er geschreven is: Om Uwentwil worden wij den ganschen dag gedood; wij zijn gerekend als schapen voor de slachtbank.
[8:37] Maar in dit alles zijn wij meer dan overwinnaars door Hem die ons bemind heeft.
[8:38] Want ik ben verzekerd dat geen dood of leven, geen engelen of overheden, geen tegenwoordige of toekomende dingen, geen machten,
[8:39] geen hoogte of diepte, noch eenig ander schepsel, ons zal kunnen scheiden van de liefde Gods, die is in Christus Jezus, onzen Heere.  
[9:1] Ik spreek de waarheid in Christus, ik lieg niet, terwijl mijn konsciëntie mede getuigenis geeft in den Heiligen Geest,
[9:2] dat ik een groote droefheid heb en een voortdurende smart aan mijn harte.
[9:3] Want ik zou wenschen zelf een vervloeking te zijn van Christus, ten behoeve van mijn broederen die naar het vleesch mijn volk zijn,
[9:4] die Israelieten zijn, van wie het zoonschap is, en de glorie, en de verbonden, en de wetgeving, en de eeredienst, en de beloften, 
[9:5]  Van wie de vaderen zijn, en uit wie de Christus is, wat het vleesch betreft, die God is boven allen, geprezen tot in eeuwigheid. Amen. 
[9:6]  Doch niet zoo, alsof Gods woord is vervallen; want niet allen zijn Israël die uit Israël zijn.
[9:7] Ook zijn zij niet allen kinderen omdat zij Abrahams nakomelingen zijn, maar: in Isaäk zal uw nakomelingschap genoemd worden;
[9:8] dat is: het zijn niet de kinderen des vleesches die kinderen Gods zijn, maar de kinderen der belofte worden gerekend als nakomelingschap.
[9:9] Want het woord der belofte is dit: Omtrent dezen tijd zal Ik komen en Sara zal een zoon hebben.
[9:10] En dit niet alleen, maar ook Rebekka, die zwanger was uit één, uit Isaäk onzen vader.
[9:11] Want toen de kinderen nog niet geboren waren, noch eenig goed of kwaad gedaan hadden— opdat Gods voornemen naar de verkiezing vast bleve, niet uit werken maar uit Hem die roept—
[9:12] toen werd tot haar gezegd: De oudere zal den jongere dienen,
[9:13] zooals er geschreven is: Jakob heb Ik bemind, doch Esau gehaat. 
[9:14]  Wat zullen wij dan zeggen? Er is toch geen onrechtvaardigheid bij God? In het geheel niet!
[9:15] Want tot Mozes zegt Hij: Ik zal Mij ontfermen over wien Ik Mij ontferm, en Ik zal medelijden hebben over wien Ik medelijden heb.
[9:16] Zoo dan, het is niet van hem die wil of van hem die loopt, maar van den ontfermenden God.
[9:17] Want de Schrifture zegt tot Farao: Tot dit einde heb Ik u verwekt, opdat Ik in u mijn kracht zou betoonen, en opdat mijn Naam zou bekend worden over de gansche aarde.
[9:18] Zoo ontfermt Hij zich dan over wien Hij wil, en Hij verhardt dien Hij wil. 
[9:19]  Gij zult dan tot mij zeggen: Wat heeft Hij dan nog te verwijten? wie toch heeft zijn wil tegengestaan?
[9:20] O mensch, wie zijt gij toch, die tegen God het woord opneemt? Zal dan het maaksel tot den maker zeggen: Waarom hebt gij mij alzoo gemaakt?
[9:21] Of heeft de pottebakker geen macht over de klei, om uit denzelfden klomp te maken een vat tot eer en een ander tot oneer?
[9:22] Indien nu God, zijn gramschap willende betoonen en zijn macht bewijzen, in vele lankmoedigheid heeft verdragen de vaten der gramschap die tot het verderf zijn toebereid,
[9:23] en opdat Hij zou bekend maken den rijkdom zijner glorie jegens de vaten der barmhartigheid, die voorbereid zijn tot glorie?
[9:24] En als dezulken heeft Hij ook ons geroepen, niet alleen uit de Joden maar ook uit de volken,
[9:25] zooals Hij ook in Hosea zegt: Ik zal het volk, dat het mijne niet was, als mijn volk roepen, en die mijn beminde niet was, als mijn beminde;
[9:26] en het zal zijn in de plaats waar tot hen gezegd werd: Gij zijt mijn volk niet! daar zullen zij zonen van den levenden God genoemd worden.
[9:27] En Jesaja roept uit over Israël: Al was het getal der zonen Israëls als het zand der zee, alleen het overblijfsel zal worden behouden.
[9:28] Want de Heere zal zijn woord op aarde volbrengen en verhaast dat in rechtvaardigheid, dat voleindigende en verhaastende.
[9:29] En zooals Jesaja vroeger gezegd had: Indien niet de Heere der legermachten ons een zaad had overgelaten, dan zouden wij als Sodom zijn geworden, en aan Gomorra zijn gelijk gemaakt. 
[9:30]  Wat zullen wij dan zeggen? — Dat de volken die de rechtvaardigheid niet zochten de rechtvaardigheid verkregen hebben; maar een rechtvaardigheid die uit het geloof is;
[9:31] doch Israël, dat een wet der rechtvaardigheid zocht, is niet gekomen tot die wet.
[9:32] Waarom? — Omdat het die zocht niet uit geloof maar als uit werken. Zij hebben gestooten aan den steen des aanstoots,
[9:33] zooals er geschreven is: Zie, Ik leg in Sion een steen des aanstoots en een rots der ergernis, en die op Hem vertrouwt zal niet beschaamd worden.  
[10:1] Broeders! de begeerte mijns harten voor Israël en mijn gebed tot God is voor hen tot behoudenis;
[10:2] want ik betuig hun dat zij ijver voor God hebben, maar niet met verstand.
[10:3] Want Gods rechtvaardigheid niet kennende en zoekende hun eigen rechtvaardigheid te doen gelden, onderwerpen zij zich niet aan de rechtvaardigheid Gods,
[10:4] want het einde der wet is Christus tot rechtvaardigheid voor al wie gelooft.
[10:5] Mozes toch schrijft dat de mensch, die de rechtvaardigheid doet die uit de wet is, in haar leven zal.
[10:6] Maar de rechtvaardigheid uit het geloof spreekt alzoo: Zeg niet in uw harte: wie zal opklimmen naar den hemel? dat is, om Christus af te brengen;
[10:7] of: wie zal afdalen naar den afgrond? dat is, om Christus uit de dooden op te brengen.
[10:8] Maar wat zegt zij? Nabij u is het woord, in uw mond en in uw hart. Dat is het woord des geloofs dat wij prediken.
[10:9] Indien gij namelijk met uw mond Jezus als Heer zult belijden, en in uw harte gelooven dat God Hem heeft opgewekt uit de dooden, dan zult gij worden behouden.
[10:10] Want met het harte gelooft men tot rechtvaardigheid en met den mond belijdt men tot behoudenis.
[10:11] Want de Schrifture zegt: Al wie op Hem vertrouwt zal niet worden beschaamd.
[10:12] Want er is geen onderscheid van Jood noch Griek, want dezelfde is Heer van allen, die rijk is over allen die Hem aanroepen.
[10:13] Want al wie den Naam des Heeren zal aanroepen zal behouden worden.
[10:14] Hoe dan zullen zij aanroepen in wien zij niet geloofd hebben? En hoe zullen zij gelooven wien zij niet gehoord hebben? En hoe zullen zij hooren zonder prediker?
[10:15] En hoe zullen zij prediken als zij niet gezonden zijn? zooals er geschreven is: Hoe liefelijk de voeten van hen die het goede verkondigen!
[10:16] Maar allen zijn aan de goede boodschap niet gehoorzaam geweest. Want Jesaja zegt: Heere, wie heeft geloofd hetgeen hij van ons gehoord heeft?
[10:17] Zoo is dan het geloof uit hetgeen gehoord wordt, en hetgeen gehoord wordt is door het woord van Christus.
[10:18] Maar ik zeg: Hebben zij het in het geheel niet gehoord? Wel zeker! Tot de gansche aarde is hun geluid gekomen en tot de uiterste einden der bewoonde aarde hun woorden.
[10:19] Maar ik zeg: heeft dan Israël het niet geweten? — Het eerst zegt Mozes: Ik zal uw jaloezie opwekken met wat geen volk is; door een onverstandig volk zal ik uw toorn opwekken.
[10:20] En Jesaja verstout zich en zegt: Ik ben gevonden van die Mij niet zochten; Ik ben openbaar geworden aan die niet naar Mij vroegen.
[10:21] Maar tot Israël zegt hij: Den ganschen dag heb Ik mijn handen uitgestrekt tot een ongehoorzaam en tegensprekend volk.  
[11:1] Ik zeg dan: God heeft toch zijn volk niet verstooten? In het geheel niet! want ik ben zelf een Israeliet, uit de nakomelingschap van Abraham, van den stam Benjamin.
[11:2] God heeft zijn volk niet verstooten dat Hij te voren gekend heeft! Of weet gij niet wat de Schrifture zegt, bij Elias, hoe hij bij God tegen Israël optreedt:
[11:3] Heere! uw profeten hebben zij gedood, uw altaren hebben zij omvergeworpen en ik ben alleen overgebleven, en zij zoeken mijn leven.
[11:4] Maar wat zegt Gods antwoord tot hem: Ik heb voor Mij zelven zeven duizend mannen overgehouden, die de knie niet gebogen hebben voor den Baäl.
[11:5] Evenzoo is er dan ook in den tegenwoordigen tijd een overblijfsel naar de verkiezing der genade.
[11:6] En is het door genade, dan is het niet meer uit werken, anders is de genade geen genade meer.
[11:7] Wat dan? Hetgeen Israël zoekt dat heeft het niet bekomen, maar de uitverkorenen hebben het bekomen, doch de overigen zijn verhard,
[11:8] zooals er geschreven is: God heeft hun gegeven een geest van bedwelming; oogen om niet te zien en ooren om niet te hooren, tot, op den dag van heden.
[11:9] En David zegt: Hun tafel worde hun tot een strik en tot een val, en tot een ergernis, en tot een vergelding;
[11:10] laat hun oogen verduisterd worden om niet te zien en verkrom hun rug ten allen tijd. 
[11:11]  Ik zeg dan: Zij hebben toch niet gestruikeld opdat zij vallen zouden? In het geheel niet. Maar door hun overtreding is de behoudenis den volken overkomen, om hen tot jaloezie op te wekken.
[11:12] Indien nu hun overtreding de rijkdom der wereld is, en hun verlies de rijkdom der volken, hoeveel te meer zal het dan hun volheid zijn!
[11:13] Want tot ulieden, o volken! spreek ik. Voor zooveel ik dan de apostel der volken ben maak ik mijn bediening heerlijk;
[11:14] of ik ook mijn volk tot jaloezie mocht bewegen en eenigen uit hen behouden.
[11:15] Want als hun verwerping de verzoening der wereld is, wat zal dan hun aanneming anders zijn dan leven uit de dooden?
[11:16] En als de eerstelingen heilig zijn, dan ook de deesem, en als de wortel heilig is, dan ook de takken.
[11:17] Maar als sommigen van de takken zijn afgebroken, en gij, die een wilde olijfboom zijt, ingeënt zijt in hen, en mede deel gekregen hebt aan den wortel en de vettigheid van den olijfboom,
[11:18] zoo beroemt u dan niet tegen de takken. Maar als gij u zoudt beroemen, gij zijt het niet die den wortel draagt maar de wortel draagt u!
[11:19] Gij zult wellicht zeggen: De takken zijn afgehouwen opdat ik zou worden ingeënt,
[11:20] Het is waar; door ongeloof zijn zij afgehouwen, maar gij staat door het geloof. Zijt niet hoogmoedig, maar vreest.
[11:21] Want als God de natuurlijke takken niet heeft gespaard, dan zal hij ook u niet sparen.
[11:22] Zie dan Gods goedertierenheid en gestrengheid. Over hen die gevallen zijn, gestrengheid; maar over u Gods goedertierenheid, als gij zult blijven in de goedertierenheid; anders zult gij ook worden afgehouwen.
[11:23] Maar ook zij, als zij niet blijven bij het ongeloof, zullen ingeënt worden, want God is machtig om hen weder in te enten.
[11:24] Want als gij zijt afgehouwen van den olijfboom die van nature wild was, en ingeënt tegen nature op den tammen olijfboom, hoeveel te meer zullen zij, die natuurlijke takken zijn, worden ingeënt op hun eigen olijfboom? 
[11:25]  Want ik wil niet, broeders, dat deze verborgenheid u onbekend zij, opdat gij niet wijs zijt bij u zelven: dat er een verharding is over een gedeelte van Israël, totdat de volheid der volken zal zijn ingegaan,
[11:26] en alzoo zal geheel Israël behouden worden, zooals er geschreven is: Uit Sion zal de Verlosser komen; Hij zal de goddeloosheden van Jakob wegdoen,
[11:27] en dit is mijn verbond met hen, wanneer Ik hun zonden zal wegnemen.
[11:28] Wat het Evangelie aangaat zijn zij dus wel vijanden om uwentwil, maar wat de uit verkiezing aangaat zijn ze beminden om der vaderen wil;
[11:29] want onberouwelijk zijn Gods giften der genade en roeping.
[11:30] Want gelijk ook gijlieden vroeger ongehoorzaam aan God zijt geweest, doch nu barmhartigheid hebt ontvangen door hun ongehoorzaamheid,
[11:31] alzoo ook zijn dezen nu ongehoorzaam geworden door de barmhartigheid aan u, opdat ook zij nu barmhartigheid zouden ontvangen.
[11:32] Want God heeft allen besloten tot ongehoorzaamheid opdat Hij allen zou barmhartig zijn. 
[11:33]  O diepte van rijkdom en wijsheid en kennisse Gods! Hoe ondoorzoekelijk zijn toch zijn oordeelen, en ondoorgrondelijk zijn wegen!
[11:34] Wie toch heeft Gods verstand gekend? Of wie is zijn raadgever geweest?
[11:35] Of wie heeft Hem eerst gegeven, zoodat het Hem zal wedergegeven worden?
[11:36] Want uit Hem, en door Hem, en tot Hem zijn alle dingen! Hem de glorie tot in eeuwigheid! Amen.  
[12:1] Ik vermaan u dan, broeders, bij de ontfermingen Gods, om uw lichamen te stellen tot een levende, heilige, Gode welgevallige offerande; dat zal zijn uw redelijke godsdienst.
[12:2] En wordt niet gelijkvormig aan deze eeuw, maar wordt veranderd door de vernieuwing des gemoeds, om te beproeven welke de wil van God zij, wat goed en welgevallig en volmaakt zij. 
[12:3]  Want door de genade die mij gegeven is, zeg ik aan elk die onder u is, om van zich zelven niet méér te denken dan hij moet denken, maar om gering te denken, naar de mate van geloof die God aan ieder gedeeld heeft.
[12:4] Want gelijk wij één lichaam veel leden hebben, maar al die leden niet dezelfde werking hebben,
[12:5] alzoo zijn wij velen één lichaam in Christus, maar elk leden van elkander,
[12:6] daar wij verschillende gaven hebben naar de genade die ons gegeven is: hetzij profetie overeenkomstig het geloof;
[12:7] hetzij bediening, in het bedienen; hetzij die onderwijst, in de onderwijzing;
[12:8] hetzij die vermaant, in de vermaning; die uitdeelt, in oprechtheid; die een bestuurder is, in ijver; die barmhartigheid doet, in blijdschap. 
[12:9]  De liefde zij ongeveinsd. Zijt afkeerig van het kwade; hangt het goede aan.
[12:10] Zijt in de broederliefde jegens elkander liefderijk; gaat elkander voor in eere.
[12:11] Zijt in het beijveren niet traag; zijt vurig naar den geest; dient den Heere.
[12:12] Verblijdt u in de hope; zijt geduldig in de verdrukking; volhardt in het gebed.
[12:13] Draagt bij tot de behoeften der heiligen; begeert naar herbergzaamheid.
[12:14] Zegent degenen die u vervolgen; zegent en vervloekt toch niet!
[12:15] Zijt vroolijk met verheugden; weent met weenenden.
[12:16] Zijt jegens elkander eensgezind; vestigt uw gemoed niet op de hooge dingen, maar daalt af tot de nederige dingen; wordt niet wijs bij u zelven.
[12:17] Vergeldt aan niemand kwaad voor kwaad; bedenkt wat goed is voor alle menschen.
[12:18] Indien mogelijk, zooveel het van u afhangt, zijt in vrede met alle menschen.
[12:19] Wreekt u zelven niet beminden, maar geeft plaats aan den toorn van God, want er is geschreven: Aan Mij wrake, Ik zal vergelden zegt de Heere.
[12:20] Maar als uw vijand honger heeft, geef hem dan te eten, als hij dorst heeft geef hem te drinken; want dit doende zult gij kolen van vuur op zijn hoofd stapelen.
[12:21] Word niet overwonnen van het kwade, maar overwin gij het kwade met het goede.  
[13:1] Alle ziele zij onderdanig aan de over haar gestelde machten, want er is geen macht dan alleen van God, en die er zijn, zijn van God ingesteld.
[13:2] Daarom heeft hij die opstaat tegen de macht, de ordening van God wederstaan, en die ze wederstaan hebben zullen over zich zelven een oordeel brengen.
[13:3] Want de oversten zijn een schrik, niet voor de goede maar voor de kwade handeling. Wilt gij dus geen schrik hebben voor de macht? Doe dan het goede en gij zult haar goedkeuring hebben.
[13:4] Want Gods dienaresse is zij tot uw welzijn. Doch als gij het kwade doet, vrees dan, want zij draagt het zwaard niet tevergeefs; want Gods dienaresse is zij, een wreekster, tot straf van hem die het kwade doet.
[13:5] Dus is het noodig onderdanig te zijn, niet alleen om de straf, maar ook om de konsciëntie
[13:6] Want daarom betaalt gij ook belastingen; want de oversten zijn dienaars van God, die gedurig op deze dingen letten. 
[13:7]  Betaalt aan ieder wat gij schuldig zijt: belasting aan wien gij belasting, impost aan wien gij impost, vreeze aan wien gij vreeze, achting aan wien gij achting schuldig zijt.
[13:8] Zijt aan niemand iets schuldig dan alleen een wederkeerige liefde, want die den ander bemint heeft de wet vervuld.
[13:9] Want deze geboden: Gij zult niet echtbreken, gij zult niet doodslaan, gij zult niet stelen, gij zult geen valsch getuigenis geven, gij zult niet begeeren, en als er nog een ander gebod is, — in dit ééne woord zijn ze saamgevat, namelijk: Gij zult uw naaste beminnen als u zelven.
[13:10] De liefde doet den naaste geen kwaad. Dus de vervulling der wet is de liefde. 
[13:11]  En dit te meer omdat gij den toestand kent, dat het hoog tijd is dat gij wakker wordt uit den slaap; want nu is de verlossing nader bij ons dan toen wij eerst geloofden.
[13:12] De nacht is voorbijgaande en de dag is nabij; laat ons dan afleggen de werken der duisternis en aandoen de wapenen des lichts.
[13:13] Laat ons betamelijk wandelen, als in den dag; niet in overdadigheden en dronkenschappen, niet in wellusten en gemeenheden, niet in twist en jaloezie,
[13:14] maar doet den Heere Jezus Christus aan, en zorgt niet voor het vleesch tot voldoening uwer lusten.  
[14:1] Dengene nu die zwak is in het geloof moet gij aannemen, maar niet om over verschilpunten te twisten.
[14:2] De een toch gelooft alles te mogen eten, maar de zwakke eet alleen groenten.
[14:3] Die alles eet moet hem niet verachten die niet alles eet, en die niet alles eet moet niet oordeelen dengene die alles eet, want God heeft hem aangenomen.
[14:4] Gij, wie zijt gij, die den huisknecht van een ander oordeelt? Zijn eigen heer gaat het aan of hij staat of valt. Maar hij zal vaststaan want de Heere kan hem vast doen staan.
[14:5] Want de een schat den eenen dag boven den anderen, maar de ander schat elken dag gelijk. Een ieder moet in zijn eigen gemoed ten volle overtuigd zijn.
[14:6] Die den dag boven anderen schat, die schat hem voor den Heere; en die alles eet, die eet voor den Heere alles, want hij dankt God. En die niet alles eet, het is voor den Heere dat hij niet alles eet en hij dankt God.
[14:7] Niemand toch van ons leeft zich zelven en niemand sterft zich zelven.
[14:8] Want als wij leven dan leven wij voor den Heere, en als wij sterven dan sterven wij voor den Heere. Hetzij dan dat wij leven, hetzij dat wij sterven, wij zijn des Heeren.
[14:9] Want tot dien einde is Christus gestorven en leeft Hij, dat Hij zou heerschen over dooden en levenden. 
[14:10]  Gij dan, wat oordeelt gij uw broeder? Of ook gij, wat veracht gij uw broeder? Allen toch zullen wij gesteld worden voor den rechterstoel van God.
[14:11] Want er is geschreven: Ik leef! zegt de Heere. Voor Mij zal alle knie buigen en alle tong zal God de glorie geven.
[14:12] Ieder onzer zal dus voor zich zelven rekenschap geven aan God.
[14:13] Laat ons dan elkander niet meer oordeelen, maar bedenkt liever dit, dat gij den broeder geen aanstoot of ergernis in den weg stelt.
[14:14] Want ik weet en ben verzekerd in den Heere Jezus, dat geen spijze op zich zelve onrein is; maar wel is zij onrein voor die ze acht onrein te zijn.
[14:15] Maar als uw broeder om een spijze bedroefd wordt dan wandelt gij niet meer naar liefde. Verwoest door uw spijze toch dien niet voor wien Christus is gestorven!
[14:16] Laat toch uw voorrecht niet gelasterd worden.
[14:17] Want Gods koninkrijk is geen spijze en drank, maar rechtvaardigheid, en vrede, en blijdschap in den Heiligen Geest.
[14:18] Want hij die in dezen aan Christus dienstbaar is, die is Gode aangenaam en bij de menschen geacht. 
[14:19]  Laat ons dan najagen wat den vrede bevordert en den opbouw van elkander.
[14:20] Verwoest niet het werk Gods om een spijze! Alle spijzen zijn toch rein, maar kwaad is het voor den mensch die eet tot een aanstoot.
[14:21] Het is goed geen vleesch te eten noch wijn te drinken, noch iets te doen waaraan uw broeder zich stoot, of zich ergert, of zwak is.
[14:22] Het geloof dat gij hebt, heb dit bij u zelven voor Gods aangezicht. Gelukkig hij die zich zelven niet oordeelt in hetgeen hij goedkeurt.
[14:23] Maar die twijfelt als hij eet is veroordeeld, omdat hij niet eet uit geloof. En al wat niet uit geloof geschiedt is zonde.  
[15:1] Wij nu, die sterk zijn, zijn verplicht om de zwakheden der zwakken te dragen en niet ons zelven te behagen.
[15:2] Ieder van ons behage zijn naaste ten goede, tot opbouwing.
[15:3] Want ook Christus heeft niet zich zelven behaagd, maar zooals er geschreven is: De beleedigingen dergenen die U beleedigen zijn op Mij gevallen.
[15:4] Want al wat vroeger geschreven is, dat is tot onze onderwijzing geschreven, opdat wij hope hebben zouden door de volharding en door de vertroosting der Schrifturen.
[15:5] De God nu der volharding en der vertroosting geve ulieden hetzelfde onder elkander te gevoelen naar Christus Jezus,
[15:6] opdat gij eendrachtig, uit één mond, den God en Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus de glorie geeft.
[15:7] Daarom, neemt elkander aan zooals ook Christus u heeft aangenomen tot glorie van God.
[15:8] Want ik zeg dat Christus een dienaar der besnijdenis is geworden voor Gods waarheid, om de beloften der vaderen te vervullen,
[15:9] en opdat de volken God voor zijn barmhartigheid de glorie zouden geven, zooals geschreven is: Daarom zal Ik U loven onder de natiën en uw Naam psalmzingen!
[15:10] En wederom zegt Hij: Verheugt u, gij natiën met zijn volk.
[15:11] En wederom: Looft den Heere, alle gij natiën en prijst Hem alle volken.
[15:12] En wederom zegt Jesaja: De wortel van Jesse zal er zijn en die opstaat om de volken te gebieden; op Hem zullen de volken hopen.
[15:13] De God nu der hope vervulle ulieden met alle blijdschap en vrede in het gelooven, opdat gij overvloedig moogt zijn in de hope, in de kracht des Heiligen Geestes. 
[15:14]  Maar ik ben zelf overtuigd, mijn broeders, dat ook gijlieden vol zijt van goedheid, vervuld met alle kennis, ook machtig om elkander te vermanen.
[15:15] Toch heb ik ulieden in zekeren zin te stoutmoediger geschreven, als om u wederom in gedachtenis te brengen aangaande de genade die mij van God gegeven is,
[15:16] om een dienaar van Christus Jezus te zijn tot de volken, gewijd aan de bediening van Gods Evangelie, opdat de offerande der volken aangenomen worde, geheiligd in den Heiligen Geest.
[15:17] Ik heb dan den roem in Christus wat de dingen Gods betreft.
[15:18] Want ik zal niet durven iets spreken van hetgeen Christus door mij niet gewerkt heeft tot gehoorzaamheid der volken, door woord en werk,
[15:19] in kracht van teekenen en mirakelen, in kracht van den Geest Gods, zoodat ik van Jerusalem af en rondom, tot Illyrië toe, het Evangelie van Christus gebracht heb.
[15:20] Ja, dat ik er een eere in stelde het Evangelie te prediken, niet waar Christus alreeds genoemd was, opdat ik niet zou bouwen op het fundament van een ander,
[15:21] maar zooals geschreven is: Zij, aan wie het niet verkondigd was, die zullen zien, en zij die het niet gehoord hebben, die zullen verstaan. 
[15:22]  Daarom ook ben ik veel malen verhinderd geweest om tot ulieden te komen;
[15:23] maar nu geen gelegenheid meer hebbende in deze gewesten en reeds vele jaren begeerte hebbende om tot ulieden te komen,
[15:24] zoo hoop ik, wanneer ik naar Spanje ga, ulieden in het voorbijreizen te zien en door u derwaarts vergezeld te worden, wanneer ik eerst ten deele voldaan zal zijn door uw gezelschap.
[15:25] Maar nu ga ik naar Jerusalem, de heiligen dienende.
[15:26] Want Macedonië en Achaje hebben goed gevonden een zekere ondersteuning te doen ten behoeve van de armen der heiligen die in Jerusalem zijn.
[15:27] Want zij hebben dit goed gevonden; ook zijn zij dit verplicht; want indien de volken deelgenooten zijn geworden van hun geestelijke goederen, dan zijn dezen ook verplicht hen te dienen in de stoffelijke.
[15:28] Als ik dan dit zal volbracht hebben en hun deze vrucht zal ter hand gesteld hebben dan zal ik door uw stad naar Spanje gaan.
[15:29] En ik weet dat, als ik bij ulieden kom, ik komen zal in een volheid van den zegen van Christus. 
[15:30]  En ik vermaan ulieden, broeders, door onzen Heere Jezus Christus en door de liefde des Geestes, om met mij mede te strijden in de gebeden voor mij tot God,
[15:31] opdat ik verlost moge worden van de ongehoorzamen in Judea, en dat mijn dienst die ik aan Jerusalem doe den heiligen aangenaam moge zijn,
[15:32] opdat ik in blijdschap tot ulieden moge komen door den wil van God, om bij ulieden wat te rusten.
[15:33] De God des vredes zij met u allen! Amen.  
[16:1] Ik beveel aan u Phoebé, onze zuster, die een diakonesse is der gemeente die in Kenchrea is;
[16:2] dat gij haar ontvangt in den Heere, zooals dit aan heiligen betaamt en dat gij haar bijstaat in welke zaak zij u zou mogen noodig hebben; want ook zij is velen tot bijstand geweest en ook aan mij zelven.
[16:3] Groet Priska en Aquila, mijn medearbeiders in Christus Jezus,
[16:4] die voor mijn leven hun eigen hals gesteld hebben; wien ik niet alleen dankbaar ben maar ook al de gemeenten der volken.
[16:5] Groet ook de gemeente in hun huis. Groet Epsenetus, mijn beminde, die de eersteling is van Asië in Christus.
[16:6] Groet Maria die veel arbeid aan u besteed heeft.
[16:7] Groet Andronikus en Junias, mijn bloedverwanten en medegevangenen, die vermaard zijn onder de apostelen, die ook eer dan ik in Christus geweest zijn.
[16:8] Groet Ampliatus, mijn beminde in den Heere.
[16:9] Groet Urbanus, onzen medearbeider in Christus, en Stachys, mijn beminde.
[16:10] Groet Apelles den beproefde in Christus. Groet die uit het huisgezin van Aristobulus zijn.
[16:11] Groet Herodion, mijn bloedverwant. Groet degenen die in den Heere zijn uit het huisgezin van Narcissus.
[16:12] Groet Tryfena en Tryfosa, die arbeiden in den Heere. Groet Persis, de beminde, die veel gearbeid heeft in den Heere.
[16:13] Groet Rufus, den uitverkorene in den Heere en de moeder van hem en van mij.
[16:14] Groet Asynkritus, Flegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, en de broeders die met hen zijn.
[16:15] Groet Filologus en Julia, Nereüs en zijn zuster, en Olympa, en al de heiligen die met hen zijn.
[16:16] Groet elkander met een heiligen kus. U groeten al de gemeenten van Christus. 
[16:17]  En ik vermaan ulieden, broeders, te letten op degenen die verdeeldheden en ergernissen veroorzaken tegen het onderwijs dat gij ontvangen hebt. Onttrekt u van hen.
[16:18] Want dezulken dienen onzen Heere Christus niet, maar hun eigen buik, en door vleiende en schoonklinkende woorden verleiden zij de harten der onnoozelen.
[16:19] Want uw gehoorzaamheid is aan allen bekend geworden. Daarom verblijd ik mij over ulieden en ik wil dat gij verstandig zijt tot het goede maar onnoozel tot het kwade.
[16:20] Maar de God des vredes zal den Satan binnenkort vertreden onder uw voeten. De genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus zij met ulieden. 
[16:21]  U groet Timotheüs mijn medearbeider, en Lukius, en Jason, en Sosipater mijn bloedverwanten.
[16:22] Ik Tertius die den brief heb geschreven, groet ulieden in den Heere.
[16:23] U groet Gajus, de gastheer van mij en van de geheele gemeente. U groet Erastus, de penningmeester der stad en Quartus de broeder.
[16:24] De genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus zij met ulieden allen. Amen. 
[16:25]  Hem nu die machtig is ulieden te versterken, volgens mijn Evangelie en de prediking van Jezus Christus, volgens de openbaring der verborgenheid, die gedurende onheugelijke tijden verzwegen is,
[16:26] maar nu is geopenbaard en door de profetische Schrifturen volgens bevel des eeuwigen Gods is bekend geworden onder alle volken, tot gehoorzaamheid des geloofs,
[16:27] den alleen wijzen God, door Jezus Christus, Hem de glorie tot in eeuwigheid! Amen.   

### I Corinthians

[1:1] Paulus, geroepen tot apostel van Jezus Christus, door den wil van God, en Sosthenes de broeder,
[1:2] Aan de gemeente Gods die in Korinthe is, aan degenen die geheiligd zijn in Christus Jezus, geroepen heiligen, met allen die den Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus aanroepen in elke plaats, hunnen en onzen Heere:
[1:3] Genade zij ulieden en vrede van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus. 
[1:4]  Ik dank mijn God altijd over ulieden, vanwege de genade Gods die ulieden gegeven is in Christus Jezus;
[1:5] dat gij in alle ding zijt rijk geworden in Hem, in alle woord en alle kennis;
[1:6] gelijk het getuigenis van Christus is bevestigd onder ulieden,
[1:7] zoodat gij niet achterstaat in eenige genadegifte, terwijl gij de openbaarwording van onzen Heere Jezus Christus verwacht,
[1:8] die u ook zal bevestigen tot den einde toe als onberispelijk en in den dag van onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[1:9] God is getrouw, door wien gij geroepen zijt tot gemeenschap met zijn Zoon Jezus Christus. 
[1:10]  Doch ik vermaan u, broeders, door den Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, dat gij allen hetzelfde spreekt en dat er onder ulieden geen scheuringen zijn, maar dat gij vereenigd zijt in dezelfde gezindheid en in hetzelfde gevoelen.
[1:11] Want mij is omtrent u bekend geworden, mijn broeders, door die van Chloë, dat er onder u twistingen zijn.
[1:12] Ik bedoel dit, dat ieder van u zegt: ik ben van Apollos, en ik van Kefas, en ik van Christus!
[1:13] Is Christus gedeeld? Paulus is toch voor u niet gekruisigd? of zijt gij in den naam van Paulus gedoopt?
[1:14] Ik dank God dat ik niemand van u gedoopt heb dan alleen Krispus en Gajus;
[1:15] opdat niemand zou zeggen dat gij in mijn naam zijt gedoopt.
[1:16] Doch ik heb ook het huisgezin van Stefanas gedoopt. Overigens weet ik niet dat ik iemand anders heb gedoopt. 
[1:17]  Want Christus heeft mij niet gezonden om te doopen maar om het Evangelie te verkondigen, niet in wijsheid des woords, opdat het kruis van Christus niet van kracht zou beroofd worden.
[1:18] Want het woord des kruises is wel dwaasheid voor degenen die verloren gaan, maar voor ons die behouden worden, is het een kracht Gods.
[1:19] Want er is geschreven: Ik zal de wijsheid der wijzen verderven, en het verstand der verstandigen zal Ik wegdoen.
[1:20] Waar is de wijze? Waar is de schriftgeleerde? Waar is de twistredenaar dezer eeuw? Heeft God de wijsheid der wereld niet verdwaasd?
[1:21] Want aangezien in de wijsheid Gods de wereld door de wijsheid God niet heeft gekend, zoo heeft het Gode behaagd door de dwaasheid der prediking te behouden die gelooven. 
[1:22]  En omdat de Joden teekenen begeeren en de Grieken wijsheid zoeken,
[1:23] — doch wij den gekruisigden Christus prediken, den Joden wel een ergernis en den volken een dwaasheid
[1:24] zoo prediken wij hun die geroepen zijn, zoowel Joden als Grieken, den Christus Gods, als de kracht en de wijsheid Gods.
[1:25] Want het dwaze Gods is wijzer dan de menschen en het zwakke Gods is sterker dan de menschen.
[1:26] Want merkt op, broeders, dat onder ulieden niet veel wijzen naar het vleesch, niet veel machtigen, niet veel edelen, zijn geroepen;
[1:27] maar het dwaze der wereld heeft God uitverkoren, opdat Hij de wijzen zou beschamen, en het zwakke der wereld heeft God uitverkoren opdat Hij het sterke zou beschamen;
[1:28] en het onedele der wereld en het verachte heeft God uitverkoren, hetgeen niet is, opdat Hij hetgeen is zou doen verdwijnen.
[1:29] Opdat geen vleesch zou roemen voor Gods aangezicht.
[1:30] Doch uit Hem zijt gij in Christus Jezus, die voor ons van God geworden is wijsheid, en rechtvaardigheid, en heiliging, en verlossing;
[1:31] opdat gelijk geschreven is, de roemende in den Heere roeme.  
[2:1] En als ik tot u gekomen ben, broeders, ben ik niet gekomen met uitnemendheid des woords en der wijsheid, om ulieden de getuigenisse Gods te verkondigen.
[2:2] Want ik heb geen voornemen gehad om onder ulieden iets anders te weten dan alleen Jezus Christus en dien als den Gekruisigde.
[2:3] En ik was bij ulieden in zwakheid, en in vreeze, en in veel beving,
[2:4] en mijn woord en mijn prediking waren niet in overhalende woorden van wijsheid, maar in betooning van den Geest en de kracht;
[2:5] opdat uw geloof niet zijn zou in wijsheid van menschen, maar in Gods kracht.
[2:6] Toch spreken wij wijsheid onder de volwassenen, doch een wijsheid niet van deze eeuw, noch van de oversten dezer eeuw die verdwijnen;
[2:7] maar wij spreken Gods wijsheid in een verborgenheid, die bedekt was, en die God vóór de eeuwen bestemd had tot onze glorie,
[2:8] die niemand van de oversten dezer eeuw gekend heeft; want als zij ze gekend hadden dan zouden zij den Heere der glorie niet gekruisigd hebben.
[2:9] Maar zooals geschreven is: Wat geen oog heeft gezien en geen oor heeft gehoord en in geen menschenhart opgekomen is, dat heeft God bereid voor degenen die Hem beminnen.
[2:10] Doch aan ons heeft God het geopenbaard door den Geest; want de Geest onderzoekt alles, zelfs de diepten Gods.
[2:11] Want wie van de menschen weet de dingen van een mensch, dan alleen de geest des menschen die in hem is? Zoo ook weet niemand de dingen Gods dan alleen de Geest Gods. 
[2:12]  Doch wij hebben niet ontvangen den geest der wereld, maar den Geest die uit God is, opdat wij zouden weten de dingen die van God ons in genade geschonken zijn,
[2:13] die wij ook spreken, niet in woorden die de menschelijke wijsheid leert, maar in leeringen des Geestes, geestelijke dingen door geestelijke verklarende.
[2:14] Maar de zinnelijke mensch ontvangt niet de dingen des Geestes Gods, want ze zijn hem een dwaasheid en hij kan ze niet verstaan omdat ze geestelijk beoordeeld worden.
[2:15] Maar de geestelijke mensch beoordeelt alles, doch hij zelf wordt van niemand beoordeeld.
[2:16] Want wie kent den zin des Heeren, die Hem zou onderwijzen? Doch wij hebben den zin van Christus.  
[3:1] En wat mij betreft, broeders, ik kon tot ulieden niet spreken als tot geestelijken, maar als tot vleeschelijken, als tot kinderkens in Christus.
[3:2] Melk heb ik u te drinken gegeven, niet vaste spijze, want gij kondet die nog niet, en kunt ze ook nu nog niet verdragen, want gij zijt nog vleeschelijk.
[3:3] Want als er onder u jaloezie is en twist, zijt ge dan niet vleeschelijk en wandelt ge dan niet naar den mensch?
[3:4] Want als de een zegt: ik ben van Paulus, en de ander: ik van Apollos, zijt gij dan niet menschen?
[3:5] Wat toch is Apollos? Wat is Paulus? — Dienaars, door wie gij geloofd hebt en naarmate de Heere aan elk gegeven heeft.
[3:6] Ik heb geplant, Apollos heeft begoten. Maar God heeft doen groeien.
[3:7] Alzoo dan, noch de planter is iets, noch de begieter, maar God die doet groeien.
[3:8] En de planter en begieter zijn gelijk, doch ieder zal zijn eigen loon ontvangen naar zijn eigen arbeid.
[3:9] Want wij zijn Gods medearbeiders; Gods arbeidsveld, Gods gebouw zijt gijlieden. 
[3:10]  Naar de genade Gods die aan mij gegeven is heb ik als een verstandig bouwmeester een fundament gelegd; doch een ander bouwt daarop. Maar een ieder moge toezien hoe hij daarop bouwt!
[3:11] Een ander fundament toch kan niemand leggen, behalve het gelegde, dat is Jezus Christus.
[3:12] Want als iemand op het fundament bouwt goud, zilver, kostbare steenen, hout, hooi, riet,
[3:13] ieders werk zal openbaar worden, want de dag zal het doen kennen omdat het in vuur wordt geopenbaard, en hoedanig ieders werk is, zal het vuur zelf uitwijzen.
[3:14] Als iemands werk blijft, dat hij daarop gebouwd heeft, dan zal hij loon ontvangen.
[3:15] Als iemands werk verbrand wordt dan zal hij verlies lijden; maar hij zelf zal worden behouden, doch als door het vuur heen. 
[3:16]  Weet gij niet dat gij een tempel Gods zijt en dat de Geest Gods in ulieden woont?
[3:17] Als iemand den tempel Gods verderft, dien zal God verderven, want de tempel Gods is heilig en zoodanigen zijt gij.
[3:18] Dat niemand zich zelven bedriege! Als iemand onder ulieden denkt verstandig te zijn in deze eeuw, dat hij dan een dwaas worde, opdat hij verstandig moge worden.
[3:19] Want het verstand van deze wereld is dwaasheid bij God. Want er is geschreven: God vat de verstandigen in hun zoogenaamde verstandigheid.
[3:20] En wederom: De Heere kent de redeneeringen der verstandigen, dat ze ledig zijn.
[3:21] Dus niemand roeme in menschen. Want alles is van u,
[3:22] hetzij Paulus, hetzij Apollos, hetzij Kefas, hetzij wereld, hetzij leven, hetzij dood, hetzij tegenwoordige dingen, hetzij toekomende dingen, alles is van ulieden;
[3:23] doch gij zijt van Christus, en Christus is van God.  
[4:1] Alzoo houde ieder ons als dienaars van Christus en bestuurders van Gods verborgenheden.
[4:2] Voor het overige wordt in de bestuurders vereischt dat ieder getrouw worde bevonden. 
[4:3]  Voor mij nu is het allerminste dat ik van ulieden word geoordeeld, of van een menschelijk vonnis. Ja, ik oordeel ook mij zelven niet;
[4:4] want ik weet niets tegen mij zelven, maar daarin ben ik niet gerechtvaardigd; doch die mij oordeelt is de Heere.
[4:5] Zoo dan, beoordeelt niets voor den tijd, totdat de Heere zal gekomen zijn, die ook de verborgen dingen der duisternis zal aan het licht brengen en de raadslagen der harten zal openbaren; en alsdan zal ieder van God den lof ontvangen die hem toekomt. 
[4:6]  Deze dingen nu, broeders, heb ik bij vergelijking toegepast op mij zelven en op Apollos om uwentwil, opdat gij in ons niets zoudt leeren boven hetgeen geschreven is, opdat niet de een ten behoeve van een ander opgeblazen worde tegen den ander.
[4:7] Want wie onderscheidt u? En wat hebt gij dat gij niet hebt ontvangen? En als gij het ontvangen hebt, wat beroemt gij u dan alsof gij het niet ontvangen hadt?
[4:8] Reeds zijt gij verzadigd; reeds zijt gij rijk geworden; zonder ons hebt gij geheerscht; en ik zou willen dat gij zoudt heerschen opdat ook wij met u mochten heerschen! 
[4:9]  Want ik meen dat God ons, apostelen, als de laagsten heeft aangewezen, als ter dood veroordeelden, omdat wij een schouwspel zijn geworden voor de wereld, en voor engelen en menschen.
[4:10] Wij zijn dwazen om Christus wil, maar gij zijt verstandigen in Christus; wij zijn zwakken, maar gij zijt sterken; gij zijt geëerden, maar wij zijn verachten.
[4:11] Tot op deze ure toe lijden wij honger en dorst, en zijn wij naakt en worden wij geslagen en verjaagd;
[4:12] en wij arbeiden, werkende met eigen handen; gescholden zijnde zegenen wij; vervolgd zijnde verdragen wij;
[4:13] belasterd zijnde bidden wij; als uitvaagsel der wereld zijn wij geworden, als aller afschrapsel tot nu toe. 
[4:14]  Niet om u te beschamen schrijf ik deze dingen, maar als mijn beminde kinderen vermaan ik ulieden,
[4:15] want al zoudt gij tien duizend opvoeders in Christus hebben, gij hebt toch niet veel vaders; want in Christus Jezus heb ik u door het Evangelie gewonnen.
[4:16] Ik vermaan u dan: zijt mijn navolgers!
[4:17] Om die reden heb ik Timotheüs tot ulieden gezonden, die mijn beminde en getrouwe zoon is in den Heere, die ulieden zal herinneren mijn wegen die in Christus Jezus zijn, zooals ik overal in iedere gemeente leer. 
[4:18]  Alsof ik niet tot ulieden komen zou, zijn sommigen opgeblazen.
[4:19] Doch ik zal spoedig tot u komen, als de Heere wil, en dan zal ik kennis nemen, niet van het woord der opgeblazenen, maar van de kracht.
[4:20] Want niet in woord bestaat het koninkrijk Gods maar in kracht.
[4:21] Wat wilt gij? Zal ik tot u komen met een roede, of in liefde en een geest van zachtmoedigheid?  
[5:1] In het algemeen hoort men dat er hoererij is onder ulieden, en wel zoodanig hoererij als er zelfs onder de heidenen niet is: dat iemand de vrouw zijns vaders heeft.
[5:2] En nog zijt gij opgeblazen en hebt niet liever gejammerd, opdat hij die deze daad begaan heeft uit uw midden weggenomen zou worden?
[5:3] Doch ik, als afwezig naar het lichaam, maar tegenwoordig naar den geest, heb reeds geoordeeld, alsof ik tegenwoordig was, dengene die alzoo heeft gehandeld,
[5:4] in den Naam des Heeren Jezus, als gijlieden zult samen vergaderd zijn en mijn geest, met de kracht van onzen Heere Jezus,
[5:5] denzulke over te geven aan den Satan, tot verderf des vleesches, opdat de geest gered worde in den dag des Heeren Jezus. 
[5:6]  Uw roem is niet fraai! Weet gij niet dat een weinig zuurdeesem den geheelen deegklomp zuur maakt?
[5:7] Zuivert den ouden zuurdeesem uit, opdat gij een nieuwe deegklomp moogt zijn, zooals gij zonder zuurdeesem zijt. Want ook Christus, ons Pascha, is geslacht.
[5:8] Laat ons dan feest houden, niet in een ouden zuurdeesem, noch in een zuurdeesem van kwaadheid en boosheid, maar in ongezuurdeesemde brooden van oprechtheid en waarheid. 
[5:9]  Ik heb u in den brief geschreven u niet te vermengen met hoereerders.
[5:10] Doch ik bedoelde niet in het algemeen met de hoereerders dezer wereld, of de gierigaards en roovers, of afgodendienaars; want dan zoudt gij moeten uit de wereld gaan.
[5:11] Maar nu, wat ik u geschreven heb, is dit: dat gij u niet zoudt vermengen met iemand die een broeder wordt genoemd en dan een hoereerder is, of gierigaard, of afgodendienaar, of lasteraar, of dronkaard, of roover; ja dat gij ook met zulk een zelfs niet zoudt eten.
[5:12] Want wat heb ik te oordeelen degenen die buiten de gemeente zijn? Oordeelt gij niet degenen die binnen de gemeente zijn?
[5:13] Die buiten de gemeente zijn zal God oordeelen. Doet gij den booze uit uw midden weg!  
[6:1] Iemand van u, die een geschil heeft met een ander, durft hij recht zoeken de onrechtvaardigen en niet bij de heiligen?
[6:2] Weet gij dan niet dat de heiligen de wereld zullen oordeelen? En als door ulieden de wereld geoordeeld wordt, zijt gij dan onbevoegd tot de kleinste gerichtzaken?
[6:3] Weet gij niet dat wij engelen zullen oordeelen? Hoeveel te meer dan de dingen van dit leven?
[6:4] Als gij dan gerichtzaken hebt van dit leven, stelt gij dan dezulken tot rechters die in de gemeente niet geacht zijn?
[6:5] Tot uw schande zeg ik u dit. Is er dan onder u geen verstandige, die zal kunnen oordeelen tusschen zijn broeders?
[6:6] Maar een broeder zoekt recht tegen een broeder, en dat bij ongeloovigen?
[6:7] Het is al een groot misbruik onder u dat gij gerichtzaken met elkander hebt. Waarom lijdt gij niet liever onrecht? Waarom lijdt gij niet liever schade?
[6:8] Maar gij doet onrecht en doet schade, en dat nog wel aan broeders!
[6:9] Weet gij dan niet dat onrechtvaardigen Gods koninkrijk niet zullen erven? 
[6:10]  Dwaalt niet! Noch hoereerders, noch afgodendienaars, noch echtbrekers, noch onzedelijken, noch onnatuurlijken, noch dieven, noch gierigaards, noch dronkaards, noch lasteraars, noch roovers, zullen Gods koninkrijk erven.
[6:11] En sommigen van u zijn alzoo geweest; maar gij zijt afgewasschen, maar gij zijt geheiligd, maar gij zijt gerechtvaardigd in den Naam van den Heere Jezus Christus en in den Geest onzes Gods. 
[6:12]  Alles is mij geoorloofd, maar niet alles is nuttig. Alles is mij geoorloofd, maar ik zal mij door geen ding laten onderwerpen.
[6:13] De spijzen zijn voor den buik en de buik is voor de spijzen, maar God zal dezen en die wegdoen. Doch het lichaam is niet voor de hoererij maar voor den Heere, en de Heere voor het lichaam.
[6:14] En God doet beide: Hij heeft den Heere opgewekt en zal ons opwekken door zijn kracht. 
[6:15]  Weet gij niet dat uw lichamen leden van Christus zijn? Zal ik dan de leden van Christus nemen en die maken tot leden van een hoere? In het geheel niet!
[6:16] Of weet gij niet dat degene die zich bij een hoere voegt één lichaam met haar is? Want er wordt gezegd: die twee zullen tot één vleesch zijn.
[6:17] Doch die zich bij den Heere voegt is één geest met Hem.
[6:18] Ontvliedt de hoererij! Alle zonde, als een mensch die doet, is buiten het lichaam. Maar die hoererij bedrijft zondigt tegen zijn eigen lichaam.
[6:19] Of weet gij niet dat uw lichaam een tempel is van den Heiligen Geest die in u is, dien gij van God hebt, en dat gij niet uws zelfs eigendom zijt?
[6:20] Want gij zijt gekocht voor een grooten prijs. Geeft dan Gode de glorie in uw lichaam.  
[7:1] Aangaande de dingen nu waarvan gij mij hebt geschreven, het is voor een mensch goed geen vrouw aan te raken.
[7:2] Doch om de hoererijen te vermijden, laat iederen man zijn eigen vrouw hebben en laat iedere vrouw haar eigen man hebben. 
[7:3]  Dat de man aan de vrouw geve wat hij haar schuldig is; alzoo ook de vrouw aan den man.
[7:4] De vrouw heeft niet de macht over haar eigen lichaam, maar de man; alzoo ook heeft de man niet de macht over zijn eigen lichaam, maar de vrouw.
[7:5] Berooft u niet van elkander, dan alleen met beider toestemming voor een tijd, opdat gij u bezig houdt met gebed; en komt dan wederom samen opdat de Satan u niet bekore vanwege uw begeerlijkheid.
[7:6] Doch ik zeg dit bij wijze van toelating, niet als gebod.
[7:7] Want ik wou dat alle menschen waren zooals ik zelf ben. Maar ieder heeft zijn eigen gave van God; de een aldus, de ander alzoo. 
[7:8]  Doch ik zeg tot de ongetrouwden en de weduwen, dat het hun goed is als zij blijven zooals ik ben.
[7:9] Maar als zij zich niet kunnen onthouden, laat ze dan trouwen; want beter is het te trouwen dan te branden. 
[7:10]  Doch den getrouwden beveel ik— niet ik, maar de Heere— dat de vrouw van den man niet scheide.
[7:11] Doch indien zij scheidt, dat zij ongetrouwd blijve of met den man verzoene. En dat een man zijn vrouw niet verlate.
[7:12] Maar tot de anderen zeg ik, niet de Heere: als eenige broeder een ongeloovige vrouw heeft en deze tevreden is om met hem te wonen, dan verlate hij haar niet.
[7:13] En als eenige vrouw een ongeloovigen man heeft, en deze tevreden is, om met haar te wonen, dan verlate zij den man niet.
[7:14] Want de ongeloovige man is geheiligd in de vrouw en de ongeloovige vrouw is geheiligd in den broeder; anders toch zijn uw kinderen ongereinigd, maar nu zijn zij heilig.
[7:15] Maar als de ongeloovige scheidt, laat hem scheiden. De broeder of de zuster is niet gebonden in zulke gevallen. God heeft ons tot vrede geroepen.
[7:16] Wat toch weet gij, vrouw, of gij den man zult redden? Of wat weet gij, man, of gij de vrouw zult redden?
[7:17] Alleenlijk, zooals de Heere aan een ieder gedeeld heeft, zooals God een ieder geroepen heeft, dat hij alzoo wandele. En alzoo beveel ik in al de gemeenten.
[7:18] Is iemand besneden zijnde geroepen? Die doe de besnijdenis niet teniet. Is iemands onbesneden zijnde geroepen Hij late zich niet besnijden.
[7:19] De besnijdenis is niets en de onbesnedenheid is niets, maar het onderhouden van Gods geboden.
[7:20] Een ieder blijve in die beroeping waarin hij geroepen is.
[7:21] Zijt gij geroepen als dienstknecht? Bekommer u daarover niet. Maar als gij ook kunt vrij worden, doe dat liever,
[7:22] Want de dienstknecht die in den Heer geroepen is, is een vrijgemaakte des Heeren. Alzoo die vrij zijnde geroepen is, is een dienstknecht van Christus.
[7:23] Tot een grooten prijs zijt gij gekocht; wordt geen dienaren van menschen.
[7:24] Een ieder in hetgeen hij geroepen is, broeders, daarin blijve hij bij God! 
[7:25]  Wat nu de maagden betreft, heb ik geen bevel des Heeren, maar ik geef mijn gevoelen, als een die barmhartigheid van den Heere verkregen heb om betrouwbaar te zijn.
[7:26] Ik meen dan dat dit goed is, om de voorstaande moeilijkheid, namelijk dat het den mensch goed is te zijn zooals hij is.
[7:27] Zijt gij aan een vrouw verbonden? Zoek geen losmaking. Zijt gij niet aan een vrouw verbonden? Zoek geen vrouw.
[7:28] Maar ook als gij trouwt zondigt gij niet, en als een maagd trouwt, zondigt zij niet. Doch dezulken zullen smarte hebben naar het vleesch; en ik zou u willen sparen.
[7:29] Maar dit zeg ik, broeders! de tijd is kort. Dat voortaan zij die vrouwen hebben mogen zijn als haar niet hebbende,
[7:30] en de weenenden als niet weenende, en de blijden als niet blijde zijnde, en de koopenden als niet bezittende,
[7:31] en die de wereld gebruiken als niet misbruikende; want de gedaante dezer wereld gaat voorbij.
[7:32] Maar ik zou willen dat gij zonder zorgen zijt. De ongetrouwde zorgt voor de dingen des Heeren, hoe hij den Heere zal behagen.
[7:33] Doch de getrouwde zorgt voor de dingen der wereld, hoe hij de vrouw zal behagen.
[7:34] Er is ook verschil tusschen de vrouw en de maagd. De ongetrouwde zorgt voor de dingen des Heeren, opdat zij heilig zij, beide naar het lichaam en naar den geest. Maar de getrouwde zorgt voor de dingen der wereld, hoe zij den man zal behagen.
[7:35] Dit nu zeg ik tot uw eigen voordeel. Niet om een strik rond u te werpen, maar tot hetgeen welvoegelijk is en bekwaam om u den Heere toe te voegen zonder afleiding.
[7:36] Doch als iemand meent dat hij onwelvoegelijk handelt jegens zijn maagd, als zij boven de jeugd gaat, en het alzoo geschieden moet, die doe wat hij wil. Hij zondigt niet; laat ze trouwen.
[7:37] Maar die vast staat in zijn harte en geen noodzakelijkheid heeft, maar macht heeft over zijn eigen wil, en dit in zijn eigen harte heeft besloten, om zijn eigen maagd te bewaren, die zal goed doen.
[7:38] Alzoo dan, die zijn maagd uithuwelijkt die doet goed, en die haar niet uithuwelijkt zal beter doen.
[7:39] Een vrouw is door de wet verbonden voor zoo langen tijd als haar man leeft; maar als de man is ontslapen dan is zij vrij om te trouwen met wien zij wil; alleenlijk in den Heere.
[7:40] Doch gelukkiger is zij als zij blijft zooals zij is, naar mijn meening. En ik denk dat ik ook den Geest van God heb.  
[8:1] Omtrent de dingen die aan de afgoden geofferd zijn weten wij dat wij allen kennis hebben. De kennis maakt opgeblazen, doch de liefde bouwt op.
[8:2] Als iemand denkt iets te weten dan weet hij nog niet zooals hij moet weten.
[8:3] Maar als iemand God bemint, die is van Hem gekend.
[8:4] Omtrent het eten dan van de dingen die aan de afgoden zijn geofferd, weten wij dat een afgod niets is in de wereld en dat niemand God is dan Eén.
[8:5] Want alhoewel er zijn die goden genoemd worden, hetzij in hemel, hetzij op aarde, gelijk er vele goden en vele heeren zijn,
[8:6] toch is er voor ons maar één God, de Vader, uit wien alles is en wij tot Hem, en maar één Heere, Jezus Christus, door wien alles is en wij door Hem.
[8:7] Doch niet in allen is die kennis. Maar sommigen, die tot nog toe iets van den afgod denken, eten als van dingen die aan de afgoden geofferd zijn, en hun konsciëntie die zwak is, wordt daardoor bevlekt.
[8:8] Doch spijze zal ons niet nader tot God brengen, en als wij eten dan zijn wij er niet beter om, en als wij niet eten dan zijn wij er niet minder om. 
[8:9]  Maar ziet toe dat deze uw vrijheid geen aanstoot wordt voor de zwakken.
[8:10] Want als iemand u, die kennis hebt, zou zien aanliggen in een afgodstempel, zou dan niet de konsciëntie van hem die zwak is, worden verkracht, om te eten van de dingen die aan de afgoden zijn geofferd?
[8:11] Want door uw kennis zal de zwakke verderven, de broeder, om wiens wil Christus gestorven is.
[8:12] En alzoo zondigende tegen de broeders en hun zwakke konsciëntie kwetsende zondigt gij tegen Christus.
[8:13] Daarom, als spijze mijn broeder ergert, zal ik volstrekt nooit vleesch eten, opdat ik mijn broeder niet zou ergeren.  
[9:1] Ben ik niet vrij? Ben ik geen apostel? Heb ik Jezus onzen Heer niet gezien? Zijt gijlieden niet mijn werk in den Heere?
[9:2] Indien ik voor anderen geen apostel ben, dan ben ik het toch wel voor ulieden? Want het merkteeken van mijn apostelschap zijt gij in den Heere.
[9:3] Deze is mijn verdediging voor degenen die naar mij onderzoek doen.
[9:4] Hebben wij niet het recht om te eten en te drinken?
[9:5] Hebben wij niet het recht om een zuster als vrouw met ons te leiden, zooals ook de andere apostelen en de broeders des Heeren, en Kefas?
[9:6] Of hebben alleen ik en Barnabas geen recht om niet te werken?
[9:7] Wie dient er ooit in den oorlog op eigen kosten? Wie plant er een wijngaard en eet zijn vrucht niet? Of wie hoedt er een kudde en eet niet van de melk der kudde?
[9:8] Spreek ik deze dingen alleen naar menschelijk gebruik? Of zegt ook de wet dit niet?
[9:9] In de wet van Mozes toch is geschreven: Gij zult een dorschenden os niet muilbanden. En voor de ossen is God toch niet bezorgd?
[9:10] Of is het niet veelmeer om onzentwille dat Hij dit zegt? Ja, om onzentwille is het geschreven, omdat de ploeger moet ploegen op hope, en de dorscher moet dorschen op hope van te kunnen genieten.
[9:11] Als wij voor ulieden geestelijke dingen gezaaid hebben, is het dan een groote zaak als wij uw stoffelijke dingen maaien?
[9:12] Als anderen van dat recht over u genieten, waarom wij niet veel meer? Doch wij hebben van dat recht geen gebruik gemaakt, maar wij verdragen alles, opdat wij geen hinder zouden toebrengen aan het Evangelie van Christus.
[9:13] Weet gij niet dat zij die de heilige dingen bedienen van de dingen uit den tempel eten? Dat zij die bij den altaar dienen hun deel hebben van den altaar?
[9:14] Zoo ook heeft de Heere geboden aan degenen die het Evangelie verkondigen om uit het Evangelie te leven.
[9:15] Doch ik heb van deze dingen geen gebruik gemaakt. Ik heb dit ook niet geschreven opdat het in mijn geval alzoo zou geschieden; want ik zou veel liever sterven dan dat iemand mijn roem zou ontnemen. 
[9:16]  Want als ik het Evangelie verkondig is dat mij geen roem, maar die plicht is mij opgelegd. Want wee mij als ik het niet zou verkondigen!
[9:17] Want als ik dat gewillig doe dan heb ik loon, maar als ik het onwillig doe, de bediening is mij toch toevertrouwd.
[9:18] Wat is dan mijn loon? Dat ik het Evangelie verkondigende het Evangelie kosteloos stelle om geen misbruik te maken van mijn recht in het Evangelie.
[9:19] Want vrij zijnde van allen heb ik mij zelven dienstbaar gemaakt aan allen, opdat ik meerderen zou winnen.
[9:20] En voor de Joden ben ik als een Jood geworden, opdat ik Joden zou winnen; voor degenen die onder de wet zijn ben ik geworden als onder de wet, ofschoon ik niet onder de wet was, opdat ik degenen die onder de wet zijn winnen zou.
[9:21] Voor degenen die zonder wet zijn ben ik geworden als zonder wet, ofschoon ik niet zonder wet van God was maar in de wet van Christus, opdat ik degenen die zonder wet zijn zou winnen.
[9:22] Voor de zwakken ben ik een zwakke geworden, opdat ik de zwakken zou winnen; voor allen ben ik alles geworden, opdat ik in alle geval sommigen behouden zou.
[9:23] Alles doe ik om het Evangelie opdat ik er mede deelgenoot van worde. 
[9:24]  Weet gij niet dat zij die in de renbaan loopen allen wel loopen, doch dat er maar één den prijs ontvangt? Loopt gij alzoo dat gij dien verkrijgen moogt.
[9:25] Al nu wie mededingt onthoudt zich van alles, en dezen doen dit om een verderfelijke kroon te bekomen; maar wij zoeken een onverderfelijke.
[9:26] Wat mij aangaat, ik loop niet als in het onzekere, ik kamp niet als de lucht slaande,
[9:27] maar ik bedwing mijn lichaam en breng het onder bedwang, opdat ik niet misschien, terwijl ik aan anderen predik zelf verwerpelijk worde.  
[10:1] Want ik wil niet, broeders, dat gij niet zoudt weten, dat onze vaders allen onder de wolk waren en allen door de zee gegaan, zijn,
[10:2] en allen in Mozes gedoopt zijn in de wolk en in de zee,
[10:3] en allen dezelfde geestelijke spijze gegeten hebben,
[10:4] en allen denzelfden geestelijken drank gedronken hebben, want zij dronken uit een geestelijke steenrots die volgde en de steenrots was de Christus.
[10:5] Maar in de meesten van hen heeft God geen welbehagen gehad, want zij werden neergeslagen in de woestijn.
[10:6] Deze dingen nu zijn ons tot voorbeelden geschied, opdat wij niet zouden lust hebben naar het kwaad, zooals zij lust gehad hebben.
[10:7] En wordt geen afgodendienaars zooals sommigen van hen, gelijk geschreven is: Het volk zat neder om te eten en te drinken en zij stonden op om te spelen.
[10:8] En laat ons niet hoereeren, zooals sommigen van hen hebben gehoereerd en er vielen op één dag drie en twintig duizend.
[10:9] En laat ons den Heere niet tergen, zooals sommigen van hen getergd hebben en ze werden door de slangen vernield.
[10:10] En murmureert niet, zooals sommigen van hen gemurmureerd hebben en ze werden vernield door den verderver. 
[10:11]  Deze dingen nu zijn hun overkomen bij maniere van voorbeelden, en ze zijn beschreven tot waarschuwing van ons tot wie de einden der eeuwen zijn gekomen.
[10:12] Alzoo die meent te staan moge toezien dat hij niet valle!
[10:13] Een bekoring is u niet overkomen dan alleen een menschelijke; doch God is getrouw, die niet zal toelaten dat gij in bekoring komt boven hetgeen gij vermoogt, maar Hij zal met de bekoring ook den weg banen om te ontkomen, opdat gij ze kunt verdragen. 
[10:14]  Daarom, mijn beminden, vlucht van den afgodendienst!
[10:15] Als tot verstandigen spreek ik; beoordeelt gij wat ik zeg.
[10:16] De drinkbeker der zegeningen, dien wij zegenen, is die niet de gemeenschap des bloeds van Christus? Het brood dat wij breken, is dat niet de gemeenschap des lichaams van Christus?,
[10:17] Want er is één brood en wij velen zijn één lichaam, want allen deelen wij van dat eene brood.
[10:18] Aanziet Israël naar het vleesch! Hebben zij die de offeranden eten niet een deel van het offeraltaar?
[10:19] Wat zeg ik dan? Dat een afgodsoffer iets is? O dat een afgod iets is?
[10:20] Neen, maar dat de heidenen datgene wat zij opofferen aan de booze geesten opofferen en niet aan God. En ik wil niet dat gij gemeenschap hebt met de booze geesten.
[10:21] Gij kunt niet den drinkbeker des Heeren drinke en den drinkbeker der booze geesten; gij kunt niet deel hebben aan de tafel des Heeren en aan de tafel der booze geesten. 
[10:22]  Of zullen wij den Heer tergen? Wij zijn toch niet sterker dan Hij?
[10:23] Alles is geoorloofd, maar alles is niet nuttig; alles is geoorloofd, maar alles is niet opbouwend.
[10:24] Dat niemand zijn eigen voordeel zoeke, maar dat van een ander.
[10:25] Al wat in het vleeschhuis verkocht wordt moogt gij eten, zonder om der konsciëntie wille iets te onderzoeken;
[10:26] want de aarde is des Heeren en haar volheid.
[10:27] Als iemand der ongeloovigen u noodigt tot een maaltijd, en gij wilt gaan, eet dan al wat u wordt voorgezet, zonder om der konsciëntie wille iets te onderzoeken.
[10:28] Doch in geval iemand tot u zou zeggen: dat is aan de afgoden geofferd! eet dan niet, ter wille van hem die u waarschuwt en om de konsciëntie.
[10:29] Ik spreek hier van de konsciëntie, niet van u zelven maar van den ander: want waarom wordt mijn vrijheid geoordeeld van eens anders konsciëntie?
[10:30] Als ik met dankzegging deel heb aan den maaltijd, waarom word ik gelasterd over iets waarvoor ik dankzeg? 
[10:31]  Hetzij dan dat gij eet, hetzij dat gij drinkt, of wat gij ook doet, doet alles tot glorie van God.
[10:32] Geeft geen aanstoot, noch aan Joden, noch aan Grieken, noch aan de gemeente Gods;
[10:33] zooals ik ook allen in alles behaag, niet zoekende mijn eigen voordeel maar dat van velen, opdat zij mogen behouden worden.  
[11:1] Zijt, mijn navolgers, zooals ook ik van Christus. 
[11:2]  Ik prijs u, broeders, dat gij in alles aan mij gedachtig zijt en dat gij onderhoudt de instellingen, zooals ik u overgeleverd heb.
[11:3] Doch ik wil dat gij weten zult dat Christus het Hoofd is van iederen man, en dat de man het hoofd is der vrouw, en God het Hoofd van Christus.
[11:4] Iedere man die bidt of profeteert met gedekten hoofde onteert zijn Hoofd.
[11:5] En iedere vrouw die bidt of profeteert met ongesluierden hoofde, onteert haar hoofd. Want dat is een en hetzelfde alsof zij kaal geschoren zou zijn.
[11:6] Want als een vrouw niet gesluierd is, dat zij dan ook kaal geschoren worde. Maar als het schande is voor een vrouw om geschoren te worden of het haar afgesneden te hebben, dat zij dan gesluierd zij.
[11:7] Want een man behoeft het hoofd niet te bedekken, omdat hij het beeld en de glorie van God is. Maar de vrouw is de glorie des mans.
[11:8] Want de man is niet uit de vrouw, maar de vrouw is uit den man.
[11:9] Want ook de man is niet geschapen om de vrouw, maar de vrouw om den man.
[11:10] Daarom moet de vrouw een teeken van macht op het hoofd hebben, om der engelen wil. 
[11:11]  Hoe het ook zij, de vrouw is niet zonder den man, noch de man zonder de vrouw, in den Heere.
[11:12] Want zooals de vrouw uit den man is, zoo is ook de man door de vrouw, maar alles is uit God.
[11:13] Oordeelt onder u zelven: is het betamelijk dat een vrouw ongesluierd tot God bidt?
[11:14] Leert de natuur zelve u niet dat het een schande is voor een man als hij lang haar draagt?
[11:15] Maar als een vrouw lang haar draagt is haar dit tot glorie, omdat het lange haar tot een sluier haar gegeven is.
[11:16] Doch als iemand belieft twistziek te zijn, wij hebben zoodanige gewoonte niet, zoomin als de gemeenten Gods.
[11:17] Maar als ik u deze vermaning geef dan prijs ik u niet, omdat gij niet samenkomt om beter maar om erger te worden.
[11:18] Want vooreerst hoor ik dat er scheuringen onder u zijn, als gij in de gemeente samenkomt.
[11:19] En ten deele geloof ik het, omdat er sekten onder u moeten zijn, opdat de oprechten onder u openbaar worden.
[11:20] Als gij dan samenkomt, dan is het niet des Heeren Avondmaal dat gij eet.
[11:21] Want bij het eten neemt ieder vooraf zijn eigen maaltijd, en de een is hongerig en de ander is overdadig.
[11:22] Wat? Hebt gij dan geen huizen om te eten en te drinken? Of veracht gij de gemeente Gods en maakt gij beschaamd degenen die niets hebben? Wat zal ik u zeggen? Zal ik u prijzen? In dezen prijs ik u niet.
[11:23] Want ik heb van den Heere ontvangen hetgeen ik u ook heb overgeleverd, dat de Heere Jezus in den nacht waarin Hij werd verraden, brood nam;
[11:24] en als Hij gedankt had brak Hij het en zeide: Neemt, eet, dat is mijn lichaam, dat voor u gebroken is; doet dat tot mijn gedachtenis.
[11:25] Alzoo ook den drinkbeker, na den maaltijd, zeggende: Deze drinkbeker is het nieuwe verbond in mijn bloed; doet dat, zoo dikwijls als gij dien drinken zult, tot mijn gedachtenis.
[11:26] Want zoo dikwijls als gij dit brood zult eten en den drinkbeker zult drinken, verkondigt gij den dood des Heeren, totdat Hij komt.
[11:27] Zoo dan, wie onwaardiglijk het brood zal eten of den drinkbeker des Heeren zal drinken, die zal schuldig zijn aan het lichaam en het bloed des Heeren.
[11:28] De mensch onderzoeke dan zich zelven en alzoo ete hij van het brood en drinke uit den drinkbeker.
[11:29] Want zoo wie eet en drinkt, die eet en drinkt zich zelven ten oordeel, als hij het lichaam des Heeren niet onderscheidt. 
[11:30]  Daarom zijn onder ulieden veel zwakken en zieken, en niet weinigen slapen.
[11:31] Want als wij ons zelven onderzochten dan zouden wij niet geoordeeld worden;
[11:32] maar als wij door den Heere geoordeeld worden dan worden wij gekastijd, opdat wij niet met de wereld zouden veroordeeld worden.
[11:33] Zoo dan, mijn broeders, als gij samenkomt om te eten, wacht dan op elkander.
[11:34] Als iemand honger heeft dan moet hij te huis eten, opdat gij niet tot een oordeel samenkomt. De overige dingen zal ik regelen als ik zal gekomen zijn.  
[12:1] Aangaande de geestelijke gaven, broeders, wil ik niet dat gij in onkunde zijt.
[12:2] Gij weet dat gij, toen gij heidenen waart, tot de stomme afgoden u liet trekken, zooals men u leide.
[12:3] Daarom verklaar ik u dat niemand, die in den Geest Gods spreekt, zeggen zal: Jezus is een vervloeking; en niemand kan zeggen: Jezus is Heer! dan in den Heiligen Geest.
[12:4] Verschillende gaven nu zijn er, maar de Geest is dezelfde;
[12:5] en verschillende bedieningen zijn er, en dezelfde Heer;
[12:6] en verschillende werkingen zijn er, doch dezelfde God, die alles werkt in allen.
[12:7] Aan ieder nu wordt de openbaring des Geestes gegeven tot nuttigheid.
[12:8] Want aan den een wordt door den Geest gegeven het woord der wijsheid, doch aan den ander het woord der kennis, naar denzelfden Geest;
[12:9] aan een ander geloof, in denzelfden Geest, en aan een ander gaven van genezingen, in denzelfden Geest,
[12:10] en aan een ander werkingen van krachten, en aan een ander profetie, en aan een ander onderscheiding der geesten, en aan een ander verschillende soort van talen, en aan een ander verklaring van talen.
[12:11] Dit alles nu werkt een en dezelfde Geest, bedeelende aan ieder in het bijzonder zooals Hij wil. 
[12:12]  Want zooals het lichaam één is en vele ledematen heeft en al de ledematen des lichaams, die vele zijn, maar één lichaam zijn, alzoo ook de Christus.
[12:13] Want ook in één Geest zijn wij allen tot één lichaam gedoopt, hetzij Joden, hetzij Grieken, hetzij dienstbaren, hetzij vrijen; en wij zijn allen gelaafd tot één Geest.
[12:14] En ook het lichaam is niet één lidmaat maar veel ledematen. 
[12:15]  Als nu de voet zou zeggen: omdat ik de hand niet ben, zoo ben ik niet van het lichaam; zou hij daarom niet van het lichaam zijn?
[12:16] En als het oor zou zeggen: omdat ik geen oog ben, zoo ben ik niet van het lichaam; zou het daarom niet van het lichaam zijn?
[12:17] Als het geheele lichaam oog zou zijn, waar zou dan het gehoor zijn? Als het geheel gehoor zou zijn, waar zou de reuk zijn?
[12:18] Maar nu heeft God de ledematen gesteld, elk in het lichaam, zooals Hij gewild heeft.
[12:19] Als zij allen één lidmaat waren, waar zou dan het lichaam zijn?
[12:20] Maar nu zijn er vele ledematen, doch het lichaam is één.
[12:21] Nu kan het oog niet zeggen tot de hand: ik heb u niet noodig! Of wederom het hoofd tot de voeten: ik heb u niet noodig!
[12:22] Maar integendeel, de ledematen des lichaams die de zwakste schijnen, zijn noodzakelijk,
[12:23] en die ons toeschijnen de oneerlijkste des lichaams te zijn, die omringen wij met te meer eer, en onze onsierlijkste hebben overvloediger versiering.
[12:24] Want onze sierlijke ledematen hebben het niet noodig. Maar God heeft het lichaam samengesteld, gevende overvloediger eer aan die het noodig hebben;
[12:25] opdat er geen scheuringen zijn in het lichaam, maar de ledematen voor elkander dezelfde zorg dragen.
[12:26] En als één lidmaat lijdt, dan lijden al de ledematen mede; als één lidmaat glorie ontvangt, dan zijn al de ledematen mede verheugd.
[12:27] Gijlieden nu zijt het lichaam van Christus, en ledematen in het bijzonder. 
[12:28]  En God heeft sommigen in de gemeente aangesteld, vooreerst apostelen, ten tweede profeten, ten derde leeraars, daarna krachten, daarna gaven van genezingen, helpers, bestuurders, verschillende soorten van talen.
[12:29] Allen zijn toch geen apostelen? Allen zijn toch geen profeten? Allen zijn geen leeraars? Allen zijn geen krachten?
[12:30] Niet allen hebben gaven van genezingen? Niet allen spreken in verschillende talen? Niet allen zijn uitleggers?
[12:31] Doch tracht gij allen naar de beste gaven. En een nog uitmuntender weg ga ik u aanwijzen.  
[13:1] Als ik spreek in de talen der menschen en de engelen, maar ik heb geen liefde, dan ben ik een klinkende bel geworden of een klaterend metaal.
[13:2] En als ik de profetie heb en alle verborgenheden weet, en alle kennis, en als ik al het geloof heb zoodat ik bergen zou verzetten, maar geen liefde heb, dan ben ik niets.
[13:3] En als ik al mijn goederen uitdeel om de armen te voeden, en als ik mijn lichaam overgeef om verbrand te worden, maar geen liefde heb, het zou mij niets baten.
[13:4] De liefde is geduldig; de liefde is vriendelijk; de liefde is niet afgunstig; zij handelt niet lichtvaardiglijk; zij is niet opgeblazen;
[13:5] zij handelt niet onbeschaamd; zij zoekt niet haar eigen baat; zij is niet bitter; zij denkt geen kwaad;
[13:6] zij verheugt zich niet over de onrechtvaardigheid; zij verheugt zich met de waarheid;
[13:7] alles bedekt zij; alles gelooft zij; alles hoopt zij; alles verdraagt zij. 
[13:8]  De liefde vergaat nooit. Maar hetzij profetieën, zij zullen verdwijnen; hetzij talen, zij zullen ophouden; hetzij kennis, zij zal verdwijnen.
[13:9] Want ten deele kennen wij en ten deele profeeteren wij.
[13:10] Doch wanneer het volmaakte zal gekomen zijn, dan zal verdwijnen wat ten deele is.
[13:11] Toen ik een kind was, sprak ik als een kind, oordeelde ik als een kind, redeneerde ik als een kind; nu ik man ben geworden, heb ik afgelegd wat van het kind was.
[13:12] Want nu zien wij door een spiegel, in een raadsel maar alsdan aanschijn tegen aanschijn. Nu ken ik te deele, maar dan zal ik ten volle kennen zooals ik ook ten volle gekend ben.
[13:13] En nu blijft geloof, hoop, liefde, deze drie; doch de voortreffelijkste van deze is de liefde.  
[14:1] Volgt de liefde na en tracht naar de geestelijke gaven, maar voornamelijk dat gij moogt profeteeren.
[14:2] Want die spreekt in een vreemde taal, die spreekt niet tot menschen maar tot God, want niemand verstaat het, doch in den geest spreekt hij verborgenheden.
[14:3] Maar die profeteert spreekt den menschen tot stichting en vermaning en vertroosting.
[14:4] Die in een vreemde taal spreekt bouwt zich zelven op, maar die profeteert bouwt de gemeente op.
[14:5] Ik wil wel dat gij allen spreekt in vreemde talen, maar vooral dat gij profeteert; want die profeteert is meerder dan die in vreemde talen spreekt, tenzij dan dat hij ze vertale, opdat de gemeente opbouwing ontvange. 
[14:6]  Maar nu, broeders, als ik tot u zou komen in vreemde talen sprekende, wat voordeel zou ik u toebrengen, indien ik tot u niet zou spreken óf in openbaring, óf in kennis, óf in profetie, óf in leering?
[14:7] Zelfs de ziellooze dingen die geluid geven, hetzij een fluit, hetzij een harp, als zij geen verscheidenheid in toonen geven, hoe zal geweten worden wat op de fluit of op de harp gespeeld wordt?
[14:8] En ook als een bazuin een verward geluid geeft, wie zal zich gereed maken tot den oorlog?
[14:9] Alzoo ook gijlieden, als gij door de vreemde taal een niet verstaanbaar geluid geeft, hoe zal dan geweten worden wat er gezegd wordt? Want gij zult zijn als sprekende tot de lucht.
[14:10] Er zijn immers zoo velerlei soorten van stemmen in de wereld, en geene is zonder stem.
[14:11] Wanneer ik dan de beteekenis der stem niet ken, dan zal ik vreemd zijn voor den spreker en de spreker zal voor mij vreemd zijn.
[14:12] Alzoo ook gijlieden, terwijl gij ijverig zijt naar geestelijke gaven, tracht ze in overvloed te hebben tot opbouwing der gemeente.
[14:13] Daarom die in een vreemde taal spreekt moet bidden dat hij ze moge vertalen.
[14:14] Want als ik bid in een vreemde taal, dan bidt mijn geest wel, maar mijn verstand is zonder vrucht.
[14:15] Wat dan gedaan? Ik zal bidden met den geest, maar zal ook bidden met het verstand; ik zal zingen met den geest, maar zal ook zingen met het verstand.
[14:16] Anders, als gij dankzegt met den geest, hoe zal hij die de plaats van een onkundige vervult het Amen zeggen op uw dankzegging? Want hij weet niet wat gij zegt.
[14:17] Want gij dankzegt dan wel goed, maar de andere wordt niet opgebouwd.
[14:18] Ik dank God dat ik meer in vreemde talen spreek dan gij allen.
[14:19] Doch in een vergadering wil ik liever vijf woorden spreken met mijn verstand, opdat ik ook anderen zou onderwijzen, dan tien duizend woorden in een vreemde taal. 
[14:20]  Broeders, zijt geen kinderen in het verstand, maar zijt kinderen in de boosheid, en zijt volwassenen in het verstand.
[14:21] In de wet is geschreven: In andere talen en met lippen van anderen zal Ik spreken tot dit volk, en ook alzoo zullen zij naar Mij niet hooren, zegt de Heere.
[14:22] Zoo dan, de vreemde talen zijn tot een teeken, niet voor de geloovigen maar voor de ongeloovigen, doch de profetie is niet voor de ongeloovigen maar voor de geloovigen.
[14:23] Als dan de geheele gemeente samengekomen was op dezelfde plaats en allen spraken in vreemde talen, en er zouden onkundigen of, ongeloovigen binnenkomen, zouden die niet zeggen dat gij onzinnig waart?
[14:24] Maar als allen profeteeren, en een ongeloovige of onkundige zou binnenkomen, dan zou hij van allen bestraft en van allen geoordeeld worden;
[14:25] de verborgen dingen zijns harten zouden openbaar worden en alzoo, vallende op het aangezicht, zal hij God aanbidden erkennende dat God waarlijk in uw midden is.
[14:26] Hoe dan gedaan, broeders? Als gij samenkomt heeft elk een lofzang, een onderwijzing, een openbaring, een vreemde taal, een vertaling; laat alles tot opbouwing geschieden.
[14:27] Als iemand spreekt in een vreemde taal, laat het zijn door twee of hoogstens drie, en op beurte, en één moet het vertalen.
[14:28] Maar als er geen vertaler is dan moet hij die een vreemde taal spreekt, zwijgen in de vergadering, en hij moet spreken tot zich zelven en tot God.
[14:29] Wat nu de profeten betreft, dat er twee of drie spreken, en de anderen moeten het beoordeelen.
[14:30] Maar als aan een ander, die daar nedergezeten is, iets geopenbaard is, dat de eerste dan zwijge.
[14:31] Want gij kunt allen profeteeren, de een na den ander, opdat allen geleerd en allen getroost worden.
[14:32] En de geesten der profeten zijn aan de profeten onderworpen.
[14:33] Want God is niet een God van tweedracht maar van vrede. 
[14:34]  Gelijk in al de gemeenten der heiligen moeten de vouwen in de vergaderingen zwijgen; want het is haar niet geoorloofd te spreken, maar zij moeten onderdanig zijn, zooals de wet zegt.
[14:35] Doch als zij iets willen leeren, dan moeten zij in huis haar eigen mannen er over vragen, want het is onwelvoegelijk voor een vrouw te spreken in de vergadering. 
[14:36]  Of is het woord Gods van u voortgekomen? Of is het tot u alleen gekomen?
[14:37] Als iemand meent een profeet te zijn of een geestelijke, die moet bekennen van hetgeen ik u schrijf dat het van den Heere is.
[14:38] Doch als iemand onkundig is, die zij onkundig.
[14:39] Alzoo, mijn broeders, tracht naar het profeteeren en verbiedt niet te spreken in vreemde talen;
[14:40] maar dat alles betamelijk en met orde geschiede!  
[15:1] Nu herinner ik u, broeders, het Evangelie dat ik u verkondigd heb, dat gij ook aangenomen hebt, waarin gij ook vast staat, waardoor gij ook behouden wordt.
[15:2] Ik herinner u met welke woorden ik het u verkondigd heb, indien gij het behoudt; anders zoudt gij tevergeefs geloofd hebben.
[15:3] Want ik heb ulieden vooreerst overgeleverd, hetgeen ik ook ontvangen heb, dat Christus gestorven is voor onze zonden volgens de Schrifturen,
[15:4] en dat Hij is begraven en dat Hij is opgewekt op den derden dag volgens de Schrifturen,
[15:5] en dat Hij aan Kefas is verschenen, daarna aan de twaalven.
[15:6] Daarna is Hij verschenen aan meer dan vijfhonderd broeders op eenmaal, waarvan de meesten nog in leven zijn, doch sommigen zijn gestorven.
[15:7] Daarna is Hij verschenen aan Jakobus, daarna aan al de apostelen.
[15:8] En ten laatste van allen is Hij ook aan mij verschenen, als aan een ontijdig geborene.
[15:9] Want ik ben de geringste der apostelen die niet waardig ben apostel genoemd te worden, omdat ik de gemeente Gods vervolgd heb.
[15:10] Maar door de genade Gods ben ik wat ik ben, en zijn genade, die aan mij is bewezen, is niet tevergeefs geweest, maar ik heb meer gearbeid dan zij allen; doch niet ik, maar de genade Gods met mij.
[15:11] Doch hetzij ik, hetzij de anderen, alzoo prediken wij en alzoo hebt gij geloofd.
[15:12] Als dan Christus gepredikt wordt dat Hij is opgewekt uit de dooden, hoe zeggen dan sommigen uit ulieden dat er geen verrijzenis van dooden is?
[15:13] Want als er geen verrijzenis van dooden is, dan is ook Christus niet opgewekt.
[15:14] En als Christus niet opgewekt is, dan is ook onze prediking tevergeefs, en ook uw geloof is dan tevergeefs;
[15:15] dan worden wij ook valsche getuigen Gods bevonden, want wij hebben getuigd aangaande God dat Hij den Christus heeft opgewekt, dien Hij niet opgewekt heeft, indien er geen dooden opgewekt worden.
[15:16] Want als er geen dooden opgewekt worden dan is ook Christus niet opgewekt.
[15:17] En als Christus niet opgewekt is dan is uw geloof tevergeefs, dan zijt gij nog in uw zonden;
[15:18] dan zijn ook verloren degenen die in Christus gestorven zijn.
[15:19] Indien wij alleen in dit leven op Christus hopende zijn, dan zijn wij de ellendigste van alle menschen.
[15:20] Maar nu, Christus is opgewekt uit de dooden de Eersteling der gestorvenen.
[15:21] Want naardien door een mensch de dood is, zoo is ook door een mensch de verrijzenis der dooden.
[15:22] Want gelijk in Adam allen sterven, zoo ook zullen allen in Christus levend gemaakt worden. 
[15:23]  Maar een ieder in zijn eigen orde: de Eersteling Christus, daarna die van Christus zijn, in zijn verschijning,
[15:24] daarna komt het einde, wanneer Hij het koninkrijk aan God en den Vader zal overgegeven hebben, wanneer Hij alle heerschappij en alle macht en kracht zal vernietigd hebben.
[15:25] Want Hij moet heerschen totdat Hij al de vijanden onder zijn voeten zal gelegd hebben.
[15:26] De laatste vijand die vernietigd wordt is de dood.
[15:27] Want alles onderwerpt Hij aan zijn voeten. En wanneer Hij zegt dat alles onderworpen is, dan is het zonder twijfel dat Hij is uitgezonderd die Hem alles onderworpen heeft.
[15:28] En wanneer Hem alles onderworpen zal zijn, dan zal ook de Zoon zelf onderworpen worden aan Dengene die Hem alles onderworpen heeft, opdat God zij alles in allen.
[15:29] Anders wat zullen zij doen die gedoopt zijn voor de dooden? Als er in ‘t geheel geen dooden opgewekt worden, wat worden zij dan voor hen gedoopt?
[15:30] En ook wij, wat loopen wij dan elk uur gevaar?
[15:31] Dagelijks sterf ik, broeders! Ik betuig dit als uw roem, dien ik heb in Christus Jezus onzen Heere.
[15:32] Als ik op menschelijke wijze te Efesus tegen de wilde beesten heb gevochten, wat zou me dat baten? Als er geen dooden opgewekt worden, laat ons dan eten en drinken, want morgen sterven wij!
[15:33] Doolt niet! Kwade samensprekingen bederven goede zeden.
[15:34] Ontwaakt rechtvaardiglijk en zondigt niet. Want sommigen hebben geen kennis van God. Tot beschaming zeg ik het u. 
[15:35]  Maar, zal iemand zeggen: hoe worden de dooden opgewekt? En met welk lichaam komen zij?
[15:36] Gij onverstandige, wat gij zelf zaait wordt niet levend tenzij het gestorven is;
[15:37] en wat gij zaait, daarvan zaait gij toch niet het lichaam dat er van komen zal, maar een enkelen graankorrel, bij voorbeeld van tarwe, of van een ander zaad;
[15:38] doch God geeft daaraan een lichaam zooals Hij wil, en aan elk der zaden een lichaam naar zijn aard.
[15:39] Niet alle vleesch is hetzelfde vleesch, maar een ander is van menschen, en een ander van beesten, en een ander van vogelen, en een ander van visschen.
[15:40] Er zijn ook bovenaardsche lichamen en aardsche lichamen. Maar een ander is de glorie der bovenaardschen en een andere die der aardschen.
[15:41] Een andere is de glorie der zon, en een andere de glorie der maan, en een andere de glorie der sterren; want de eene ster verschilt zelfs van de andere in glorie.
[15:42] Alzoo ook de verrijzenis der dooden. Er wordt gezaaid in verderfelijkheid, er wordt opgewekt in onverderfelijkheid;
[15:43] er wordt gezaaid in oneer, er wordt opgewekt in glorie; er wordt gezaaid in zwakheid, er wordt opgewekt in kracht.
[15:44] Een zinnelijk lichaam wordt gezaaid en een geestelijk lichaam wordt opgewekt. Als er een zinnelijk lichaam is, dan is er ook een geestelijk.
[15:45] Gelijk ook geschreven is: De eerste mensch, Adam, werd tot een levende ziel. Maar de laatste Adam werd tot een levendmakenden Geest.
[15:46] Doch niet het geestelijke is eerst, maar het natuurlijke; daarna het geestelijke.
[15:47] De eerste mensch is aardsch, uit de aarde; de tweede mensch is uit den hemel.
[15:48] Hoedanig de aardsche is, zoodanig zijn ook de aardschen, en hoedanig de bovenaardsche is, zoodanig zijn ook de bovenaardschen.
[15:49] En gelijk wij het beeld des aardschen gedragen hebben, zoo zullen wij ook het beeld des bovenaardschen dragen.
[15:50] Doch dit zeg ik, broeders, dat vleesch en bloed Gods koninkrijk niet kunnen beërven, en dat de verderfelijkheid de onverderfelijkheid niet beërft. 
[15:51]  Ziet, ik zeg ulieden een verborgenheid. Wij zullen wel niet allen sterven, maar wij zullen allen veranderd worden, in een wenk, in een oogenblik, bij de laatste bazuin.
[15:52] Want de bazuin zal slaan en de dooden zullen onverderfelijk opgewekt worden en wij zullen veranderd worden.
[15:53] Want dit verderfelijke moet met onverderfelijkheid bekleed worden, en dit sterfelijke moet met onsterfelijkheid bekleed worden.
[15:54] En wanneer dit verderfelijke zal bekleed zijn met onverderfelijkheid, en dit sterfelijke zal bekleed zijn met onsterfelijkheid, dan zal het woord geschieden dat geschreven is: De dood is verslonden tot overwinning.
[15:55] O dood, waar is uw overwinning? O dood, waar is uw prikkel?
[15:56] De prikkel nu van den dood is de zonde, en de kracht der zonde is de wet.
[15:57] Maar Gode zij dank, die ons de overwinning geeft door onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[15:58] Alzoo dan, mijn beminde broeders, zijt standvastig, onbewegelijk, altijd overvloedig in het werk des Heeren, daar gij weet dat uw arbeid niet tevergeefs is in den Heere.  
[16:1] Aangaande de kollekte nu voor de heiligen, doet gij alzoo als ik bevolen heb aan de gemeenten van Galatië.
[16:2] Op den eersten dag van elke week legge een ieder van u iets bij zich zelven ter zijde, vergaderende volgens zijn welvaren, opdat niet als ik kom die kollekte gehouden worde.
[16:3] En wanneer ik gekomen zal zijn zal ik degenen, die gij door uw brieven geschikt acht, zenden om uw gift naar Jerusalem over te brengen.
[16:4] En als het geschikt is dat ik zelf ga dan zullen zij met mij gaan. 
[16:5]  Doch ik zal tot u komen als ik door Macedonië zal gegaan zijn, want ik moet door Macedonië gaan.
[16:6] En misschien zal ik bij u blijven of ook den winter doorbrengen, opdat gij mij moogt geleiden waar ik gaan zal.
[16:7] Want ik wil u nu niet in het voorbijgaan zien, want ik hoop eenigen tijd bij u te blijven, als de Heere het zal toelaten.
[16:8] Doch ik zal in Efesus blijven tot Pinksteren.
[16:9] Want voor mij is een groote en krachtige deur geopend en er zijn veel tegenstanders. 
[16:10]  En wanneer Timotheüs zal gekomen zijn, ziet toe dat hij zonder vreeze bij u zij, want hij werkt het werk des Heeren, zooals ook ik.
[16:11] Dat dan niemand hem verachte, maar geleidt hem in vrede, opdat hij tot mij kome, want ik verwacht hem met de broeders. 
[16:12]  Wat nu den broeder Apollos betreft, ik heb hem zeer verzocht dat hij tot u zou komen met de broeders, doch het was in het geheel niet naar zijn zin om nu te komen, maar hij zal komen als hij gelegenheid zal hebben. 
[16:13]  Waakt, staat in het geloof, houdt u mannelijk, zijt kloek!
[16:14] Laat al wat gij doet in liefde geschieden! 
[16:15]  En ik verzoek u, broeders, — gij kent het huisgezin van Stefanas, dat het de eerstelingvrucht van Achaje is en dat zij zich zelven gesteld hebben ten dienste der heiligen
[16:16] dat gij u ook onderwerpt aan dezulken en aan elk die medewerkt en arbeidt.
[16:17] Ik ben verblijd over de aankomst van Stefanas en van Fortunatus en van Achaïkus, want wat van uw kant ontbrak dat hebben zij aangevuld.
[16:18] Want zij hebben mijn geest verkwikt en den uwe. Erkent dan dezulken. 
[16:19]  U groeten de gemeenten van Asië. U groeten hartelijk in den Heere, Aquila en Priska, met de gemeente ten hunnen huize.
[16:20] U groeten al de broeders. Groet elkander met een heiligen kus.
[16:21] De groetenis met mijn hand, van Paulus. 
[16:22]  Als iemand den Heere Jezus Christus niet bemint, die zij vervloekt! Maranatha!
[16:23] De genade van den Heere Jezus Christus zij met ulieden!
[16:24] Mijn liefde is met ulieden allen in Christus Jezus! Amen.   

### II Corinthians

[1:1] Paulus, apostel van Jezus Christus, door den wil van God, en Timotheüs de broeder, aan de gemeente Gods die in Korinthe is, met al de heiligen die in geheel Achaje zijn,
[1:2] genade zij ulieden en vrede van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Geprezen zij de God en Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, de Vader der barmhartigheden en de God aller vertroosting,
[1:4] die ons vertroost in al onze verdrukking, opdat wij zouden kunnen vertroosten degenen die in alle verdrukking zijn, door de vertroosting waarmede wij zelven vertroost worden van God.
[1:5] Want gelijk de smarten van Christus over ons overvloedig zijn, zoo ook is door Christus onze vertroosting overvloedig.
[1:6] Doch hetzij dat wij verdrukt worden, het is tot uw vertroosting en behoudenis; hetzij dat wij vertroost worden, het is tot uw vertroosting, die werkzaam is in de volharding van dezelfde smarten die ook wij lijden.
[1:7] En onze hoop is vast op ulieden, wetende dat, gelijk gij deelgenooten zijt van de smarten, gij ook alzoo deelgenooten zijt van de vertroosting. 
[1:8]  Want wij willen niet, broeders, dat gij onkundig zijt van onze verdrukking die ons in Asië overkomen is, zoodat wij overmatig boven onze krachten bezwaard zijn geweest, zoodat wij zelfs wanhoopten aan het leven.
[1:9] Ja zelfs hadden wij in ons zelven reeds het vonnis des doods, opdat wij niet vertrouwen zouden op ons zelven, maar op dien God die de dooden opwekt;
[1:10] die ons uit zoodanigen dood verlost heeft en verlost; op wien wij hopen dat Hij ons ook nog verlossen zal.
[1:11] Ook gijlieden werkt toch mede in het gebed voor ons, opdat voor de gifte door vele personen aan ons toegebracht, voor ons ook door velen dankzegging gebracht worde. 
[1:12]  Want onze roem is deze: de getuigenis van onze konsciëntie dat wij in heiligheid en oprechtheid voor God, niet in vleeschelijke wijsheid, maar in de genade Gods, in de wereld verkeerd hebben, en inzonderheid bij ulieden.
[1:13] Want wij schrijven u geen andere dingen dan die gij leest of ook erkent; doch ik hoop dat gij ze tot den einde toe erkennen zult;
[1:14] zooals gij ook ten deele ons erkend hebt, dat wij uw roem zijn gelijk gij ook de onze zijt, in den dag van onzen Heere Jezus. 
[1:15]  En in dit vertrouwen wilde ik eerst tot ulieden komen, opdat gij een tweede gunst zoudt ontvangen,
[1:16] en langs u naar Macedonië trekken en wederom van Macedonië tot u komen en door ulieden voortgeholpen worden naar Judea.
[1:17] Dit dan willende, heb ik toch niet in lichtvaardigheid gehandeld? Of wat ik wil, dat wil ik toch niet naar het vleesch, opdat bij mij Ja zij Ja, en Neen zij Neen?
[1:18] Doch God is getuige dat ons woord tot u niet is Ja en Neen.
[1:19] Want de Zoon van God, Jezus Christus, die onder u door ons gepredikt is, door mij en Silvanus en Timotheüs, was niet Ja en Neen, maar was Ja in Hem. 
[1:20]  Want zoovele beloften Gods als er zijn, in Hem is het Ja; daarom is ook door Hem het Amen, Gode tot glorie door ons.
[1:21] Maar die ons met ulieden vaststelt in Christus, en die ons gezalfd heeft, is God,
[1:22] die ons ook verzegeld heeft en het onderpand des Geestes in onze harten gegeven heeft. 
[1:23]  Maar ik aanroep God tot getuige over mijn leven, dat ik om u te sparen nog niet naar Korinthe ben gekomen.
[1:24] Niet omdat wij heerschappij voeren over uw geloof, maar wij zijn medearbeiders aan uw blijdschap; want door het geloof staat gij vast.  
[2:1] Doch ik heb bij mij zelven voorgenomen om niet wederom in droefheid tot ulieden te komen.
[2:2] Want als ik ulieden bedroef, wie is het dan die mij kan verblijden, dan alleen degene die door mij bedroefd is?
[2:3] En ik heb dit zelfde geschreven opdat ik niet, als ik kom, droefheid zou hebben van degenen door wie ik verblijd moest worden, vertrouwende op u allen, dat mijn blijdschap uw aller blijdschap is. 
[2:4]  Want uit vele verdrukking en benauwdheid des harten heb ik ulieden geschreven met vele tranen; niet opdat gij zoudt bedroefd worden, maar opdat gij mijn liefde zoudt weten die ik overvloedig voor ulieden heb.
[2:5] Doch als iemand bedroefd heeft, dan heeft hij mij niet bedroefd, maar ten deele, opdat ik hem niet bezware, u allen. 
[2:6]  Den zoodanige is deze bestraffing voldoende, die door de meerderheid is toegedeeld,
[2:7] alzoo dat gij den zoodanige liever moet vergeven en vertroosten, opdat niet door al te groote droefheid de zoodanige worde verslonden.
[2:8] Daarom bid ik u dat gij aan hem de liefde bewijst.
[2:9] Want daartoe heb ik ook geschreven, opdat ik van u de proeve mocht nemen, of gij tot alles gehoorzaam zijt.
[2:10] Want aan wien gij iets vergeeft, die geef ik ook; en wat ik ook vergeven heb, als ik iets heb vergeven, dat deed ik om uwentwil, in de tegenwoordigheid van Christus, opdat de Satan geen voordeel op ons behale,
[2:11] want zijn aanslagen zijn ons niet onbekend. 
[2:12]  Doch toen ik naar Troas kwam om het Evangelie van den Christus, en toen mij een deur geopend was in den Heere,
[2:13] zoo heb ik toch geen rust gehad voor mijn geest omdat ik Titus mijn broeder daar niet vond, maar ik nam van hen afscheid en ging uit naar Macedonië.
[2:14] Doch Gode zij dank, die ons altijd tot de overwinning leidt in Christus en den reuke zijner kennis doet openbaar worden door ons in alle plaats.
[2:15] Want wij zijn een goede reuke van Christus voor God, in degenen die behouden worden en in degenen die verderven.
[2:16] Voor deze laatsten wel een reuke uit den dood tot den dood, maar voor de eersten een reuke uit het leven tot het leven. En wie is bekwaam tot deze dingen?
[2:17] Want wij zijn niet als die velen, die Gods woord te koop aanbieden, maar als uit oprechtheid, maar als uit God, voor Gods aangezicht, spreken wij in Christus.  
[3:1] Beginnen wij wederom ons zelven aan te bevelen? Of hebben wij ook aanbevelingsbrieven noodig aan u of vanwege u, zooals sommigen?
[3:2] Onze brief zijt gij, geschreven in onze harten, bekend en gelezen door alle menschen;
[3:3] omdat het openbaar is dat gij een brief van Christus zijt, door onzen arbeid, geschreven niet met inkt, maar met den Geest des levenden Gods, niet in steenen tafelen, maar in vleeschen tafelen des harten.
[3:4] En een zoodanig vertrouwen hebben wij door Christus op God.
[3:5] Niet dat wij van ons zelven bekwaam zijn om iets te verstaan als uit ons zelven, maar onze bekwaamheid is uit God. 
[3:6]  Die ons ook bekwaam gemaakt heeft als dienaars van een nieuw verbond, niet van de letter maar van den geest; want de letter doodt maar de geest maakt levend.
[3:7] Doch als de bediening des doods, die met letters in steenen gegraveerd is, in glorie is geweest, zoodat de kinderen Israëls niet konden blijven zien op het aangezicht van Mozes, vanwege de glorie zijns aangezichts die voorbijging,
[3:8] hoeveel te meer zal dan niet de bediening des geestes in glorie zijn?
[3:9] Want indien de bediening der veroordeeling glorie was, hoeveel te meer is de bediening der rechtvaardigheid overvloedig in glorie!
[3:10] En de bediening van Mozes, die verheerlijkt was, bezit niet de heerlijkheid in die mate, wegens de alles overtreffende heerlijkheid.
[3:11] Want als hetgeen voorbijging door glorie was, hoeveel te meer zal hetgeen blijft in glorie zijn! 
[3:12]  Zoodanige hoop dan hebbende, gebruiken wij veel vrijmoedigheid,
[3:13] en doen niet zooals Mozes, die een bedekking leide op zijn aangezicht, opdat de kinderen Israëls niet zouden bleven zien op het einde van hetgeen voorbijgaande was.
[3:14] Maar hun zinnen zijn verhard. Want tot den dag van heden blijft dezelfde bedekking bij het voorlezen des Ouden Verbonds, en zij wordt niet weggenomen, omdat zij in Christus voorbijgaat.
[3:15] Maar tot vandaag toe, zoo dikwijls als de wet van Mozes gelezen wordt, ligt een bedekking op hun harte.
[3:16] Maar als het tot den Heere bekeerd zal zijn, dan wordt de bedekking weggenomen. 
[3:17]  Doch de Heere is de Geest, en waar de Geest des Heeren is, daar is vrijheid.
[3:18] Doch wij allen, die met een ongedekt aangezicht de glorie des Heeren als een spiegel weergeven, worden veranderd naar hetzelfde beeld, van glorie tot glorie, als van den Heer des Geestes.  
[4:1] Daarom, nu wij deze bediening hebben naar de ons geschonken barmhartigheid, zoo zijn wij niet moedeloos,
[4:2] maar wij hebben de verborgenheden der schande weggeworpen, niet wandelende in listigheid, noch Gods woord vervalschende, maar door de openbaring der waarheid maken wij ons zelven aannemelijk bij alle konsciëntiën der menschen, voor Gods aangezicht. 
[4:3]  Doch indien ook ons Evangelie bedekt is, dan is het bedekt in degenen die verloren gaan.
[4:4] in wie de god dezer eeuw de zinnen der ongeloovigen heeft verblind, opdat zij niet zouden zien het licht des Evangelies der glorie van Christus, die het beeld van God is.
[4:5] Want niet ons zelven prediken wij, maar Christus Jezus als Heer en ons zelven als uw dienaars om Jezus wil. 
[4:6]  Want dezelfde God die gezegd heeft: uit duisternis schijne het licht! die heeft ook in onze harten geschenen tot verlichting der kennis der glorie van God, in het aangezicht van Jezus Christus. 
[4:7]  Doch wij hebben dezen schat in aarden vaten, opdat de uitnemendheid der kracht zij van God, en niet uit ons,
[4:8] die in alles verdrukt worden, doch niet in het nauw; geen raad wetende, doch niet radeloos;
[4:9] vervolgd, doch niet achtergelaten; nedergeworpen, doch niet verdorven;
[4:10] altijd de dooding van Jezus in het lichaam omdragende opdat ook het leven van Jezus in ons lichaam openbaar zou worden.
[4:11] Want wij worden al levende altijd overgegeven in den dood om Jezus wil, opdat ook het leven van Jezus openbaar zou worden in ons sterfelijk vleesch.
[4:12] Zoo dan, de dood werkt in ons, maar het leven in ulieden. 
[4:13]  Doch hebbende denzelfden geest des geloofs, zooals er geschreven is: Ik heb geloofd daarom heb ik gesproken zoo gelooven wij ook en daarom spreken wij,
[4:14] wetende dat Hij die den Heere Jezus heeft opgewekt, ook ons met Jezus zal opwekken en met u zal doen verschijnen.
[4:15] Want dit alles is om uwentwille, opdat de genade aan velen vermenigvuldigd, de dankzegging overvloediger doe worden tot de glorie van God.
[4:16] Daarom worden wij niet moedeloos, maar al is het ook dat onze uitwendige mensch verdorven wordt, zoo wordt toch onze inwendige dag aan dag vernieuwd.
[4:17] Want onze lichte verdrukking, die maar voor een oogenblik is, werkt ons op de meest uitnemende wijze een eeuwig gewicht van glorie,
[4:18] omdat wij niet het oog hebben op de dingen die zichtbaar zijn, maar op de dingen die niet zichtbaar zijn; want de zichtbare dingen zijn voor een tijd, maar de onzichtbare dingen zijn eeuwig.  
[5:1] Want wij weten, als deze onze aardsche woning zal afgebroken zijn, dat wij een gebouw uit God hebben, een woning zonder handen gemaakt, eeuwig, in de hemelen.
[5:2] Want ook zuchten wij in deze woning, verlangende bekleed te worden met onze woning die uit den hemel is,
[5:3] want wij zullen toch wel bekleed, niet naakt bevonden worden!
[5:4] Want ook wij die in deze woning zijn zuchten bezwaard, omdat wij niet willen ontkleed maar overkleed worden, opdat hetgeen sterfelijk is van het leven moge verslonden worden.
[5:5] En Hij die ons daartoe bereid maakt is God, die ons ook den Geest tot onderpand heeft gegeven.
[5:6] Dewijl wij dan altijd goeden moed hebben en weten dat wij in het lichaam inwonende van den Heere uitwonen,
[5:7] — want door geloof wandelen wij, niet door aanschouwen—
[5:8] zoo hebben wij goeden moed en begeeren liever uit te wonen uit het lichaam en in te wonen bij den Heere. 
[5:9]  Daarom trachten wij ook zeer, hetzij inwonende hetzij uitwonende, om welbehagelijk te zijn aan Hem.
[5:10] Want wij allen moeten openbaar worden voor den rechterstoel van Christus, opdat ieder ontvange naar hetgeen hij door het lichaam gedaan heeft, hetzij goed hetzij kwaad.
[5:11] Wetende dan den schrik des Heeren overtuigen wij menschen. Doch voor God zijn wij openbaar. En ik hoop ook in uw konsciëntiën openbaar te worden.
[5:12] Niet dat wij wederom ons zelven bij u aanprijzen, maar wij geven u gelegenheid om wegens ons te roemen, opdat gij u zoudt kunnen verantwoorden bij degenen die zich beroemen in den uitwendigen schijn en niet in het harte.
[5:13] Want hetzij dat wij buiten zinnen zijn, we zijn het voor God; hetzij dat wij gezond van zinnen zijn, het is voor ulieden. 
[5:14]  Want de liefde van Christus dringt ons,
[5:15] omdat wij dit oordeelen dat één voor allen gestorven is; dan zijn ook allen gestorven. En voor allen is; Hij gestorven opdat de levenden niet meer voor zich zelven zouden leven, maarvoor Hem die voor hen gestorven is en verrezen.
[5:16] Zoo dan, wij kennen van nu af niemand naar het vleesch. En als wij ook Christus naar het vleesch hebben gekend, wij kennen Hem nu toch zoo niet meer.
[5:17] Zoo dan, als iemand in Christus is, dan is hij een nieuw schepsel; de oude dingen zijn voorbijgegaan, ziet, zij zijn nieuw geworden.
[5:18] Maar alles is uit dien God die ons verzoend heeft met zich zelven door Christus, en die aan ons de bediening der verzoening gegeven heeft;
[5:19] namelijk, dat God was in Christus, de wereld met zich zelven verzoenende, hun overtredingen hun niet toerekenende, en in ons het woord der verzoening leggende.
[5:20] Voor Christus dus zijn wij gezanten, als van God die door ons vermaant: wij smeeken voor Christus, laat u met God verzoenen!
[5:21] Want Hem die geen zonde gekend heeft, heeft Hij zonde gemaakt ten onzen behoeve, opdat wij zouden worden rechtvaardigheid Gods in Hem.  
[6:1] Wij dan die mede arbeiden vermanen u ook dat gij de genade Gods niet tevergeefs moogt ontvangen,
[6:2] — want Hij zegt: Ter geschikter tijd heb Ik u gehoord en in den dag der verlossing heb Ik u geholpen. Zie, nu is het de geschikte tijd; zie, nu is het de dag der verlossing!
[6:3] geen aanstoot gevende aan iemand, opdat niet de bediening zou gelasterd worden,
[6:4] maar in alles ons zelven aanbevelende als Gods dienaars, in veel volharding, in verdrukkingen, in moeilijkheden, in benauwdheden,
[6:5] in slagen, in gevangenissen, in oproeren, in arbeid, in waken, in vasten,
[6:6] in reinheid, in kennis, in lankmoedigheid, in lieftalligheid, in den Heiligen Geest, in ongeveinsde liefde,
[6:7] in het woord der waarheid, in de kracht Gods, door de wapenen der rechtvaardigheid ter rechter– en linkerzijde,
[6:8] door eer en oneer, door kwaad en goed gerucht, als verleiders en toch waarachtigen,
[6:9] als onbekenden en toch goed bekend, als stervenden en zie, wij leven; als gekastijd en toch niet gedood,
[6:10] als bedroefden en toch altijd blijde zijnde, als armen en toch velen rijk makende, als niets hebbende en toch alles bezittende. 
[6:11]  Onze mond is opengedaan tegen u, o Korinthiërs, ons hart is uitgebreid.
[6:12] Gij hebt geen kleine plaats in ons, maar gij hebt een kleine plaats in uw eigen gemoed!
[6:13] Doch om gelijke vergelding te hebben— ik spreek als tot kinderen— verbreedt gij ook uw gemoed!
[6:14] Zet u niet onder een zelfde juk met ongeloovigen. Want welke betrekking is er tusschen rechtvaardigheid en onrechtvaardigheid? Of wat gemeenschap is er tusschen licht en duisternis?
[6:15] En welke overeenstemming is er tusschen Christus en Belial? Of welk deel heeft een geloovige met een ongeloovige?
[6:16] En wat overeenkomst heeft een tempel Gods met afgoden? Wij toch zijn een tempel des levenden Gods, zooals God gezegd heeft: Ik zal onder hen wonen en wandelen, en Ik zal hun tot een God zijn en zij zullen mijn volk zijn.
[6:17] Daarom gaat uit hun midden en scheidt u af— zegt de Heere— en raakt het onreine niet aan, en Ik zal u aannemen.
[6:18] En Ik zal u zijn tot een Vader, en gij zult Mij zijn tot zonen en dochteren, zegt de Heere, de Almachtige.  
[7:1] Deze beloften dan hebbende, beminden, laat ons van alle onreinheid van vleesch en geest ons zelven reinigen, volbrengende de heiligmaking in de vreeze Gods. 
[7:2]  Opent uw harten voor ons! Niemand hebben wij onrecht aangedaan, niemand hebben wij benadeeld, van niemand hebben wij voordeel getrokken.
[7:3] Tot veroordeeling spreek ik niet, want ik heb vooraf gezegd dat gij in onze harten zijt om samen te sterven en samen te leven.
[7:4] Groot is mijn vrijmoedigheid bij u, groot is mijn roem ten uwen behoeve; ik ben vervuld met vertroosting, ik ben zeer overvloedig in blijdschap bij al onze verdrukking.
[7:5] Want ook als wij naar Macedonië kwamen heeft ons vleesch geen rust gehad, maar in alles zijn wij verdrukt geweest; van buiten was er strijd, van binnen vreeze.
[7:6] Maar God, die de nedergedrukten vertroost, heeft ons vertroost in de aankomst van Titus.
[7:7] Doch niet alleen in zijn aankomst, maar ook in de vertroosting waardoor hij bij u vertroost is geweest, terwijl hij ons verhaalde van uw verlangen, uw weenen, uw ijver voor mij, zoodat ik mij nog meer verheug. 
[7:8]  Want alhoewel ik u in den brief bedroefd heb, ik heb daar toch geen berouw van; en al had ik er ook berouw van gehad— want ik zie dat die brief u voor een korten tijd bedroefd heeft—
[7:9] zoo ben ik nu toch blijde, niet omdat gij zijt bedroefd geworden, maar omdat gij tot boetvaardigheid zijt bedroefd geworden; want gij zijt bedroefd geworden naar God, zoodat gij in niets van ons nadeel geleden hebt.
[7:10] Want de droefheid naar God werkt boetvaardigheid tot een zaligheid die niet berouwt, maar de droefheid der wereld werkt den dood.
[7:11] Want ziet, dat bedroefd worden naar God, hoe groote zorgvuldigheid heeft dat voor u gewerkt! wat een verdediging, wat een verontwaardiging, wat een vreeze, wat een verlangen, wat een ijver, wat een bestraffing! In alles hebt gij u zelven getoond zuiver te zijn in deze zaak.
[7:12] Zoo dan, als ik u ook geschreven heb, dan is dit niet ter wille van hem die onrecht gedaan heeft, noch ter wille van hem dien onrecht aangedaan is, maar opdat uw zorgvuldigheid ten onzen behoeve zou openbaar worden voor u in Gods tegenwoordigheid. 
[7:13]  Daarom zijn wij vertroost geweest. En bij onze vertroosting zijn wij nog veel overvloediger verblijd geworden over de blijdschap van Titus, omdat zijn geest verkwikt is van u allen.
[7:14] Want als ik in iets bij hem over u geroemd heb, dan ben ik niet beschaamd geworden, maar zooals wij alles tot u in waarheid gesproken hebben, zoo is ook onze roem bij Titus waarheid geweest.
[7:15] En zijn innerlijke genegenheden zijn te overvloediger tot u, als hij gedenkt aan de gehoorzaamheid van u allen, hoe gij hem met vreeze en beving ontvangen hebt.
[7:16] Ik verblijd mij dat ik in alles van u vertrouwen mag hebben.  
[8:1] En wij maken u bekend, broeders, de genade Gods die gegeven is in de gemeenten van Macedonië,
[8:2] hoe dat te midden van veel beproeving en verdrukking, de overvloed hunner blijdschap en hun zeer diepe armoede, heeft uitgeblonken in den rijkdom hunner milddadigheid.
[8:3] Want ik getuig dat zij naar vermogen, ja boven vermogen gewillig waren,
[8:4] met veel aandrang ons smeekende om de gunst van ook deel te mogen hebben; aan dezen dienst jegens de heiligen.
[8:5] En dat niet alleen, zooals wij gehoopt hadden, maar ze gaven zich zelven eerst aan den Heere en aan ons! door den wil van God. 
[8:6]  Daarom hebben wij Titus verzocht om deze gunst ook, aan ulieden te volbrengen, zooals hij te voren begonnen was.
[8:7] Maar gelijk gij overvloedig zijt in alles, in geloof, en woord, en kennis, en allen ijver, en in uw liefde jegens ons, zoo moet gij ook in deze gunst overvloedig zijn.
[8:8] Ik zeg dit niet als gebiedende, maar als om door den ijver van anderen ook de oprechtheid uwer liefde te beproeven. 
[8:9]  Want gij kent de genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, dat Hij, rijk zijnde, arm geworden is om uwentwille, opdat gij door zijn armoede zoudt rijk worden.
[8:10] En in dezen geef ik mijn gedachte. Want dit is ulieden tot nuttigheid, die niet alleen het doen maar het willen al een jaar geleden begonnen zijt.
[8:11] Maar volbrengt nu ook het doen, opdat er een uitvoering gegeven worde aan hetgeen gij wilt, zooals gij ook de begeerte hadt om te willen.
[8:12] Want als eerst de begeerte daar is, dan is zij aangenaam naar hetgeen iemand heeft, niet naar hetgeen hij niet heeft.
[8:13] Want ik zeg dit niet om anderen te verlichten en u te bezwaren, maar opdat er gelijkheid zij.
[8:14] Uw overvloed toch in dezen tegenwoordigen tijd is tot hun hulp, opdat ook hun overvloed eens u tot hulp zij; opdat er gelijkheid zij;
[8:15] zooals er geschreven is: hij die veel verzamelde had geen overvloed en hij die weinig verzamelde kwam niet te kort. 
[8:16]  Gode nu zij dank, die denzelfden ijver voor u gegeven heeft in het hart van Titus,
[8:17] dat hij het verzoek heeft ingewilligd; zelfs was hij zeer ijverig en gewillig om tot u te gaan.
[8:18] Wij hebben dan met hem gezonden den broeder, die in het Evangelie vermaard is door al de gemeenten.
[8:19] En dit niet alleen, maar hij is ook verkozen door de gemeenten om met ons te reizen met deze gave, die van ons bezorgd is tot de heerlijkheid des Heeren zelven en tot betooning van onze bereidvaardigheid.
[8:20] Want wij zoeken te vermijden dat iemand ons zou lasteren in deze groote som die van ons bezorgd wordt.
[8:21] Want wij betrachten het goede, niet alleen voor het aangezicht des Heeren, maar ook voor het aangezicht der menschen.
[8:22] Wij hebben dan met hen onzen broeder gezonden, dien wij in vele dingen dikwijls getrouw bevonden hebben, doch nu nog veel getrouwer vanwege het groot vertrouwen in u. 
[8:23]  Als iemand naar Titus onderzoek doet, hij is mijn medgezel en medearbeider bij u; of naar onze andere broeders, zij zijn afgezanten der gemeenten, een glorie van Christus.
[8:24] Geeft hun dan een bewijs uwer liefde en van onzen roem ten uwen behoeve voor het aangezicht der gemeenten.  
[9:1] Om nu over dezen dienst aan de heiligen aan u te schrijven, dat is mij overbodig,
[9:2] want ik weet uw bereidwilligheid, waarvan ik roem over u bij de Macedoniërs, omdat Achaje al een jaar lang bereid is geweest, en uw ijver heeft meerderen opgewekt. 
[9:3]  Ik heb dan de broeders gezonden, opdat onze roem over u in dit opzicht niet ijdel zou zijn en gij bereid moogt zijn zooals ik gezegd heb;
[9:4] opdat niet, als de Macedoniërs met mij zouden komen, en zij u onvoorbereid zouden vinden, wij, (om niet te zeggen: gij) in dit vertrouwen beschaamd zouden staan.
[9:5] Daarom heb ik het noodig geacht den broeders te verzoeken dat zij eerst naar u zouden gaan en vooraf in orde zouden brengen de u te voren aangekondigde kollekte, opdat die gereed zij als een gewillige, niet als een karige gifte. 
[9:6]  En dit zeg ik: die karig zaait zal ook karig maaien, en die mildelijk zaait zal ook mildelijk maaien.
[9:7] Een ieder doe zooals hij in zijn hart heeft voorgenomen, niet met tegenzin of uit dwang, want God bemint een blijmoedigen gever.
[9:8] En God is machtig allen zegen overvloedig over u te doen worden, opdat gij in alles altijd genoeg hebbende, moogt overvloedig zijn tot alle goed werk,
[9:9] zooals er geschreven is: hij heeft uitgedeeld; hij heeft den armen gegeven; zijn rechtvaardigheid blijft tot in eeuwigheid.
[9:10] Hij nu die den zaaier zaad verschaft, die verschaffe ook brood tot voedsel en zal uw zaad om te zaaien vermenigvuldigen en de vruchten uwer rechtvaardigheid vermeerderen;
[9:11] daar gij in alles rijk zijt tot alle milddadigheid, die door ons dankzegging aan God voortbrengt. 
[9:12]  Want de volbrenging van dezen dienst is niet alleen vervullende de behoeften der heiligen, maar is ook overvloedig door vele dankzeggingen aan God;
[9:13] overmits zij door de proeve dezer bediening God de glorie geven wegens de gehoorzaamheid uwer belijdenis van het Evangelie van Christus en wegens de milddadigheid uwer giften aan hen en aan allen,
[9:14] en wegens hun gebed voor u, naar u verlangende vanwege de alles overtreffende genade Gods over u.
[9:15] Gode zij dank voor zijn onuitsprekelijke gifte!  
[10:1] Ik Paulus zelf, bid u, — als die tegenwoordig zijnde wel gering ben onder u, doch afwezig zijnde stoutmoedig ben tegen u, — bij de zachtmoedigheid en goedertierenheid van Christus,
[10:2] bid ik u dat ik tegenwoordig zijnde niet stoutmoedig moge zijn met die vrijmoedigheid waarmede ik geacht word stoutmoedig te zijn tegen sommigen die ons achten alsof wij naar het vleesch wandelen.
[10:3] Want ofschoon wij wandelen in het vleesch, zoo strijden wij toch niet naar het vleesch.
[10:4] Want de wapenen van onzen strijd zijn niet vleeschelijk, maar krachtig voor God tot nederwerping van sterkten,
[10:5] redeneeringen nederwerpende en alle hoogte die zich verheft tegen de kennis van God, en gevangen nemende alle verstand tot de gehoorzaamheid van Christus;
[10:6] en gereed zijnde om alle ongehoorzaamheid te straffen, als uw gehoorzaamheid volkomen zal zijn.
[10:7] Aanziet gij dan de dingen die voor oogen zijn? Als iemand zich zelven acht van Christus te zijn, die moet wederom bij zich zelven bedenken dat ook wij van Christus zijn zooals hij is.
[10:8] Want al zou ik ook wat overvloediger roemen over onze macht die de Heere gegeven heeft tot uw opbouwing en niet tot uw nederwerping, ook dan zou ik niet beschaamd worden.
[10:9] Maar opdat ik niet den schijn zou hebben door de brieven te willen bevreesd maken,
[10:10] — want de brieven, zeggen zij, zijn wel krachtig en gewichtig, maar de tegenwoordigheid des lichaams is zwak en het woord is verachtelijk
[10:11] zoo moet de zoodanige berekenen dat hetgeen wij in woorden door brieven zijn, als wij afwezig zijn, wij ook zoodanig zijn inderdaad als wij tegenwoordig zijn.
[10:12] Want wij zijn niet stoutmoedig, om ons zelven te rekenen of te vergelijken met sommigen die zich zelven aanbevelen. Maar die zijn onverstandig, daar zij zich zelven met zich zelven meten en zich zelven met zich zelven vergelijken.
[10:13] Doch wij zullen niet boven de mate roemen, maar naar de mate van den regel dien God ons toegevoegd heeft om ook tot bij ulieden te strekken.
[10:14] Want wij strekken ons niet te ver uit, alsof wij niet tot u zouden reiken, want wij zijn ook tot bij u gekomen in het Evangelie van Christus.
[10:15] Niet roemende boven mate in den arbeid van anderen, maar hopende dat, als uw geloof zal vermeerderd zijn, wij onder u zullen grooter worden naar onzen werkkring,
[10:16] om het Evangelie te verkondigen tot de landen die voorbij u gelegen zijn, om niet te roemen in den werkkring van anderen die reeds bereid is. 
[10:17]  Doch die roemt roeme in den Heere.
[10:18] Want niet die zich zelven prijst, die is goedgekeurd, maar dien de Heere prijst.  
[11:1] Och, of gij van mij een weinigske dwaasheid woudt verdragen! — Maar gij zult mij wel verdragen!
[11:2] Want ik ben jaloersch van u met een goddelijke jaloezie; want ik ben het die u heb verloofd aan één man, om u als een reine maagd aan Christus voor te stellen.
[11:3] Doch ik vrees dat uw zinnen misschien worden afgetrokken van de eenvoudigheid die naar Christus leidt, zooals de slang in haar listigheid Eva heeft verleid.
[11:4] Want als er iemand komt die een anderen Jezus zou prediken, dien wij niet gepredikt hebben, of als gij een anderen Geest zoudt ontvangen dien gij niet ontvangen hebt, of een ander Evangelie dat gij niet ontvangen hebt, — dien verdraagt gij wel! 
[11:5]  Ik laat mij toch voorstaan dat ik in niets minder ben dan die uitstekende apostelen!
[11:6] Want al ben ik slecht ter tale, dan ben ik het toch niet in kennis. Doch in alles hebben wij dit onder u getoond in alle opzichten.
[11:7] Of heb ik zonde gedaan als ik mij zelven vernederde om u te verhoogen, omdat ik het Evangelie Gods aan ulieden verkondigd heb om niet?
[11:8] Andere gemeenten heb ik bezwaard, door loon te nemen, om u te bedienen; en als ik bij u was en behoeften had dan was ik niemand tot last.
[11:9] Want in mijn behoeften hebben de broeders voorzien die van Macedonië kwamen; en in alles heb ik mij gewacht van u te bezwaren, en ik zal mij daarvoor wachten.
[11:10] Daar de waarheid van Christus in mij is, zal deze roem, dien ik heb in de gewesten van Achaje, mij niet ontnomen worden.
[11:11] Waarom? — Omdat ik u niet bemin? — God weet het.
[11:12] Maar ik doe dit en zal dit doen, om de gelegenheid af te snijden aan degenen die gelegenheid zoeken om daarin te roemen dat zij aan ons gelijk zijn.
[11:13] Want dezulken zijn schijnapostelen, bedriegelijke arbeiders, zich voordoende als apostelen van Christus.
[11:14] En geen wonder! Want de Satan zelf doet zich voor als een lichtengel!
[11:15] ‘t is dus niets bijzonders dat ook zijn dienaren zich voordoen als dienaars der rechtvaardigheid. Maar hun einde zal zijn naar hun werken! 
[11:16]  Ik zeg nog eens: dat niemand mij aanzie voor een dwaas. Doch als ge dit wilt, neemt mij dan aan als een dwaas, dat ik toch ook een weinigske roemen moge!
[11:17] Wat ik spreek, dat spreek ik dus niet naar den Heere, maar als in dwaasheid, in deze zucht naar roem!
[11:18] Nu er toch velen roemen naar het vleesch, mag ik ook eens roemen.
[11:19] Want gaarne verdraagt gij de dwazen, omdat gij verstandig zijt.
[11:20] Want gij verdraagt het als iemand u dienstbaar maakt, als iemand u opeet, als iemand u berooft, als iemand zich verheft, als iemand u op het gezicht slaat.
[11:21] Ik ben beschaamd om te spreken, alsof wij ook zwak waren geweest. Doch waarin iemand stoutmoedig is (ik spreek in dwaasheid) daar ben ik ook stoutmoedig.
[11:22] Zijn zij Hebreërs? Ik ook. — Zijn zij Israëlieten? Ik ook. — Zijn zij Abrahams nakomelingen? Ik ook.
[11:23] Zijn zij dienaars van Christus? (ik spreek nu als een die buiten zich zelven is), ik sta boven hen; in moeilijkheden ben ik overvloediger, in slagen overvloediger, in gevangenissen menigvuldiger, in doodsgevaren dikwijls;
[11:24] vijfmaal heb ik van de Joden de veertig slagen min één ontvangen;
[11:25] driemaal ben ik gegeeseld, eenmaal ben ik gesteenigd, driemaal heb ik schipbreuk geleden, een dag en nacht heb ik doorgebracht in den afgrond;
[11:26] dikwijls ben ik op reis geweest in gevaar van rivieren, in gevaar van moordenaars, in gevaar vanwege mijn volk, in gevaar vanwege heidenen, in gevaar in de stad, in gevaar in de woestijn, in gevaar op zee, in gevaar onder schijnbroeders,
[11:27] in arbeid en moeite, in slapeloosheid dikwijls, in honger en dorst, in vasten dikwijls, in koude en naaktheid.
[11:28] Zonder nog de dingen die van buiten zijn, heb ik dagelijksche drukte, de zorg voor al de gemeenten.
[11:29] Wie is er zwak, dat ik niet zwak ben? Wie wordt er geërgerd, dat ik niet brand van smart?
[11:30] Als men roemen moet, dan zal ik roemen in mijn zwakheden!
[11:31] De God en Vader van den Heere Jezus, die geprezen zij in der eeuwigheid, weet dat ik niet lieg!
[11:32] In Damaskus liet de stadhouder van den koning Aretas de stad der Damaskenen bezetten, om mij te vangen,
[11:33] en ik werd door een venster in een mand langs den muur afgelaten, en zoo ontsnapte ik aan zijn handen.  
[12:1] Ik moet roemen, ofschoon het niet betamelijk is. Doch ik zal komen tot visioenen en openbaringen des Heeren.
[12:2] Ik ken een mensch in Christus die veertien jaar geleden is opgenomen geweest tot in den derden hemel (hetzij in het lichaam, ik weet het niet; hetzij buiten het lichaam, ik weet het niet; God weet het);
[12:3] Ik ken dan zulk een mensch (hetzij in het lichaam of zonder het lichaam, ik weet het niet; God weet het);
[12:4] dat hij is opgenomen tot het paradijs en gehoord heeft onuitgesproken dingen, die geen mensch uitspreken mag.
[12:5] Op zoodanige zal ik roemen, doch op mij zelven zal ik niet roemen, tenzij in mijn zwakheden.
[12:6] Want als ik zou willen roemen, dan zou ik daarom geen dwaas zijn, want ik zou waarheid spreken. Doch ik laat daarvan af, opdat niemand van mij zou denken boven hetgeen hij van mij ziet of uit mij hoort. 
[12:7]  En opdat ik niet hoovaardig zou worden op de uitnemendheid der openbaringen, is mij gegeven een doorn in het vleesch, een satansengel, om mij te geeselen, opdat ik niet hoovaardig zou worden.
[12:8] Hierover nu heb ik driemaal den Heere aangeroepen, opdat die van mij wijken zou,
[12:9] en Hij heeft tot mij gezegd: mijn genade zij u genoegzaam, want mijn kracht wordt in zwakheid volkomen.
[12:10] Daarom heb ik vermaak in zwakheden, in smadingen, in moeilijkheden, in vervolgingen en benauwdheden, voor Christus; want als ik zwak ben, dan ben ik machtig. 
[12:11]  Ik ben dwaas geworden. Gij hebt mij genoodzaakt, want ik behoorde door u aangeprezen te worden. In niets toch ben ik minder geweest dan die uitstekende apostelen, al ben ik ook niets.
[12:12] Want de kenmerken van een apostel zijn onder u gewrocht in alle volharding, door teekenen en wonderen en krachten.
[12:13] Want wat is er waarin gij minder geweest zijt dan de andere gemeenten, dan alleen daarin dat ik zelf u niet tot bezwaar ben geweest? Vergeeft mij dit ongelijk! 
[12:14]  Ziet, dit is nu de derde keer dat ik gereed ben om tot u te komen en ik zal u niet tot bezwaar zijn. Want ik zoek niet het uwe, maar u. Want niet de kinderen moeten schatten verzamelen voor de ouders, doch de ouders voor de kinderen.
[12:15] En ik zal zeer gaarne de kosten doen en voor uw zielen ten koste gegeven worden. Of zal ik, u overvloedig beminnende, te minder bemind worden?
[12:16] Doch het zij zoo; ik heb u niet bezwaard. Maar slim zijnde, heb ik u door list gevangen. 
[12:17]  Heb ik misschien door iemand van degenen die ik tot u gezonden heb u iets afgeperst?
[12:18] Ik heb Titus aangezocht en met hem den broeder gezonden. Titus heeft u toch niet afgeperst? Hebben wij niet in een zelfden geest gewandeld? Niet in dezelfde voetstappen? 
[12:19]  Sedert langen tijd denkt gij dat wij ons zelven bij u verdedigen. Voor Gods aangezicht in Christus spreken wij. En dit alles, beminden, voor uw opbouwing!
[12:20] Want ik vrees dat, als ik kom, ik u niet zóó zal vinden als ik begeer, en dat ik door u zóó zal gevonden worden als gij niet begeert; dat er misschien twist, jaloezie, gramschap, gekijf, achterklappingen, oorblazingen, verwaandheden, beroerten zijn.
[12:21] Ik vrees dat, als ik wederom kom, mijn God mij bij u zal vernederen en dat ik zal treuren over velen die te voren gezondigd hebben en geen berouw gehad hebben over de onreinheid en hoererij en ontucht die zij bedreven hebben.  
[13:1] Dit is de derde keer dat ik tot u kom. In den mond van twee of drie getuigen zal alle woord vast staan.
[13:2] Ik heb te voren gezegd, toen ik tegenwoordig was voor de tweede keer, en ik zeg nu afwezig zijnde tot degenen die te voren gezondigd hebben en tot al de anderen, dat ik niet sparen zal als ik wederom kom;
[13:3] want gij zoekt een bewijs dat Christus in mij spreekt; Hij die jegens ulieden niet zwak is, maar krachtig is in ulieden.
[13:4] Want wel is Hij gekruisigd uit zwakheid, maar Hij leeft in de kracht Gods; want ook wij zijn zwak in Hem, maar wij zullen leven in de kracht Gods voor u. 
[13:5]  Onderzoekt u zelven of gij in het geloof zijt, beproeft u zelven. Of erkent gij niet dat Christus Jezus in ulieden is? Tenzij dat gij onoprecht zijt.
[13:6] Doch ik hoop dat gij weten zult dat wij niet onoprecht zijn.
[13:7] En wij bidden van God dat gij gansch geen kwaad doen moogt, niet opdat wij goedgekeurd zouden bevonden worden, maar opdat gij het goede zoudt doen, en wij afgekeurd zouden bevonden worden.
[13:8] Want wij vermogen niets tegen de waarheid, maar voor de waarheid.
[13:9] Want wij verheugen ons als wij zwak zijn en gij sterk zijt, en ook dit begeeren wij, uw volmaking. 
[13:10]  Daarom schrijf ik dit, afwezig zijnde, opdat ik, tegenwoordig zijnde, niet strengelijk zou moeten handelen naar de macht die de Heere mij gegeven heeft tot opbouwing en niet tot nederwerping. 
[13:11]  Voorts, broeders, vaartwel, wordt volkomen, zijt getroost, zijt eensgezind, leeft in vrede! En de God van liefde en vrede zal met ulieden zijn!
[13:12] Groet elkander met een heiligen kus. U groeten al de heiligen.
[13:13] De genade van den Heere Jezus Christus, en de liefde Gods, en de gemeenschap des Heiligen Geestes zij met ulieden allen!
[13:14]   

### Galatians

[1:1] Paulus, een apostel— niet van menschen noch door een mensch, maar door Jezus Christus en God den Vader, die Hem opgewekt heeft uit de dooden
[1:2] en al de broeders die met mij zijn, aan de gemeenten van Galatie;
[1:3] genade zij ulieden en vrede van God den Vader, en van onzen Heere Jezus Christus,
[1:4] die zich zelven gegeven heeft voor onze zonden, opdat Hij ons trekken zou uit deze tegenwoordige booze eeuw, naar den wil van God, onzen Vader,
[1:5] wien de glorie zij tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen. 
[1:6]  Ik ben verwonderd dat gij zóó spoedig van dengene die u geroepen heeft in de genade van Christus, afgetrokken zijt naar een ander evangelie.
[1:7] Niet dat er een ander is. Doch er zijn sommigen die u beroeren en die het Evangelie van Christus willen omkeeren.
[1:8] Maar ook al zouden wij, of een engel uit den hemel, ulieden een evangelie verkondigen, anders dan wij u verkondigd hebben, die zij vervloekt!
[1:9] Zooals wij vooraf gezegd hebben, zoo zeg ik nog wederom: als iemand ulieden een evangelie verkondigt, anders dan dat wat gij hebt ontvangen, die zij vervloekt!
[1:10] Want moet ik de menschen tot vriend houden, of God? Of zoek ik aan menschen te behagen? — Als ik nog aan menschen behagen zou, dan zou ik toch geen dienaar van Christus zijn. 
[1:11]  Doch ik verklaar u, broeders! het Evangelie dat van mij verkondigd is, is niet naar den mensch;
[1:12] want ik heb het ook niet van een mensch ontvangen noch geleerd, maar door een openbaring van Jezus Christus.
[1:13] Want gij hebt gehoord van mijn levenswandel, hoe die eertijds was in het jodendom, dat ik bovenmate de gemeente Gods vervolgde en haar verwoestte;
[1:14] en ik stak uit in het jodendom boven velen van mijn leeftijd onder mijn volk, uiterst ijverig zijnde voor mijn vaderlijke inzettingen.
[1:15] Maar toen het behaagd heeft aan God— die mij van mijns moeders lichaam afgezonderd en door zijn genade geroepen heeft
[1:16] om zijn Zoon in mij te openbaren, opdat ik dien prediken zou onder de volken, toen ben ik terstond bij geen vleesch en bloed te rade gegaan;
[1:17] ook ben ik niet opgegaan naar Jerusalem tot degenen die vroeger dan ik apostelen waren, maar ik ben weggegaan naar Arabië, en wederom teruggekeerd naar Damaskus.
[1:18] Daarna ben ik, drie jaar later, opgegaan naar Jerusalem om Kefas te leeren kennen, en ik bleef vijftien dagen bij hem.
[1:19] Doch een anderen van de apostelen zag ik niet, maar wel Jakobus, den broeder des Heeren.
[1:20] Wat ik ulieden schrijf, ziet, voor Gods aangezicht, ik lieg niet!
[1:21] Daarna ben ik gekomen naar de gewesten van Syrië en Cilicië.
[1:22] Doch ik was van aangezicht onbekend bij de gemeenten van Judea die in Christus zijn.
[1:23] Alleenlijk hadden zij gehoord: hij die ons vroeger vervolgde predikt nu het geloof dat hij vroeger verwoestte.
[1:24] En zij gaven in mij de glorie aan God.  
[2:1] Daarna ben ik, veertien jaar later, wederom opgegaan naar Jerusalem met Barnabas, en ook Titus medenemende.
[2:2] Doch ik ging op volgens een openbaring, en ik stelde hun het Evangelie voor dat ik predik onder de volken, maar in het bijzonder aan degenen die in achting waren, opdat ik niet tevergeefs mocht loopen of geloopen hebben.
[2:3] Doch Titus, die met mij was en een Griek was, werd niet genoodzaakt om besneden te worden,
[2:4] ter wille van de binnengekropen zoogenaamde broeders, die binnen geslopen waren om te bespieden onze vrijheid die wij hebben in Christus Jezus, opdat zij ons tot dienstbaarheid mochten brengen;
[2:5] voor wie wij zelfs geen uur hebben geweken door onderwerping, opdat de waarheid des Evangelies bij u zou stand houden.
[2:6] Doch aangaande degenen die geacht waren iets te zijn— hoe zij eertijds geweest zijn gaat mij niet aan God neemt het aangezicht van een mensch niet aan— degenen, zeg ik, die in achting waren hebben mij niets opgelegd.
[2:7] Maar daarentegen, als zij zagen dat aan mij het Evangelie voor de onbesnedenen was toevertrouwd zooals aan Petrus dat voor de besnedenen,
[2:8] — want die in Petrus gewerkt heeft tot het apostelschap voor de besnedenen, die heeft ook in mij gewerkt tot het apostelschap voor de onbesnedenen
[2:9] en als zij verstonden de genade die mij gegeven was, zoo gaven Jakobus, en Kefas, en Johannes, die geacht waren steunpilaren te zijn, aan mij en Barnabas de rechterhand der gemeenschap, opdat wij zouden gaan tot de heidenen en zij tot de besnedenen;
[2:10] mits dat wij zouden gedenken aan de armen, hetgeen ik mij ook altijd gehaast heb om te doen. 
[2:11]  Doch toen Kefas gekomen was naar Antiochië stond ik hem tegen in zijn aangezicht, omdat hij te bestraffen was.
[2:12] Want eer dat sommigen gekomen waren, van Jakobus gezonden, at hij mede met de heidenen, maar toen die gekomen waren onttrok hij zich en scheidde zich af, uit vreeze van degenen die uit de besnedenen waren.
[2:13] En met hem huichelden ook de andere Joden, zoodat zelfs Barnabas werd medegesleept door hun huichelarij.
[2:14] Maar toen ik zag dat zij niet recht wandelden naar de waarheid des Evangelies, sprak ik tot Kefas in aller tegenwoordigheid: als gij die een Jood zijt op zijn heidensch en niet op zijn joodsch leeft, hoe dwingt gij dan de heidenen om op zijn joodsch te leven? 
[2:15]  Wij die van afkomst Joden zijn en niet zondaars uit de heidenen,
[2:16] wij weten toch dat een mensch niet gerechtvaardigd wordt uit de werken der wet, maar alleen door het geloof van Jezus Christus. En wij hebben in Christus Jezus geloofd opdat wij zouden gerechtvaardigd worden uit het geloof van Christus en niet uit de werken der wet, omdat er uit werken der wet geen mensch zal gerechtvaardigd worden.
[2:17] Doch als wij, die zoeken gerechtvaardigd te worden in Christus, ook zelf zondaars worden bevonden, is Christus dan een dienaar der zonde? — In ‘t geheel niet!
[2:18] Want als ik wederom ga opbouwen wat ik afgebroken heb, dan verklaar ik mij zelven voor overtreder.
[2:19] Want ik ben door de wet aan de wet gestorven, opdat ik voor God zou leven.
[2:20] Met Christus ben ik gekruisigd, en nu leef ik niet meer, maar in mij leeft Christus; en wat ik nu leef in het vleesch, dat leef ik in het geloof van Gods Zoon die mij bemind heeft en zich zelven voor mij heeft overgegeven.
[2:21] Ik veracht de genade Gods niet. Want als de rechtvaardigheid door de wet is dan is Christus tevergeefs gestorven.  
[3:1] O onverstandige Galatiërs! wie heeft u betooverd om aan de waarheid niet te gehoorzamen, u voor wier oogen Jezus Christus vooraf beschreven is als gekruisigd zijnde?
[3:2] Dit alleen wil ik van u vernemen: is het uit de werken der wet dat gij den Geest ontvangen hebt, of uit het gehoor van de prediking des geloofs?
[3:3] Zijt gij zóó onverstandig? Begonnen zijnde met den Geest, eindigt gij nu met het vleesch?
[3:4] Hebt gij dan tevergeefs zoodanig geleden? Als het maar tevergeefs was! 
[3:5]  Hij dan die ulieden den Geest mededeelt en krachten onder ulieden werkt, is dat uit de werken der wet of uit het gehoor van de prediking des geloofs?
[3:6] Gelijk Abraham vertrouwde op God en het is hem toegerekend tot rechtvaardigheid;
[3:7] verstaat alzoo dat zij die uit het geloof zijn, zonen van Abraham zijn.
[3:8] En de Schriftuur, die vooraf gezien heeft dat God de volken uit het geloof rechtvaardigt, heeft te voren het Evangelie verkondigd aan Abraham, zeggende: in u zullen al de volken gezegend worden.
[3:9] Dus zij die uit het geloof zijn, worden gezegend met den geloovigen Abraham. 
[3:10]  Zoovelen toch als er zijn uit de werken der wet, die zijn onder den vloek; want er is geschreven: Vervloekt is een ieder die niet blijft in al wat geschreven is in het boek der wet, om dat te doen.
[3:11] En dat niemand in de wet gerechtvaardigd wordt bij God, dat is klaar, want de rechtvaardige zal leven uit geloof.
[3:12] Doch de wet is niet uit geloof, maar zegt: Hij die die deze dingen doet zal daarin leven.
[3:13] Christus heeft ons vrijgekocht uit den vloek der wet, om onzentwille een vloek geworden zijnde, want er is geschreven: Vervloekt is al wie op een hout is gehangen,
[3:14] opdat tot de volken de zegen van Abraham zou komen in Christus Jezus, opdat wij door het geloof de belofte des Geestes zouden ontvangen. 
[3:15]  Broeders, ik spreek naar den mensch. Zelfs een door menschen bevestigd verbond zal niemand vernietigen of daarbij doen.
[3:16] Aan Abraham nu en aan zijn nakomelingschap zijn de beloften gegeven. Hij zegt niet: aan de nakomelingschappen, als van velen, maar als aan één: aan uw nakomelingschap, dat is Christus.
[3:17] Dit bedoel ik: een verbond dat te voren bevestigd is door God, wordt door de wet, die vierhonderd en dertig jaar later gegeven is, niet krachteloos gemaakt, om de belofte te verijdelen.
[3:18] Want als de erfenis uit de wet is, dan is zij niet meer uit de belofte. Doch aan Abraham heeft God ze uit genade gegeven door de belofte.
[3:19] Wat is dan de wet? — Zij is er bijgekomen om de overtredingen, totdat de nakomelingschap zou gekomen zijn, waaraan de belofte gegeven was, besteld door engelen in de hand eens middelaars.
[3:20] En die middelaar is niet van één, maar God is één.
[3:21] Is dan de wet tegen de beloftenissen Gods? In het geheel niet! Want als er een wet was gegeven die machtig was om levend te maken, dan zou waarlijk de rechtvaardigheid uit de wet zijn,
[3:22] Maar de Schriftuur heeft alles onder de zonde besloten, opdat de belofte zou gegeven worden uit het geloof van Jezus Christus aan de geloovigen.
[3:23] Eer dat het geloof kwam waren wij door de wet opgesloten in bewaring, tot het geloof dat openbaar worden zou,
[3:24] zoodat de wet onze opvoedster is geweest om ons te brengen tot Christus, opdat wij uit het geloof zouden gerechtvaardigd worden. 
[3:25]  Doch nu het geloof is gekomen, zijn wij niet meer onder de opvoedster;
[3:26] want gij zijt allen zonen Gods door het geloof in Christus Jezus.
[3:27] Want zoovelen als gij in Christus gedoopt zijt hebt gij Christus aangedaan.
[3:28] Daar is hier geen Jood noch Griek; daar is geen dienstknecht noch vrije; daar is geen mannelijk noch vrouwelijk; want gij zijt allen één in Christus Jezus.
[3:29] En als gij van Christus zijt, dan zijt gij Abrahams nakomelingschap, naar de belofte dus erfgenamen.  
[4:1] Doch ik zeg: zoolang de erfgenaam een kind is verschilt hij niets van een dienstknecht, ofschoon hij heer is van alles;
[4:2] maar hij is onder voogden en verzorgers tot op den tijd die van den vader is gesteld.
[4:3] Alzoo ook wij, toen wij kinderen waren, zijn wij dienstbaar geweest onder de eerste regelen der wereld.
[4:4] Maar toen de volheid des tijds gekomen is heeft God zijn Zoon uitgezonden, die geworden is uit een vrouw, geworden is onder de wet,
[4:5] opdat Hij degenen die onder de wet waren vrijkoopen zou, opdat wij de aanneming tot zonen verkrijgen zouden.
[4:6] En omdat gij zonen zijt heeft God den Geest zijns Zoons uitgezonden in uw harten, die roept: Abba, dat is Vader;
[4:7] zoodat gij niet meer een dienstknecht zijt, maar een zoon; en indien een zoon, dan ook een erfgenaam van God. 
[4:8]  Maar eertijds, toen gij God niet kendet, diendet gij degenen die van nature geen goden zijn.
[4:9] Doch nu gij God kent, ja meer nog van God gekend zijt, hoe keert gij wederom tot de zwakken en arme eerste regelen, waaraan gij wederom u wilt dienstbaar maken?
[4:10] Gij viert dagen, en maanden, en tijden, en jaren!
[4:11] Ik vrees dat ik tevergeefs voor u gearbeid heb. 
[4:12]  Wordt als ik, want ook ik ben geworden als gij, broeders! Ik bid u; gij hebt mij geen ongelijk aangedaan.
[4:13] Doch gij weet dat ik aan u het eerst het Evangelie gepredikt heb wegens een zwakheid van het vleesch,
[4:14] en hetgeen voor u was een beproeving in mijn vleesch, dat hebt gij niet veracht nog verfoeid, maar als een engel Gods hebt gij mij aangenomen, als Christus Jezus.
[4:15] Waar is dan nu uw gelukachting? Want ik geef u dit getuigenis dat gij, als het mogelijk geweest was, uw oogen zoudt hebben uitgetrokken en aan mij gegeven.
[4:16] Ben ik dan uw vijand geworden door u de waarheid te zeggen?
[4:17] De ijver dien zij voor u hebben is niet goed. Maar zij willen u aftrekken van mij, opdat gij hen aanhangen zoudt.
[4:18] Goed is het om altijd in het goede ijverig te zijn, en niet alleen als ik bij u tegenwoordig ben. 
[4:19]  Mijn kinderkens, om wie ik wederom in barensnood ben, totdat Christus in ulieden volwassen zal zijn!
[4:20] Ik wilde nu wel bij u tegenwoordig zijn en veranderen van stem, want ik ben verlegen om uwentwil.
[4:21] Zegt mij, gij die onder de wet wilt zijn, verstaat gij de wet wel?
[4:22] Want er is geschreven dat Abraham twee zonen had, één uit de dienstmaagd en één uit de vrije.
[4:23] Maar de eerste, die uit de dienstmaagd was, is geboren naar het vleesch, maar die uit de vrije is, door de belofte.
[4:24] Deze dingen zijn zinnebeeldig. Want deze vrouwen zijn twee verbonden: de eene van den berg Sinaï, tot dienstbaarheid barende; dat is Hagar.
[4:25] Want de Sinaï is een berg in Arabië, en beteekent het Jerusalem dat nu bestaat, want het is dienstbaar met zijn kinderen.
[4:26] Maar het Jerusalem van hierboven is vrij, en dat is onze moeder.
[4:27] Want er is geschreven: Verheug u, gij onvruchtbare die niet baart; breek uit en roep, gij die geen barensweeën hebt, want de kinderen van de verlatene zijn meer dan van haar die een man heeft.
[4:28] Doch wij, broeders, wij zijn kinderen der belofte, zooals Isaäk.
[4:29] Maar zooals toen degene die naar het vleesch geboren was, vervolgde dengene die naar den geest geboren was, alzoo ook nu.
[4:30] Maar wat zegt de Schriftuur? Werp de dienstmaagd buiten en haar zoon! want de zoon der dienstmaagd zal niet erven met den zoon der vrije.
[4:31] Daarom, broeders, wij zijn niet kinderen van de dienstmaagd maar van de vrije,  
[5:1] Door die vrijheid waarmede Christus ons vrijgemaakt heeft. Staat dan vast en laat u niet wederom vangen door het juk der dienstbaarheid! 
[5:2]  Ziet, ik Paulus zeg ulieden dat, als gij u laat besnijden, Christus u niets zal baten.
[5:3] Ja ik betuig wederom aan een ieder mensch die zich laat besnijden, dat hij schuldig is de geheele wet te onderhouden.
[5:4] Gij hebt geen deel aan Christus, gij die in de wet wilt gerechtvaardigd worden; van de genade zijt gij vervallen.
[5:5] Want wij verwachten door den Geest uit het geloof de hope der rechtvaardigheid.
[5:6] Want in Christus Jezus geldt geen besnijdenis, noch onbesnedenheid, maar geloof, door liefde werkende. 
[5:7]  Gij liept goed! Wie heeft u belet van gehoorzaam te zijn aan de waarheid?
[5:8] Deze meening is niet uit Hem die u roept.
[5:9] Een weinig zuurdeesem doet den geheelen deegklomp zuur worden.
[5:10] Ik vertrouw van u in den Heere dat gij geen ander gevoelen hebt; maar die u beroert zal het oordeel dragen, wie hij ook zij. 
[5:11]  Doch wat mij betreft, broeders, als ik nog de besnijdenis verkondig, wat word ik nog vervolgd? — Dan wordt de aanstootelijkheid van het kruis weggenomen.
[5:12] Ik wou dat zij afgesneden wierden die u ontroeren! 
[5:13]  Want gij zijt tot vrijheid geroepen, broeders! Doch niet tot een vrijheid die een oorzaak is voor het vleesch, maar dient malkander door de liefde.
[5:14] Want de geheele wet wordt in één woord vervuld, in dit: gij zult uw evennaaste beminnen als u zelven.
[5:15] Maar als gij malkander bijt en opeet, ziet toe dat gij niet door malkander wordt verslonden! 
[5:16]  Doch ik zeg: wandelt door den Geest en voldoet niet aan de lusten van het vleesch.
[5:17] Want het vleesch is belust tegen den geest, doch de geest tegen het vleesch. Want die strijden tegen malkander, opdat gij niet zoudt doen datgene wat gij wilt.
[5:18] Doch als gij door den Geest geleid wordt dan zijt gij niet onder de wet.
[5:19] De werken des vleesches nu zijn openbaar, te weten: hoererij, onreinheid, ontucht,
[5:20] afgoderij, tooverij, vijandigheden, twist, jaloesie, toornigheden, gekijf, verdeeldheden, ketterijen,
[5:21] nijdigheid, dronkenschap, brasserijen, en dergelijke, waarvan ik u te voren zeg, zooals ik te voren gezegd heb, dat zij die zulke dingen doen Gods koninkrijk niet zullen erven. 
[5:22]  Doch de vrucht des Geestes is liefde, blijdschap, vrede, geduld, goedertierenheid, goedheid, vertrouwen, zachtmoedigheid, matigheid.
[5:23] Tegen dezulken is de wet niet.
[5:24] Doch die het eigendom van Christus Jezus zijn hebben het vleesch gekruisigd met de driften en de lusten.
[5:25] Als wij leven door den Geest, laat ons dan ook door den Geest wandelen.
[5:26] Laat ons niet ijdele eerzoekers zijn, die malkander tergen, malkander benijden.  
[6:1] Broeders, indien ook een mensch gevallen ware in eenige overtreding, dan moet gij die geestelijk zijt denzulke oprichten in den geest der zachtmoedigheid, ziende op u zelven, dat ook gij niet bekoord wordt.
[6:2] Draagt malkanders lasten en alzoo vervult gij de wet van Christus.
[6:3] Want zoo iemand meent iets te zijn die niets is, die bedriegt zich zelven.
[6:4] Laat ieder zijn eigen werk beproeven, en dan zal hij roem hebben in zich zelven alleen, en niet in dat van een ander.
[6:5] Want een ieder zal zijn eigen pak dragen. 
[6:6]  Maar die onderwezen wordt in het woord moet mededeelen aan die hem onderwijst in alle goede dingen.
[6:7] Dwaalt niet! God laat zich niet bespotten. Want zoo wat, een mensch zaait dat zal hij ook maaien.
[6:8] Want hij die zaait op zijn eigen vleesch zal uit het vleesch verderf maaien; maar hij die zaait op den geest zal uit den geest eeuwig leven maaien.
[6:9] Laat ons niet moede worden in het goeddoen, want ter rechter tijd zullen wij maaien als wij niet verslappen.
[6:10] Zoo dan, nu wij tijd hebben, laat ons het goede doen jegens allen, maar het meest jegens de geloofsgenooten. 
[6:11]  Ziet eens met hoe groote letters ik u geschreven heb met eigen hand!
[6:12] Zoovelen als zich schoon voordoen willen in het vleesch die dwingen u besneden te worden, alleen opdat zij niet zouden vervolgd worden vanwege het kruis van Christus.
[6:13] Want zij zelven die besneden worden houden de wet niet, maar zij willen dat gij zoudt besneden worden, opdat zij zouden roemen in uw vleesch.
[6:14] Maar verre zij het van mij te roemen, dan alleen in het kruis van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, door hetwelk de wereld mij gekruisigd is en ik der wereld.
[6:15] Want in Christus Jezus heeft noch de besnijdenis eenige kracht, noch de onbesnedenheid, maar een nieuw schepsel.
[6:16] En zoovelen als naar dezen regel zullen wandelen, over die zal vrede zijn en barmhartigheid, en over het Israël Gods.
[6:17] En overigens, niemand doe mij overlast aan, want ik draag de merkteekenen van den Heere Jezus in mijn lichaam. 
[6:18]  De genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus zij met uw geest, broeders! Amen.

[1:1] Paulus, een apostel van Christus Jezus, door den wil van God, aan de heiligen die in Efesus zijn, en geloovigen in Christus Jezus,
[1:2] genade zij ulieden en vrede van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Geprezen zij de God en Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, die ons gezegend heeft met allen geestelijken zegen, in de hemelsche plaatsen, in Christus,
[1:4] zooals Hij ons heeft uitverkoren in Hem, vóór de grondlegging der wereld, opdat wij heilig en onbesmet zouden zijn voor zijn aangezicht;
[1:5] en zooals Hij ons in liefde heeft uitverkoren om tot kinderen aangenomen te worden, door Jezus Christus, tot zich zelven, naar het welbehagen van zijn wil,
[1:6] tot lof der glorie zijner genade, waarmede Hij ons heeft begenadigd in den Geliefde;
[1:7] in wien wij hebben de verlossing door zijn bloed, de vergiffenis der overtredingen, naar den rijkdom zijner genade,
[1:8] waarmede Hij overvloedig is geweest jegens ons, in alle wijsheid en verstand;
[1:9] daar Hij ons deed kennen de verborgenheid van zijn wil, naar zijn welbehagen, dat Hij in Hem had voorgenomen,
[1:10] tot de bedeeling van de volheid der tijden, om alle dingen onder één Hoofd samen te brengen in Christus, die in de hemelen en die op de aarde zijn; 
[1:11]  In Hem, in wien wij ook een erfdeel geworden zijn, te voren daartoe verkoren zijnde naar het voornemen van Hem die alle dingen werkt naar den raad van zijn wil,
[1:12] opdat wij zouden zijn tot lof zijner glorie, wij die te voren gehoopt hadden in Christus;
[1:13] in wien ook gij, — die het woord der waarheid, het Evangelie uwer behoudenis gehoord hebt— in wien ook gij, die geloofd hebt, verzegeld zijt door den Heiligen Geest der belofte,
[1:14] die een onderpand is onzer erfenis, tot verlossing van zijn eigendom, tot lof zijner glorie. 
[1:15]  Daarom houd ook ik— die gehoord heb van het geloof in den Heere Jezus dat onder u is, en van de liefde tot al de heiligen,
[1:16] niet op voor u te danken, uwer gedenkende in mijn gebeden,
[1:17] opdat de God van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, de Vader der glorie, ulieden geve een geest van wijsheid en openbaring in zijn kennis;
[1:18] hebbende de oogen uwer harten verlicht, opdat gij moogt weten welke de hope is zijner roeping, welke de rijkdom is der glorie zijner erfenis in de heiligen,
[1:19] en welke de alles overtreffende grootheid is zijner macht jegens ons die gelooven, naar de werking der kracht zijner sterkte,
[1:20] die Hij gewrocht heeft in den Christus, toen Hij Hem opwekte uit de dooden en Hem zette aan zijn rechterhand in de hemelsche plaatsen,
[1:21] verre boven alle overheid, en macht, en kracht, en heerschappij, en allen naam die genoemd wordt, niet alleen in deze eeuw, maar ook in de toekomende;
[1:22] en alle dingen heeft Hij onder zijn voeten gesteld, en heeft Hem tot een Hoofd over alles gegeven aan de gemeente,
[1:23] die zijn lichaam is, de volheid van Hem die alles in allen vervult.  
[2:1] Ook ulieden heeft Hij levend gemaakt— toen gij dood waart door uw overtredingen en zonden,
[2:2] waarin gij vroeger gewandeld hebt naar de eeuw dezer wereld, naar den overste van de macht der lucht, van den geest die nu werkt in de kinderen der ongehoorzaamheid,
[2:3] waarin ook wij allen vroeger leefden in de begeerlijkheden van ons vleesch, doende de lusten van het vleesch en van de gedachten ook wij waren van nature kinderen des toorns, zooals ook de anderen;
[2:4] Maar God, die rijk is in barmhartigheid, heeft om zijn groote liefde waarmede Hij ons beminde,
[2:5] ook toen wij dood waren door de overtredingen, ons mede levend gemaakt met Christus, — door genade zijt ge behouden—
[2:6] en heeft ons mede opgewekt en medegezet in de hemelsche plaatsen in Christus Jezus,
[2:7] opdat Hij betoonen zou in de toekomende eeuwen den alles overtreffenden rijkdom zijner genade, in zijn goedertierenheid over ons in Christus Jezus.
[2:8] Want door de genade zijt gij behouden door het geloof, en dat niet uit u— Gods gifte is het
[2:9] niet uit werken, opdat niemand zich beroeme!
[2:10] Want zijn maaksel zijn wij, geschapen in Christus Jezus voor goede werken, die God te voren bereid heeft, opdat wij daarin wandelen zouden. 
[2:11]  Daarom, gij die vroeger heidenen waart in het vleesch, die onbesnedenen werdt genoemd door de zoogenaamde besnijdenis in het vleesch, die met handen geschiedt,
[2:12] gedenkt dat gij in dien tijd waart zonder Christus, vervreemd van het burgerschap Israëls: en vreemd aan de verbonden der belofte, geen hope hebbende en zonder God in de wereld;
[2:13] maar nu, in Christus Jezus, zijt gij, die vroeger verre waart, nabij geworden in het bloed van Christus;
[2:14] want Hij is onze vrede, die beiden één gemaakt heeft en den middelmuur der afscheiding, de vijandschap, heeft afgebroken,
[2:15] toen Hij in zijn vleesch de wet der geboden, die in inzettingen bestond, te niet deed, opdat Hij in zich zelven die twee tot één nieuwen mensch zou scheppen, door vrede te maken,
[2:16] en opdat Hij die beiden in één lichaam met God zoo verzoenen door het kruis, nadat Hij de vijandschap in dat kruis gedood had.
[2:17] En Hij is vrede komen verkondigen aan ulieden die verre waart, en vrede aan hen die nabij waren;
[2:18] want door Hem hebben wij beiden den toegang in één geest tot den Vader. 
[2:19]  Zoo dan, gij zijt niet meer vreemdelingen en bijwoners, maar ge zijt medeburgers der heiligen en huisgenooten Gods,
[2:20] gebouwd op het fundament der apostelen en profeten, terwijl Christus Jezus zelf de hoeksteen is;
[2:21] in wien het geheele gebouw, goed samengevoegd, opwast tot een heiligen tempel in den Heere,
[2:22] in wien ook gij mede gebouwd wordt tot een woning Gods in den Geest.  
[3:1] Daarom ik, Paulus, de gevangene van Christus voor u die heidenen zijt,
[3:2] — indien ge ten minste gehoord hebt de bedeeling der genade Gods, die mij gegeven is met het oog op u,
[3:3] dat mij door openbaring de verborgenheid is bekend gemaakt, — zooals ik vroeger kort geschreven heb,
[3:4] waardoor gij, het lezende, kunt bemerken mijn inzicht, in de verborgenheid van Christus,
[3:5] die in andere geslachten niet is bekend gemaakt aan de kinderen der menschen, zooals zij nu is geopenbaard aan zijn heilige apostelen en profeten in den Geest
[3:6] dat de heidenen medeërfgenamen zijn, en medeleden van het lichaam, en mededeelgenooten der belofte in Christus Jezus, door het Evangelie,
[3:7] waarvan ik een dienaar ben geworden naar de gifte der genade Gods, die mij gegeven is naar de werking zijner kracht. 
[3:8]  Mij, den allerminste van alle heiligen is deze genade gegeven, om aan de heidenen te verkondigen den onnaspeurlijken rijkdom van Christus,
[3:9] en voor allen in het licht te stellen welke de bedeeling is der verborgenheid die door alle eeuwen heen verborgen is geweest in God die alle dingen geschapen heeft,
[3:10] opdat nu aan de overheden en de machten in de hemelsche plaatsen door de gemeente de veelvuldige wijsheid Gods zou worden bekend gemaakt,
[3:11] naar het eeuwig voornemen dat Hij opgevat heeft in Christus Jezus, onzen Heere,
[3:12] in wien wij hebben de vrijmoedigheid en den toegang in vertrouwen, door het geloof van Hem.
[3:13] Daarom bid ik dat gij niet moedeloos wordt in mijn verdrukkingen voor u, die uw glorie zijn. 
[3:14]  Daarom buig ik mijn knieën voor den Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus,
[3:15] uit wien alle vaderschap, in de hemelen en op de aarde, genoemd wordt,
[3:16] opdat Hij u geve naar den rijkdom zijner glorie met kracht versterkt te worden door zijn Geest, naar den inwendigen mensch;
[3:17] zoodat Christus door het geloof in uw harten wone, terwijl gij in de liefde geworteld zijt en gegrond,
[3:18] opdat gij bekwaam zoudt zijn om met al de heiligen te begrijpen, welke de breedte, en lengte, en diepte, en hoogte zij,
[3:19] en om te kennen de liefde van Christus, die de kennis te boven gaat, opdat gij vervuld moogt zijn tot al de volheid Gods. 
[3:20]  Hem nu, die machtig is boven alles te doen, verre boven hetgeen wij bidden of denken, naar de kracht die in ons werkt,
[3:21] Hem zij de glorie in de gemeente en in Christus Jezus, door alle geslachten van alle eeuwen. Amen.  
[4:1] Ik vermaan u dan, ik, de gevangene in den Heere, dat gij wandelt waardiglijk der roeping, waarmede gij zijt geroepen,
[4:2] met alle nederigheid en zachtmoedigheid, met geduld, verdragende malkander in liefde,
[4:3] u benaarstigende om te bewaren de eenheid des geestes, in den band des vredes. 
[4:4]  Eén lichaam is het en één Geest, gelijk gij ook geroepen zijt in één hope uwer roeping;
[4:5] één Heer, één geloof, één doop,
[4:6] één God en Vader van allen, die is over allen, en door allen, en in allen;
[4:7] maar aan ieder onzer is de genade gegeven, naar de mate der gave van Christus. 
[4:8]  Daarom zegt God: opklimmende naar den hooge heeft Hij de gevangenis gevangen genomen; Hij heeft aan de menschen gaven gegeven.
[4:9] Dit nu: Hij is opgeklommen, wat is het anders, dan dat Hij ook is nedergedaald tot de onderste deelen der aarde?
[4:10] Hij die nedergedaald is, is ook dezelfde die opgeklommen is boven al de hemelen, opdat Hij alles vervullen zou.
[4:11] En Hij zelf heeft gegeven sommigen tot apostelen, en sommigen tot profeten, en sommigen tot evangelisten, en sommigen tot herders en leeraars,
[4:12] voor de volmaking der heiligen, tot het werk der bediening, tot opbouwing van het lichaam van Christus,
[4:13] totdat wij allen geraken tot de eenheid des geloofs en der kennis van den Zone Gods, tot een volwassen man, tot de mate der volkomen grootheid van Christus,
[4:14] opdat wij geen kinderkens meer zouden zijn, geslingerd en omgevoerd door allen wind van leering, in het bedrog der menschen, in arglistigheid, naar de kunstgrepen der dwaling,
[4:15] maar opdat wij, de waarheid in liefde betrachtende, in alles zouden opgroeien tot Hem, die het Hoofd is, Christus,
[4:16] uit wien het geheele lichaam, goed samengevoegd en verbonden zijnde door alle verband der gewrichten, naar de werking van elk deel in zijn mate, den groei van het lichaam krijgt, tot zijn opbouwing in liefde. 
[4:17]  Dit dan zeg en betuig ik in den Heere, dat gij niet meer wandelt zooals ook de heidenen wandelen in de ijdelheid van hun gedachte,
[4:18] verduisterd zijnde in het verstand, vervreemd van het leven Gods, wegens de onwetendheid die in hen is, wegens de hardheid van hun harte;
[4:19] die, ongevoelig geworden zijnde, zich zelven hebben overgegeven aan de ongebondenheid tot het bedrijven van alle onreinheid in gierigheid.
[4:20] Maar gij hebt Christus alzoo niet geleerd;
[4:21] indien ge Hem ten minste gehoord hebt, en in Hem onderwezen zijt, zooals de waarheid in Jezus is,
[4:22] dat gij, ten opzichte van uw vorig leven, moet afleggen den ouden mensch, die verdorven wordt naar de begeerlijkheden der verleiding,
[4:23] en vernieuwd worden in den geest van uw gemoed,
[4:24] en den nieuwen mensch aandoen, die naar God geschapen is in rechtvaardigheid en heiligheid der waarheid.
[4:25] Daarom afleggende den leugen, spreekt waarheid, een iegelijk met zijn naaste, want wij zijn malkanders leden.
[4:26] Wordt toornig en zondigt niet; laat de zon niet ondergaan over uw toornigheid,
[4:27] en geeft geen plaats aan den duivel.
[4:28] Die gestolen heeft stele niet meer, maar liever arbeide hij, en werke met zijn eigen handen wat goed is, opdat hij wat hebbe om mede te deelen aan die gebrek heeft.
[4:29] Laat geen vuil woord uit uw mond gaan, maar als er een goed woord is, tot noodige opbouwing, opdat het voordeel geve aan hen die hooren.
[4:30] En bedroeft den Heiligen Geest Gods niet, in wien gij zijt verzegeld tot den dag der verlossing.
[4:31] Alle bitterheid, en oploopendheid, en gramschap, en geschreeuw, en lastering worde van u weggedaan, met alle boosheid;
[4:32] maar zijt jegens malkander goedertieren, barmhartig, vergevende malkander, zooals ook God in Christus ulieden heeft vergeven.  
[5:1] Weest dan navolgers van God, als welbeminde kinderen,
[5:2] en wandelt in liefde, zooals ook Christus u bemind heeft en zich zelven heeft overgegeven voor ons tot een gave en een offer, Gode tot een welriekenden reuk. 
[5:3]  Maar hoererij en alle onreinheid of gierigheid worde onder u zelfs niet genoemd, zooals het past aan heiligen,
[5:4] noch oneerbaarheid, of zot geklap, of gekkernij, wat niet betaamt, maar veeleer dankzegging.
[5:5] Want dit moet ge weten, dat geen hoereerder, of onreine, of gierigaard, die een afgodendienaar is, een erfdeel heeft in het koninkrijk van Christus en God.
[5:6] Niemand misleide u met ijdele woorden, want om die dingen komt de toorn Gods over de kinderen der ongehoorzaamheid. 
[5:7]  Weest dus hun medeplichtigen niet!
[5:8] Want vroeger waart gij duisternis, maar nu zijt gij licht in den Heere. Wandelt als kinderen des lichts,
[5:9] — want de vrucht des lichts bestaat in alle goedheid, en rechtvaardigheid, en waarheid
[5:10] onderzoekende wat den Heere wel aangenaam is.
[5:11] En hebt geen gemeenschap met de onvruchtbare werken der duisternis, maar bestraft ze ook veeleer,
[5:12] want wat in het heimelijk door hen geschiedt, is schandelijk zelfs om te zeggen.
[5:13] Maar alle dingen worden openbaar als ze door het licht bestraft zijn, want wat alles openbaar maakt is het licht:
[5:14] Daarom zegt Hij: ontwaakt, gij slapende! en sta op uit de dooden en Christus zal over u lichten.
[5:15] Ziet dan nauwkeurig toe, hoe gij wandelt, niet als onverstandigen, maar als verstandigen,
[5:16] den tijd uitkoopende, omdat de dagen slecht zijn. 
[5:17]  Daarom, weest niet onverstandig, maar verstaat welke de wil des Heeren is,
[5:18] en wordt niet dronken van wijn, waarin rampzaligheid is, maar wordt vol van den Geest,
[5:19] malkander onderhoudende met psalmen, en lofzangen, en geestelijke liederen, zingende en lofzeggende den Heere in uw harte,
[5:20] dankende ten allen tijde voor alle dingen, God en den Vader, in den Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus,
[5:21] malkander onderdanig zijnde in de vreeze van Christus. 
[5:22]  Gij vrouwen, weest aan uw eigen mannen onderdanig, zooals aan den Heere;
[5:23] want de man is het hoofd der vrouw, zooals ook Christus het Hoofd is der gemeente, Hij, de Behouder van het lichaam.
[5:24] Maar gelijk de gemeente aan Christus onderdanig is, zoo ook de vrouwen aan haar mannen in alles. 
[5:25]  Gij mannen, bemint uw vrouwen, zooals ook Christus de gemeente bemind heeft, en zich zelven voor haar heeft overgegeven,
[5:26] opdat Hij haar zou heiligen, nadat Hij haar gezuiverd heeft door het waterbad, in het woord,
[5:27] opdat Hij zich zelven de gemeente vol glorie zou voorstellen, geen vlek hebbende, of rimpel, of iets dergelijks, maar opdat zij heilig en onbevlekt zou zijn.
[5:28] Alzoo zijn de mannen verplicht hun vrouwen te beminnen, als hun eigen lichaam. Die zijn eigen vrouw bemint, bemint zich zelven.
[5:29] Niemand toch heeft ooit zijn eigen vleesch gehaat, maar men voedt en onderhoudt het, zooals Christus de gemeente;
[5:30] want wij zijn ledematen van zijn lichaam, van zijn vleesch en van zijn gebeente.
[5:31] Daarom zal een mensch vader en moeder verlaten en zijn vrouw aanhangen; en die twee zullen zijn tot één vleesch.
[5:32] Dit mysterie is groot, maar ik spreek ten opzichte van Christus en de gemeente.
[5:33] Evenwel ook gij ieder in ‘t bijzonder moet uw vrouw zoo beminnen als u zelven, en de vrouw, dat zij haar man vreeze!  
[6:1] Gij kinderen, gehoorzaamt uw ouders in den Heere, want dat is recht.
[6:2] Eert uw vader en uw moeder— dat is het eerste gebod met een belofte
[6:3] opdat het u welga en gij lang moogt leven op de aarde. 
[6:4]  En gij vaders, maakt uw kinderen niet toornig, maar voedt ze op in het onderwijs en de vermaning des Heeren. 
[6:5]  Gij dienstknechten, gehoorzaamt aan uw heeren naar het vleesch, met vreeze en beving, in eenvoudigheid van uw harte, als aan Christus,
[6:6] niet naar oogendienst, als menschenbehagers, maar als dienstknechten van Christus, die den wille Gods doet van harte,
[6:7] en met goedwilligheid dient, als den Heere en niet den menschen,
[6:8] daar gij weet dat wat een iegelijk goeds zal gedaan hebben, hij dat van den Heere zal weder ontvangen, hetzij dienstknecht, hetzij vrije. 
[6:9]  En gij, heeren, doet aan hen hetzelfde en laat het dreigen na, daar gij weet dat zoowel hun als uw Heer in de hemelen is, en dat er geen aanneming des persoons bij Hem is. 
[6:10]  Ten slotte, mijn broeders! wordt krachtig in den Heere en in de macht zijner sterkte.
[6:11] Doet aan de volle wapenrusting Gods, opdat gij kunt staan tegen de kunstgrepen van den duivel.
[6:12] Want voor ons is de worsteling niet tegen vleesch en bloed, maar tegen de overheden, tegen de machten, tegen de wereldbeheerschers dezer duisternis, tegen de geestelijke wezens der boosheid in de hemelsche plaatsen.
[6:13] Daarom neemt de volle wapenrusting Gods aan, opdat gij moogt kunnen weerstand bieden in den boozen dag, en tot alles wel bereid zijnde, moogt staande blijven.
[6:14] Staat dan vast, uw lenden omgord met de waarheid, en het borstwapen der gerechtigheid aangedaan hebbende,
[6:15] en de voeten geschoeid met bereidheid van het Evangelie des vredes,
[6:16] bovenal opnemende het schild des geloofs, waarmede gij al de brandende pijlen des boozen zult kunnen uitblusschen;
[6:17] en neemt den helm der zaligheid, en het zwaard des Geestes, dat is Gods woord;
[6:18] met alle gebed en smeeking biddende ten allen tijd in den geest, en daartoe wakende in alle volharding en smeeking voor al de heiligen,
[6:19] en voor mij, opdat mij een woord gegeven worde bij het openen van mijn mond, om in vrijmoedigheid de verborgenheid des Evangelies bekend te maken,
[6:20] waarvoor ik een gezant ben in een keten, opdat ik daarin met vrijmoedigheid handel, zooals ik moet spreken. 
[6:21]  Opdat nu ook gij moogt weten mijn omstandigheden, hoe het mij gaat, zal Tychikus, de beminde broeder en getrouwe dienaar in den Heere u alles bekendmaken,
[6:22] dien ik juist daarom tot u gezonden heb, opdat gij zoudt weten onze omstandigheden en hij uw harten zou vertroosten. 
[6:23]  Vrede den broederen en liefde met geloof, van God den Vader en den Heere Jezus Christus!
[6:24] De genade met allen die onzen Heere Jezus Christus in onvergankelijkheid beminnen!   

### Philippians

[1:1] Paulus en Timotheüs, dienaren van Jezus Christus, aan al de heiligen in Christus Jezus die in Filippi zijn, met de opzieners en diakenen,
[1:2] genade zij ulieden en vrede, van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Ik dank mijn God wegens al wat ik van ulieden in gedachtenis heb,
[1:4] altijd in al mijn smeeking voor u allen met blijdschap het gebed doende,
[1:5] vanwege uw gemeenschap aan het Evangelie van den eersten dag af tot nu toe,
[1:6] vertrouwen hebbende hierin, dat Hij, die in ulieden een goed werk is begonnen, dit volkomen maken zal tot op den dag van Jezus Christus;
[1:7] gelijk het recht is voor mij dat ik van u allen dit gevoelen heb, omdat gij mij in uw hart draagt, en omdat gij allen, zoowel in mijn banden als in de verdediging en bevestiging van het Evangelie, deelgenoten zijt van mijn genade. 
[1:8]  Want God is mijn getuige hoe ik naar u allen verlang, in de teedere liefde van Jezus Christus,
[1:9] En dit bid ik, dat uw liefde nog meer en meer overvloedig worde in kennis en in alle verstand,
[1:10] om te onderkennen de dingen die goed en kwaad zijn, opdat gij oprecht moogt zijn en onberispelijk tot den dag van Christus;
[1:11] vervuld met een vrucht der rechtvaardigheid, die door Jezus Christus is tot glorie en lof van God. 
[1:12]  Doch ik wil dat gij weet, broeders, dat de dingen die mij overkomen zijn zeer tot bevordering des Evangelies zijn gekomen,
[1:13] zoodat mijn banden in Christus openbaar geworden zijn in het geheele rechthuis en bij al de anderen,
[1:14] en dat de meesten van de broeders in den Heere door mijn banden vertrouwen hebben gekregen en meer overvloedig het woord Gods onbevreesd durven spreken. 
[1:15]  Sommigen toch prediken wel den Christus door nijd en twist, maar anderen door goedwilligheid.
[1:16] Sommigen doen het uit liefde, wetende dat ik gesteld ben tot een verdediging van het Evangelie,
[1:17] maar anderen verkondigen den Christus uit twistijver, niet oprechtelijk, meenende verdrukking toe te brengen aan mijn banden. 
[1:18]  Maar wat zou dat zijn? — Als maar op alle maniere Christus verkondigd wordt, hetzij onder een schijn of in waarheid! En daarin verblijd ik mij en zal ik mij verblijden.
[1:19] Want ik weet dat dit mij tot behoudenis zal verstrekken door uw gebed en door mededeeling van den Geest van Jezus Christus;
[1:20] volgens mijn ernstige verwachting en hope; dat ik in niets zal worden beschaamd gemaakt! maar dat in al mijn vrijmoedigheid, zoowel altijd als ook nu, Christus zal groot gemaakt worden in mijn lichaam, hetzij door het leven, hetzij door den dood. 
[1:21]  Want wat mij betreft, te leven is Christus, en te sterven is gewin.
[1:22] Doch in het vleesch te leven, of dat de vrucht is van mijn werk, en wat ik verkiezen zou, — ik weet het niet.
[1:23] Ik word toch van twee kanten gedrongen, daar ik begeerte heb om losgemaakt te worden en met Christus te zijn, want dat is verre het beste.
[1:24] Maar in het vleesch te blijven is noodiger om uwentwille.
[1:25] En dit vertrouwen hebbende, weet ik dat ik zal blijven en met u allen zal verblijven tot uw voortgang en blijdschap des geloofs,
[1:26] opdat uw roem in mij overvloedig worde in Christus Jezus, als ik weer bij u tegenwoordig zal zijn. 
[1:27]  Alleenlijk, gedraagt u waardiglijk het Evangelie van Christus, opdat hetzij ik kom, en u zie, hetzij ik afwezig ben, ik moge hooren van uw zaken, dat gij vast staat in één geest, met één gemoed strijdende voor het geloof des Evangelies,
[1:28] en dat gij in geen ding verschrikt wordt door de tegenstanders. Hetgeen voor hen wel een bewijs is des verderfs, is voor u een oorzaak der zaligheid, en dat van God.
[1:29] Want aan ulieden is het vergund ten behoeve van Christus, niet alleen om in Hem te gelooven maar ook om voor Hem te lijden,
[1:30] hebbende denzelfden strijd als dien gij in mij gezien hebt en nu in mij hoort.  
[2:1] Indien er dan eenige vertroosting is in Christus, indien er eenige verkwikking is der liefde, indien er eenige gemeenschap is des geestes, indien er eenige teederheid en medelijden is,
[2:2] vervult dan mijn blijdschap hierdoor dat gij hetzelfde gevoelt, dezelfde liefde hebt, van één gemoed, van één gevoelen zijnde;
[2:3] niets doende door twist, noch door ijdele eerzucht, maar elkander door nederigheid hooger achtende dan u zelven;
[2:4] niet het oog hebbende op eigen voordeel, maar ook op dat van anderen. 
[2:5]  Gij moet dit gevoeler in u hebben dat ook in Christus Jezus was;
[2:6] die, in de gestalte Gods zijnde, het geen roof geacht heeft om gelijkte zijn aan God.
[2:7] Nochtans heeft Hij zich zelven ontledigd, door de gestalte van een dienstknecht aan te nemen, zijnde gelijk geworden aan menschen.
[2:8] En in gedaante gevonden als een mensch heeft Hij zich zei ven vernederd, gehoorzaam geworden zijnde tot den dood, den dood des kruises.
[2:9] Daarom ook heeft God Hem ten hoogste verheven en heeft Hem den Naam geschonken, die hooger is dan alle naam,
[2:10] opdat in den Naam van Jezus alle knie buigen zou van de hemelsche, en aardsche en onderaardsche schepselen,
[2:11] en opdat alle tong zou uitspreken dat Jezus Christus Heer is, tot glorie van God den Vader. 
[2:12]  Zoo dan, mijn beminden, gelijk gij altijd gehoorzaam zijt geweest, niet alleen in mijn tegenwoordigheid maar nu veel meer in mijn afwezigheid, gij moet met vreeze en beven uw eigen zaligheid uitwerken.
[2:13] Want God is het die in u werkt zoowel het willen als het werken, volgens zijn welbehagen.
[2:14] Doet alles zonder murmureeren en twistingen,
[2:15] opdat gij moogt zijn onberispelijk en onbestraffelijk, kinderen Gods, onbevlekt te midden van een bedorven en verkeerd geslacht, waaronder gij blinkt als fakkels in de wereld,
[2:16] voorhoudende het woord des levens, mij tot een roem tot den dag van Christus, opdat ik niet in het ledige hebbe geloopen, noch in het ledige hebbe gearbeid.
[2:17] Ja, al moest ook uw offerande en de bediening van uw geloof met mijn bloed begoten worden, zoo verheug ik mij en verblijd mij met u allen.
[2:18] En om ditzelfde verheugt gij u met mij. 
[2:19]  En ik hoop in den Heere Jezus Timotheüs spoedig tot u te zenden, opdat ik ook welgemoed moge zijn als ik uw zaken zal weten.
[2:20] Want ik heb niemand zoo eensgezind met mij, die met zulk een oprechte genegenheid voor u zal bezorgd zijn.
[2:21] Want al de anderen zoeken hun eigen voordeel, niet dat van Jezus Christus.
[2:22] Want gij weet dat Timotheüs het bewijs gegeven heeft om met mij in het Evangelie te dienen, zooals een kind zijn vader dient.
[2:23] Dezen dan hoop ik te zenden zoohaast als ik zal gezien hebben hoe het met mij zal gaan.
[2:24] Doch ik vertrouw in den Heere dat ik ook zelf spoedig zal komen. 
[2:25]  Intusschen heb ik noodig geacht om Epafroditus tot u te zenden, mijn broeder, en medearbeider, en medestrijder, en uw afgezant en bedienaar van mijn nooddruft.
[2:26] Want deze verlangde zeer naar u allen en was bekommerd, omdat gij gehoord hadt dat hij ziek was.
[2:27] Want hij is ook ziek geweest tot nabij den dood. Maar God heeft zich over hem ontfermd, en niet alleen over hem maar ook over mij, opdat ik niet droefheid op droefheid zou hebben.
[2:28] Daarom heb ik hem te spoediger gezonden opdat gij, hem ziende, wederom zoudt verblijd worden en opdat ik zonder droefheid zou zijn.
[2:29] Ontvangt hem dan in den Heere met alle blijdschap, en houdt dezulken in waarde.
[2:30] Want om het werk van Christus was hij nabij den, dood gekomen, zijn leven, wagende, opdat hij zou volkomen maken wat ontbreekt: aan uw bediening jegens mij.  
[3:1] Overigens, mijn broeders, verblijdt u in den Heere. Dezelfde dingen aan u te schrijven is voor mij niet verdrietig en voor u is het nuttig.
[3:2] Hoedt u voor de honden; hoedt u voor de kwade arbeiders; hoedt u voor de valsche besnijdenis.
[3:3] Want wij zijn de besnijdenis, wij die God in den geest dienen, en roemen in Christus Jezus en niet op vleesch ons betrouwen. 
[3:4]  Toch zou ik ook iets hebben om mij in het vleesch te betrouwen. Als er iemand anders is die in het vleesch vertrouwt, dan ik nog meer:
[3:5] besneden op den achtsten dag, uit het volk Israels, van den stam Benjamin, een Hebreër uit de Hebreërs, wat de wet betreft een fariseër,
[3:6] wat den ijver betreft een vervolger der gemeente, wat de rechtvaardigheid in de wet betreft onberispelijk. 
[3:7]  Doch hetgeen mij een gewin was dat heb ik verlies geacht om Christus wil.
[3:8] Ja waarlijk, ik acht alle dingen verlies te zijn om de uitnemendheid der kennis van Christus Jezus mijn Heer, om wien ik dat alles verlies acht en acht het vuilnis te zijn, opdat ik Christus zou gewinnen,
[3:9] en in Hem zou gevonden worden, niet hebbende mijn rechtvaardigheid die uit de wet is, maar die door het geloof van Christus is, de rechtvaardigheid uit God, op het geloof,
[3:10] om Hem te kennen en de kracht zijner verrijzenis en de gemeenschap aan zijn smarten, gelijkvormig wordende aan zijn dood;
[3:11] of ik ook wellicht zou geraken tot de verrijzenis die uit de dooden is. 
[3:12]  Niet dat ik het al bekomen heb of al volmaakt ben, maar ik jaag er naar, of ik het aanvatten mocht, waartoe ik ook door Christus Jezus aangevat ben.
[3:13] Broeders! ik acht niet dat ik zelf het nog aangevat heb.
[3:14] Maar één ding zeg ik: vergetende wat achter is, en mij uitstrekkende tot hetgeen vóór mij is, jaag ik naar het doelwit, naar den prijs der roeping Gods die van boven is, in Christus Jezus. 
[3:15]  Voor zooveel wij dan volmaakt zijn, laat ons alzoo gezind zijn; en als gij anders gezind zijt dan zal God u ook dit openbaren.
[3:16] Ondertusschen, laat ons naar denzelfden regel wandelen, in hetgeen waartoe wij gekomen zijn.
[3:17] Zijt te zamen mijn navolgers, broeders! En let op degenen die alzoo wandelen als gij ons tot voorbeeld hebt. 
[3:18]  Velen toch, van wie ik u dikwijls gesproken heb en nu ook weenende spreek, wandelen als vijanden van het kruis van Christus,
[3:19] wier einde is het verderf, wier god is de buik, en wier glorie is in hun schande, die de aardsche dingen bedenken.
[3:20] Want ons burgerschap is in de hemelen, waaruit wij ook den Heere Jezus Christus als Verlosser verwachten,
[3:21] die ons lichaam der vernedering zal veranderen tot gelijkvormigheid aan zijn lichaam der glorie, naar de kracht die Hij bezit om alle dingen aan zich zelven te onderwerpen.  
[4:1] Zoo dan, mijn beminde en gewenschte broeders, mijn vreugde en kroon, staat alzoo vast in den Heere, beminden! 
[4:2]  Ik vermaan Euodia en ook Syntyche vermaan ik, om in den Heere eensgezind te zijn,
[4:3] ja, ik verzoek ook u, getrouwe medearbeider! help haar die in het Evangelie met mij gestreden hebben, en met Klemens en mijn andere medearbeiders, wier namen in het boek des levens zijn.
[4:4] Verblijdt u altijd in den Heere! Nog eens zeg ik: verblijdt u!
[4:5] Uw billijkheid zij bekend aan alle menschen; de Heere is nabij!
[4:6] Zijt in niets bekommerd, maar laat door al uw bidden en smeeken met dankzegging, uw begeerten bekend worden bij God.
[4:7] En de vrede Gods, die boven alle verstand, gaat, zal uw harten en gedachten bewaren in Christus Jezus. 
[4:8]  En voor het overige, broeders! al wat waar is, al wat eerlijk is, al wat recht is, al wat rein is, al wat liefelijk is, al wat welluidend is, als er eenige deugd of eenige lof is— laat uw gedachten daarop zijn gevestigd.
[4:9] En wat gij geleerd en ontvangen en gehoord en in mij gezien hebt, doet dat; en de God des vredes zal met ulieden zijn. 
[4:10]  En ik ben grootelijks verblijd in den Heere dat gij eindelijk wakker geworden zijt om aan mij te gedenken. Wel hadt gij er aan gedacht, maar gij hadt de gelegenheid niet.
[4:11] Niet dat ik wegens gebrek spreek; want ik heb geleerd om tevreden te zijn in hetgeen ik ben.
[4:12] Ik weet ook vernederd te worden, ik weet ook overvloed te hebben; in alle opzichten en in alles ben ik onderwezen, zoowel om verzadigd te zijn als om honger te hebben, om overvloed te hebben als om te kort te komen.
[4:13] Alles kan ik in Hem die mij versterkt.
[4:14] Toch hebt gij goed gedaan met deel te nemen aan mijn verdrukking.
[4:15] En gij zelf, Filippiërs, gij weet dat in het begin des Evangelies, toen ik van Macedonië kwam, geen gemeente met mij gedeeld heeft, wat de rekening van uitgave en ontvangst betreft, dan gij alleen.
[4:16] Want ook in Thessalonika hebt gij mij meer dan eens gezonden tot mijn nooddruft.
[4:17] Niet dat ik de gifte zoek, maar ik zoek de vrucht, die overvloedig is, wat uw rekening betreft.
[4:18] Doch ik bezit alles en heb overvloed. Ik ben volkomen voorzien toen ik van Epafroditus ontvangen heb hetgeen van u kwam, een welriekende reuk, een aangename offerande, welbehagelijk aan God.
[4:19] Doch mijn God zal al uw nooddruft vervullen, naar zijn rijkdom in glorie, in Christus Jezus. 
[4:20]  Gode en onzen Vader zij de glorie in alle eeuwigheden. Amen.
[4:21] Groet alle heiligen in Christus Jezus.
[4:22] U groeten de broeders die met mij zijn. U groeten al de heiligen en vooral die uit het huis des keizers zijn.
[4:23] De genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus zij met uw geest, Amen.   

### Colossians

[1:1] Paulus, een apostel van Jezus Christus, door den wil van God, en Timotheüs de broeder,
[1:2] aan de heilige en geloovige broeders in Christus te Kolosse, genade zij ulieden en vrede, van God onzen Vader, en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Wij danken den God en Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, en bidden altijd voor u,
[1:4] gehoord hebbende mij; geloof in Christus Jezus, en de liefde die gij hebt tot al de heiligen,
[1:5] om de hope die voor n bewaard wordt in de hemelen, waarvan gij te voren gehoord hebt in het woord der waarheid, des Evangelies,
[1:6] dat tot u gekomen is, gelijk het ook in de geheele wereld is, vrucht dragende en aanwassende, gelijk ook onder u, van dien dag af dat gij het gehoord hebt en dat gij de genade van God in waarheid bekend hebt;
[1:7] gelijk gij ook geleerd hebt van Epafras, onzen beminden mededienstknecht, die voor u een getrouw dienaar van Christus is;
[1:8] die ons ook bekend gemaakt heeft uw liefde in den geest. 
[1:9]  Daarom hebben ook wij, van den dag af dat wij het gehoord hebben, niet opgehouden voor u te bidden en te begeeren dat gij zoudt vervuld worden met de kennis van zijn wil, in alle geestelijke wijsheid en verstand;
[1:10] om waardiglijk te wandelen voor den Heere, tot alle welbehagelijkheid, in alle goed werk vrucht dragende en aanwassende in de kennis van God;
[1:11] met alle kracht bekrachtigd zijnde naar de sterkte zijner glorie, tot alle volharding en lankmoedigheid; met blijdschap
[1:12] den Vader dankende die ons bekwaam gemaakt heeft om deelgenooten te zijn van de erfenis der heiligen in het licht;
[1:13] die ons getrokken heeft uit de macht der duisternis en ons overgebracht heeft lot het koninkrijk van den Zoon zijner liefde,
[1:14] in wien wij de verlossing hebben, de vergiffenis der zonden;
[1:15] die het beeld is van den onzichtbaren God, de eerstgeborene van de geheele schepping.
[1:16] Want in Hem is alles geschapen! Wat in de hemelen en op de aarde is, de zichtbare en de onzichtbare dingen, hetzij troonen, hetzij heerschappijen, hetzij overheden, hetzij machten, alle dingen zijn door Hem en tot Hem geschapen;
[1:17] en zelf is Hij vóór alle dingen en al die dingen blijven bestaan in Hem.
[1:18] En Hij is het Hoofd des lichaams, der gemeente; Hij die het begin is, de eerstgeborene uit de dooden, opdat Hij zelf in alles de eerste plaats zou hebben.
[1:19] Want het heeft den Vader behaagd dat de geheele volheid wonen zou in Hem,
[1:20] en dat Hij door Hem alle dingen zou verzoenen tot zich zelven, vrede gemaakt hebbende door het bloed zijns kruises, door Hem, zeg ik, zoowel de dingen op aarde als die in de hemelen zijn. 
[1:21]  En Hij heeft u, die te voren vervreemd zijt geweest en vijanden in uw gezindheid, door de booze werken,
[1:22] nu ook verzoend in het lichaam zijns vleesches, door den dood, om u heilig en onbevlekt en onberispelijk voor Hem te stellen,
[1:23] indien het is dat gij gegrond en vast blijft in het geloof, en niet bewogen wordt van de hope des Evangelies dat gij gehoord hebt, dat gepredikt is aan alle schepsel onder den hemel en waarvan ik Paulus, een dienaar ben geworden. 
[1:24]  Nu verheug ik mij in mijn lijden voor u, en ik maak in mijn vleesch volkomen wat nog ontbreekt aan de verdrukkingen van Christus, voor zijn lichaam, dat is de gemeente,
[1:25] waarvan ik een dienaar geworden ben, naar den last dien God mij gegeven heeft, om onder ulieden het woord Gods te vervullen,
[1:26] te weten de verborgenheid die verborgen is geweest van alle eeuwen en geslachten, doch nu geopenbaard is aan zijn heiligen,
[1:27] aan wie God heeft willen bekend maken welke de rijkdom is der glorie van deze verborgenheid onder de heidenen: namelijk Christus in u, de hope der glorie;
[1:28] dien wij verkondigen, door iederen mensch te vermanen en iederen mensch te onderwijzen in alle wijsheid, om iederen mensch volkomen te stellen in Christus;
[1:29] waartoe ik ook arbeid, strijdende naar zijn werking die in mij werkt met kracht.  
[2:1] Want ik wil dat gij weet hoe grooten strijd ik heb om uwentwil en om degenen die in Laodicea zijn en om zoovelen die mijn aangezicht in het vleesch niet hebben gezien,
[2:2] opdat hun harten vertroost mogen worden, te zamen gevoegd zijnde in liefde, en vervuld tot allen rijkdom, des verstands, tot kennis der verborgenheid van God en van Christus,
[2:3] in wien al de schatten der wijsheid en der kennis verborgen zijn. 
[2:4]  Dit zeg ik, opdat niemand van ulieden verleid worde door schoonklinkende: woorden.
[2:5] Want al ben ik lichamelijk afwezig, zoo ben ik met den geest toch met u, mij verheugende en ziende uw goede orde en de vastigheid van uw vertrouwen op Christus.
[2:6] Gelijk gij dan Christus Jezus, den Heere, hebt aangenomen, wandelt alzoo in Hem;
[2:7] geworteld en opgebouwd in Hem, en vastgesteld in het geloof gelijk gij onderwezen zijt, toenemende in dankzegging.
[2:8] Ziet toe, dat niemand u tot verleider zij door de filosofie en ledig bedrog, naar de overlevering der menschen, naar de grondregels der wereld en niet naar Christus;
[2:9] want in Hem woont de geheele volheid der godheid lichamelijk,
[2:10] en gij zijt in Hem volkomen, die is het Hoofd van alle overheid en macht,
[2:11] in wien gij ook besneden zijt met een besnijdenis die zonder handen geschiedt, in de aflegging van het lichaam des vleesches, in de besnijdenis van Christus;
[2:12] met Hem begraven zijnde in den doop, waarin gij ook mede verrezen zijt door het geloof in de werking Gods die Hem uit de dooden opgewekt heeft.
[2:13] En ook u, die dood waart door de overtredingen en door de onbesnedenheid uws harten, u heeft Hij mede levend gemaakt met Hem, u al de overtredingen vergeven hebbende;
[2:14] uitgewischt hebbende het handschrift dat tegen ons was. bestaande in inzettingen, dat ons tegenstond, en Hij heeft dit uit den weg genomen, het nagelende aan het kruis;
[2:15] ontwapend hebbende de overheden en de machten, heeft Hij die openlijk ten toon gesteld, daarin over hen triumfeerende. 
[2:16]  Dat u dan niemand oordeele in spijs of in drank, of over een feestdag, of over nieuwe maan of sabbaten,
[2:17] die schaduwen zijn van de dingen die toekomende waren, doch het lichaam is van Christus.
[2:18] Dat niemand u beroove, onder den schijn van nederigheid en engelendienst, intredende in dingen die hij niet gezien heeft, tevergeefs opgeblazen zijnde door zijn vleeschelijke gedachte,
[2:19] en zich niet vasthoudende aan het Hoofd, waaruit het geheele lichaam, dat samengebonden en samengevoegd is door de gewrichten en bindselen, opwast met goddelijken wasdom.
[2:20] Indien gij met Christus de grondregels der wereld afgestorven zijt, wat wordt gij dan met inzettingen gebonden, alsof gij in de wereld leefdet:
[2:21] raakt dit niet aan, proeft dat niet, roert dat niet aan!
[2:22] al welke dingen ten verderve gaan door het gebruik, naar de bevelen en leeringen der menschen?
[2:23] Welke dingen een schijnreden van wijsheid hebben in een eigenwillige godsdienst, en in vernedering, en in lichaamskastijding, maar niet van eenige waarde zijn tegen voldoening van het vleesch.  
[3:1] Indien gij dan met Christus verrezen zijt, zoo zoekt de dingen die boven zijn, waar de Christus is gezeten aan de rechterhand Gods.
[3:2] Zet uw hart op de dingen die boven zijn, niet die op de aarde zijn;
[3:3] want gij zijt gestorven en uw leven is met Christus verborgen in God.
[3:4] Als Christus zal verschenen zijn, die uw leven is, dan zult ook gij met Hem verschijnen in glorie.
[3:5] Doodt dan uw leden die op aarde zijn, hoererij, onreinheid, driften, kwade begeerlijkheid en de gierigheid die afgoderij is,
[3:6] om welke dingen de gramschap Gods komt over de kinderen der ongehoorzaamheid;
[3:7] waarin ook gij te voren gewandeld hebt, toen gij daarin leefdet.
[3:8] Maar legt gij nu ook dit alles af, gramschap, toornigheid, kwaadheid, lastering, vuil geklap uit uw mond.
[3:9] Liegt niet tegen malkanderen, aangezien gij hebt uitgetrokken den ouden mensch met zijn werken,
[3:10] en aangetrokken den nieuwen mensch, die vernieuwd wordt tot kennis, naar het beeld van dengene die hem geschapen heeft;
[3:11] alwaar niet is Griek en Jood, besnijdenis en onbesnedenheid, barbaar, Scyth, slaaf, vrije, maar alles en in alles is Christus. 
[3:12]  Trekt dan aan, als uitverkorenen Gods, heiligen en beminden, een medelijdend gemoed, goedertierenheid, nederigheid, zachtmoedigheid, geduldigheid,
[3:13] malkander verdragende en malkander vergiffenis schenkende, als iemand tegen iemand een klacht heeft; gelijk Christus ulieden vergiffenis geschonken heeft, alzoo moet gij ook doen.
[3:14] En boven dit alles moet jij de liefde aantrekken dat is de band der volmaaktheid.
[3:15] En de vrede van Christus moge heerschen in uw harten, tot welken gij ook geroepen zijt in één lichaam; en zijt dankbaar. 
[3:16]  Het woord van Christus wone overvloediglijk in ulieden, malkander in alle wijsheid onderwijzende en vermanende, door psalmen, lofzangen en geestelijke liederen, in aangenaamheid zingende voor God in uw harten,
[3:17] en al wat gij doet, in woord of in werk, het zij alles in den Naam van den Heere Jezus, dankende God den Vader door Hem. 
[3:18]  Gij vrouwen, zijt onderdanig aan uw mannen, gelijk het in den Heere betaamt.
[3:19] Gij mannen, bemint uw vrouwen en zijt niet bitter tegen haar.
[3:20] Gij kinderen, zijt gehoorzaam aan uw ouders in alles, want dat is welbehagelijk in den Heere.
[3:21] Gij vaders, tergt uw kinderen niet opdat zij niet ontmoedigd worden.
[3:22] Gij dienstknechten, zijt gehoorzaam in alles aan uw heeren naar het vleesch, niet in oogendienst als menschenbehagers, maar in eenvoudigheid des harten, vreezende den Heere.
[3:23] Al wat gij doet, doet dat van harte, als voor den Heere en niet voor de menschen,
[3:24] wetende dat gij van den Heere zult ontvangen het loon der erfenis, want gij dient den Heere Christus.
[3:25] Want die onrecht doet die zal het onrecht dragen dat hij gedaan heeft, en er is geen uitzondering van persoon.  
[4:1] Gij heeren, doet aan uw dienstknechten recht en billijkheid, wetende dat gij ook zelf een Heer inden hemel hebt. 
[4:2]  Volhardt in het gebed, daarin wakende in dankzegging,
[4:3] tegelijk biddende ook voor ons, dat God ons een deur des woords opene, om de verborgenheid van Christus te spreken, om welke ik ook gebonden ben;
[4:4] opdat ik die bekend maken moge zooals ik moet spreken. 
[4:5]  Wandelt in wijsheid bij degenen die buiten de gemeente zijn, den tijd waarnemende.
[4:6] Uw woord zij altijd in vriendelijkheid, met zout besprengd, om te weten hoe gij elkander moet antwoorden. 
[4:7]  Al wat mij betreft zal Tychikus u bekend maken, de beminde broeder en getrouwe dienaar en mededienaar in den Heere,
[4:8] dien ik tot dat einde tot u gezonden heb, opdat hij wete hoe het u gaat en hij uw harten moge vertroosten;
[4:9] met Onesimus, den getrouwen en beminden broeder, die uit de uwen is. Zij zullen u alles bekend maken wat hier omgaat. 
[4:10]  U groet Aristarchus, mijn medestrijder, en Markus, de neef van Barnabas, omtrent wien gij bevelen ontvangen hebt, — als hij tot u komt, ontvangt hem dan—
[4:11] en Jezus, die Justus genoemd wordt. Deze zijn uit de besnijdenis: zij alleen zijn mijn medearbeiders tot het koninkrijk Gods, die mij tot vertroosting zijn geweest.
[4:12] U groet Epafras, die uit de uwen is, een dienaar van Christus Jezus, die altijd voor u strijdt in de gebeden, opdat gij staan moogt volmaakt en volkomen in den geheelen wil van God;
[4:13] want ik kan van hem getuigen dat hij een grooten ijver voor u heeft, en voor degenen die in Laodicea zijn, en voor die in Hiërapolis zijn.
[4:14] U groet Lukas, de geneesheer, de beminde, en Demas.
[4:15] Groet de broeders in Laodicea, en Nyntfas en de gemeente die in zijn huis is. 
[4:16]  En als deze brief bij u zal gelezen zijn, maakt dan dat hij ook gelezen worde in de gemeente der Laodiceërs, en dat ook gij dien brief leest die uit Laodicea geschreven is. 
[4:17]  En zegt tot Archippus: let op de bediening die gij ontvangen hebt in den Heere, dat gij die volbrengt! 
[4:18]  De groetenis met mijn hand, van Paulus. Gedenkt aan mijn boeien. De genade met ulieden! Amen.   

### I Thessalonians

[1:1] Paulus en Silvanus en Timotheüs, aan de gemeente der Thessalonikers, in God den Vader en in den Heere Jezus Christus, genade zij ulieden en vrede!
[1:2] Wij danken God altijd voor u allen, aan ulieden gedachtig zijnde bij onze gebeden;
[1:3] zonder ophouden gedachtig zijnde aan het werk van uw geloof, en aan den arbeid van uw liefde, en aan de volharding van uw hope op onzen Heere Jezus Christus, voor het aangezicht van onzen God en Vader,
[1:4] wetende, van God beminde broeders, uw uitverkiezing. 
[1:5]  Want ons Evangelie is tot u gekomen niet alleen in woorden, maar ook in kracht, en in den Heiligen Geest, en met volle overtuiging, gelijk gij weet hoedanig wij onder u geweest zijn om uwentwil.
[1:6] En gij zijt navolgers geworden van ons en van den Heere, hebbende het woord aangenomen in veel verdrukking, met blijdschap des Heiligen Geestes,
[1:7] zoodat gij een voorbeeld zijt geworden voor al de geloovigen in Macedonië en in Achaje.
[1:8] Want van u is het woord des Heeren vermaard geworden, niet alleen in Macedonië en in Achaje, maar in alle plaatsen is uw vertrouwen dat gij op God hebt, verbreid geworden, zoodat het niet noodig is dat wij daar iets van zeggen;
[1:9] want zij zelven verhalen van ons, koedammen toegang wij tot u hadden, en hoe gij bekeerd zijt tot God van de afgoden, om den levenden waarachtigen God te dienen,
[1:10] en zijn Zoon te verwachten uit de hemelen, dien Hij verwekt heeft uit de dooden, Jezus, die ons verlost van de gramschap die komende is.  
[2:1] Want gij weet zelf, broeders, onzen toegang tot ulieden, dat die niet tevergeefs is geweest,
[2:2] maar te voren veel geleden hebbende en gesmaad zijnde in Filippi, zooals gij weet, zoo hebben wij toch met vrijmoedigheid in onzen God tot u het Evangelie gesproken, in veel strijd. 
[2:3]  Want onze vermaning was niet uit dwaling, noch uit onzuiverheid, noch uit bedrog;
[2:4] maar, zooals wij van God waardig geacht zijn dat ons het Evangelie is toebetrouwd alzoo spreken wij, niet als behagende aan menschen maar aan God die onze harten beproeft.
[2:5] Want nooit hebben wij omgegaan met vleiende woorden, zooals gij weet, noch met bedekte gierigheid; God is getuige!
[2:6] Noch zoekende naar glorie uit de menschen, noch van u noch van anderen, alhoewel wij u tot last hadden kunnen zijn, als apostelen van Christus.
[2:7] Maar wij zijn toegevend in uw midden geweest, zooals een voedster haar kinderen opkweekt.
[2:8] Aldus u zeer genegen zijnde wenschten wij met groote begeerte niet alleen u het Evangelie van God mede te deelen, maar ook ons eigen zielen, omdat gij ons lief zijt geworden.
[2:9] Want gij zijt gedachtig, broeders, aan onzen arbeid en onze moeite. Nacht en dag werkende, om toch maar, niemand van u tot last te zijn, hebben wij het Evangelie Gods aan u verkondigd.
[2:10] Gij zijt getuigen, en God, hoe heilig, en rechtvaardig, en onberispelijk wij geweest zijn voor u die gelooft;
[2:11] gelijk gij ook weet hoe wij een ieder van u hebben vermaand en vertroost, zooals een vader zijn kinderen doet,
[2:12] en hebben getuigd dat gij zoudt wandelen waardiglijk voor God, die u roept tot zijn eigen koninkrijk en glorie.
[2:13] En daarom danken ook wij God zonder ophouden dat, als gij het woord der tijding Gods van ons ontvangen hebt, gij dit niet ontvangen hebt als het woord van menschen, maar, zooals het waarlijk is, als een woord van God, die ook werkt in u die gelooft. 
[2:14]  Want gij zijt navolgers geworden, broeders, van de gemeenten Gods die in Judea zijn, in Christus Jezus, want dezelfde dingen hebt ook gij geleden van uw eigen medeburgers, zooals zij van de Joden,
[2:15] die ook den Heere Jezus gedood hebben en de profeten, en die ons vervolgd hebben en aan God niet behagen en tegen alle menschen zijn,
[2:16] die ons beletten om tot de heidenen te spreken opdat zij zouden behouden worden, — om ten allen tijde hun zonden vol te maken. Doch de gramschap is over hen gekomen tot den einde toe. 
[2:17]  Doch wij, broeders, voor een korten tijd van u gescheiden zijnde naar het aangezicht, niet naar het hart, hebben te overvloediger getracht om uw aangezicht te zien, met groot verlangen.
[2:18] Daarom hebben wij tot u willen komen, ik Paulus wel een en andermaal; maar de satan heeft het ons belet.
[2:19] Want welke is toch onze hope, of blijdschap, of kroon des roems? Zijt gij dat niet voor onzen Heere Jezus Christus, in zijn verschijning?
[2:20] Want gijlieden zijt onze glorie en blijdschap.  
[3:1] Daarom, niet langer kunnende wachten, wilden wij gaarne in Athene alleen gelaten worden,
[3:2] en hebben Timotheüs afgezonden, onzen broeder en dienaar van God in het Evangelie van Christus, om u te versterken en u te vermanen vanwege uw geloof,
[3:3] opdat niemand beroerd zou worden in deze verdrukkingen, want gij weet zelf dat wij daartoe gesteld zijn.
[3:4] Want ook als wij bij u waren hebben wij u voorzegd dat wij zouden verdrukt worden, zooals het ook geschied is en gij weet het.
[3:5] Daarom heb ik, niet langer kunnende wachten, hem gezonden om van uw geloof kennis te nemen, of niet de bekoorder u mocht bekoord hebben en onze arbeid tevergeefs mocht geweest zijn. 
[3:6]  Maar als nu Timotheüs van u tot ons gekomen was en ons de goede boodschap gebracht had van uw geloof en liefde, en dat gij altijd goede gedachtenis van ons hebt, en zeer begeerig zijt om ons te zien, zooals wij ook om u te zien,
[3:7] zoo zijn wij, broeders, daarom vertroost over ulieden in al onze moeilijkheid en verdrukking door uw geloof.
[3:8] Want nu leven wij als gij vast staat in den Heere.
[3:9] Want wat dankbaarheid kunnen wij aan God wedergeven voor u, vanwege al de blijdschap waarmede wij verblijd zijn voor onzen God?
[3:10] Nacht en dag zeer vuriglijk biddende om uw aangezicht te mogen zien en om aan te vullen hetgeen aan uw geloof ontbreekt.
[3:11] Doch onze God en Vader zelf en onze Heere Jezus Christus, Hij bane onzen weg tot u. 
[3:12]  En de Heere doe u toenemen en overvloedig worden in de liefde tot elkander en tot allen, zooals ook wij zijn tot ulieden,
[3:13] ten einde uw harten te versterken om onberispelijk te zijn in heiligheid voor onzen God en Vader, in de verschijning van onzen Heere Jezus Christus met al zijn heiligen. Amen.  
[4:1] Ten slotte dan, broeders, verzoeken en vermanen wij u in den Heere Jezus, dat, zooals gij van ons geleerd hebt hoe gij wandelen moet en aan God behagen, gij ook alzoo wandelt, opdat gij meer moogt toenemen.
[4:2] Want gij weet welke bevelen wij ulieden gegeven hebben door den Heere Jezus.
[4:3] Want dit is de wil van God: uw heiligmaking; dat gij u zoudt onthouden van de hoererij;
[4:4] dat een ieder van u zijn eigen lichaam wete te bezitten in heiligmaking en eerbaarheid,
[4:5] niet in drift van begeerlijkheid zooals de heidenen die God niet kennen,
[4:6] om in dit opzicht zijn broeder toch niet te verdrukken en te bedriegen, want de Heere is een wreker over dit alles, zooals wij u te voren gezegd en betuigd hebben.
[4:7] Want God heeft ons niet geroepen tot onzuiverheid maar in heiligmaking.
[4:8] Die dus dit veracht, die veracht geen mensch maar God die ook zijn Heiligen Geest aan u heeft gegeven. 
[4:9]  Doch aangaande de broederliefde heb ik niet noodig u te schrijven, want gij zelf zijt van God geleerd om elkander te beminnen.
[4:10] Want gij doet ook dit aan al de broeders in geheel Macedonië. Doch wij vermanen u, broeders, dat gij daarin meer toeneemt,
[4:11] en dat gij uw best doe om stil te zijn en uw eigen dingen te doen en met uw handen te werken, zooals wij u bevolen hebben;
[4:12] opdat gij betamelijk moogt wandelen voor degenen die buiten de gemeente; zijn en opdat gij van niemand iets noodig hebt. 
[4:13]  Doch wij willen niet broeders, dat gij onwetend zijt aangaande degenen die ontslapen zijn, opdat gij niet bedroefd zoudt zijn zooals de anderen die geen hop hebben.
[4:14] Want als wij gelooven dat Jezus gestorven is en verrezen, zoo zal God ook degenen die ontslapen zijn, door Jezus met Hem brengen.
[4:15] Want dit zeggen wij u op het woord des Heeren, dat wij die leven, die overgebleven zijn tot de verschijning des Heeren, in ‘t geheel niet vroeger komen zullen dan degenen die ontslapen zijn.
[4:16] Want de Heere zelf zal, onder een geroep, onder de stem van een aartsengel, en onder een bazuin van God, nederdalen van den hemel en die in Christus gestorven zijn zullen eerst opstaan.
[4:17] Daarna wij, de levenden, de overgeblevenen, zullen tegelijk met hen weggerukt worden in de wolken, tot ontmoeting van den Heere in de lucht; en alzoo zullen wij altijd met den Heere zijn.
[4:18] Vertroost dan elkander in deze woorden.  
[5:1] Toch wat aangaat de tijden en stonden, broeders, gij hebt niet noodig dat ik u daarvan schrijf,
[5:2] want gij weet zelf zeer goed dat de dag des Heeren zal komen als een dief in den nacht.
[5:3] Als zij zullen zeggen: vrede en veiligheid! dan overvalt hun een haastig verderf, zooals barensnood aan een zwangere; en zij zullen het geenszins ontvluchten. 
[5:4]  Maar gij, broeders, gij zijt niet in duisternis, dat u die dag zou bevangen als een dief.
[5:5] Want gij zijt allen kinderen van het licht en kinderen van den dag; wij zijn niet van den nacht noch van de duisternis.
[5:6] Zoo laat ons dan niet slapen gelijk de anderen, maar laat ons wakker zijn en nuchter.
[5:7] Want die slapen, slapen des nachts, en die dronken zijn, zijn des nachts dronken;
[5:8] maar wij die kinderen van den dag zijn, laat ons nuchter zijn, aangedaan hebbende het borstwapen van geloof en liefde en tot een hoofddeksel de hope der zaligheid.
[5:9] Want God heeft ons niet gesteld tot gramschap, maar tot het bekomen der zaligheid door onzen Heere Jezus Christus,
[5:10] die voor ons gestorven is, opdat hetzij wij wakker zijn, hetzij wij slapen, te zamen met Hem leven zouden.
[5:11] Daarom, vertroost elkander en bouwt elkander op, zooals gij ook doet. 
[5:12]  Doch wij verzoeken u, broeders, diegenen te erkennen die onder u arbeiden en die over u gesteld zijn in den Heere en die u vermanen,
[5:13] en hen zeer in groote waarde te houden in liefde om hun arbeid, zijt vreedzaam onder elkander. 
[5:14]  En wij vermanen u, broeders, bestraft de ongeregelden, bemoedigt de kleinmoedigen, ondersteunt de zwakken, zijt geduldig jegens allen.
[5:15] Ziet toe, dat niemand kwaad voor kwaad vergelde aan iemand, maar tracht altijd naar het goede voor elkander en voor allen.
[5:16] Zijt altijd blijde.
[5:17] Bidt zonder ophouden.
[5:18] Zijt dankbaar in alles; want dit is de wil van God in Christus Jezus jegens ulieden.
[5:19] Bluscht den Geest niet uit.
[5:20] Versmaadt de profetie niet.
[5:21] Beproeft alles; houdt het goede vast.
[5:22] Onthoudt u van allen schijn des kwaads. 
[5:23]  De God des vredes zelf heilige u geheel en al, en uw geest en ziel en lichaam moge geheel onbevlekt bewaard zijn in de verschijning van onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[5:24] Getrouw is Hij die u roept, die het ook zal doen.
[5:25] Broeders, bidt voor ons.
[5:26] Groet al de broeders, met een heiligen kus.
[5:27] Ik bezweer u bij den Heere, dat deze brief moet voorgelezen worden aan al de broeders.
[5:28] De genade van onzen Heere Jezus Christus zij met ulieden. Amen.   

### II Thessalonians

[1:1] Paulus en Silvanus en Timotheüs, aan de gemeente der Thessalonikers, in God onzen Vader en den Heere Jezus Christus:
[1:2] genade zij ulieden en vrede van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Wij moeten God altijd over u danken, broeders, gelijk betamelijk is, omdat uw geloof zeer aanwast en omdat de liefde van u allen tot malkander zeer toeneemt,
[1:4] zoodat wij zelf ook in u roemen in de gemeenten Gods, over uw volhardingen geloof in al uw vervolgingen en de verdrukkingen die gij verdraagt,
[1:5] tot een bewijs van Gods rechtvaardig oordeel, opdat gij waardig zoudt geacht worden het koninkrijk Gods waarvoor gij ook lijdt. 
[1:6]  Want het is rechtvaardig bij God om verdrukking te vergelden aan uw verdrukkers,
[1:7] en aan u die verdrukt wordt verkwikking met ons, in de openbaring van den Heere Jezus van den hemel, met de engelen zijner macht, in vlammend vuur,
[1:8] wraak doende aan degenen die God niet kennen en aan degenen die het Evangelie van onzen Heere Jezus Christus niet gehoorzaam zijn,
[1:9] die gestraft zullen worden met een eeuwig verderf van het aangezicht des Heeren en van de glorie zijner sterkte,
[1:10] als Hij zal komen om de glorie te ontvangen in zijn heiligen en zich wonderbaar te vertoonen in allen die gelooven, in dien dag; want ons getuigenis aan ulieden is geloofd geworden. 
[1:11]  Tot dien einde bidden wij ook altijd voor ulieden, opdat onze God u uw roeping waardig moge maken en Hij al het welbehagen zijner goedheid en het werk des geloofs met kracht vervullen moge,
[1:12] opdat de Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus in u de glorie ontvangen moge, en gij in Hem, naar de genade van onzen God en van den Heere Jezus Christus.  
[2:1] Doch wij bidden u, broeders, wat aangaat de verschijning van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, en onze bijeenvergadering met Hem;
[2:2] laat u toch niet lichtelijk beroeren van gemoed, noch verschrikken, zoo min door een geest, als door een woord of door een brief die door ons zou geschreven zijn, alsof de dag des Heeren voor de deur staat. 
[2:3]  Laat niemand u verleiden op eenigerlei wijze, want die dag des Heeren komt niet als eerst de afval niet gekomen is en openbaar geworden is de mensch der wetteloosheid, de zoon des verderfs,
[2:4] de tegenstander en verheffer van zich zelven boven al wat God genoemd wordt of wat godsdienstig vereerd wordt, zoodat hij zich zelven zal zetten in den tempel Gods, zich zelven voordoende alsof hij God is. 
[2:5]  Hebt gij niet onthouden dat ik, toen ik nog bij ulieden was, u deze dingen gezegd heb?
[2:6] En nu weet gij wel wat hem terughoudt opdat hij op zijn tijd openbaar worde.
[2:7] Want de verborgenheid der wetteloosheid werkt alreeds; alleenlijk die hem terughoudt moet nog uit het midden weggedaan zijn,
[2:8] en alsdan zal de wettelooze openbaar worden, dien de Heere Jezus vernielen zal door den adem zijns monds en vernietigen zal door de verschijning zijner toekomst;
[2:9] wiens toekomst is naaide werking des Satans, in alle kracht en teekenen en mirakelen der leugen,
[2:10] en in alle verleiding van onrechtvaardigheid voor degenen die verloren gaan, omdat zij de liefde der waarheid niet hebben aangenomen om behouden te worden.
[2:11] En daarom zendt God hun een kracht van doling, om ze in den leugen te doen gelooven,
[2:12] opdat zij allen zouden geoordeeld worden die niet geloofd hebben in de waarheid, maar die een welbehagen gehad hebben in de onrechtvaardigheid. 
[2:13]  Doch wij moeten God altijd danken over ulieden, broeders die van den Heere bemind zijt, omdat God u verkozen heeft van den beginne tot behoudenis, in heiligmaking des Geestes en geloof der waarheid,
[2:14] waartoe Hij u ook geroepen heeft door ons Evangelie, tot bekoming der glorie van onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[2:15] Zoo dan, broeders, staat vast en behoudt de overleveringen die gij geleerd hebt hetzij door woord, hetzij door onzen brief.
[2:16] En onze Heere Jezus Christus zelf en onze God en Vader die ons bemind heeft en een eeuwige vertroosting gegeven heeft, en goede hope in genade,
[2:17] die moge uw harten vertroosten en versterken in alle goed werk en woord.  
[3:1] Tenslotte, broeders, bidt voor ons, opdat het woord des Heeren verspreid worden moge en de glorie ontvange, zooals het ook is bij ulieden,
[3:2] en opdat wij verlost mogen worden van de ongeregelde en kwade menschen; want het geloof is niet gemeen aan allen.
[3:3] Doch de Heere is getrouw, die ulieden versterken zal en bewaren van het kwaad.
[3:4] En wij vertrouwen in den Heere van ulieden dat gij doet en doen zult wat wij gebieden.
[3:5] Doch de Heere bestiere uw harten tot de liefde Gods en tot de volharding van Christus. 
[3:6]  En wij gebieden u, broeders, in den Naam van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, u te onttrekken van allen broeder die ongeregeld wandelt, en niet naar de overlevering die zij van ons ontvangen hebben.
[3:7] Want gij weet zelf hoe noodig het is ons na te volgen, omdat wij ons niet ongeregeld gedragen hebben onder u;
[3:8] ook hebben wij geen brood van u voor niet gegeten, maar nacht en dag werkende in arbeid en moeite, om niemand van u te bezwaren.
[3:9] Niet dat wij daartoe geen macht hadden, maar om zelf ulieden een voorbeeld te geven om ons na te volgen.
[3:10] Want toen wij bij u waren hebben wij dit gezegd dat, als iemand niet wil werken dan moet hij ook niet eten.
[3:11] Want wij hooren dat sommigen onder u ongeregeld wandelen, niet werkende maar ledig loopende.
[3:12] Doch den zoodanige gebieden en vermanen wij in den Heere Jezus Christus, om stillekens te werken en hun eigen brood te eten. 
[3:13]  Maar gij, broeders, houdt niet op van goed te doen.
[3:14] En als iemand niet gehoorzaamt aan ons woord door dezen brief, houdt hem in het oog; hebt geen gemeenschap met hem opdat hij beschaamd worde;
[3:15] en beschouwt hem niet als een vijand, maar bestraft hem als een broeder. 
[3:16]  Doch de Heere de vredes zelf geve u den vrede ten allen tijde, in alle wijze: De Heer zij met u allen!
[3:17] De groetenis met mijn hand, van Paulus. Dit is een teeken in eiken brief. Alzoo schrijf ik.
[3:18] De genade van onze Heere Jezus Christus zij me u allen. Amen.   

### I Timothy

[1:1] Paulus, een apostel van Jezus Christus, naar het gebod van God, onzen Zaligmaker, en van Jezus Christus, onze hope,
[1:2] aan Timotheüs, mijn oprechten zoon in het geloof: genade, barmhartigheid, vrede zij u, van God den Vader, en van Christus Jezus, onzen Heer. 
[1:3]  Doe zooals ik u vermaand heb om in Efesus te blijven, als ik naar Macedonië ging, opdat gij aan sommigen zoudt gebieden geen vreemde leering te leeren,
[1:4] noch zich bezig te houden met fabelen en eindelooze geslachtlijsten, die meer twistredenen voortbrengen dan opbouwing Gods, die in het geloof is.
[1:5] Doch het einde van het gebod is liefde uit een zuiver hart en een goede konsciëntie en een ongeveinsd geloof,
[1:6] waarvan sommigen afgedoold zijn, zich gekeerd hebbende tot ledig geklap,
[1:7] willende leeraars der wet zijn, niet verstaande, noch wat zij zeggen, noch wat zij bevestigen.
[1:8] Doch wij weten dat de wet goed is, als iemand ze op wettige manier gebruikt,
[1:9] dit wetende, dat de wet niet gemaakt is voor een rechtvaardige, maar voor onrechtvaardigen en wederspannigen, voor goddeloozen en zondaars, voor onheiligen en ongoddelijken, voor vadermoorders en moedermoorders, voor doodslagers,
[1:10] voor hoereerders, voor sodomieters, voor menschendieven, voor leugenaars, voor meineedigen, en al het overige dat strijdt tegen de gezonde leering,
[1:11] volgens het Evangelie der glorie van den zaligen God, dat mij toevertrouwd is. 
[1:12]  Ik dank onzen Heere Jezus Christus, die mij krach t gegeven heeft, dat Hij mij getrouw geacht heeft, stellende mij in de bediening,
[1:13] mij, die vroeger een lasteraar was, en een vervolger en een verdrukker: maar ik verkreeg barmhartigheid, omdat ik het onwetend deed in ongeloof.
[1:14] En de genade van onzen Heer was overvloedig met geloof en liefde, die in Christus Jezus is.
[1:15] Waarachtig is het woord, en waardig aller aanneming, dat Jezus Christus gekomen is tot de wereld om zondaren te behouden, waarvan ik de eerste ben.
[1:16] Maar daarom verkreeg ik barmhartigheid, opdat Jezus Christus in mij, als den eerste, alle lankmoedigheid zou betoonen, tot een voorbeeld van degenen die gelooven zullen tot het eeuwige leven.
[1:17] Den Koning nu der eeuwen, den onverderfelijken, onzichtbaren, eenigen God, zij lof en glorie tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen. 
[1:18]  Dit gebod gebied ik u, mijn zoon Timotheüs, naar de profetieën die te voren over u gesproken zijn, dat gij in deze den goeden strijd zult strijden,
[1:19] behoudende het geloof en een goede konsciëntie, die sommigen verstooten hebbende, schipbreuk hebben geleden in het geloof,
[1:20] waaronder Hymeneüs en Alexander zijn, die ik aan den Satan heb overgegeven, opdat zij leeren mogen niet te lasteren.  
[2:1] Ik vermaan dan, vóór alle dingen, dat er gedaan worden smeekingen, gebeden, voorbiddingen, dankzeggingen, voor alle menschen;
[2:2] voor koningen en voor allen die in hoogheid zijn, opdat wij een rustig en stil leven mogen leiden, in alle godvruchtigheid en eerbaarheid.
[2:3] Want dat is goed en aangenaam voor het aangezicht van God, onzen Zaligmaker,
[2:4] die wil dat alle menschen behouden worden en komen tot kennis der waarheid.
[2:5] Want er is één God, ook één Middelaar tusschen God en menschen, die zelf mensch is, Christus Jezus,
[2:6] die zich zelven gegeven heeft tot een losprijs voor allen, het getuigenis ter geschikter tijd,
[2:7] waartoe ik gesteld ben als prediker en apostel, (ik spreek waarheid, ik lieg niet!) als leer aar der heidenen in geloof en waarheid. 
[2:8]  Ik wil dan dat de mannen bidden in alle plaats, opheffende heilige handen, zonder gramschap en twisting.
[2:9] Evenzoo dat ook de vrouwen in een zedig gewaad, met schaamte en ingetogenheid, zich zelven versieren, niet met haarvlechten en goud, of paarlen, of kostbare kleeding,
[2:10] maar— gelijk het aan vrouwen betaamt die belijden God te vreezen— door goede werken.
[2:11] Een vrouw moet zich laten onderwijzen in stilheid, in alle onderdanigheid.
[2:12] Doch ik laat aan een vrouw niet toe om onderwijs te geven, noch om over den man te heerschen maar om in stilheid te zijn.
[2:13] Want Adam is eerst gevormd, daarna Eva.
[2:14] En Adam is niet verleid, maar de vrouw, verleid zijnde, is in overtreding geweest;
[2:15] doch zij zal behouden worden door kinderen te baren, als zij blijven in geloof en liefde en heiligheid, met ingetogenheid.  
[3:1] Waasachtig is het gezegde: als iemand de bediening van een opziener zoekt, dan begeert hij een goed werk.
[3:2] Daarom moet de opziener onberispelijk zijn, de man van één vrouw, matig, ingetogen, eerbaar, genegen tot herbergzaamheid, bekwaam tot onderwijs,
[3:3] niet genegen tot wijn, geen twister, maar zedig, vreedzaam, niet geldzuchtig,
[3:4] die zijn eigen huisgezin goed bestiert, zijn kinderen in onderdanigheid houdende met alle eerbaarheid;
[3:5] — want als iemand zijn eigen huisgezin niet weet te bestieren, hoe zal hij zorgdragen voor de gemeente Gods?
[3:6] geen nieuweling, opdat hij niet valle in het oordeel des duivels, door hoovaardigheid.
[3:7] Hij moet ook een goed getuigenis hebben van degenen die buiten de gemeente zijn, opdat hij niet valle tot verachting en in een strik des duivels. 
[3:8]  De diakenen insgelijks moet eerbaar zijn, niet dubbel van tong, niet genegen tot veel wijn, geen vuil gewin zoekers,
[3:9] hebbende de verborgenheid des geloofs in een zuivere konsciëntie.
[3:10] En dezen moeten ook eerst op de proef gesteld worden en daarna mogen zij dienen als diakenen als zij onberispelijk zijn.
[3:11] De vrouwen insgelijks moeten eerbaar zijn, geen lasteressen, matig, getrouw in alles.
[3:12] Diakens moeten aangesteld worden die mannen zijn van één vrouw, hun kinderen en hun eigen huisgezinnen goed bestieren.
[3:13] Want die goed zullen gediend hebben als diakenen, die zullen voor zich zelven een goeden opgang verkrijgen en veel vrijmoedigheid in het geloof dat in Christus Jezus is. 
[3:14]  Dit schrijf ik u, hopende haast tot u te komen;
[3:15] doch als ik vertoef, opdat gij weten moogt hoe gij u moet gedragen in het huis Gods, dat is de gemeente van den levenden God, de pilaar en steun van de waarheid.
[3:16] En buiten twijfel, groot is de verborgenheid der godvruchtigheid! Die geopenbaard is in het vleesch, is gerechtvaardigd in den geest, is verschenen aan de engelen, is gepredikt onder de heidenen, is geloofd in de wereld, is opgenomen in glorie!  
[4:1] Doch de Geest zegt duidelijk dat er in de laatste tijden sommigen zullen afvallen van liet geloof, luisterende naar verleidende geesten en naar leeringen der booze geesten,
[4:2] in geveinsdheid der leugensprekers, hun eigene konscientië toegebrand hebbende,
[4:3] verbiedende te trouwen, ca gebiedende zich te onthouden van spijzen die God geschapen heeft om met dankzegging gebruikt te worden door de geloovigen en die de waarheid hebben bekend.
[4:4] Want alle schepsel Gods is goed, en niets is er verwerpelijk, genomen zijnde met dankzegging,
[4:5] want het wordt geheiligd door Gods woord en door gebed. 
[4:6]  Deze dingen den broederen voorstellende zult gij een goed dienaar van Jezus Christus zijn, opgevoed met de woorden des geloofs en der goede leering die gij gevolgd hebt.
[4:7] Doch verwerp de ongoddelijke en oudwijfsche fabelen, en oefen u zelven tot godvruchtigheid,
[4:8] want de lichamelijke oefening is tot weinig voordeelig, maar de godvruchtigheid is tot alles voordeelig, hebbende een belofte voor het tegenwoordige en het toekomende leven.
[4:9] Waarachtig is het woord en waardig aller aanneming.
[4:10] Want tot dien einde arbeiden wij en strijden wij, omdat wij hebben gehoopt op den levenden God, die een behouder is van alle menschen, doch het meest van de geloovigen. 
[4:11]  Verkondig en onderwijs deze dingen.
[4:12] Dat niemand uw jonkheid verachte, maar zijt een voorbeeld der geloovigen in woord, in levensmanier, in liefde, in vertrouwen, in reinheid.
[4:13] Houd aan met het lezen, met liet vermanen, met liet onderwijzen totdat ik kom.
[4:14] Verzuim niet de genadegave die in u is, die u gegeven is door profetie met oplegging der handen van het ouderlingschap.
[4:15] Bedenk deze dingen, maak er werk van, opdat uw vooruitgang openbaar zij aan allen.
[4:16] Let op u zelven en op het onderwijs; volhard in deze dingen; want dit doende zult gij u zelven behouden en degenen die u hooren.  
[5:1] Bestraf een ouden man niet scherpelijk, maar vermaan hem als een vader; de jonge mannen als broeders;
[5:2] oude vrouwen als moeders, jonge vrouwen als zusters in alle reinheid.
[5:3] Acht de weduwen die waarlijk weduwen zijn.
[5:4] Doch als een weduwe kinderen heeft, of kindskinderen, laat die dan leeren eerst hun eigen huisgezin godvruchtig te verzorgen en wedervergelding te bewijzen aan de ouders; want dat is aangenaam voor Gods aangezicht.
[5:5] Doch die waarlijk weduwe is en alleen gelaten, die moet op God hopen en volharden in smeekingen en gebeden nacht en dag.
[5:6] Maar die wellustig leeft die is levende dood.
[5:7] Beveel dan deze dingen opdat zij onberispelijk mogen zijn.
[5:8] Doch als iemand niet zorgt voor de zijnen, en vooral voor zijn huisgenoot ten, die heeft het geloof verloochend en is erger dan een ongeloovige.
[5:9] Laat er geen weduwe gekozen worden tot verzorgster die minder dan zestig jaar oud is, en alleen die de vrouw van één man is geweest,
[5:10] die een goed getuigenis heeft in goede werken; als zij kinderen opgevoed heeft, als zij vreemdelingen geherbergd heeft, als zij de voeten van heiligen gewasschen heeft, als zij hulp bewezen heeft aan verdrukten, als zij allerlei goed werk nagevolgd heeft.
[5:11] Doch jongere weduwen moet gij weigeren als verzorgsters, want als zij door wellustigheid afgevoerd zijn van Christus dan willen zij trouwen,
[5:12] schuldig zijnde omdat zij haar eerste trouw geschonden hebben.
[5:13] Daarenboven leeren zij ook ledig te zijn, bij de huizen omloopende, en niet al leen ledig maar ook klapachtig en bemoeizuchtig, sprekende hetgeen niet betaamt.
[5:14] Ik wil dan dat jongere weduwen trouwen, kinderen voortbrengen, het huisgezin waarnemen, geen oorzaak geven aan de tegenpartij om te lasteren.
[5:15] Want sommigen zijn alreeds afgeweken achter den Satan.
[5:16] Als eenige geloovige, hetzij man of vrouw, weduwen heeft in zijn familie, dat hij die verzorge, en dat de gemeente niet bezwaard worde, opdat zij genoeg moge hebben voor degenen die waarlijk weduwen zijn. 
[5:17]  Voor de ouderlingen, die goed besturen, moet men dubbele achting hebben, vooral voor degenen die arbeiden in het woord en in het onderwijs.
[5:18] Want de Schriftuur zegt: een os die den dorschvloer treedt zult gij niet muilbanden en de werkman is zijn loon waardig.
[5:19] Tegen een ouderling zult gij geen beschuldiging opnemen, dan alleen onder twee of drie getuigen.
[5:20] Degenen die zondigen, moet gij bestraffen voor het aangezicht van allen, opdat ook de overigen mogen vreezen. 
[5:21]  Ik betuig voor het aangezicht van God en van Christus Jezus en van de uitverkoren engelen, dat gij deze dingen onderhoudt, zonder vooringenomenheid, niets doende naar voorliefde.
[5:22] Leg aan niemand haastelijk de handen op, en heb geen gemeenschap met de zonden van anderen. Bewaar u zelven rein.
[5:23] Drink niet langer water, maar gebruik een weinig wijn, om uw maag en om uw menigvuldige zwakheden.
[5:24] De zonden van sommige menschen zijn vooraf openbaar, eer men ze onderzoekt, doch die van anderen komen daarna te voorschijn.
[5:25] Desgelijks ook zijn de goede werken vooraf openbaar, en die het niet zijn die kunnen niet verborgen blijven.  
[6:1] zoovelen als er dienstbaren zijn onder het juk moeten hun eigen meesters allen eerbied waardig achten, opdat de Naam van God en de leering niet gelasterd worden moge.
[6:2] En die geloovige meesters hebben mogen dezen niet minachten omdat zij broeders zijn, maar zij moeten hen te meer dienen omdat zij geloovig en bemind zijn, als zijnde mededeelgenooten derzelfde weldaad. Onderwijs deze dingen en vermaan hen. 
[6:3]  Als iemand wat anders onderwijst en zich niet voegt naar de gezonde woorden van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, en naar het onderwijs dat naar de godvruchtigheid is,
[6:4] die is opgeblazen, niets wetende, maar razende over vraagstukken en redeneeringen, waaruit nijdigheid voortkomt, twist, lasteringen, kwade bedenkingen,
[6:5] krakeelingen van menschen die verdorven zijn van zin en van de waarheid beroofd, meenende dat de godvruchtigheid een gewin is. 
[6:6]  En de godvruchtigheid is een groot gewin met vergenoegdheid.
[6:7] Want wij hebben niets in de wereld gebracht en het is zeker dat wij er ook niets kunnen uitdragen.
[6:8] Maar voedsel hebbende en deksel, zullen wij daarmede tevreden zijn.
[6:9] Doch die willen rijk worden vallen in bekoring en in een strik en in vele dwaze en schadelijke begeerlijkheden, die de menschen doen zinken tot verderf en ondergang,
[6:10] want een wortel van alle kwaad is de gierigheid, waartoe sommigen zich begevende zijn afgedwaald van het geloof en zich zelven met vele smarten hebben doorstoken. 
[6:11]  Maar gij, o mensch Gods! vlied deze dingen, en tracht naar rechtvaardigheid, godvruchtigheid, geloof, liefde, volharding, zachtmoedigheid.
[6:12] Strijd den goeden strijd des geloofs, grijp naar het eeuwige leven, waartoe gij geroepen zijt en de goede belijdenis beleden hebt voor het aangezicht van veel getuigen.
[6:13] Ik gebied u voor het aangezicht van God die alle dingen leven doet en van Christus Jezus die de goede belijdenis voor Pontius Pilatus beleden heeft,
[6:14] dat gij het gebod onbevlekt, onberispelijk bewaart tot op de verschijning van onzen Heere Jezus Christus,
[6:15] die Hij ter rechter tijd vertoonen zal, Hij de zalige en alleen machtige, de Koning dergenen die als koningen heerschen en de Heer dergenen die als heeren gebieden,
[6:16] die alleen onsterfelijkheid bezit, een ongenaakbaar licht bewonende, dien geen mensch gezien heeft, noch zien kan; aan wien de eere toekomt en eeuwige kracht! Amen. 
[6:17]  Aan de rijken in de tegenwoordige eeuw moet gij gebieden niet hoogmoedig te zijn, noch te vertrouwen op de ongestadigheid van den rijkdom, maar op den God die leeft en die ons alle dingen overvloediglijk verschaft tot gebruik;
[6:18] om weldadig te zijn, rijk te zijn in goede werken, gewillig te zijn tot uitdeelen, gemeenzaam te zijn,
[6:19] voor zich zelven een goeden grond bijeen verzamelende tot de toekomst, opdat zij het waarachtige leven mogen bekomen. 
[6:20]  O Timotheüs! bewaar wat u is toebetrouwd, u afkeerende van het ledig geklap en van de tegenspraak der zoogenaamde wetenschap,
[6:21] die sommigen uitbazuinende, van het geloof zijn afgedoold. De genade zij met u! Amen.   

### II Timothy

[1:1] Paulus, een apostel van Jezus Christus, door den wil van God, naar de belofte des levens dat in Christus Jezus is;
[1:2] aan Timotheüs, mijn beminden zoon: genade, barmhartigheid, vrede, van God den Vader en van onzen Heere Jezus Christus! 
[1:3]  Ik dank God, wien ik dien van mijn voorouders af in een zuivere konsciëntie, gelijk ik onophoudelijk aan u gedachtig ben in mijn gebeden, nacht en dag,
[1:4] begeerende u te zien, gedachtig zijnde aan uw tranen, opdat ik vervuld moge; worden met blijdschap,
[1:5] mij in gedachtenis brengende het ongeveinsd geloof dat in u is, dat eerst gewoond heeft in uw grootmoeder Loïs en in uw moeder Eunice; en ik ben overtuigd dat het ook in u is. 
[1:6]  Daarom breng ik u in gedachtenis dat gij de genadegifte Gods weder moet opwekken die in u is door de oplegging mijner handen.
[1:7] Want God heeft ons niet gegeven een geest van vreesachtigheid, maar van kracht en van liefde en van matigheid.
[1:8] Schaam u dan niet over het getuigenis van onzen Heere, noch over mij, zijn gevangene, maar lijd mede met het Evangelie, naar de kracht van God,
[1:9] die ons verlost heeft en geroepen met een heilige roeping, niet naar onze werken maar naar zijn eigen voornemen en genade, die ons gegeven is in Christus Jezus vóór de tijden der eeuwen,
[1:10] doch die nu geopenbaard is door de verschijning van onzen Verlosser Jezus Christus, die den dood heeft krachteloos gemaakt, doch leven en onverderfelijkheid heeft te voorschijn gebracht door het Evangelie,
[1:11] waartoe ik gesteld ben als een prediker en apostel en leeraar.
[1:12] Om welke oorzaak ook ik deze dingen lijd, maar ik ben niet beschaamd geworden; want ik weet in wien ik geloofd heb, en ik ben overtuigd dat Hij machtig is te bewaren wat mij toebetrouwd is, tot dien dag. 
[1:13]  Houd vast het voorbeeld der gezonde woorden die gij van mij gehoord hebt in geloof en liefde, die in Christus Jezus is.
[1:14] Bewaar het goede dat u toevertrouwd is, door den Heiligen Geest die in ons woont. 
[1:15]  Gij weet dit, dat allen die in Asië zijn van mij afgekeerd zijn, waaronder ook Fygellus en Hermogenes.
[1:16] De Heere doe barmhartigheid aan het huisgezin van Onesiforus, want dikwijls heeft hij mij verkwikt en zich niet geschaamd over mijn boeien;
[1:17] maar in Rome gekomen zijnde heeft hij mij weldra gezocht en gevonden;
[1:18] de Heere geve hem barmhartigheid te vinden bij den Heere in dien dag. En hoezeer hij in Efesus is dienstig geweest, dat weet gij zeer wel.  
[2:1] Gij dan, mijn zoon, word gesterkt in de genade die in Christus Jezus is.
[2:2] En wat gij gehoord hebt van mij door veel getuigen, vertrouw gij dat toe aan getrouwe menschen, die bekwaam zullen zijn ook anderen te onderwijzen.
[2:3] Lijd mede verdrukking als een goed krijgsknecht van Jezus Christus.
[2:4] Niemand die in den krijgsdienst is bemoeit zich met de zaken van den leeftocht, opdat hij moge behagen aan dengene die hem tot den krijgsdienst aangenomen heeft.
[2:5] En ook als iemand strijdt dan wordt hij niet gekroond als hij niet wettelijk gestreden heeft.
[2:6] De landman die arbeidt moet het eerst van de vruchten genieten.
[2:7] Let wel op hetgeen ik zeg; want de Heere zal u verstand geven in alles.
[2:8] Houd in gedachtenis Jezus Christus, verrezen uit de dooden, uit de nakomelingschap van David, volgens mijn Evangelie,
[2:9] waarin ik verdrukking lijd tot de boeien toe, als een kwaaddoener, maar het woord Gods wordt niet gebonden.
[2:10] Daarom verdraag ik alles om de uitverkorenen, opdat ook zij de zaligheid bekomen zouden, die is in Christus Jezus, met eeuwige glorie.
[2:11] Waarachtig is het woord: want als wij mede gestorven zijn, zullen wij ook mede leven;
[2:12] als wij verdragen, dan zullen wij ook mede als koningen heerschen; als wij Hem verloochenen, dan zal Hij ons ook verloochenen;
[2:13] als wij ontrouw zijn, Hij blijft getrouw, want Hij kan zichzelven niet verloochenen.
[2:14] Breng deze dingen in gedachtenis, hen betuigende voor het aangezicht van God dat zij geen woordenstrijd voeren, dat tot niets dient, en tot nadeel is der hoorders.
[2:15] Benaarstig u om u zelven beproefd voor God te stellen, als een arbeider die; zich niet moet schamen, die het woord der waarheid recht snijdt.
[2:16] Doch stel u tegen de goddelooze ijdele klapperijen, want zij zullen meer en meer: toenemen in goddeloosheid,
[2:17] en hun woord zal voort eten als een kanker; van dezen zijn Hymeneüs en Filetus,
[2:18] die van de waarheid zijn afgevallen, zeggende dat de verrijzenis al geschied is en die het geloof van sommigen ondermijnen.
[2:19] Toch staat het vaste fundament Gods, dat dit zegel heeft de Heere kent degenen die van Hem zijn; en ook dit dat hij afstand doe van onrechtvaardigheid, al wie den Naam des Heeren belijdt.
[2:20] Doch in een groot huis zijn niet alleen vaten van goud en van zilver, maar ook van hout en van aarde, en sommigen zijn tot versiering maar anderen tot ontsiering.
[2:21] Als dan iemand zich zelven van die dingen gezuiverd heeft dan zal hij zijn een vat tot versiering, geheiligd, dienstig voor den meester, tot alle goed werk geschikt.
[2:22] Maar vlied de lusten der jonkheid, en tracht naar rechtvaardigheid, vertrouwen, liefde, vrede met degenen die den Heer aanroepen uit een zuiver hart.
[2:23] Maar dwaze en onleerzame vraagstukken moet gij verwerpen, wetende dat zij twistingen voortbrengen.
[2:24] Doch een dienstknecht des Heeren moet niet twisten maar vriendelijk zijn jegens allen, bekwaam om te onderwijzen, verdraagzaam,
[2:25] in zachtmoedigheid onderwijzende degenen die tegenstaan, of wellicht God hun te eenigertijd boetvaardigheid mocht geven tot kennis der waarheid,
[2:26] en zij wederom wakker mochten worden uit den strik des duivels, onder wien zij gevangen waren tot zijn wil.  
[3:1] Doch gij moet dat weten dat er in de laatste dagen moeilijke tijden zullen komen.
[3:2] Want de menschen zullen zijn zelfzuchtig, geldgierig, grootsprekers, hoovaardig, lasteraars, den ouders ongehoorzaam, ondankbaar, onheilig,
[3:3] zonder natuurlijke liefde, onverzoenlijk, oproerig, onmatig, wreed, zonder liefde voor het goede,
[3:4] verraders, opgewonden, opgeblazen, meer liefhebbers van wellusten dan liefhebbers van God,
[3:5] wel den vorm houdende van godvruchtigheid maar de kracht van deze verloochenende. Keer u ook af van dezen. 
[3:6]  Want uit dezen zijn zij die insluipen in de huizen en de vrouwkens gevangen nemen die met zonden beladen zijn, gedreven wordende door velerlei begeerlijkheden,
[3:7] altijd leerende en nooit tot kennis der waarheid kunnende komen.
[3:8] En op dezelfde wijze als Jannes en Jambres aan Mozes tegenstonden, zoo staan ook dezen de waarheid tegen menschen, verdorven van verstand, verwerpelijk wat het geloof betreft.
[3:9] Maar zij zullen niet verder voortgaan, want hun onverstand zal voor allen openbaar zijn, gelijk ook dat van die Jannes en Jambres geweest is. 
[3:10]  Doch gij hebt achtervolgd mijn onderwijs, omgang, inzicht, geloof, lankmoedigheid, liefde, volharding,
[3:11] vervolgingen, smarten, hetgeen mij overkomen is in Antiochië, in Ikoniüm, in Lystre; hoedanige vervolgingen ik doorgestaan heb; en uit die allen heeft de Heer mij verlost.
[3:12] En allen die godvruchtig willen leven in Christus Jezus, die zullen vervolgd worden.
[3:13] Doch ondeugende menschen en verleiders zullen tot erger voortgaan, dwalende en tot dwaling vervoerende.
[3:14] Maar blijf gij in de dingen die gij geleerd hebt en waarvan gij verzekerd zijt, wetende van wien gij ze geleerd hebt,
[3:15] en dat gij van kinds af de Heilige Schriften hebt geweten die u kunnen onder wijzen tot behoudenis door het geloof dat in Christus Jezus is.
[3:16] Alle Schriftuur is van God ingegeven en dienstig tot onderwijzing, tot bestraffing, tot verbetering, tot opvoeding die in de rechtvaardigheid is
[3:17] opdat de mensch Gods volkomen moge zijn, tot alle goed werk volkomen bereid.  
[4:1] Ik betuig voor het aangezicht van God en van Jezus Christus, die levenden en dooden oordeelen zal, en bij zijn verschijning en zijn koninkrijk;
[4:2] predik het woord, dring het aan tijdig en ontijdig, bestraf, vermaan, berisp in alle zachtmoedigheid en onderwijzing.
[4:3] Want er zal een tijd zijn dat zij het gezonde onderwijs niet zullen verdragen, maar naar hun eigen begeerten zullen zij voor zich zelven onderwijzers verzamelen, daar zij belust zijn op het hooren van streelende dingen.
[4:4] En zij zullen het gehoor afkeeren van de waarheid, en zullen zich keeren tot fabelen.
[4:5] Maar gij, wees waakzaam in alles, verdraag het kwade, doe het werk van een evangelist, volbreng uw dienstwerk. 
[4:6]  Want ik word al geofferd en de tijd mijner losmaking is op handen.
[4:7] Den goeden strijd heb ik gestreden, den loop heb ik volbracht, het geloof heb ik bewaard.
[4:8] Voorts is voor mij weggelegd de kroon der rechtvaardigheid, die mij de Heere in dien dag geven zal, de rechtvaardige Rechter, doch niet alleen aan mij maar ook aan allen die zijn verschijning hebben bemind. 
[4:9]  Spoed u om haast tot mij te komen.
[4:10] Want Demas heeft mij verlaten, uit liefde tot de tegenwoordige eeuw, en is gereisd naar Thessalonika, Krescens naar Galatië, Titus naar Dalmatië.
[4:11] Lukas is alleen met mij. Neem Markus en breng hem met u, want hij is mij zeer nuttig tot het dienstwerk.
[4:12] Tychikus heb ik gezonden naar Efesus.
[4:13] Den mantel, dien ik in Troas heb gelaten bij Karpus, breng dien mede als gij komt; ook de boeken, vooral de perkamenten.
[4:14] Alexander de koperslager heeft mij veel kwaad toegebracht; de Heere zal hem loon geven naar zijn werken.
[4:15] Voor dezen moet gij u ook wachten, want hij heeft onze woorden zeer tegengestaan.
[4:16] In mijn eerste verdediging heeft niemand mij bijgestaan, maar zij hebben mij allen verlaten. Het moge hun niet toegerekend worden!
[4:17] Doch de Heere heeft mij bijgestaan en bekrachtigd, opdat door mij de prediking volkomen zou worden, en al de heidenen ze hooren zouden; en ik ben verlost uit den muil van den leeuw.
[4:18] De Heere zal mij verlossen van alle kwaad werk en zal mij bewaren tot zijn hemelsch koninkrijk. Hem zij de glorie tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen. 
[4:19]  Groet Priska en Aquila en het huisgezin van Onesiforus.
[4:20] Erastus is in Korinthe gebleven, doch Trofimus heb ik krank in Milete gelaten.
[4:21] Spoed u om vóór den winter te komen. U groeten Eubulus, en Pudens, en Linus, en Klaudia, en al de broeders.
[4:22] De Heere Jezus Christus zij met uw geest. De genade met ulieden! Amen.   

### Titus

[1:1] Paulus, een dienaar van God, en apostel van Jezus Christus, naar het geloof der uitverkorenen Gods en naar de kennis der waarheid die naar de godvruchtigheid is,
[1:2] op hope van het eeuwige leven, dat God die niet liegt beloofd heeft vóór de tijden der eeuwen,
[1:3] doch die zijn woord geopenbaard heeft ter zijner tijd in de prediking, die mij toevertrouwd is naar het gebod van God onzen Verlosser:
[1:4] Aan Titus, mijn oprechten zoon naar het gemeenschappelijk geloof, genade en vrede zij u van God den Vader en van Jezus Christus onzen Verlosser. 
[1:5]  Om die oorzaak heb ik u in Kreta gelaten, opdat gij in orde zoudt brengen hetgeen er nog ontbrak en dat gij van stad tot stad oudsten zoudt aanstellen, zooals ik u geboden heb.
[1:6] Als iemand onberispelijk is, de man van één vrouw, geloovige kinderen hebbende, niet onder beschuldiging van onmatigheid of ongehoorzaamheid.
[1:7] Want een opziener moet onberispelijk zijn als een huisverzorger Gods, niet eigenzinnig, niet boosaardig, niet genegen tot wijn, niet heftig, geen vuil gewin zoeker,
[1:8] maar gaarn herbergende, het goede beminnende, matig, rechtvaardig, heilig, ingetogen,
[1:9] vasthoudende aan het woord des geloofs dat naar de leering is, opdat hij bekwaam zij zoowel om te vermanen in de gezonde leering als ook om de tegensprekers te wederleggen. 
[1:10]  Want er zijn vele ongeregelden, ledige klappers en bedriegers, vooral die uit de besnijdenis zijn,
[1:11] die men den mond moet stoppen, die geheele huisgezinnen verkeeren, onderwijzende wat niet behoort, om vuil gewin.
[1:12] Een uit hen, een profeet uit hun midden, heeft gezegd: „de Kretenzen zijn altijd leugenaars, kwade beesten, luie buiken.”
[1:13] Dit getuigenis is waar. Om die reden moet gij hen scherpelijk bestraffen, opdat zij gezond mogen worden in het geloof,
[1:14] geen acht gevende op joodsche fabelen en geboden van menschen, die zich afkeeren van de waarheid.
[1:15] Alles is zuiver voor degenen die zuiver zijn; doch voor degenen die besmet en ongeloovig zijn is niets zuiver, maar zoowel hun verstand als hun konsciëntie is besmet.
[1:16] Zij belijden God te kennen, maar met de werken verloochenen zij Hem, want zij zijn afschuwelijk en ongehoorzaam en tot alle goed werk ongeschikt.  
[2:1] Doch gij, spreek hetgeen, de gezonde leering betaamt.
[2:2] Leer de oude mannen om nuchter te zijn, stemmig, matig, gezond in het geloof in de liefde, in de volharding.
[2:3] Leer evenzoo de oude vrouwen om in haar gedrag eerbiedwaardig te zijn, niet oproerig, niet genegen tot veel wijn, het goede onderwijzende,
[2:4] opdat zij aan de jonge vrouwen mogen leeren om haar mannen te beminnen, haar kinderen te beminnen,
[2:5] matig te zijn, kuisch te zijn, te huis te arbeiden, goed te zijn, onderworpen aan haar eigen mannen, opdat Gods woord niet gelasterd worden moge.
[2:6] Vermaan de jonge mannen desgelijks om matig te zijn in alles,
[2:7] u zelven een voorbeeld betoonende van goede werken, in het onderwijs onvervalschtheid, deftigheid
[2:8] gezond in liet woord da niet veroordeeld kan worde opdat hij die van de tegenpartij is beschaamd worde en niets kwaads van ons te zeggen hebbe. 
[2:9]  Vermaan de dienstbaren om onderdanig te zijn aan hun eigen meesters, om in alles welbehagelijk te zijn, niet tegensprekende,
[2:10] niets achterhoudende, maar alle goede trouw bewijzende, opdat zij het onderwijs van God onzen Verlosser in alles mogen versieren. 
[2:11]  Want de genade Gods is verschenen, die voor alle menschen tot behoudenis is,
[2:12] ons opvoedende, opdat wij, de goddeloosheid en de wereldsche lusten verzakende, matig, en rechtvaardig, en godvruchtig zouden leven in de tegenwoordige eeuw,
[2:13] verwachtende de zalige hope en de verschijning der glorie van den grooten God en onzen Verlosser Jezus Christus,
[2:14] die zich zelven gegeven heeft voor ons opdat Hij ons zou vrijkoopen van alle onrechtvaardigheid en zich zelven een volk des eigendoms zou reinigen, dat ijverig is in goede werken.
[2:15] Deze dingen moet gij spreken en vermanen en bestraffen met alle gezag. Niemand mag u verachten.  
[3:1] Vermaan hen om onderdanig te zijn aan overheden en machten, om gehoorzaam te zijn, om tot alle goed werk bereid te zijn,
[3:2] om niemand te lasteren, om niet twistgierig te zijn, bescheiden te zijn, om alle zachtmoedigheid te betoonen jegens alle menschen. 
[3:3]  Want ook wij waren eertijds onverstandig, ongehoorzaam, afdwalende, aan velerlei begeerlijkheden en wellusten dienstbaar, in slechtheid en afgunst levende, hatelijk, malkander hatende.
[3:4] Maar als de goedertierenheid en de menschlievendheid openbaar geworden is van God, onzen Behouder,
[3:5] niet uit werken der rechtvaardigheid die wij zouden gedaan hebben, maar naar zijn eigen barmhartigheid, heeft Hij ons behouden door het bad der wedergeboorte en der vernieuwing des Heiligen Geestes,
[3:6] dien Hij rijkelijk over ons heeft uitgestort, door Jezus Christus, onzen Behouder,
[3:7] opdat wij, gerechtvaardigd zijnde door zijn genade, erfgenamen zouden worden, naar de hope des eeuwigen levens. 
[3:8]  Waarachtig is het woord, en wat deze dingen aangaat, ik wil dat gij ze ernstig bevestigt, opdat degenen die in God geloofd hebben zorg mogen dragen om goede werken voor te staan. Deze dingen zijn het die goed en voordeelig zijn voor de menschen;
[3:9] doch dwaze vragen, en geslachtrekeningen, en twist, en strijd over de wet moet gij tegenstaan, want die zijn nadeelig en ledig.
[3:10] Een mensch die scheuring aanricht moet gij, na een eerste en tweede vermaning verwerpen,
[3:11] wetende dat de zoodanige verkeerd is en dat hij zondigt, zijnde door zich zelven veroordeeld. 
[3:12]  Als ik Artemas of Tychikus tot u zal zenden, spoed u dan om tot mij te komen naar Nikopolis, want aldaar heb ik besloten om den winter over te blijven.
[3:13] Begeleid Zenas den wetgeleerde en Apollos zorgvuldig, opdat hun niets ontbreke.
[3:14] En ook de onzen moeten leeren goede werken voor te staan, waar de nood het vereischt, opdat zij niet onvruchtbaar mogen zijn. 
[3:15]  Allen die met mij zijn groeten u. Groet degenen, die ons beminnen in het geloof. De genade met ulieden allen! Amen.   

### Philemon

[1:1] Paulus, een gevangene van Jezus Oliristus en Timotheüs de broeder: aan Filemon, onzen beminde en medearbeider,
[1:2] en aan Appia, de zuster, en aan Arcliippus, onzen medestrijder, en aan de gemeente die in uw huis vergadert:
[1:3] genade zij ulieden en vrede, van God onzen Vader en van den Heere Jezus Christus. 
[1:4]  Ik dank mijn God, altijd uwer gedachtig zijnde in mijn gebeden,
[1:5] alzoo ik hoor van uw liefde en geloof, die gij hebt jegens den Heere Jezus en jegens al de heiligen,
[1:6] zoodat de gemeenschap van uw geloof krachtig wordt, in de erkentenis van al het goede dat in u is, tot Christus!
[1:7] Want ik heb veel vreugde en vertroosting wegens uw liefde, omdat de harten der heiligen door u verkwikt zijn, broeder! 
[1:8]  Daarom, hoewel ik in Christus vrijmoedigheid heb om u te gebieden hetgeen betamelijk is,
[1:9] zoo verzoek ik u liever in liefde— ik die Paulus ben, een oud man en nu ook een gevangene van Jezus Christus,
[1:10] ik verzoek u dan voor mijn zoon, dien ik in de boeien gewonnen heb, Onesimus,
[1:11] die u vroeger onnuttig was, maar die nu nuttig is voor u en mij; dien ik aan u teruggezonden heb,
[1:12] hem, dat is mijn eigen hart;
[1:13] dien ik wel had willen bij mij houden, opdat hij mij in uw plaats zou dienen in de boeien des Evangelies.
[1:14] Doch zonder uw goedvinden heb ik niets willen doen, opdat uw goedwilligheid niet zou zijn als uit noodzaak, maar naar vrijwilligheid.
[1:15] Misschien toch is hij daarom voor een tijd van u gescheiden geweest, opdat gij hem voor eeuwig zoudt wederbekomen;
[1:16] niet langer als een slaaf, maar meer dan een slaaf, als een beminden broeder, vooral voor mij, maar hoeveel te meer dan voor u, zoowel in het vleesch als in den Heere!
[1:17] Als gij mij dan houdt voor een bijzonderen vriend neem hem dan aan als mij.
[1:18] En als hij u eenig nadeel heeft gedaan, of u schuldig is, reken dit aan mij toe.
[1:19] Ik, Paulus, heb dit geschreven met mijn hand; ik zal betalen; om er u niet bij te zeggen dat gij ook u zelven aan mij schuldig zijt.
[1:20] Ja, broeder! ik mag dit genoegen van u hebben in den Heere; verkwik mijn hart in den Heere!
[1:21] Overtuigd van uw gehoorzaamheid schrijf ik u, wetende dat gij doen zult meer dan ik zeg. 
[1:22]  Daarenboven, bereid mij ook een herberg, want ik hoop dat ik door uw gebeden ulieden zal geschonken worden. 
[1:23]  U groet Epafras, mijn medestrijder in Christus Jezus,
[1:24] Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, mijn medearbeiders.
[1:25] De genade van den Heere Jezus Christus zij met uw geest! Amen.   

### Hebrews

[1:1] Nadat God oudtijds veelmaal en op velerlei manieren gesproken had tot de vaderen in de profeten, heeft Hij op het laatst dezer dagen tot ons gesproken in den Zoon,
[1:2] dien Hij heeft gesteld tot erfgenaam van alle dingen, door wien Hij ook de eeuwen gemaakt heeft;
[1:3] die— de glans van Gods glorie zijnde en de uitdrukking van zijn wezen, en alle dingen dragende door het woord zijner kracht, nadat Hij de reiniging der zonden had aangebracht— gezeten is aan de rechterhand der Majesteit in het allerhoogste;
[1:4] zooveel voortreffelijker geworden zijnde dan de engelen, als Hij een uitnemender Naam boven hen heeft geërfd. 
[1:5]  Want tot wien van de engelen heeft God ooit gezegd: gij zijt mijn Zoon; Ik heb u lieden gewonnen? — en wederom: Ik zal Hem zijn tot een Vader en Hij zal Mij zijn tot een Zoon?
[1:6] En als Hij wederom den Eerstgeborene inbrengt tot de bewoonde aarde, zegt Hij: alle engelen Gods moeten voor Hem nederbuigen!
[1:7] En van de engelen zegt Hij wel: die zijn engelen maakt geesten en zijn dienaren tot vuurvlammen;
[1:8] maar tot den Zoon zegt Hij: uw troon, o God, is tot in alle eeuwigheid, en de staf der rechtvaardigheid is de staf van uw koninkrijk;
[1:9] Gij hebt rechtvaardigheid bemind en onrechtvaardigheid gehaat; daarom, o God, heeft uw God U gezalfd met olie der vreugde boven uw medegenooten.
[1:10] En Gij o Heere! hebt in den beginne de aarde gegrondvest en de werken uwer handen zijn de hemelen;
[1:11] die zullen voorbijgaan, maar Gij blijft bestaan; en allen zullen zij verslijten als een kleed, en als een mantel zult Gij ze oprollen en zij zullen veranderen;
[1:12] maar Gij zijt dezelfde en uw jaren zullen niet ophouden!
[1:13] Tot wien van de engelen heeft God ooit gezegd: Zit aan mijn rechterhand totdat Ik uw vijanden maak tot uw voetbank?
[1:14] Zijn zij niet allen dienstdoende geesten, uitgezonden ten dienste van degenen die de verlossing zullen beërven?  
[2:1] Daarom moeten wij te meer ons vastklemmen aan de dingen die wij gehoord hebben, opdat wij niet daarvan afgevoerd worden.
[2:2] Want als het woord, dat door engelen gesproken is, waarachtig is, en als alle overtreding en ongehoorzaamheid een rechtvaardige vergelding heeft ontvangen,
[2:3] hoe zullen wij dan ontkomen, als wij een zóó groote verlossing verwaarloozen? Want deze, eerst door den Heere verkondigd zijnde, is ons bevestigd door degenen die gehoord hebben,
[2:4] terwijl God mede getuigenis gaf door teekenen en mirakelen en allerlei krachten en uitdeelingen des Heiligen Geestes, naar zijn wil. 
[2:5]  Want niet aan de engelen heeft God onderworpen de toekomende bewoonde aarde waarvan wij spreken.
[2:6] Maar iemand heeft ergens getuigd, zeggende: Wat is een mensch dat Gij aan hem gedenkt, of een menschenkind dat Gij op hem nederziet?
[2:7] Gij hebt hem voor een korten tijd iets minder doen worden dan engelen; met glorie en eere hebt Gij hem gekroond en Gij hebt hem gesteld over de werken uwer handen; alle dingen hebt Gij onderworpen aan zijn voeten.
[2:8] Want door alles aan hem te onderwerpen heeft God niets uitgesloten dat hem niet onderworpen zou zijn. — Doch nu zien wij nog niet dat alles aan hem onderworpen is,
[2:9] maar Hem zien wij, die voor een korten tijd iets minder is geworden dan de engelen, namelijk Jezus, om het lijden des doods met glorie en eere gekroond, opdat Hij door de genade Gods voor allen den dood zou smaken. 
[2:10]  Want het betaamde dat Hij, om wien en door wien alle dingen bestaan, en die vele zonen gebracht had tot de glorie, den Vorst hunner verlossing zou volmaken door smarten.
[2:11] Want zoowel Hij die heiligt als zij die geheiligd worden zijn allen uit Eén. Daarom schaamt Hij zich niet hen broeders te noemen,
[2:12] zeggende: Ik zal uw Naam aan mijn broeders verkondigen; in het midden der vergadering zal Ik U lofzingen.
[2:13] En wederom: Ik zal mijn vertrouwen op Hem stellen. En wederom: ziedaar Ik en de kinderen die God Mij gegeven heeft.
[2:14] Dewijl dan de kinderen vleesch en bloed deelachtig zijn, is Hij ook zelf op dezelfde manier die deelachtig geworden, opdat Hij door den dood zou krachteloos maken dengene die de heerschappij over den dood heeft, dat is, den duivel,
[2:15] en opdat Hij zou verlossen zoovelen als er door de vreeze des doods het gansche leven onderworpen waren aan de dienstbaarheid.
[2:16] Want waarlijk, niet engelen komt Hij te hulp, maar Abrahams nakomelingschap komt Hij te hulp.
[2:17] Daarom moest Hij in alles gelijk worden aan de broederen, opdat Hij zou zijn een barmhartig en getrouw Hoogepriester in de dingen Gods, om de zonden des volks te verzoenen.
[2:18] In datgene toch, wat Hij zelf in bekoring zijnde geleden heeft, kan Hij hulp verleenen aan degenen die in bekoring zijn.  
[3:1] Daarom, heilige broeders! die deel hebt aan de hemelsche roeping, let op den Apostel en Hoogepriester onzer belijdenis, Jezus,
[3:2] die getrouw is aan dengene die Hem heeft aangesteld, zooals ook Mozes getrouw was in geheel Gods huis.
[3:3] Want deze is meer glorie waardig geacht dan Mozes, zooveel als hij die het huis bouwt meerder eere heeft dan het huis.
[3:4] Elk huis toch wordt gebouwd door iemand, maar die alles gebouwd heeft is God.
[3:5] En Mozes was wel getrouw in geheel zijn huis als een bedienaar, om getuigenis te geven van de dingen die zouden aangekondigd worden,
[3:6] maar Christus als een Zoon over Godshuis, wiens huis wij zijn, als wij maar de vrijmoedigheid en den roem der hope vasthouden tot het laatste. 
[3:7]  Daarom, zooals de Heilige Geest zegt: Heden, als gij zijn stem zult hooren,
[3:8] verhardt uw harten niet, zooals in den opstand, ten dage der bekoring in de woestijn,
[3:9] waar uw vaderen Mij in bekoring brachten en op de proef stelden, en veertig jaar lang mijn werken zagen.
[3:10] Daarom had Ik een afkeer van dit geslacht en Ik zeide: altijd dwalen zij in het harte! — Maar zij kenden mijn wegen niet,
[3:11] zoodat Ik in mijn toorn heb gezworen: zij zullen niet ingaan tot mijn ruste!
[3:12] Ziet toe, broeders, dat niet misschien in iemand van ulieden zij een boos harte des ongeloofs in het afwijken van den levenden God;
[3:13] maar vermaant elkander dagelijks, zoolang als men spreken kan van het Heden, opdat niemand uit ulieden verhard worde door de verleiding der zonde.
[3:14] Want wij zijn deelgenooten van Christus geworden, indien wij althans het begin van het vertrouwen tot het laatste toe vasthouden, terwijl er gezegd wordt:
[3:15] Heden, als gij zijn stem zult hooren, verhardt uw harten niet zooals in den opstand.
[3:16] Want wie van degenen die gehoord hadden zijn tot opstand gekomen? Immers allen die door Mozes uit Egypte gegaan zijn?
[3:17] En van wie had Hij veertig jaar lang een afkeer? Is het niet van degenen die gezondigd hadden, wier lijken zijn gevallen in de woestijn?
[3:18] En over wie heeft Hij gezworen dat zij niet zouden ingaan tot zijn ruste? Immers over degenen die ongehoorzaam geweest waren?
[3:19] Wij zien dus dat zij niet hebben kunnen ingaan door ongeloof.  
[4:1] Laat ons dan vreezen dat, terwijl er nog een belofte is overgebleven van tot zijn ruste in te gaan, niet iemand uit ulieden blijke te laat gekomen te zijn.
[4:2] Want ook aan ons is de goede boodschap geschied zoowel als aan hen; maar het gehoorde woord deed hun geen nut, omdat het niet vergezeld was met het geloof bij degenen die het hoorden.
[4:3] Want wij die geloofd hebben gaan in tot de ruste, zooals Hij gezegd heeft: gelijk Ik heb gezworen in mijn toorn: zij zullen niet ingaan tot mijn ruste! — ofschoon de werken al volbracht waren van de grondlegging der wereld.
[4:4] Want van den zevenden dag heeft Hij ergens alzoo gesproken: en God heeft op den zevenden dag gerust van al zijn werken.
[4:5] En in deze plaats wederom: zij zullen niet ingaan tot mijn ruste!
[4:6] Dewijl het dan nog aan sommigen overblijft om in die ruste in te gaan en de eersten, aan wie de goede boodschap geschied is, niet konden ingaan door ongehoorzaamheid,
[4:7] zoo bepaalt Hij wederom zekeren dag, namelijk Heden, als Hij na zoo langen tijd door David zegt, zooals het vooraf gezegd is: Heden, als gij zijn stem zult hooren, verhardt uw harten niet
[4:8] Want als Jozua hun ruste gegeven had dan zou Hij later niet hebben gesproken over een anderen dag.
[4:9] Er blijft dus een sabbatsruste voor Gods volk over.
[4:10] Want die is ingegaan tot zijn ruste heeft ook zelf gerust van zijn werken, zooals God van de zijnen.
[4:11] Laten wij ons dan benaarstigen om in te gaan tot die ruste, opdat niet iemand valle in hetzelfde voorbeeld der ongehoorzaamheid.
[4:12] Want Gods woord is levend, en werkzaam, en scherper dan alle tweesnijdend zwaard, en doorgaande tot verdeeling der ziel en des geestes, der verbindingen en des mergs, en is een beoordeelaar der gedachten en der overleggingen des harten.
[4:13] En geen schepsel is verborgen voor Hem, maar alles is naakt en opengelegd voor de oogen van Hem aan wien wij rekenschap zullen geven. 
[4:14]  Hebbende dan een grooten Hoogepriester, die door de hemelen is doorgegaan, Jezus den Zone Gods, laat ons de belijdenis bewaren.
[4:15] Want wij hebben niet een hoogepriester die geen medegevoel kan hebben met onze zwakheden, maar een die in alle dingen eveneens in bekoring geweest is, doch zonder zonde.
[4:16] Laat ons dan naderen met vrijmoedigheid tot den troon der genade, opdat wij barmhartigheid mogen verkrijgen en genade vinden, tot tijdige hulpe.  
[5:1] Want alle hoogepriester uit menschen genomen is gesteld voor menschen in de dingen Gods, opdat hij giften en offers opdrage voor de zonden.
[5:2] Deze kan medelijden hebben met de onkundigen en dolenden, omdat hij ook zelf zwakheid omdraagt,
[5:3] En om die zwakheid moet hij, gelijk voor het volk, alzoo ook voor zich zelven offeren voor de zonden.
[5:4] En niemand neemt die eere voor zich zei ven, maar als hij geroepen is door God, zooals ook Aaron.
[5:5] Zoo ook heeft de Christus zich zelven niet de glorie gegeven om Hoogepriester te worden, maar Hij die tot Hem gezegd heeft: Gij zijt mijn Zoon; Ik heb 17 heden gewonnen.
[5:6] Zooals Hij ook op een andere plaats zegt: Gij zijt een eeuwig priester naar de orde van Melchizedek. 
[5:7]  Deze heeft in de dagen zijns vleesches gebeden en smeekingen geofferd aan Hem die bij machte was Hem te verlossen uit den dood, met sterk geroep en met tranen; en verhoord zijnde wegens zijn godvruchtigheid,
[5:8] heeft Hij, ofschoon Hij Zoon was, de gehoorzaamheid geleerd door hetgeen Hij heeft geleden;
[5:9] en volmaakt zijnde is Hij voor allen die Hem gehoorzamen de bron eener eeuwige behoudenis geworden,
[5:10] door God verklaard zijnde tot Hoogepriester, naar de orde van Melchizedek. 
[5:11]  Van dit nu hebben wij veel te zeggen en dingen die zwaar zijn om te verklaren, omdat gij traag in liet hooren zijt geworden.
[5:12] Want wat den tijd betreft moest gij wel leeraars zijn; toch hebt gij wederom noodig dat men u onderwijze, welke de eerste beginselen zijn der godspraken; en gij zijt geworden die melk noodig hebt en niet vaste spijze.
[5:13] Want ieder die aan de melk is, die is onbedreven in het woord der rechtvaardigheid, want hij is een kind.
[5:14] Maar voor volwassenen is de vaste spijze, die door het gebruik de zinnen geoefend hebben, tot onderscheiding van goeden kwaad.  
[6:1] Laat ons dan nalaten te spreken van het beginsel der leer van Christus en laat ons voortgaan tot het volwassene, niet wederom een fundament leggende van de afkeering van doode werken, en van het vertrouwen op God,
[6:2] van de leer der reinigingen, en van handenoplegging en van verrijzenis der dooden, en van een eeuwig oordeel.
[6:3] En ook dit zullen wij doen als God het toelaat.
[6:4] Want onmogelijk is het dat zij, die eenmaal zijn verlicht geweest en de hemelsche gave gesmaakt hebben, en deelgenooten des Heiligen Geestes geworden zijn,
[6:5] en die het goede woord Gods gesmaakt hebben, en de krachten der toekomende eeuw,
[6:6] en afvallig worden— dat die wederom vernieuwd worden tot boetvaardigheid, omdat zij voor zich zelven den Zone Gods andermaal kruisigen en Hem openlijk schandvlekken.
[6:7] Want de aarde, die den regen indrinkt die dikwijls op haar komt, en geschikte planten voortbrengt voor degenen voor wie zij bebouwd is, die ontvangt zegen van God.
[6:8] Maar als zij distelen en doornen voortbrengt dan is zij verwerpelijk en nabij den vloek; haar einde is tot verbranding. 
[6:9]  Maar wij zijn van ulieden, beminden, betere dingen wachtende en die tot verlossing leiden, ofschoon wij alzoo spreken.
[6:10] Want God is niet onrechtvaardig om uw arbeid te vergeten en de liefde die gij getoond hebt jegens zijn Naam, daar gij de heiligen gediend hebt en nog dient.
[6:11] En wij wenschen dat ieder van u dezelfde naarstigheid betoont tot de volkomenheid der hope tot het einde,
[6:12] opdat gij niet traag wordt, maar navolgers dergenen die door geloof en lankmoedigheid de beloften beërven.
[6:13] Want toen God aan Abraham de belofte gaf en Hij bij niemand die meerder was zweren kon, heeft Hij gezworen bij zich zelven, zeggende:
[6:14] Waarlijk, zegenende zal Ik u zegenen en vermenigvuldigende zal Ik u vermenigvuldigen.
[6:15] En alzoo heeft Abraham geduldig gewacht en de belofte verkregen.
[6:16] Want menschen zweren bij den meerdere, en bij alle tegenspraak onder hen is de eed een einde tot bevestiging.
[6:17] Daarom is God, die overvloediger aan de erfgenamen der belofte wilde toonen de onveranderlijkheid zijns raads, met een eed daartusschen gekomen,
[6:18] opdat wij door twee onveranderlijke dingen waarin het onmogelijk is dat God zou liegen, een krachtige bemoediging zouden hebben, wij die ontvloden zijn om de voorgestelde hope vast te houden,
[6:19] die wij als een anker der ziele hebben, zeker en vast, en ingaande tot in het, binnenste des voorhangsels
[6:20] waar Jezus als voorlooper voor ons is ingegaan, die naar de orde van Melchizedek een Hoogepriester geworden is tot in eeuwigheid.  
[7:1] Want deze Melchizedek, koning van Salem, priester van God den Allerhoogste, — die Abraham tegemoet ging toen deze wederkeerde van het slaan der koningen en hem zegende,
[7:2] aan wien Abraham ook een tiende gaf van alles; die eerst is koning der rechtvaardigheid door de beteekenis van zijn naam, en daarna koning van Salem, dat is, koning des vredes;
[7:3] zonder vader, zonder moeder, zonder geslachtrekening, geen begin van dagen of einde van leven hebbende, maar gelijk geworden aan den Zone Gods, — deze Melchizedek blijft een priester bij voortduring.
[7:4] Merkt dan op hoe groot deze is, aan wien Abraham de aartsvader ook een tiende uit den buit heeft gegeven.
[7:5] Zij nu die uit de zonen van Levi het priesterschap ontvangen, hebben een gebod om naar de wet tienden te nemen van het volk, dat is van hun broeders, ofschoon zij uit de lenden van Abraham zijn voortgekomen;
[7:6] maar deze Melchizedek, die de geslachtrekening niet uit hen heeft, heeft van Abraham tienden genomen, en hij heeft gezegend dengene die de beloften had.
[7:7] Toch is het zonder tegenspreken dat het mindere gezegend wordt door het meerdere.
[7:8] En hier nemen wel sterfelijke. menschen tienden, doch daar doet hij het van wien getuigd wordt dat hij levende is.
[7:9] En, om zoo te spreken, door Abraham heeft Levi, die tienden neemt, ook tienden gegeven;
[7:10] want hij was nog in de lenden des vaders toen Melchizedek hem te gemoet ging. 
[7:11]  Als er dan nu volkomenheid was door het levitische priesterdom— want met het oog op dit priesterschap heeft het volk de wet ontvangen— wat was het dan nog noodig dat er een ander priester zou opstaan naar de ordening van Melchizedek, en die niet naar de ordening van Aaron zou gerekend worden?
[7:12] Want bij verandering van het priesterschap moet noodzakelijk de wet anders worden.
[7:13] Want Hij, op wien deze dingen gezegd worden, behoort tot een anderen stam, waarvan niemand tot den altaar getreden is. 
[7:14]  Want het is duidelijk dat onze Heer uit den stam van Juda is voortgekomen, een stam waarvan Mozes niets gesproken heeft met het oog op het priesterschap.
[7:15] En dat is nog veel duidelijker, als er naar de gelijkheid van Melchizedek een ander priester opstaat,
[7:16] die dit is geworden, niet naar de wet van een vleeschelijk gebod, maar n aar de kracht van een onvergankelijk leven.
[7:17] Want er wordt gezegd: Gij zijt priester tot in eeuwigheid naar de ordening van Melchizedek.
[7:18] De vernietiging toch van een voorafgaand gebod geschiedt uit oorzake van zijn zwakheid en onprofijtelijkheid,
[7:19] — want de wet heeft niets volkomen gemaakt— en die vernietiging is dus de invoering van een betere hope, waardoor wij naderen tot God.
[7:20] En voor zooveel het niet is zonder eedzwering— want de Levieten zijn wel zonder eedzwering priesters geworden,
[7:21] maar Jezus met eedzwering door dengene die tot Hem gezegd heeft: de Heere heeft gezworen, en zal geen berouw hebben: Gij zijt priester tot in eeuwigheid
[7:22] van een des te beter verbond is Jezus borg geworden. 
[7:23]  En die anderen zijn wel in grooten getale priesters geworden, omdat zij door den dood verhinderd worden om te blijven;
[7:24] maar deze, omdat Hij blijft tot in eeuwigheid, heeft een onvergankelijk priesterschap.
[7:25] Daarom ook kan Hij tot het uiterste toe verlossen degenen die door Hem tot God gaan, daar Hij altijd leeft om voor hen in te treden.
[7:26] Want ook zoodanigen Hoogepriester hadden wij noodig, heilig, onnoozel, onbevlekt, afgezonderd van de zondaren en hooger dan de hemelen,
[7:27] die niet noodig had dagelijks, zooals de hoogepriesters des ouden verbonds, om eerst offeranden op te dragen voor zijn eigen zonden, en daarna voor die des volks; want dat heeft Hij eens voor al gedaan, als Hij zich zelven opofferde.
[7:28] Want de wet stelt aan tot hoogepriesters menschen die zwakheden hebben, maar het woord der eedzwering, dat na de wet kwam, stelt den Zoon aan, die tot in eeuwigheid volkomen geworden is.  
[8:1] De hoofdzaak nu van de dingen die wij bespreken is, dat wij zulken Hoogepriester hebben, die is gezeten aan de rechterhand des troons der majesteit in de hemelen,
[8:2] een bedienaar der heilige dingen en des waarachtigen tabernakels, dien de Heere heeft opgericht, niet een mensch.
[8:3] Want alle hoogepriester wordt aangesteld om giften en offeranden op te dragen, waarom er noodzaak is dat ook deze Hoogepriester wat had dat Hij opdragen zou. 
[8:4]  Maar als Hij op aarde was zou Hij in het geheel geen priester zijn, omdat er dezulken zijn die giften offeren volgens de wet,
[8:5] die bedienaren zijn van hetgeen een afdruksel en schaduwe is der hemelsche dingen, zooals Mozes door God was vermaand toen hij den tabernakel zou volmaken: Zie toch toe— zeide God— dat gij alles maakt naar de type die u getoond is op den berg.
[8:6] Maar nu heeft Christus een zooveel uitnemender bediening verkregen, als Hij ook van een beter verbond Middelaar is, dat op betere beloften is gegrond.
[8:7] Want als dat eerste zonder gebreken was geweest dan zou er voor een tweede geen plaats gezocht zijn. 
[8:8]  Want hen bestraffende zegt Hij: Ziet er komen dagen— zegt de Heere— dat Ik over het huis van Israël en over het huis van Juda een nieuw verbond zal volmaken;
[8:9] niet naar het verbond dat Ik gemaakt heb met hun vaderen in den dag als Ik hen bij de hand nam om hen uit te leiden uit het land van Egypte; want zij zijn niet gebleven in dit mijn verbond, en ook Ik heb op hen niet geacht, zegt de Heere;
[8:10] want dit is het verbond dat Ik stellen zal met het huis van Israël na die dagen, zegt de Heere: Ik zal mijn wetten geven in hun gemoed, en op hun harten zal Ik die schrijven, en Ik zal hun zijn tot een God en zij zullen Mij zijn tot een volk;
[8:11] en niet ieder zal zijn naaste leeren, noch ieder zijn broeder, zeggende: Ken den Heere! want allen zullen Mij kennen van den kleinste tot den grootste van hen;
[8:12] want Ik zal genadig zijn met betrekking tot hun onrechtvaardigheden, en aan hun zonden zal Ik niet meer gedenken.
[8:13] Als Hij spreekt van een nieuw verbond, dan heeft Hij het eerste voor oud verklaard. En dat wat oud is en verouderd staat op het punt van te verdwijnen.  
[9:1] Toch had ook het eerste verbond ordeningen tot den goddelijken dienst en het wereldlijke heiligdom.
[9:2] Want er was een tabernakel toebereid, de eerste, waarin was de kandelaar, en de tafel, en de toonbrooden, die het Heilige genoemd wordt.
[9:3] En achter het tweede voorhangsel was de tabernakel, die genoemd wordt liet Heilige der Heiligen,
[9:4] die een gouden wierookvat had en de Arke des Verbonds, rondom met goud overdekt, waarin was een gouden kruik met Manna, en de staf van Aäron die gebloeid had, en de tafelen des verbonds.
[9:5] En daarboven over heen waren Cherubim der glorie die het verzoendeksel beschaduwden. Doch wij kunnen over deze dingen nu niet afzonderlijk spreken.
[9:6] Deze dingen dan alzoo toebereid zijnde, gingen de priesters wel gedurig den eersten tabernakel binnen om de bediening te vervullen;
[9:7] maar tot den tweeden ging alleen de hoogepriester, eenmaal des jaars, niet zonder bloed dat hij offerde voor zich zelven en des volks afdwalingen.
[9:8] De Heilige Geest gaf dit te kennen dat de weg tot de heilige dingen nog niet openbaar was gemaakt, terwijl de eerste tabernakel nog stond,
[9:9] die een gelijkenis is met het oog op den tegenwoordigen tijd, volgens welke giften en offeranden worden opgedragen die niet naar de konsciëntie kunnen volmaken degenen die bedienen,
[9:10] daar zij alleen, — bestaande in spijzen en dranken en verschillende zuiveringen— vleeschelijke instellingen zijn, ingesteld tot op een tijd van hervorming. 
[9:11]  Christus nu, als Hoogepriester der toekomende goederen gekomen zijnde, is eenmaal ingegaan tot het heiligdom door den meerderen en volmaakteren tabernakel die niet met handen is gemaakt, dat is niet van deze schepping,
[9:12] noch door het bloed van bokken en kalveren, maar door zijn eigen bloed, een eeuwige verlossing verworven hebbende.
[9:13] Want als het bloed van bokken en stieren, en de asch van een jonge koe, op de onreinen gesprenkeld, heiligt tot reiniging des vleesches,
[9:14] hoeveel te meer zal dan het bloed van Christus die door den eeuwigen Geest zich zelven onbevlekt aan God heeft opgeofferd, uw konsciëntie reinigen van doode werken, om den levenden God te dienen?
[9:15] En daarom is Hij Middelaar van een nieuw verbond opdat, nu er een dood is bij gekomen tot verlossing der overtredingen die onder het eerste verbond waren, de geroepenen de belofte der eeuwige–erfenis zouden ontvangen. 
[9:16]  Want waar een testament is moet noodzakelijk de dood van den testamentmaker er bij komen.
[9:17] Want een testament is vast in dooden, maar het heeft nog geen kracht als de testamentmaker leeft.
[9:18] Daarom is ook het eerste verbond, niet ingewijd zonder bloed.
[9:19] Want als ieder gebod door Mozes naar de wet was gesproken tot het gansche volk, nam hij het bloed der kalveren en der bokken, met water en purperen wol en hysop, en besprenkelde hij het boek zelf en al het volk,
[9:20] zeggende: Dit is het bloed des verbonds dat God voor ulieden geboden heeft.
[9:21] En den tabernakel, en al het vaatwerk van den dienst besprenkelde hij eveneens met het bloed.
[9:22] En bijna alles wordt naar de wet in bloed gereinigd, en zonder bloedstorting geschiedt geen vergiffenis.
[9:23] Het was dus noodzakelijk dat de afdruksels der dingen die in de. hemelen zijn door deze gereinigd zouden worden, maar de hemelsche dingen zelven door betere offeranden dan deze. 
[9:24]  Want Christus is niet ingegaan tot een heiligdom dat met handen is gemaakt, als een tegenbeeld van het waarachtige, maar tot den hemel zelven, om nu te verschijnen voor Gods aangezicht ten onzen behoeve;
[9:25] en ook niet om dikwijls zich zelven op te offeren, zooals de hoogepriester jaarlijks inging tot het heiligdom met bloed dat het zijne niet was;
[9:26] — anders had Hij dikwijls moeten lijden van de grondlegging der wereld af— maar nu is Hij eenmaal, bij het einde der eeuwen, geopenbaard tot het wegdoen der zonde door zijn eigen offerande. 
[9:27]  En zooals het den menschen opgelegd is eenmaal te sterven, en er daarna een oordeel is,
[9:28] alzoo ook zal de Christus, die eenmaal geofferd is om de zonden van velen te dragen, ten tweedemale zonder zonde verschijnen aan degenen die Hem verwachten tot verlossing.  
[10:1] Want de wet— die een schaduwe heeft van de toekomende goederen, niet het beeld zelf van de dingen— kan nooit, door dezelfde jaarlijksche offeranden die men voortdurend opdraagt, degenen volmaken die ze brengen.
[10:2] Want zouden zij anders toch niet opgehouden hebben geofferd te worden, om dat de bedienaren, eenmaal gereinigd zijnde, geen konsciëntie van zonden meer zouden gehad hebben?
[10:3] Maar in deze offeranden is er elk jaar weer gedachtenis aan de zonden.
[10:4] Onmogelijk toch is het dat bloed van stieren en bokken zonden wegneemt! 
[10:5]  Daarom, als Hij tot de wereld komt zegt Hij: offeranden en slachtoffers hebt Gij niet gewild, maar voor Mij hebt Gij een lichaam toebereid;
[10:6] ook brandoffers en zondoffers zijn U niet welgevallig geweest.
[10:7] Toen zeide Ik: Zie, Ik kom— aan het hoofd des boeks is van Mij geschreven— om uw wil te doen, o God!
[10:8] Nadat Hij eerst zeide: offeranden en slachtoffers en brandoffers en ook zondoffers hebt Gij niet gewild, noch zijn U welgevallig geweest— die volgens de wet opgedragen zijn—
[10:9] dan sprak Hij: zie, Ik kom om uw wil te doen, o God! — Het eerste neemt Hij weg om het tweede vast te stellen.
[10:10] In welken wil wij geheiligd zijn door de offerande des lichaams van Jezus Christus, eens voor al.
[10:11] En iedere priester stond wel dagelijks te bedienen en dezelfde offeranden dikwijls op te offeren, die toch nooit zonden kunnen wegnemen;
[10:12] maar deze, die één offerande voor de zonden opgedragen heeft voor altijd, is gaan zitten aan de rechterhand Gods,
[10:13] van dan af wachtende totdat zijn vijanden zullen gemaakt zijn tot een voetbank zijner voeten.
[10:14] Want door één offerande heeft Hij volmaakt voor altijd degenen die worden geheiligd. 
[10:15]  Doch ook de Heilige Geest getuigt het ons.
[10:16] Want nadat de Heere gezegd heeft: Dit is het verbond dat Ik na die dagen met hen maken zal, zoo spreekt Hij: Ik zal mijn wetten geven in hun harten en op hun gemoed zal ik die schrijven,
[10:17] en aan hun zonden en hun onrechtvaardigheden zal Ik geenszins meer gedenken.
[10:18] Waar nu vergiffenis van deze is daar is geen offerande meer voor de zonde. 
[10:19]  Hebbende dan, broeders, vrijmoedigheid tot den ingang in de heilige plaats door het bloed van Jezus,
[10:20] dien Hij voor ons heeft ingewijd, als een nieuwen en levenden weg, door het voorhangsel heen, dat is door zijn vleesch;
[10:21] en hebbende een grooten Priester over het huis Gods,
[10:22] zoo laat ons naderen met een waarachtig hart in volheid des geloofs, de harten gereinigd zijnde van een kwade konsciëntie, en het lichaam gewasschen zijnde met zuiver water. 
[10:23]  Laat ons vasthouden de belijdenis der onwankelbare hope; want getrouw is Hij die toegezegd heeft.
[10:24] En laat ons op elkander letten tot opscherping van liefde en goede werken;
[10:25] niet verzuimende onze gemeenschappelijke vergadering, zooals het de gewoonte is van sommigen, maar elkander vermanende, en dat des te meer als gij den dag ziet naderen. 
[10:26]  Want als wij opzettelijk zondigen, nadat wij de kennis der waarheid ontvangen hebben, dan blijft er voor de zonden geen offerande meer,
[10:27] maar een zekere schrikkelijke verwachting des oordeels en hitte des vuurs dat de tegenstanders zal verslinden.
[10:28] Als iemand de wet van Mozes geschonden had dan stierf hij zonder barmhartigheid op het woord, van twee of drie getuigen;
[10:29] hoeveel meerder straf, meent gij, zal hij waardig geacht worden, die den Zoon van God zal hebben vertreden en het bloed des verbonds, waarin hij geheiligd was, een gewone zaak zal geacht hebben, en den Geest der genade zal gesmaad hebben?
[10:30] Want wij kennen Hem die gezegd heeft: Mijne is de wrake; Ik zal vergelden. En wederom; De Heere zal zijn volk oordeelen!
[10:31] Schrikkelijk is het te vallen in de handen des levenden Gods! 
[10:32]  Doch denkt aan de vroegere dagen, waarin gij, verlicht zijnde, een zwaren strijd van smarten hebt doorgestaan,
[10:33] eensdeels ten toon gesteld door smaadheden en verdrukkingen, anderdeels deelgenooten geworden zijnde van hen die alzoo behandeld werden.
[10:34] Want ook hebt gij medelijden gehad met de gebondenen, en den roof uwer bezittingen hebt gij met vreugde aangenomen, wetende dat gij voor u zelven hebt een betere en blijvende bezitting.
[10:35] Werpt dan uw vrijmoedigheid niet weg, die een groote belooning heeft.
[10:36] Want gij hebt volharding noodig, opdat gij, den wil van God doende, de belofte moogt ontvangen.
[10:37] Want nog weinig, zeer weinig tijd; Hij die komende is zal komen en niet vertragen.
[10:38] Doch— mijn rechtvaardige zal leven uit geloof, en als hij zich onttrekt dan heeft mijn ziel in hem geen welbehagen.
[10:39] Maar wij zijn niet van hen die zich onttrekken ten verderve, maar die gelooven tot behoudenis der ziele.  
[11:1] Geloof nu is een vast vertrouwen van hetgeen men hoopt, een bewijs der dingen die niet gezien worden.
[11:2] In dit geloof toch hebben de Ouden getuigenis ontvangen.
[11:3] Door het geloof verstaan wij dat de eeuwen zijn geformeerd door Gods Woord, zoodat hetgeen gezien wordt niet is geworden uit zichtbare dingen. 
[11:4]  Door het geloof heeft Abel een betere offerande aan God opgedragen dan Kaïn, waardoor hij bewezen is rechtvaardig te zijn, daar God getuigenis gaf over zijn giften, en daardoor spreekt hij nog, ofschoon hij gestorven is.
[11:5] Door het geloof is Henoch overgebracht om den dool niet te zien, en hij werd niet gevonden omdat God hem had overgebracht. Want vóór zijn overbrenging had hij getuigenis bekomen dat hij Gode welbehagelijk was.
[11:6] Doch zonder geloof is het onmogelijk om welbehagelijk te zijn. Want die tot God nadert moet gelooven dat Hij bestaat en een belooner is voor degenen die Hem zoekende zijn.
[11:7] Door het geloof heeft Noach die vermaand was aangaande de dingen die nog niet gezien werden, en God vreezende, een ark toebereid tot redding van zijn huisgezin. Door deze heeft hij de wereld veroordeeld en is hij geworden een erfgenaam van de rechtvaardigheid naar het geloof.
[11:8] Door het geloof is Abraham, toen hij geroepen was, gehoorzaam geweest om uit te gaan naar een plaats die hij zou ontvangen tot een erfenis, en hij is uitgegaan, niet wetende waar te komen.
[11:9] Door het geloof verbleef hij in het land der belofte als een land van een ander, in tenten wonende met Isaak en Jakob, de medeerfgenamen derzelfde belofte:
[11:10] want hij verwachtte de stad die de fundamenten heeft, wier stichter en bouwmeester God is.
[11:11] Door het geloof heeft ook Sara zelve kracht bekomen tot het ontvangen van nakomelingschap toen zij al over den tijd was, omdat zij vertrouwen gesteld heeft in Hem die beloofd had.
[11:12] Daarom ook zijn van één, en dat van een die als gestorven was, zoovelen geboren als de sterren des hemels in menigte en als het zand dat bij den oever der zee is, dat ontelbaar is.
[11:13] Naar het geloof zijn deze allen gestorven, de beloftenissen niet bekomen hebbende, maar uit de verte die ziende en begroetende, en belijdende dat zij vreemdelingen en pelgrims waren op de aarde.
[11:14] Want die zulke dingen zeggen toonen dat zij naar een vaderland zoeken.
[11:15] En als zij gedacht hadden aan dat vanwaar zij uitgetrokken waren, dan hadden zij tijd gehad om terug te keer en.
[11:16] Maar nu begeeren zij een beter vaderland, dat is een hemelsch. Daarom schaamt God zich niet om hun God genoemd te worden; want Hij heeft voor hen een stad gereedgemaakt.
[11:17] Door het geloof heeft Abraham, toen hij op de proef gesteld werd, Isaak opgeofferd, en zijn eeniggeborene heeft hij opgeofferd die de belofte had ontvangen,
[11:18] tot wien gezegd was: in Isaak zal uw nakomelingschap genoemd worden;
[11:19] bedenkende dat God machtig was zelfs uit de dooden hem op te wekken, vanwaar hij hem dan ook, om zoo te spreken, heeft teruggekregen.
[11:20] Door het geloof heeft Isaak aangaande toekomende dingen Jakob en Esau gezegend.
[11:21] Door het geloof heeft Jakob stervende ieder der zonen van Jozef gezegend en Hij heeft aangebeden, leunende op den top van zijn staf.
[11:22] Door het geloof heeft Jozef, toen zijn einde naderde, melding gemaakt van den uittocht der zonen Israels en bevel gegeven aangaande zijn gebeente.
[11:23] Door het geloof is Mozes toen hij geboren was drie maanden lang verborgen door zijn ouders, omdat zij zagen dat het kindeken welgevormd was, en zij vreesden het gebod des konings niet.
[11:24] Door het geloof heeft Mozes, toen hij groot geworden was, geweigerd zoon van Farao’s dochter genoemd te worden,
[11:25] daar hij liever verkoos mishandeld te worden met Gods volk dan voor een tijd het genot der zonde te hebben,
[11:26] daar hij den smaad van Christus voor grooter rijkdom hield dan de schatten van Egypte; want hij zag op tot de vergelding des loons.
[11:27] Door het geloof verliet hij Egypte, den toorn des konings niet vreezende, want den onzichtbaren hield hij vast alsof hij Mem zag.
[11:28] Door het geloof stelde hij het Pascha in en de besprenging des bloeds, opdat de verderver der eerstgeborenen hen niet treffen zou.
[11:29] Door het geloof gingen zij door de Roode Zee, als door een droog land, hetwelk de Egyptenaars ook beproefden en zij verdronken.
[11:30] Door het geloof zijn de muren van Jericho gevallen, nadat zij zeven dagen lang waren omringd geweest.
[11:31] Door het geloof is Rahab de hoere niet omgekomen met de ongehoorzamen, omdat zij de verspieders met vrede had ontvangen. 
[11:32]  En wat zal ik nog zeggen? — Want de tijd zal mij ontbreken als ik zou spreken van Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jeftha, David en Samuël en de profeten,
[11:33] die door het geloof koninkrijken onderwierpen, rechtvaardigheid uitoefenden, beloften verkregen, de muilen van leeuwen stopten,
[11:34] de kracht des vuurs bluschten, de scherpte des zwaards ontvloden, uit zwakheid krachtig werden, sterk werden in den oorlog, legers van vreemden op de vlucht joegen;
[11:35] vrouwen hebben haar dooden uit een verrijzenis ontvangen, anderen zijn aan tormenten overgegeven, omdat zij de bevrijding niet aannamen, opdat zij een betere verrijzenis mochten verkrijgen;
[11:36] en anderen ondergingen bespottingen en geeselingen, zelfs nog banden en gevangenis;
[11:37] zij zijn gesteenigd, in stukken gezaagd, gekweld; zij stierven door het zwaard; zij liepen om in schaapsvellen en geitevellen, van alles beroofd, bedroefd, mishandeld zijnde.
[11:38] — De wereld was hen niet waardig. — Zij hebben rondgedoold in woestijnen, en gebergten, en spelonken en holen der aarde. 
[11:39]  En deze allen, ofschoon zij door het geloofgetuigenis hebben bekomen, hebben niet ontvangen wat beloofd was,
[11:40] omdat God omtrent ons wat beters op het oog had, opdat zij niet zouden volkomen zijn zonder ons.  
[12:1] Daarom ook wij, die omringd zijn van een zoo groote wolk van getuigen, laat ons, afleggende allen last en de zoo gemakkelijk omringende zonde, met volharding loopen in de voor ons liggende loopbaan;
[12:2] opziende tot den Aanvoerder en Volmaker des geloofs Jezus, die voor de vreugde Hem voorgesteld het kruis heeft verdragen, schande verachtende, en gezeten is aan de rechterhand des troons van God.
[12:3] Aanschouwt dan Hem die zoodanigen tegenstand van de zondaren tegen zich heeft verdragen, opdat gij niet vermoeid wordt, in uw zielen bezwijkende.
[12:4] Nog niet tot den bloede toe hebt gij tegengestaan, strijdende tegen de zonde.
[12:5] En gij hebt vergeten de vermaning die tot ulieden gezegd wordt als tot zonen: Mijn zoon, acht de kastijding des Heeren niet gering, en bezwijk niet als gij van Hem bestraft wordt
[12:6] want dien Hij bemint kastijdt de Heere, en Hij geeselt eiken zoon dien Hij aanneemt. 
[12:7]  Volhardt onder kastijding; als jegens zonen gedraagt God zich jegens u. Want welke zoon is er die een vader niet kastijdt?
[12:8] Doch als gij zonder kastijding zijt, die allen zijn deelachtig geworden, dan zijt gij bastaards en niet zonen.
[12:9] Voorts, wij hebben wel de vaders van ons vleesch tot kastijders gehad en we hebben hen ontzien; zullen wij dan niet veelmeer oponderwerpen aan den Vader der geesten, en leven?
[12:10] Want de eersten hebben ons voor weinige dagen gekastijd, zooals het hun goed toescheen; maar deze laatste tot ons nut, opdat wij deelgenooten zouden worden van zijn heiligheid.
[12:11] Alle kastijding nu schijnt voor het tegenwoordige niet tot vreugde maar tot droefheid te zijn; maar daarna brengt zij voor degenen die door haar geoefend worden, een vreedzame vrucht der rechtvaardigheid aan. 
[12:12]  Daarom, heft op de trage handen en de wankelende knieën,
[12:13] en maakt rechte paden voor uw voeten, opdat het kreupele niet erger worde, maar het eerder geneze. 
[12:14]  Jaagt na den vrede met allen, en de heiligmaking, zonder welke niemand den Heere zal zien,
[12:15] toeziende dat niet iemand terugvalle van de genade Gods; dat niet een wortel van bitterheid opwassende, beroering make, en door deze velen aangestoken worden. 
[12:16]  Dat niemand zij een hoereerder of onheilige, zooals Esau, die voor één spijze zijn eigen eerstgeboorte weggaf;
[12:17] want gij weet dat ook later, als hij den zegen wilde beërven, hij verworpen werd; want een plaats der boetvaardigheid vond hij niet, ofschoon hij die zocht met tranen. 
[12:18]  Want gij zijt niet genaderd tot een tastbaren berg, en een brandend vuur, en een wolk, en een donkerheid, en een onweder,
[12:19] en een bazuingeklank, en een geluid van woorden, zoodanig dat zij die ze hoorden verzochten dat het woord, tot hen niet meer zou gericht worden;
[12:20] want zij verdroegen niet hetgeen gezegd werd: indien zelfs een dier den berg aanraakt zal het gesteenigd worden.
[12:21] En zoo vreeselijk was de verschijning dat Mozes zeide: ik ben zeer bevreesd en bevende.
[12:22] Maar gij zijt genaderd tot den berg Sion en de stad des levenden Gods, het hemelsch Jerusalem en de duizenden van engelen,
[12:23] tot de algemeene vergadering en de gemeente der eerstgeborenen die in de hemelen zijn opgeschreven, en tot God den Rechter van allen, en de geesten der rechtvaardigen die volmaakt zijn,
[12:24] en tot Jezus, den Middelaar des Nieuwen Verbonds, en tot het bloed der besprenging dat betere dingen spreekt dan dat van Abel. 
[12:25]  Ziet toe, dat gij dengene die spreekt niet verwerpt; want als zij niet ontvloden zijn die verwierpen dengene die op aarde van Godswege vermaande, hoeveel te meer wij niet, als wij ons afkeeren van dengene die van de hemelen is,
[12:26] wiens stem toen de aarde deed schudden. Maar nu heeft Hij beloofd, zeggende: Nog eenmaal zal ik doen schudden niet alleen de aarde maar ook den hemel.
[12:27] Dit woord nu: nog eenmaal, beteekent de verandering der beweegbare dingen, als die gemaakt zijn, opdat blijven zouden de dingen die niet beweegbaar zijn. 
[12:28]  Daarom, nu wij een niet beweegbaar koninkrijk ontvangen, laat ons dankbaarheid bewijzen, waardoor wij op een welbehagelijke wijze God mogen dienen, met godvruchtigheid en vreeze;
[12:29] want onze God is een verteerend vuur.  
[13:1] Dat de broederliefde blijve!
[13:2] Verwaarloost de liefde tot vreemdelingen niet, want door deze hebben sommigen engelen geherbergd zonder het te weten.
[13:3] Zijt gedachtig aan de gevangenen alsof gij mede gevangenen waart, en aan degenen die mishandeld worden als die ook zelf in een lichaam zijt. 
[13:4]  Het huwelijk zij onder allen eerlijk gehouden en het bed zij onbevlekt, want hoereerders en overspelers zal God oordeelen.
[13:5] Uw wandel zij zonder geldzucht, tevreden zijnde met hetgeen gij hebt; want God heeft zelf gezegd: Ik zal u geenszins begeven en zal u geenszins verlaten.
[13:6] Zoodat wij met goed vertrouwen kunnen zeggen: De Heere is mij een Helper, ik zal niet vreezen; wat zal een mensch mij doen? 
[13:7]  Zijt gedachtig aan uw voorgangers, die Gods woord tot u gesproken hebben; en volgt hun geloof na, beschouwende de uitkomst van hun wandeling.
[13:8] Jezus Christus is dezelfde, gisteren, en heden, en tot in eeuwigheid. 
[13:9]  Laat u niet medeslepen door verschillende en vreemde leeringen; want het is goed dat het harte wordt versterkt door genade; niet door spijze waarin geen nuttigheid is voor degenen die zich daaraan hechten. 
[13:10]  Wij hebben een altaar waarvan zij geen recht hebben om te eten die in den tabernakel dienen.
[13:11] Want de lichamen van die dieren wier bloed voor de zonde tot het heiligdom gebracht werd door den hoogepriester, werden verbrand buiten het leger.
[13:12] Daarom heelt ook Jezus, opdat Hij door zijn eigen bloed het volk zou heiligen, buiten de poort geleden.
[13:13] Laat ons daarom tot Hem uitgaan buiten het leger, zijn smaadheid dragende.
[13:14] Want hier hebben wij geen blijvende stad, maar de toekomende zoeken wij. 
[13:15]  Laat ons dan door Hem voortdurend een offerande; des lofs aan God opdragen, dat is een vrucht der lippen die zijn Naam belijden.
[13:16] En vergeet niet de weldadigheid en de mededeelzaamheid, want aan zoodanige offeranden heeft God een welbehagen. 
[13:17]  Zijt gehoorzaam aan uw voorgangers en onderdanig, want die houden de wacht over uw zielen, als zullende rekenschap geven, opdat zij dit mogen doen met blijdschap en niet al zuchtende, hetgeen u niet tot voordeel zou zijn. 
[13:18]  Bidt voor ons, want wij zijn overtuigd dat wij een goede konsciëntie hebben, omdat wij in alles wenschen eerlijk te wandelen.
[13:19] En te meer vermaan ik u dat gij dit doet, opdat ik ulieden te eerder moge wedergegeven worden. 
[13:20]  De God des vredes nu, die den grooten Herder der schapen uit de dooden heeft wedergebracht, door het bloed van een eeuwig verbond, namelijk onzen Heere Jezus,
[13:21] die bekwame ulieden in alle goed werk om zijn wil te doen, werkende in u wat aangenaam is voor zijn aan gezicht door Jezus Christus, wien de glorie zij tot in alle eeuwen. Amen. 
[13:22]  Doch ik vermaan u broeders! verdraagt het woord der vermaning, want ik heb u geschreven in het kort.
[13:23] Gij weet dat onze broeder Timotheüs is losgelaten; als hij spoedig komt hoop ik met hem ulieden te zien. 
[13:24]  Groet al uw voorgangers en al de heiligen. Ulieden groeten de broeders van Italië.
[13:25] De genade met u allen! Amen.   

### James

[1:1] Jakobus, een dienstknecht van God en van den Heere Jezus Christus, aan de twaalf stammen die in de verstrooiing zijn: zaligheid! 
[1:2]  Acht het voor enkel vreugde, mijn broeders, als gij rondom in menigvuldige bekoringen komt,
[1:3] wetende dat de beproeving van uw geloof volharding uitwerkt.
[1:4] Doch de volharding moet een volkomen werk hebben; opdat gij volmaakt moogt zijn en volkomen, in geen ding gebrekkig. 
[1:5]  Doch als iemand van ulieden wijsheid noodig heeft, die moge ze begeeren van dien God, die aan een iegelijk mildelijk geeft en niet verwijt, en zij zal hem gegeven worden.
[1:6] Doch hij moet ze in geloof begeeren, niets betwijfelende, want de twijfelaar is gelijk aan een golf der zee die door den wind wordt gedreven en op en neer geslingerd.
[1:7] Want zulk een mensch moet niet denken dat hij iets zal ontvangen van den Heer;
[1:8] een dubbelhartig man, onstandvastig in al zijn wegen! 
[1:9]  Maar de broeder die gering van staat is moet roemen in zijn hoogheid,
[1:10] en de rijke in zijn geringheid, want als een bloem des velds zal hij voorbijgaan.
[1:11] Want de zon gaat op met haar hitte en het gras verdroogt, en zijn bloem valt af, en de schoonheid van haar gedaante gaat voorbij; alzoo ook zal de rijke in zijn wegen verdorren. 
[1:12]  Zalig de man die bekoring doorstaat, want beproefd zijnde zal hij de kroon des levens bekomen, die God beloofd heeft aan degenen die Hem beminnen.
[1:13] Niemand, die in bekoring is, moge zeggen dat hij van God wordt bekoord, want God kan niet worden bekoord door het kwade en Hij zelf bekoort niemand.
[1:14] Maar iedereen wordt bekoord als hij van zijn eigen begeerlijkheden wordt vervoerd en verlokt.
[1:15] Daarna, als de begeerlijkheid bevrucht is, baart zij zonde, en de zonde, als zij voldragen is, brengt den dood voort.
[1:16] Doolt niet, mijn beminde broeders!
[1:17] Alle goede gifte en alle volkomen gave is van boven afdalende, van den Vader der lichten, bij wien niet de minste verandering is, of schijn van verwisseling.
[1:18] Door zijn wil heeft Hij ons voortgebracht door het woord der waarheid, om ons te doen zijn de eerstelingen van zijn schepselen. 
[1:19]  Gij weet dit, mijn beminde broeders! Maar ieder mensch zij vlijtig om te hooren, traag om te spreken, traag tot gramschap.
[1:20] Want de gramschap eens mans werkt niet uit wat voor God rechtvaardig is.
[1:21] Daarom, alle onreinheid en overvloed van kwaadheid afleggende, ontvangt in zachtmoedigheid het ingeplante woord dat uw zielen kan behouden.
[1:22] En wordt daders des woords, en niet alleen hoorders die zich zelven misleiden.
[1:23] Want als iemand een hoorder des woords is, en niet een dader, dan is hij gelijk aan een man die zijn natuurlijk aangezicht ziet in een spiegel;
[1:24] want hij heeft zich zelven gezien en is weggegaan, en terstond heeft hij verbeten hoe hij was.
[1:25] Doch die ziet op de volmaakte wet, die van de vrijheid, en daarbij blijft, geen vergetelijk hoorder zijnde maar een dader des werks, deze zal zalig zijn in zijn handeling.
[1:26] Als iemand meent godsdienstig te zijn, terwijl hij zijn tong niet bedwingt maar zijn hart misleidt, dan is de godsdienst van dezen ledig.
[1:27] Zuivere en onbevlekte godsdienst bij God en den Vader is deze: weezen en weduwen in hun verdrukking te bezoeken, zich zelven onbesmet te bewaren van de wereld.  
[2:1] Mijn broeders, gij hebt toch het geloof van Jezus Christus, den Heere der glorie, niet met aanzien des persoons?
[2:2] Want als er in uw vergadering een man zou komen met een gouden ring aan, in een kostbaar kleed, en er zou een arme inkomen in een gering kleed,
[2:3] en gij zoudt letten op dengene die het kostbaar kleed draagt en zeggen: zit gij hier op een goede plaats! en gij zoudt zeggen tot den arme: sta gij daar of zit onder aan mijn voetbank!
[2:4] zoudt gij dan in u zelven geen onderscheid maken en niet rechters geworden zijn van verkeerde gedachten?
[2:5] Hoort, mijn beminde broeders! heeft God niet uitverkoren de armen naar de wereld tot rijken in het geloof en tot erfgenamen van het koninkrijk dat Hij beloofd heeft aan degenen die Hem beminnen?
[2:6] Maar gij hebt den arme veracht. Zijn het niet de rijken die u overheerschen en zijn zij het niet die u trekken voor de rechtbanken?
[2:7] Zijn zij het niet die den goeden Naam lasteren die over u is uitgeroepen?
[2:8] Als gij echter de koninklijke wet volbrengt volgens de Schriftuur: Gij zult uw naaste beminnen als u zelven, dan doet gij wel.
[2:9] Maar als gij den persoon aanziet dan doet gij zonde, en gij wordt van de wet bestraft als overtreders.
[2:10] Want al wie de geheele wet zal houden, maar in één gebod zal overtreden, die is schuldig geworden aan al de geboden.
[2:11] Want die gezegd heeft: Gij zult geen overspel doen, die heeft ook gezegd: Gij zult niet doodslaan. Als gij nu geen overspel doet, maar wel doodslaat, dan zijt gij een overtreder der wet geworden.
[2:12] Spreekt alzoo en doet alzoo als die geoordeeld zult worden door de wet der vrijheid.
[2:13] Want een onbarmhartig oordeel zal komen over den– gene die geen barmhartigheid gedaan heeft. Barmhartigheid roemt tegen oordeel. 
[2:14]  Wat baat het, mijn broeders! als iemand zegt geloof te hebben, maar de werken heeft hij niet? Het geloof kan hem toch niet behouden?
[2:15] Als een broeder of zuster naakt zou zijn en in gebrek aan dagelijksch voedsel,
[2:16] en iemand uit u zon tot hen zeggen: gaat heen in vrede; verwarmt en verzadigt u! doch gij zoudt hun niet geven de benoodigdheden des lichaams— wat zou dat baten?
[2:17] Alzoo ook het geloof, als het geen werken heeft dan is het in zich zelven dood.
[2:18] Maar, zal iemand zeggen: gij hebt geloof en ik heb werken! — Toon mij uw geloof zonder de werken, en dan zal ik u uit mijn werken het geloof toonen.
[2:19] Gij gelooft dat God de Eenige is? Gij doet wel. Ook de booze geesten gelooven en sidderen.
[2:20] Doch wilt gij weten, o nietig mensch, dat het geloof zonder de werken onvruchtbaar is?
[2:21] Is Abraham onze vader niet uit werken gerechtvaardigd, toen hij Isaak zijn zoon op den altaar offerde?
[2:22] Gij ziet dus dat het geloof medewerkte met zijn werken en dat het geloof volkomen is geworden uit de werken,
[2:23] en dat de Schriftuur is vervuld die zegt: Abraham heeft op God vertrouwd en dat is hem toegerekend tot rechtvaardigheid, en hij is een vriend van God genoemd.
[2:24] Gij ziet dus dat een mensch uit werken gerechtvaardigd wordt en niet alleen uit geloof.
[2:25] Evenzeer ook Rahab de hoere, is zij niet uit werken gerechtvaardigd, als zij de zendboden heeft ontvangen en langs een anderen weg heeft weggelaten?
[2:26] Want evenals het lichaam zonder geest dood is, zoo ook is het geloof zonder werken dood.  
[3:1] Mijn broeders, zijt niet veel leeraars, wetende dat wij te zwaarder oordeel zullen ontvangen.
[3:2] Want in veel dingen struikelen wij allen. Als iemand in spreken niet struikelt dan is hij een volmaakt man, machtig om ook het geheele lichaam in toom te houden.
[3:3] Indien wij den paarden toornen in den mond leggen opdat zij ons zouden gehoorzamen, dan leiden wij hun geheele lichaam om.
[3:4] Zie ook de schepen, hoe groot die ook zijn en door sterke winden gedreven, zij worden omgewend door een zeer klein roer waar de wensch van den stuurman het wil.
[3:5] Alzoo ook de tong; zij is een klein lid en roemt op groote dingen. Zie, wat een klein vuur, en hoe grooten hoop houts steekt het aan!
[3:6] De tong is ook een vuur, de wereld der ongerechtigheid. De tong is onder onze leden als datgene wat het geheele lichaam besmet en den geheelen omloop van ons leven ontsteekt en ontstoken wordt van de hel.
[3:7] Want alle natuur, zoowel van wilde beesten als van vogelen en kruipend gedierte en van zeemonsters, wordt getemd en is getemd door de menschelijke natuur.
[3:8] Doch de tong kan niemand van de menschen temmen; een onbedwingbaar kwaad is zij, vol van doodelijk vergif.
[3:9] Door haar loven wij God en den Vader, en door haar vervloeken wij de menschen die naar de gelijkenis van God zijn gemaakt.
[3:10] Uit denzelfden mond komt voort zegening en vervloeking. Mijn broeders, dit mag alzoo niet zijn!
[3:11] De fontein geeft toch uit denzelfden ader geen zoet en bitter?
[3:12] Mijn broeders, een vijgeboom kan toch geen olijven voortbrengen, of een wijnstok geen vijgen? Zoo ook kan zout water geen zoet voortbrengen. 
[3:13]  Wie is wijs en verstannig onder u? Die moet toonen uit zijn goeden wandel zijn werken in zachtmoedige wijsheid.
[3:14] Maar als gij in uw harten bittere jaloezie hebt en twist, beroemt u dan niet op de waarheid en liegt niet.
[3:15] Deze is toch niet de wijsheid die van bovenkomt, maar zij is aardsch, zinnelijk, duivelsch.
[3:16] Want waar jaloezie is en twist, daar is verwarring en alle boos bedrijf.
[3:17] Maar de wijsheid van boven is ten eerste zuiver, daarna vreedzaam, bescheiden, gezeggelijk, vol van barmhartigheid en van goede vruchten, onpartijdig, ongeveinsd.
[3:18] De vrucht nu der rechtvaardigheid wordt gezaaid in vrede door degenen die vrede stichten.  
[4:1] Vanwaar de oorlogen en vanwaar de twistingen onder u? Komen zij niet daaruit, uit uw begeerlijkheden die strijd voeren in uw leden?
[4:2] Gij zijt begeerig en gij bezit niet; gij zijt moorddadig en nijdig, en gij kunt niets bekomen; gij vecht en voert oorlog; en gij hebt niet omdat gij niet bidt;
[4:3] gij bidt en gij ontvangt niet, omdat gij kwalijk bidt, opdat gij het zoudt verdoen in uw begeerlijkheden.
[4:4] Gij overspelers, weet gij niet dat de vriendschap der wereld vijandschap is tegen God? Zoo wie dan een vriend van de wereld wil zijn, die wordt een vijand van God gerekend.
[4:5] Of denkt gij dat de Schriftuur tevergeefs spreekt? Zou de Geest die in ons woont lust hebben tot nijd?
[4:6] Doch Hij geeft meerder genade. Daarom zet de Schriftuur: God wederstaat hoovaardigen, maar aan nederigen geeft Hij genade. 
[4:7]  Onderwerpt u dan aan God; wederstaat den duivel en hij zal van u wegvluchten.
[4:8] Nadert tot God en Hij zal naderen tot u. Zuivert de handen, gij zondaars! en reinigt de harten, gij dubbelhartigen!
[4:9] Gevoelt uw ellende, en treurt, en weent! Uw lachen worde veranderd in droefheid en uw blijdschap in treurigheid!
[4:10] Vernedert u voor het aangezicht des Heeren en Hij zal u verhoogen. 
[4:11]  Spreekt geen kwaad van elkander, broeders! Die kwaad spreekt van zijn broeder of die zijn broeder oordeelt, die spreekt kwaad van de wet en oordeelt de wet. En als gij de wet oordeelt, dan zijt gij geen volbrenger van de wet maar een rechter.
[4:12] Doch er is maar één Wetgever en Rechter, die kan redden en verderven. Maar wie zijt gij, die uw naaste oordeelt? 
[4:13]  En wat u aangaat die zegt: van daag of morgen zullen wij naar deze of die stad gaan, en daar zullen wij een jaar verblijven en koophandel drijven en winst doen;
[4:14] gij die niet weet wat er morgen gebeuren zal! Want hoedanig is uw leven? Want gij zijt een damp die een korten tijd gezien wordt en daarna verdwijnt!
[4:15] in plaats dat gij zoudt zeggen: als de Heere wil, dan zullen wij leven en dit of dat doen;
[4:16] maar nu beroemt gij u in uw grootspraak. Al zulke roem is kwaad.
[4:17] Zoo dan, die het goede weet dat er te doen is, en het niet doet, dien is het tot zonde.  
[5:1] En wat u aangaat, gij rijken, weent en huilt over de ellenden die over u gaan komen!
[5:2] Uw rijkdom verrot, en uw kleederen worden van de mot gegeten;
[5:3] uw goud en zilver verroest en hun roest zal een getuige zijn tegen u en zal uw vleesch verslinden als een vuur. Gij hebt schatten verzameld in de laatste dagen.
[5:4] Ziet de loon der arbeiders die uw akkers gemaaid hebben, dien gij achtergehouden hebt, die roept om straf, en de klachten dergenen die voor u den oogst binnen gebracht hebben klimmen op tot de ooren van den Heer der legermachten!
[5:5] Gij hebt lekker geleefd op de aarde, en dartelheden nagevolgd, gij hebt uw harten vet gemest alsof het een hoogdag was.
[5:6] Gij hebt veroordeeld, gij: hebt gedood den rechtvaardige, zonder dat hij u tegenstaat. 
[5:7]  Zijt dan geduldig, broeders, tot op de verschijning des Heeren. Ziet de landman verwacht de kostbare vrucht der aarde, geduldig zijnde over haar, totdat zij vroegen en laten regen ontvangen heeft.
[5:8] Zijt ook gij geduldig, versterkt uw harten, want de verschijning des Heeren is nabij.
[5:9] Zucht niet tegen elkander, broeders, opdat gij niet veroordeeld wordt. Ziet, de Rechter staat vóór de deur. 
[5:10]  Broeders! Neemt aan als een voorbeeld, van mishandelingen, van geduld, de profeten die gesproken hebben in den Naam des Heeren.
[5:11] Ziet, wij houden diegenen voor gelukkig die volhard hebben. De volharding van Job hebt gij gehoord, en het einde des Heeren hebt gij gezien, dat de Heere zeer barmhartig is en ontfermend. 
[5:12]  Doch vooral, mijn broeders, zweert toch niet! Noch bij den hemel, noch bij de aarde, noch bij eenigen anderen eed; maar uw ja zij ja, en uw neen, zij neen, opdat gij niet onder een oordeel valt. 
[5:13]  Is er iemand onder ulieden lijdende? Die moet bidden. — Is er iemand welgemoed? Die moet zingen.
[5:14] Is er iemand onder u krank? Die moet de oudsten der gemeente roepen, en die moeten over hem bidden, hem zalvende met olie in den Naam des Heeren;
[5:15] en het gebed des geloofs zal den kranke behouden, en de Heere zal hem oprichten, en als hij zonden heeft gedaan zal hem dit vergeven worden. 
[5:16]  Belijdt dan voor elkander de zonden en bidt voor elkander, opdat gij gezond moogt worden. Een krachtig gebed van een rechtvaardige vermag veel.
[5:17] Elias was een mensch van gelijke natuur als wij, en hij bad vurig dat het niet zou regenen, en het regende niet op de aarde in drie jaar en zes maanden;
[5:18] en wederom bad hij, en de hemel gaf regen en de aarde bracht haar vrucht voort. 
[5:19]  Mijn broeders, als iemand onder ulieden is afgedoold van de waarheid en iemand hem terugbrengt,
[5:20] die moet weten dat hij die een zondaar terugbrengt van zijn doolweg zijn ziel zal redden uit den dood en een menigte van zonden zal bedekken.   

### I Peter

[1:1] Petrus, een apostel van Jezus Christus, aan de uitverkorenen die vreemdelingen zijn der verstrooiing in Pontus, Galatië, Kappadocië, Asië en Bithynië,
[1:2] naar de voorkennis van God den Vader, in heiligmaking des geestes, tot gehoorzaamheid en besprenging des bloeds van Jezus Christus: genade en vrede zij over ulieden vermenigvuldigd! 
[1:3]  Geprezen zij de God en Vader van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, die naar zijn groote barmhartigheid ons heeft wedergeboren tot een levende hope, door de verrijzenis van Jezus Christus: uit de dooden,
[1:4] tot een onverderfelijk, en onbesmettelijk, en onverwelkelijk erfdeel, dat in de hemelen bewaard wordt voor ulieden,
[1:5] die in Gods kracht bewaard wordt door het geloof tot een zaligheid die gereed is om geopenbaard te worden in den laatsten tijd;
[1:6] Waarin gij u verheugt, als het noodig is dat gij nu een weinig bedroefd wordt in velerlei bekoringen,
[1:7] opdat de beproeving van uw geloof, — die kostbaarder is dan van goud dat vergaat, al is het door vuur beproefd, — bevonden worde tot lof en glorie en eere, in de openbaring van Jezus Christus,
[1:8] dien gij bemint alhoewel gij Hem niet gezien hebt, in wien gij ook, alhoewel Hem nu niet ziende maar geloovende, u verheugt met een onuitsprekelijke en verheerlijkte vreugde,
[1:9] verkrijgende het einde uws geloofs, de behoudenis der zielen. 
[1:10]  Aangaande welke behoudenis de profeten, die geprofeteerd hebben van de genade jegens ulieden, hebben onderzocht en doorzocht,
[1:11] doorzoekende welkenen hoedanigen lijd de Geest van Christus die in hen was, bedoelde, die te voren getuigde van de smarten die op Christus zouden komen en de glorie die daarna komen zou;
[1:12] aan wie geopenbaard is dat zij niet voor zich zelven maar voor ulieden deze dingen bedienden, die nu verkondigd zijn aan ulieden door degenen die u het Evangelie verkondigd hebben in den Heiligen Geest, die gezonden is van den hemel; welke dingen de engelen begeeren in te zien. 
[1:13]  Daarom opschortende de lenden uws verstands, zijt nuchter en hoopt volkomen op de genade die u toegebracht wordt in de openbaring van Jezus Christus;
[1:14] als kinderen der gehoorzaamheid, u niet voegende naar uw vroegere begeerlijkheden uit den tijd uwer onwetendheid,
[1:15] maar gelijk Hij die u geroepen heeft heilig is, zoo wordt ook gij zelf heilig in geheel uw wandel,
[1:16] omdat er geschreven is: Zijt heilig, omdat ook Ik heilig ben.
[1:17] En indien gij als Valer aanroept dengene die, zonder aanzien van personen, oordeelt naar een ieders werk, zoo wandelt dan in vreeze den tijd van uw verblijf op aarde;
[1:18] wetende dat gij niet door vergankelijke dingen, zilver of goud, losgekocht zijt uit uw ijdelen wandel die u van uw voorouders was overgeleverd,
[1:19] maar door het kostbare bloed als van een onbevlekt en onberispelijk Lam, Christus;
[1:20] die wel voorgekend is vóór de grondlegging der wereld, doch aan het einde der tijden geopenbaard is om uwentwil,
[1:21] die door Hem geloovig zijt in God, die Hem heeft opgewekt uit de dooden en Hem glorie gegeven, zoodat uw geloof ook hoop is op God. 
[1:22]  Uw zielen dan gezuiverd hebbende in de gehoorzaamheid der waarheid tot ongeveinsde broederliefde, zoo bemint elkander vuriglijk uit een zuiver hart,
[1:23] gij die wedergeboren zijt niet uit verderfelijk maar uit onverderfelijk zaad door het woord van God, die leeft en blijft.
[1:24] Want alle vleesch is als gras, en al zijn glorie als een grasbloem; het gras verdroogt en de bloem valt af;
[1:25] maar het woord des Heeren blijft tot in eeuwigheid. En dat is het woord dat aan u verkondigd is.  
[2:1] Afleggende dan alle kwaadheid, en alle bedrog, en geveinsdheid, en nijdigheid, en alle kwaadsprekendheid,
[2:2] moet gij, als pasgeboren kinderkens, begeerig zijn naar de geestelijke, onvervalschte melk, opdat gij daardoor moogt opwassen tot behoudenis,
[2:3] indien gij althans gesmaakt hebt dat de Heere barmhartig is.
[2:4] Tot wien gij komende, als tot een levenden steen van menschen wel verworpen maar bij God uitverkoren en kostbaar,
[2:5] zoo wordt gij ook zelf als levende steenen opgebouwd, als een geestelijk huis, om een heilig priesterdom te zijn, om geestelijke offeranden op te dragen die door Jezus Christus aangenaam zijn aan God.
[2:6] Daarom is er gezegd in de Schriftuur: zie Ik stel in Sion een opperhoeksteen, uitverkoren, kostbaar; en die op Hem vertrouwt zal geenszins beschaamd worden.
[2:7] Voor ulieden dan die gelooft is de prijs. Maar voor de ongeloovigen is de steen, dien de bouwmeesters weggeworpen hebben, geworden tot een hoofdsteen des hoeks, en een steen des aanstoots en een rots der ergernis,
[2:8] die zich stooten aan het woord, ongehoorzaam zijnde, waartoe zij ook gesteld zijn.
[2:9] Maar gijlieden zijt een uitverkoren geslacht, een koninklijk priesterdom, een heilig volk, een volk ten erfdeel, opdat gij de krachten zoudt verkondigen van Hem die u geroepen heeft uit duisternis tot zijn wonderbaar licht.
[2:10] Gij die eertijds Gods volk niet waart, doch nu Gods volk zijt, die geen barmhartigheid badt verkregen, maar nu barmhartigheid verkregen hebt. 
[2:11]  Geliefden, ik vermaan u, als bijwoners en pelgrims, dat gij u onthoudt van de vleeschelijke lusten, die strijd voeren tegen de ziel,
[2:12] en dat gij uw wandel betamelijk houdt onder de heidenen, opdat zij, in hetgeen zij van u kwaadspreken als van kwaaddoeners, uit de goede werken die zij opmerken, aan God de glorie geven mogen in den dag der bezoeking. 
[2:13]  Onderwerpt u aan alle menschelijke ordening, om des Heeren wil, hetzij aan een koning als die de opperste macht heeft,
[2:14] hetzij aan stadhouders als die gezonden zijn door hem tot straf der kwaaddoeners, doch tot lof dergenen die goed doen.
[2:15] Want zoo is het de wil van God, dat gij door goed te doen den mond stopt der onwetende en onverstandige menschen.
[2:16] Als vrije menschen, maar toch de vrijheid niet gebruikende als een dekmantel der kwaadheid, maar als dienaars van God.
[2:17] Eert allen, bemint de broederschap, vreest God, eert den koning. 
[2:18]  Gij dienstknechten, zijt in alle eerbiedigheid onderdanig aan uw meesters, niet alleen aan de goeden en vriendelijken, maar ook aan de verkeerden.
[2:19] Want dat is Gode aangenaam, als iemand om der konsciëntie wil voor God kwellingen verdraagt, ten onrechte lijdende.
[2:20] Want wat lof is het als gij verdraagt indien gij zondigt en dan met vuisten geslagen wordt? Maar als gij verdraagt indien gij goed doet en dan lijdt, dat is aangenaam voor God.
[2:21] Want daartoe zijt gij geroepen, omdat ook Christus voor u geleden heeft, u een voorbeeld nalatende, opdat gij zijn voetstappen zoudt navolgen;
[2:22] die geen zonde gedaan heeft, en er is geen bedrog in zijn mond gevonden;
[2:23] die als Hij gescholden werd niet wederschold, en als Hem lijden aangedaan werd niet dreigde, maar Hij gaf zich over aan den rechtvaardigen Rechter;
[2:24] die zelf onze zonden gedragen heeftin zijn lichaam op het kruis, opdat wij, der zonden afgestorven zijnde, voor de rechtvaardigheid zouden leven, door wiens striemen gij genezen zijt.
[2:25] Want gij waart als dolende schapen, maar gij zijt nu wedergekeerd tot den Herder en Opziener uwer zielen.  
[3:1] Insgelijks gij vrouwen, zijt onderdanig aan uw eigen mannen, opdat ook als sommigen ongehoorzaam zijn aan het woord, zij door de levensmanier der vrouwen zonder woord mogen gewonnen worden,
[3:2] lettende op uw reinen wandel in eerbiedigheid.
[3:3] Het versiersel der vrouwen moet niet uitwendig zijn, in gekrulde haren en het omhangen van goud, of het pronken met kleederen,
[3:4] maar in den verborgen mensch des harten, in het onverderfelijk sieraad van een zachtmoedigen en stillen geest, die kostelijk is voor Gods aangezicht.
[3:5] Want alzoo ook versierden zich zelven eertijds de heilige vrouwen die op God hoopten, en aan haar mannen onderdanig waren;
[3:6] zooals ook Sara aan Abraham onderdanig was, hem heer noemende, welker dochteren gij zijt geworden, als gij weldoet en u door geen vreeze laat ontstellen. 
[3:7]  Gij mannen evenzoo, leeft met haar verstandig, eerbiedigheid bewijzende aan het vrouwelijk geslacht als aan het zwakste, als die ook mede erfgenamen zijn van de genade des levens, opdat uw gebeden niet worden verhinderd. 
[3:8]  En eindelijk, zijt allen eensgezind, medelijdend, broederlievend, barmhartig, nederig,
[3:9] geen kwaad met kwaad vergeldende of schelden met schelden, maar integendeel hen zegenende, want daartoe zijt gij geroepen, opdat gij den zegen zoudt beërven.
[3:10] Want die het leven wil beminnen en goede dagen zien, die bedwinge zijn tong van het kwaad en zijn lippen van bedrog te spreken;
[3:11] die wijke af van het kwaad en doe goed, en zoeke vrede en jage dien na;
[3:12] want des Heeren oogen zijn op rechtvaardigen en zijn ooren tot hun geroep, maar des Heeren aangezicht is tegen kwaaddoeners.
[3:13] En wie zal u kwaad doen als gij ijveraars voor het goede geworden zijt?
[3:14] Maar als gij ook al lijdt om de rechtvaardigheid, dan zijt gij zalig; vreest dan hun dreigementen niet en ontstelt niet,
[3:15] maar heiligt Christus in uw harten als Heer, altijd gereed tot verdediging aan al wie u rekenschap zou vragen wegens de hope die in u is, maar met zachtmoedigheid en eerbiedigheid,
[3:16] een goede konsciëntie hebbende, opdat zij beschaamd worden mogen in hetgeen zij van u kwaadspreken, zij die lasteren uw goeden wandel in Christus.
[3:17] Want beter is het toch, als de wil van God zoo is, om weldoende te lijden, dan kwaaddoende. 
[3:18]  Want Christus is ook eenmaal voor de zonden gestorven, de Rechvaardige voor onrechtvaardigen, opdat Hij ons tot God zou brengen; die wel gedood is naar het vleesch, doch levend gemaakt naar den geest,
[3:19] waarin Hij ook is heengegaan en gepredikt heeft aan geesten in de gevangenis,
[3:20] die eertijds ongehoorzaam waren toen de lankmoedigheid Gods verlengd was, in de dagen van Noach, terwijl de ark werd toebereid, waarin weinige, dat is acht zielen, behouden werden door het water heen;
[3:21] dat water, waarvan het tegenbeeld, de doop, u nu ook behoudt, niet als een afwassching van de onreinheid des lichaams, maar als de toezegging van een goede konsciëntie tot God, door de verrijzenis van Jezus Christus,
[3:22] die is aan Gods rechterhand, heengegaan naaiden hemel, terwijl engelen en krachten en machten Hem onderworpen zijn.  
[4:1] Aangezien dan Christus in het vleesch geleden heeft zoo wapent u ook met dezelfde gedachte; want hij die in het vleesch geleden heeft, heeft opgehouden van de zonde,
[4:2] om nu den tijd dien gij over hebt in het vleesch, niet meer te leven naar de begeerlijkheid der menschen, maar naar den wil van God.
[4:3] Want het is voldoende in den verloop en tijd den wil der heidenen volbracht te hebben, gewandeld hebbende in ontuchtigheden, begeerlijkheden, wijnzuiperijen, brasserijen, zwelgerijen en gruwelijke afgoderijen,
[4:4] waarin het hun vreemd voorkomt als gij niet medeloopt tot dezelfde uitgieting van overdadigheid en u daarom lasteren;
[4:5] die rekenschap zullen geven aan Hem die gereed staat om te oordeelen levenden en dooden.
[4:6] Want tot dat einde is ook aan de dooden het Evangelie verkondigd, opdat zij wel zouden geoordeeld worden naar den mensch in het vleesch, maar leven zouden naar God in den geest. 
[4:7]  Maar het einde van alle dingen is nabij; zijt dan nuchter en waakt tot gebeden;
[4:8] vooral vurige liefde hebbende jegens elkander, want de liefde bedekt een menigte van zonden;
[4:9] voor elkander herbergzaam zijnde zonder murmureering. 
[4:10]  Een ieder, zooals hij een genadegave ontvangen heeft, bestede die onder u zelven, als goede verzorgers der menigvuldige genade Gods.
[4:11] Als iemand spreekt, dan spreke hij als woorden Gods, als iemand een bediening heeft, dan diene hij als uit kracht die God verleent, opdat God in alles de glorie ontvange, door Jezus Christus, aan wien de glorie toekomt, en de heerschappij tot in alle eeuwigheid. Amen. 
[4:12]  Beminden, laat het u niet vreemd toeschijnen dat gij hevig verdrukt wordt, hetgeen over u komt om u te beproeven, alsof u iets vreemds overkwame;
[4:13] maar voor zooveel gij deelgenooten van de smarten van Christus zijt zoo moet gij u verblijden, opdat gij u ook verheugen en verblijden moogt in de openbaring zijner glorie.
[4:14] Als u smaadheid wordt aangedaan om den Naam van Christus, dan zijt gij gelukkig; want de Geest der glorie en van God rust op u.
[4:15] Doch dat niemand van ulieden lijde als een doodslager, of dief, of kwaaddoener, of die zich met een anders zaken bemoeit.
[4:16] Maar als iemand lijdt als een christen, dan moet hij zich niet schamen, maar dan moet hij in dien naam God de glorie geven.
[4:17] Want de tijd is daar dat het oordeel begint van het huis Gods; doch als dit eerst begint van ons, wat zal dan het einde zijn van degenen die aan het Evangelie Gods ongehoorzaam zijn?
[4:18] En als de rechtvaardige nauwelijks behouden wordt, de goddelooze en de zondaar waar zal die dan verschijnen;
[4:19] Zoo dan, laat ook hen die lijden naar den wil van God, hun zielen aan den getrouwen Schepper overgeven in weldadigheid.  
[5:1] De ouderlingen dan die onder u zijn vermaan ik, de medeouderling en getuige der smarten van Christus, maar die ook deelgenoot ben van de glorie die geopenbaard zal worden:
[5:2] hoedt de kudde Gods die onder u is en hebt er toezicht over, niet gedwongen maar gewillig, volgens Gods wil, noch om vuil gewin maar uitterharte,
[5:3] noch als heerschappijvoerders over het erfdeel, maar als voorbeelden zijnde voor de kudde.
[5:4] En als de overste Herder zal verschenen zijn dan zult gij de onverwelkelijke kroon der glorie verkrijgen. 
[5:5]  Zoo ook, gij die jonger zijt, zijt onderdanig aan de oudsten. Ja, gij allen, versiert u zelven met nederigheid, want God wederstaat de hoovaardigen doch aan de nederigen geeft Hij genade.
[5:6] Vernedert u dan onder de machtige hand Gods, opdat Hij u ter rechter tijd verhooge.
[5:7] Werpt al uw bekommernis op Hem, want Hij zorgt voor u.
[5:8] Zijt nuchter, waakt! Uw tegenpartij, de duivel, als een brullende leeuw, gaat hij rond, zoekende wien hij verslinden moge.
[5:9] Wederstaat hem, vast in het geloof, wetende dat dezelfde smarten geleden worden door uw broeders die in de wereld zijn. 
[5:10]  Doch de God van alle genade, die u geroepen heeft tot zijn eeuwige glorie in Christus, nadat gij een weinig zult geleden hebben, die zal u volmaken, versterken, bevestigen en fundeeren.
[5:11] Hem zij de glorie en de heerschappij tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen. 
[5:12]  Door Silvanus, den getrouwen broeder naar ik meen, heb ik u in het kort geschreven, vermanende en getuigende dat deze is de waarachtige genade Gods; staat daarin vast!
[5:13] De medeuitverkorenedie in Babylon is groet u, en ook Markus mijn zoon.
[5:14] Groet elkander met een kus der liefde. Vrede zij met u allen die in Christus zijt!   

### II Peter

[1:1] Simon Petrus, een dienaar en apostel van Jezus Christus, aan degenen die hetzelfde dierbaar geloof ontvangen hebben in de rechtvaardigheid van onzen God en Verlosser Jezus Christus:
[1:2] genade en vrede zij ulieden vermenigvuldigd, inde kennis van God en onzen Heere Jezus Christus. 
[1:3]  Gelijk ons van zijn goddelijke kracht alle dingen, die tot het leven en de godvruchtigheid dienen, geschonken zijn, door de kennis van Hem die ons geroepen heeft door zijn eigen glorie en kracht,
[1:4] waardoor Hij ons zijn kostbare en zeer groote beloften geschonken heeft, opdat gij door dezen zoudt deelgenooten worden van de goddelijke natuur, ontvloden zijnde het verderf dat in de wereld is, in de begeerlijkheid;
[1:5] zoo tracht ook met alle naarstigheid de kracht te voegen bij uw geloof en bij de kracht de kennis,
[1:6] en bij de kennis de matigheid, en bij de matigheid de volharding, en bij de volharding de godvruchtigheid,
[1:7] en bij de godvruchtigheid de broederliefde, en bij de broederliefde de liefde jegens allen.
[1:8] Want als deze dingen bij u te vinden zijn, en overvloedig zijn, dan zullen zij u niet ledig noch onvruchtbaar laten tot de kennis van onzen Heere Jezus Christus.
[1:9] Want bij wien deze dingen niet te vinden zijn die is blind, bijziende, vergeten hebbende de reiniging van zijn vroegere zonden. 
[1:10]  Daarom te meer, broeders, haast u om uw roeping en verkiezing vast te stellen; want dat doende zult gij nooit struikelen.
[1:11] Want alzoo zal u een ruime ingang gebaand worden tot het eeuwig koninkrijk van onzen Heere en Zaligmaker Jezus Christus. 
[1:12]  Daarom zal ik zorgen u altijd deze dingen te herinneren, alhoewel gij ze weet en bevestigd zijt in de waarheid die tegenwoordig geopenbaard is.
[1:13] En ik meen dat het recht is, zoolang ik in dezen tabernakel ben, u op te wekken door herinnering,
[1:14] wetende dat de aflegging van mijn tabernakel nabij is, zooals ook onze Heere Jezus Christus mij heeft bekend gemaakt.
[1:15] Maar ik zal mij haasten dat gij voortdurend, ook na mijn heengaan, deze dingen in gedachtenis hebt.
[1:16] Want wij hebben geen schoon verzonnen fabelen gevolgd, als wij u bekend gemaakt hebben de kracht en verschijning van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, maar Wij zijn ooggetuigen geweest van zijn majesteit.
[1:17] Want Hij heeft van God den Vader eere en glorie ontvangen, als er van die hoogwaardige glorie zoodanige stem tot Hem afdaalde: Deze is mijn Zoon, de Beminde, in wien Ik welbehagen heb.
[1:18] En deze stem hoorden wij uit den hemel afkomen, als wij met Hem waren op den heiligen berg.
[1:19] En wij hebben het profetische woord, dat vaster is, waarop gij wel doet acht l te nemen als op een lamp die schijnt in een donkere plaats, totdat de dag aanbreke en de morgenster opga in uw harten;
[1:20] dit vooral wetende, dat geen profetische schrift van eigen uitlegging is.
[1:21] Want niet door den wil eens menschen is de profetie eertijds voortgebracht, maar van den Heiligen Geest gedreven zijnde, hebben menschen gesproken van God.  
[2:1] En er zijn ook schijnprofeten onder het volk geweest, zooals er ook onder u schijnleeraars zullen zijn, die op bedekte wijze verderfelijke ketterijen zullen invoeren, den Meester die hen gekocht heeft verloochenende, zich zei ven een haastig verderf op den hals halende.
[2:2] En velen zullen hun verderfelijke dingen navolgen; om hunnentwil zal de weg der waarheid gelasterd worden;
[2:3] en in gierighied zullen zij u met gemaakte woorden omkoopen; maar het oordeel over hen is al lang op weg en hun verderf slaapt niet. 
[2:4]  Want is het dat God de engelen die gezondigd hebben niet gespaard heeft maar hen in de hel geworpen heeft, en overgegeven heeft in de boeien der duisternis, om bewaard te worden tot het oordeel;
[2:5] en is het dat Hij de oude wereld niet gespaard, maar Noach den prediker der rechtvaardigheid, met zeven anderen bewaard heeft, als Hij den zondvloed deed komen over de wereld der goddeloozen,
[2:6] en is het dat Hij de steden Sodom en Gomorra in assche verkeerde, in een verwoesting ze veroordeelende, die tot een voorbeeld stellende voor degenen die goddeloos leven;
[2:7] en heeft Hij den rechtvaardigen Lot uitgered, die verdrukt werd door den ontuchtigen handel der goddeloozen;
[2:8] — in het zien en hooren toch kwelde deze rechtvaardige man, die onder hen woonde, dag aan dag zijn rechtvaardige ziel, door hun goddelooze werken:
[2:9] De Heer weet de godvruchtigen uit bekoringen te verlossen, maar de goddeloozen tot den dag des oordeels te bewaren om gestraft te worden;
[2:10] doch vooral degenen die wandelen naar het vleesch in de begeerlijkheid der onreinheid, en die de overheid verachten. Stout, eigenzinnig zijnde, vreezen zij niet om de machten te lasteren,
[2:11] waar de engelen, alhoewel in sterkte en kracht meerder zijnde, toch geen lasterlijk oordeel tegen die machten inbrengen voor den Heer.
[2:12] Maar dezen, als redelooze dieren, geboren zijnde tot roof en verderf, lasterende in dingen die zij niet kennen, zullen in hun verdorvenheid ook verwoest worden,
[2:13] verkrijgende het loon der goddeloosheid: die hun genot stellen in dagelijksche weelde, kladden en schandvlekken zijnde, weelderig in hun liefdemaaltijden die zij met u houden,
[2:14] hebbende oogen vol van overspel; die niet kunnen ophouden van zondigen, onvaste zielen verlokkende, hebbende het hart geoefend in gierigheid, kinderen der vervloeking;
[2:15] den rechten weg verlatende zijn zij verdoold, volgende den weg van Balaam, den zoon van Bosor, die het loon der onrechtvaardigheid beminde;
[2:16] doch hij heeft de straf zijner eigene onrechtvaardigheid gehad, toen een stomlastdragend beest, met de stem van een mensch, de onzinnigheid van den profeet verhinderde.
[2:17] Dezen zijn waterlooze fonteinen en wolken die gedreven worden door draaiwinden, voor wie de donkerste duisternis bewaard is.
[2:18] Want opgeblazen ijdele dingen sprekende verlokken zij door begeerlijkheden des vleesches, door wellustigheden degenen die kort te voren ontvloden zijn van degenen die in doling wandelen,
[2:19] hun vrijheid verkondigende, zijn zij zelf slaven der verdorvenheid; want iemand is de slaaf van dengene door wien hij overwonnen is.
[2:20] Want als zij, de besmettingen der wereld ontvloden zijnde door de kennis van onzen Heer en Verlosser Jezus Christus, wederom zich daarin wikkelen en laten overwinnen, dan is hun laatste slechter geworden dan hun eerste.
[2:21] Want het ware hun beter den weg der rechtvaardigheid niet gekend te hebben, dan dien gekend hebbende, zich af te keeren van het heilig gebod dat hun was overgeleverd.
[2:22] Hun is overkomen hetgeen een waarachtig spreekwoord zegt: een hond keert weder tot zijn eigen uitbraaksel en een gewasschen zeug tot de wenteling in het slijk.  
[3:1] Dezen tweeden brief schrijf ik nu aan u, beminde broeders, in welke beide ik uw oprecht gemoed opwek door vermaning.
[3:2] Opdat gij gedenken zoudt aan de woorden die te voren gesproken zijn door de heilige profeten, en aan het gebod van den Heer en Verlosser, door uw apostelen.
[3:3] Dit vooraf wetende, dat er in het laatste der dagen spotters zullen komen, die wandelen naar hun eigen begeerlijkheden,
[3:4] en zeggen: waar is de belofte van zijn verschijning? want sedert dat onze voorouders gestorven zijn blijven alle dingen alzoo als van het begin der schepping!
[3:5] Want moedwillig vergeten zij dit, dat er hemelen waren van oude tijden af en dat er een aarde bestond uit water en door water, door het woord Gods,
[3:6] waardoor de wereld die toen bestond, door water overstroomd, vergaan is.
[3:7] Doch de hemelen die nu bestaan en de aarde zijn door hetzelfde woord als een schat weggelegd, bewaard wordende ten vure tot den dag des oordeels en der verderving van de goddelooze menschen.
[3:8] Doch vergeet dit ééne niet, beminden, dat één dag bij den Heer is als duizend jaar, en duizend jaar als één dag.
[3:9] De Heer is niet traag in de belofte, zooals eenigen die traagheid achten; maar Hij handelt lankmoediglijk om uwentwil, niet willende dat eenigen verdorven worden maar dat allen tot boetvaardigheid komen.
[3:10] Doch de dag des Heeren zal komen als een dief, waarin de hemelen meteen gedruisch zullen voorbijgaan, de elementen door hitte zullen versmelten, en de aarde en hetgeen in haar is zal verbrand worden. 
[3:11]  Aangezien dan al deze dingen vergaan, hoedanig moet gij dan zijn in heiligen wandel en godvruchtigheid!
[3:12] Verwachtende en verlangende naar de verschijning van de dag Gods, om welken de hemelen brandende zullen vergaan en de elementen door hitte zullen versmelten.
[3:13] Doch, naar zijn belofte, verwachten wij nieuwe hemelen en een nieuwe aarde waarin rechtvaardigheid woont.
[3:14] Daarom, beminden, deze dingen verwachtende, benaarstigt u om onbevlekt en onbestraffelijk in vrede door Hem bevonden te worden.
[3:15] En acht de lankmoedigheid van onzen Heer als redding, zooals ook onze geliefde broeder Paulus ulieden geschreven heeft, naar de wijsheid die hem gegeven is,
[3:16] zooals ook in al de brieven waarin hij spreekt van deze dingen; waarin sommige dingen moeilijk zijn om te verstaan, die de ongeleerden en onstandvastigen verdraaien; zooals ook de andere Schriften, tot hun eigen verderf. 
[3:17]  Gij dan, beminden, dat te voren wetende, wacht u dat gij niet, door de doling der goddeloozen mede vervoerd wordende, uitvalt van uw eigen vastigheid.
[3:18] Maar wast op in genade en in kennis van onzen Heer en Verlosser Jezus Christus. Hem zij de glorie, zoowel nu als tot den dag der eeuwigheid. Amen.   

### I John

[1:1] Hetgeen was van den beginne, hetgeen wij gehoord hebben, hetgeen wij gezien hebben met onze oogen, hetgeen wij aanschouwd hebben en onze handen getast hebben, aangaande het Woord des levens;
[1:2] — en het leven is openbaar geworden, en wij hebben gezien, en getuigen, en verkondigen ulieden het leven dat eeuwig is, dat was bij den Vader en aan ons is openbaar geworden—
[1:3] hetgeen wij gezien hebben en gehoord, dat verkondigen wij ook ulieden, opdat ook gij gemeenschap zoudt hebben met ons, en opdat de gemeenschap die de onze is ook zij met den Vader en met zijn Zoon Jezus Christus.
[1:4] En deze dingen schrijven wij ulieden, opdat onze blijdschap volkomen moge zijn. 
[1:5]  En dat is de boodschap die wij gehoord hebben van Hem en die wij ulieden verkondigen, dat God licht is en dat er gansch geen duisternis is in Hem,
[1:6] als wij zeggen dat wij gemeenschap hebben met Hem, en wij wandelen in de duisternis, dan liegen wij en wij doen de waarheid niet.
[1:7] Doch als wij in het licht wandelen zooals Hij in het licht is, dan hebben wij gemeenschap met elkander en het bloed van Jezus Christus, zijn Zoon, zuivert ons van alle zonde. 
[1:8]  Als wij zeggen dat wij geen zonde hebben dan brengen wij ons zelven in doling en de waarheid is niet in ons.
[1:9] Als wij onze zonden belijden, God is getrouw en rechtvaardig, dat Hij ons de zonden vergeve en dat Hij ons zuivere van alle onrechtvaardigheid.
[1:10] Als wij zeggen dat wij niet gezondigd hebben, dan maken wij Hem tot een leugenaar, en zijn woord is niet in ons.  
[2:1] Mijn kinderkens, deze dingen schrijf ik u opdat gij niet zoudt zondigen En als iemand zondigt, wij hebben een Voorspreker bij den Vader, Jezus Christus, den Rechtvaardige.
[2:2] En Hij is een verzoening voor onze zonden, en niet alleen voor de onze, maar ook voor de geheele wereld.
[2:3] En hierin weten wij dat wij Hem gekend hebben, als wij zijn geboden bewaren.
[2:4] Die zegt: ik heb Hem gekend, en die zijn geboden niet bewaart, die is een leugenaar, en in dezen is de waarheid niet.
[2:5] Doch die zijn woord bewaart, in dezen is waarlijk de liefde Gods volkomen geworden. Daarin weten wij dat wij in Hem zijn.
[2:6] Die zegt in Hem te blijven die moet ook zelf evenalzoo wandelen als Hij gewandeld heeft. 
[2:7]  Mijn beminden, ik schrijf u geen nieuw gebod, maar een oud gebod, dat gij van den beginne gehad hebt. Dat oud gebod is het woord dat gij gehoord hebt.
[2:8] Wederom schrijf ik u een; nieuw gebod: hetgeen waarachtig is in Hem en in ulieden; want de duisternis gaat voorbij en het waarachtige licht schijnt alreeds.
[2:9] Die zegt in het licht ter zijn en zijn broeder haat, die is in de duisternis tot nu toe.
[2:10] Die zijn broeder bemint: blijft in het licht, en in hem is geen struikeling;
[2:11] doch die zijn broedehaat, die is in de duisternis en die wandelt in de duisternis, en die weet niet waar hij gaat, omdat de duisternis zijn oogen verblind heeft;
[2:12] Ik schrijf u, kinderken omdat u de zonden vergeven zijn om zijns Naams wil.
[2:13] Ik schrijf n, vaders, omdat gij gekend hebt Hem die van den beginne is. Ik schrijf u, jongelingen, omdat gij den kwade overwonnen hebt.
[2:14] Ik heb u geschreven, kinderen, omdat gij den Vader gekend hebt. Ik heb u geschreven, vaders, omdat gij gekend hebt Hem die van den beginne is. Ik heb u geschreven, jongelingen omdat gij sterk zijt en omdat Gods woord in u blijft, en omdat gij den kwade overwonnen hebt. 
[2:15]  Bemint toch de wereld niet, noch hetgeen in de wereld is; als iemand de wereld bemint, dan is de liefde des Vaders niet in hem.
[2:16] Want al wat in de wereld is, de begeerlijkheid des vleesches, en de begeerlijkheid der oogen, en de hoovaardij des levens, is niet uit den Vader, maar is uit de wereld.
[2:17] En de wereld gaat voorbij, en haar begeerlijkheid; maar die den wil van God doet, die blijft tot in eeuwigheid. 
[2:18]  Kinderkers, het is de laatste ure, en zooals gij gehoord hebt dat de Antichrist komt, zoo zijn ook nu vele antichristen opgestaan, vanwaar wij weten dat het de laatste ure is.
[2:19] Zij zijn uit ons uitgegaan, maar zij zijn uit ons niet geweest, want als zij uit ons geweest waren, dan zouden zij met ons gebleven zijn. Maar zij zijn uit ons uitgegaan opdat het openbaar worden zou dat allen niet uit ons zijn.
[2:20] En gij hebt de zalving van den Heilige, en gij weet alle dingen.
[2:21] Ik heb u niet geschreven omdat gij de waarheid niet weet, maar omdat gij ze weet, en omdat geen leugen uit de waarheid is.
[2:22] Wie is de leugenaar, dan hij die loochent dat Jezus is de Christus? Deze is de Antichrist, die den Vader en den Zoon loochent.
[2:23] Al wie den Zoon loochent, die heeft ook den Vader niet. Die den Zoon belijdt, die heeft ook den Vader.
[2:24] Wat u aangaat, laat datgene wat gij van den beginne gehoord hebt ook in u blijven. Als in u blijft hetgeen gij van den beginne gehoord hebt, dan zult gij ook in den Zoon en in den Vader blijven.
[2:25] En dit is de belofte die Hij zelf ons beloofd heeft, het eeuwige leven. 
[2:26]  Deze dingen heb ik u geschreven aangaande degenen die u verleiden.
[2:27] En wat u aangaat, de zalving die gij van Hem ontvangen hebt, blijft in u, en gij hebt niet van noode dat iemand u onderwijze. Maar gelijk zijn zalving u onderwijst van alles, en waarachtig is en geen leugen, alzoo blijft gij ook in Hem zooals zij u onderwezen heeft.
[2:28] En nu, kinderkens, blijft in Hem, opdat als Hij zal geopenbaard zijn wij vrijmoedigheid mogen hebben, en niet beschaamd gemaakt worden van Hem in zijn verschijning.
[2:29] Als gij weet dat Hij rechtvaardig is, dan weet gij ook dat al wie de rechtvaardigheid doet uit Hem geboren is.  
[3:1] Ziet hoe groote liefde de Vader ons gegeven heeft, dat wij kinderen Gods zouden genoemd worden, en ook zijn! Daarom kent de wereld ons niet, omdat zij Hem niet kent.
[3:2] Beminden, nu zijn wij kinderen Gods, en het is nog niet geopenbaard wat wij zullen zijn. Wij weten dat, als het zal geopenbaard zijn, wij Hem zullen gelijk zijn, omdat wij Hem zullen zien zooals Hij is.
[3:3] En al wie deze hoop op Hem heeft die reinigt zich zelven, zooals Hij rein is. 
[3:4]  Al wie de zonde doet, doet ook de wetteloosheid, want de zonde is de wetteloosheid.
[3:5] En gij weet dat Hij geopenbaard is om de zonde weg te nemen, en zonde is er in Hem niet.
[3:6] Al wie in Hem blijft zondigt niet: al wie zondigt heeft Hem niet gezien, noch gekend.
[3:7] Kinderkens, laat niemand u verleiden. Die de rechtvaardigheid doet die is rechtvaardig, zooals Hij ook rechtvaardig is.
[3:8] Die de zonde doet is uit den duivel, want de duivel zondigt van den beginne. Daartoe is de Zoon van God geopenbaard, opdat Hij de werken des duivels vernielen zou.
[3:9] Al wie uit God geboren is doet geen zonde, omdat Gods zaad in Hem blijft; en hij kan niet zondigen, omdat hij uit God is geboren. 
[3:10]  Daarin zijn de kinderen Gods en de kinderen des duivels te kennen: al wie geen rechtvaardigheid doet die is niet uit God, en die zijn broeder niet bemint.
[3:11] Want dit is de boodschap die gij van den beginne gehoord hebt, dat wij elkander moeten beminnen,
[3:12] niet zooals Kaïn, die uit den booze was en zijn broeder doodsloeg. En om wat reden sloeg hij hem dood? Omdat zijn werken slecht waren en die van zijn broeder rechtvaardig.
[3:13] En verwondert u niet, broeders, als de wereld u haat.
[3:14] Wij weten dat wij zijn overgegaan uit den dood tot het leven, omdat wij de broeders beminnen. Die niet bemint blijft in den dood.
[3:15] Al wie zijn broeder haat is een menschenmoordenaar, en gij weet dat geen menschenmoordenaar eeuwig leven in zich blijvende heeft.
[3:16] Hierin hebben wij de liefde gekend, dat Hij voor ons zijn leven gesteld heeft, en wij zijn schuldig voor de broeders het leven te stellen.
[3:17] Zoo wie dan het goed der wereld heeft en hij ziet zijn broeder gebrek hebben en hij zou zijn gemoed sluiten voor hem, hoe blijft de liefde Gods in Hem? 
[3:18]  Kinderkens, laat ons niet beminnen met woord of tong, maar met der daad en in waarheid.
[3:19] En daarin weten wij dat wij uit de waarheid zijn, en voor zijn aangezicht zullen wij onze harten overtuigen.
[3:20] Want als ons hart ons veroordeelt, God is grooter dan ons hart, en Hij weet alles.
[3:21] Beminden, als ons hart ons niet veroordeelt, dan hebben wij vrijmoedigheid bij God,
[3:22] en zoo wat wij begeeren ontvangen wij van Hem, omdat wij zijn geboden bewaren en doen wat behagelijk is voor zijn aangezicht.
[3:23] En dat is zijn gebod, dat wij gelooven in den Naam van zijn Zoon Jezus Christus en elkander beminnen, zooals Hij ons een gebod gegeven heeft.
[3:24] En die zijn geboden bewaart blijft in God en God, in hem. En daarin weten wij dat Hij in ons blijft, uit den Geest dien Hij ons heeft gegeven.  
[4:1] Beminden, geeft geen geloof aan iederen geest, maar beproeft de geesten of zij uit God zijn, want vele schijnprofeten zijn uitgegaan tot de wereld.
[4:2] Daarin kent gij den Geest Gods: alle geest die Jezus belijdt voor den Christus die in het vleesch gekomen is, die is uit God,
[4:3] en alle geest die Jezus niet belijdt, die is niet uit God. En dat is de geest van den Antichrist, dien gij gehoord hebt dat komt, en hij is nu al in de wereld.
[4:4] Gijlieden zijt uit God, kinderkens, en gij hebt hen overwonnen, omdat Hij die in u is grooter is dan die in de wereld is.
[4:5] Dezen zijn uit de wereld, daarom spreken zij uit de wereld en de wereld hoort hen.
[4:6] Wij zijn uit God. Die God kent hoort ons; die uit God niet is, die hoort ons niet. Daaruit kennen wij den geest der waarheid en den geest der dwaling. 
[4:7]  Beminden, laat ons elkander beminnen, want de liefde is uit God, en al wie bemint is uit God geboren en kent God.
[4:8] Die niet bemint kent God niet, want God is liefde.
[4:9] Daarin is de liefde Gods tot ons geopenbaard, dat God zijn eeniggeboren Zoon gezonden heeft tot de wereld, opdat wij zouden leven door Hem.
[4:10] Daarin is de liefde, niet dat wij God bemind hebben, maar dat Hij ons bemind heeft en dat Hij zijn Zoon gezonden heeft, als zoenoffer voor onze zonden. 
[4:11]  Beminden, als God ons alzoo heeft bemind, dan moeten wij ook malkander beminnen.
[4:12] Niemand heeft ooit God aanschouwd. Als wij elkander beminnen dan blijft God in ons en zijn liefde is in ons volmaakt.
[4:13] Daarin weten wij dat wij in Hem blijven en Hij in ons, omdat Hij ons uit zijn Geest gegeven heeft.
[4:14] En wij hebben aanschouwd en wij getuigen dat de Vader den Zoon gezonden heeft als Verlosser der wereld.
[4:15] Zoo wie belijden zal dat Jezus is de Zoon van God, God blijft in hem en hij in God.
[4:16] En wij hebben gekend en geloofd de liefde die God tot ons heeft. God is liefde, en die in de liefde blijft, die blijft in God en God blijft in hem.
[4:17] Daarin is de liefde bij ons volmaakt, opdat wij vrijmoedigheid mogen hebben in den dag des oordeels; want zooals Hij is zijn ook wij in deze wereld.
[4:18] Vrees is er niet in de liefde, maar de volmaakte liefde werpt de vreeze buiten; want de vrees brengt smart mede, en die vreest is niet volmaakt in de liefde.
[4:19] Wij beminnen omdat Hij ons eerst bemind heeft.
[4:20] Als iemand zou zeggen: ik bemin God, en hij zou zijn broeder haten, dan is hij een leugenaar. Want die zijn broeder niet bemint dien hij gezien heeft, die kan God niet beminnen dien hij niet gezien heeft.
[4:21] En dit gebod hebben wij van Hem, dat hij die God bemint, ook zijn broeder moet beminnen.  
[5:1] Al wie gelooft dat Jezus is de Christus, die is uit God geboren, en al wie bemint dengene die voortgebracht heeft die bemint ook dengene die uit Hem geboren is.
[5:2] Daarin weten wij dat wij de kinderen Gods beminnen, als wij God beminnen en zijn geboden doen.
[5:3] Want dit is de liefde voor God, dat wij zijn geboden bewaren, en zijn geboden zijn niet zwaar. 
[5:4]  Want al wat uit God geboren is overwint de wereld; en dit is de overwinning die de wereld overwint, ons geloof.
[5:5] Wie is het die de wereld overwint, dan alleen hij die gelooft dat Jezus is de Zoon van God?
[5:6] Deze is het die gekomen is door water en bloed, Jezus Christus; niet in het water alleen, maar in het water en in het bloed. En het is de Geest die getuigenis geeft, want de Geest is de waarheid.
[5:7] Want drie zijn er die getuigenis geven in den hemel: de Vader, het Woord en de Heilige Geest en deze drie zijn een.
[5:8] En drie zijn er die getuigenis geven op de aarde; de Geest, en het water en het bloed, en deze drie zijn tot één.
[5:9] Als wij de getuigenis der menschen aannemen, dan is de getuigenis van God meerder; want deze is de getuigenis Gods, die Hij heeft getuigd van zijn Zoon.
[5:10] Die gelooft in den Zoon van God heeft de getuigenis in zich zelven. Die God niet gelooft heeft Hem tot leugenaar gemaakt, omdat hij niet geloofd heeft in de getuigenis die God getuigd heeft van zijn Zoon.
[5:11] En deze is de getuigenis, dat God ons het eeuwige leven gegeven heeft, en dit leven is in zijn Zoon.
[5:12] Die den Zoon heeft die heeft het leven, die den Zoon van God niet heeft die heeft het leven niet.
[5:13] Deze dingen heb ik aan u geschreven, opdat gij zoudt weten dat gij eeuwig leven hebt, gij die gelooft in den Naam des Zoons van God. 
[5:14]  En deze is de vrijmoedigheid die wij tot Hem hebben, dat als wij iets bidden naar zijn wil, Hij ons hoort.
[5:15] En als wij weten dat Hij ons hoort, wat wij ook bidden, dan weten wij dat wij het gevraagde bezitten dat wij van Hem gebeden hebben.
[5:16] Als iemand zijn broeder ziet zondigen een zonde niet tot den dood, dan zal hij bidden, en God zal hem het leven geven voor degenen die niet tot den dood zondigen. Er is een zonde tot den dood; niet voor deze zeg ik dat hij vragen zou.
[5:17] Alle onrechtvaardigheid is zonde, en er is een zonde niet tot den dood. 
[5:18]  Wij weten dat al wie uit God geboren is niet zondigt, maar die uit God geboren is houdt Hem vast en de booze raakt hem niet aan.
[5:19] Wij weten dat wij uit God zijn en dat de geheele wereld in het kwade ligt.
[5:20] Doch wij weten dat de Zoon van God is gekomen, en Hij heeft ons verstand gegeven, opdat wij den Waarachtige zouden kennen; en wij zijn in den Waarachtige, in zijn Zoon Jezus Christus. Deze is de waarachtige God en het eeuwige leven.
[5:21] Kinderkens, wacht u zelven van de afgoden!   

### II John

[1:1] De ouderling, aan Euria, de uitverkorene en aan haar kinderen, die ik in waarheid bemin, en niet alleen ik maar ook allen die de waarheid kennen;
[1:2] ter wille van de waarheid die in ons blijft, en met ons zal blijven tot in eeuwigheid:
[1:3] genade, barmhartigheid, vrede zal met u zijn van God den Vader en van Jezus Christus, den Zoon des Vaders, in waarheid en liefde. 
[1:4]  Ik verblijd mij zeer dat ik er van uw kinderen gevonden heb die wandelen in de waarheid, zooals wij een gebod hebben ontvangen van den Vader.
[1:5] En nu verzoek ik u, Kuria, niet als u een nieuw gebod schrijvende, maar dat wij van den beginne gehad hebben, dat wij malkander beminnen.
[1:6] En dat is de liefde, dat wij naar zijn geboden wandelen; dit is het gebod, zooals gij van den beginne gehoord hebt, dat gij daarin zoudt wandelen. 
[1:7]  Want er zijn veel verleiders in de wereld uitgegaan, die niet belijden dat Jezus Christus in het vleesch komt; deze is de verleider en de Antichrist.
[1:8] Ziet toe voor u zelven, opdat gij niet verliezen zoudt hetgeen wij gearbeid hebben, maar dat gij vollen loon moogt ontvangen.
[1:9] Al wie afwijkt en niet blijft in de leering van den Christus, die heeft God niet; die in de leering blijft, die heeft den Vader en den Zoon.
[1:10] Als iemand tot u komt en deze leering niet brengt, ontvangt hem niet in huis, en zegt tot hem niet: zijt gegroet!
[1:11] Want die tot hem zegt: zijt gegroet! die neemt deel aan zijn slechte werken. 
[1:12]  U veel te schrijven hebbende wilde ik dit niet doen door papier en inkt, maar ik hoop tot u te komen en van mond tot mond te spreken, opdat onze blijdschap volkomen zij.
[1:13] U groeten de kinderen uwer zuster de uitverkorene.   

### III John

[1:1] De ouderling, aan Gajus, den beminde, dien ik in waarheid bemin,
[1:2] Beminde, vóór alle dingen wensch ik dat gij welvaart en gezond zijt, zooals uw ziel welvaart! 
[1:3]  Ik ben zeer verblijd geweest, als er broeders kwamen en getuigenis gaven van uw oprechtheid, zooals gij ook in de waarheid wandelt.
[1:4] Grooter blijdschap toch heb ik niet, dan als ik hoor dat mijn kinderen in de waarheid wandelen.
[1:5] Beminde, gij handelt getrouwelijk in al wat gij doet jegens de broeders en de vreemdelingen,
[1:6] die getuigenis hebben gegeven van uw liefde voor het aangezicht der gemeente; en gij zult wel doen als gij ze helpt op reis, zooals dit Gode waardig is.
[1:7] Want zij zijn uitgegaan voor den Naam, niets nemende van de heidenen.
[1:8] Wij moeten dan dezulken ontvangen, opdat wij medewerkers mogen zijn aan de waarheid. 
[1:9]  Ik heb geschreven aan de gemeente; maar Diotrefes, die over hen meester wil zijn, neemt ons niet aan.
[1:10] Daarom, als ik kom zal ik zijn werken in gedachtenis brengen die hij doet, met slechte woorden tegen ons klappende; en daarmede nog niet tevreden zijnde ontvangt hij zelfs de broeders niet, en hij verhindert die dit zouden willen doen, en werpt ze uit de gemeente. 
[1:11]  Beminde, volgt het kwade niet na, maar het goede. Die goed doet is uit God. Die kwaad doet heeft God niet gezien. 
[1:12]  Aan Demetrius wordt getuigenis gegeven van allen en van de waarheid zelve: en wij geven ook getuigenis en gij weet dat onze getuigenis waarachtig is. 
[1:13]  Ik had u veel te schrijven, maar ik wil u niet schrijven met inkt en pen,
[1:14] doch ik hoop u spoedig te zien, en dan zullen wij van mond tot mond spreken.
[1:15] Vrede zij u! De vrienden groeten u! Groet de vrienden bij name!   

### Jude

[1:1] Judas, een dienaar van Jezus Christus, en broeder van Jakobus, aan de geroepenen, die in God den Vader bemind en door Jezus Christus bewaard zijn:
[1:2] barmhartigheid, en vrede, en liefde zij over ulieden vermenigvuldigd! 
[1:3]  Beminden, alle naarstigheid doende om u te schrijven over onze gemeenschappelijke verlossing, zoo was ik gedrongen om u te schrijven en te vermanen om toch kloek te strijden voor het geloof dat eenmaal aan de heiligen is overgeleverd,
[1:4] want er zijn sommige menschen ingekropen, die vroeger al te voren opgeschreven zijn tot dit oor deel, goddeloos, die de genade van onzen God veranderen in ontuchtigheid en die den eenigen Meester en onzen Heere Jezus Christus verloochenen.
[1:5] Maar ik wil u indachtig maken, u die dit alles eenmaal weet, dat de Heere, die zijn volk uit Egypte verlost had, voor de tweedemaal vernield heeft degenen die niet geloofden;
[1:6] en engelen, die hun eigen waardigheid niet bewaard hebben, maar die hun eigen woning verlaten hebben, heeft Hij in eeuwige boeien onder de duisternis bewaard tot het oordeel van den grooten dag.
[1:7] Gelijk Sodom en Gomorra en de omliggende steden, die op gelijke maniere als dezen hebben gehoereerd en ander vleesch hebben nageloopen, tot een voorbeeld gesteld zijn, dragende tot straf het eeuwig vuur.
[1:8] Zoo ook dezen ingeslapen zijnde verontreinigen het vleesch, en verachten de overheid, en lasteren de machten;
[1:9] terwijl Michael de aartsengel, toen hij met den duivel verschil had, en twistte over het lichaam van Mozes, geen oordeel der lastering tegen hem durfde voortbrengen, maar zeide: de Heere zal u straffen!
[1:10] Doch dezen lasteren al wat zij niet weten, en wat zij van nature weten, als de onredelijke dieren, daarin verderven zij zich zelven.
[1:11] Wee hunner, want den weg van Kaïn zijn zij opgegaan, en door de verleiding van Balaams loon zijn zij omgekomen, en door de oproerigheid van Korach zijn zij verdorven.
[1:12] Dezen zijn schandvlekken in uw liefdemaaltijden, onbevreesd medeaanzittende, zich zelven te goed doende, wolken zonder regen die door den wind omgedreven worden, boomen die in den herfst onvruchtbaar zijn, tweemaal gestorven, ontworteld,
[1:13] woeste baren der zee, hun eigen schande opwerpende, dwalende planeten, voor wie de donkerheid der duisternis tot in eeuwigheid bewaard is.
[1:14] En van dezen heeft ook Enoch, de zevende van Adam, geprofeteerd, zeggende: ziet, de Heer is gekomen met zijn tien duizenden heiligen,
[1:15] om het oordeel uit te voeren tegen allen en om al hun goddeloozen te straffen, vanwege al hun werken van goddeloosheid die zij goddelooslijk gedaan hebben, en vanwege al de smadelijke woorden die de goddelooze zondaars gesproken hebben.
[1:16] Dezen zijn murmureerders die altijd klagen, die wandelen naar hun begeerlijkheden, en wier mond opgeblazen dingen spreekt, den menschen lof toebrengende om des voordeels wil. 
[1:17]  Doch gij, beminden, zijt gedachtig aan de woorden die voorzegd zijn van de apostelen van onzen Heer Jezus Christus,
[1:18] die ulieden zeiden dat er in den laatsten tijd spotters zullen zijn, die naar hun eigen goddelooze begeerlijkheden wandelen.
[1:19] Dezen zijn het die afscheidingen maken, zinnelijke menschen, den Geest niet hebbende.
[1:20] Doch gij, beminden, u zelven opbouwende in uw allerheiligst geloof, biddende in den Heiligen Geest,
[1:21] moet gij u zelven bewaren in de liefde Gods, verwachtende de barmhartigheid van onzen Heere Jezus Christus, ten eeuwigen leven.
[1:22] En hebt medelijden met degenen die onbeslist zijn.
[1:23] Redt anderen, hen uit het vuur trekkende; ontfermt u over nog anderen met vrees, hatende ook zelfs het kleed dat van het vleesch besmet is. 
[1:24]  Hem nu die machtig is u te bewaren van struikelen en u onbevlekt in vreugde te stellen voor het aangezicht zijner glorie,
[1:25] den eenigen God, onzen Verlosser, door Jezus Christus onzen Heere, zij glorie, majesteit, heerschappij en macht door alle eeuwen, en nu en tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen.   

### Revelation of John

[1:1] De openbaring van Jezus Christus, die God Hem gegeven heeft, om aan zijn dienaars te toonen de dingen die haast geschieden moeten; en Hij maakte die bekend en zond die door zijn engel aan zijn dienaar Johannes,
[1:2] die van het woord Gods getuigenis heeft gegeven en van de getuigenis van Jezus Christus, van al wat hij gezien heeft.
[1:3] Zalig hij die leest en zij die hooren de woorden dezer profetie, en die bewaren hetgeen daarin geschreven is, want de tijd is nabij! 
[1:4]  Johannes, aan de zeven gemeenten die in Asië zijn: genade zij ulieden en vrede van Hem die is, en die was, en die komende is, en van de zeven Geesten die voor zijn troon zijn,
[1:5] en van Jezus Christus, den getrouwen Getuige, den Eerstgeborene der dooden en den Overste van de koningen der aarde! — Hem die ons bemint en die ons vrijgemaakt heeft uit onze zonden in zijn bloed,
[1:6] en die ons gemaakt heeft tot een koninkrijk, tot priesters voor God en zijn Vader, — Hem zij de glorie, en de heerschappij tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen.
[1:7] Ziet, Hij komt met de wolken, en alle oog zal Hem zien, ook degenen die Hem doorstoken hebben, en al de geslachten der aarde zullen over Hem weeklagen! Ja. Amen.
[1:8] Ik ben de Alfa en de Omega, — zegt de Heere God— die is, en die was, en die komende is, de Almachtige. 
[1:9]  Ik Johannes— uw broeder en medegenoot in de verdrukking en in het koninkrijk en in de volharding die in Jezus is— ik was in het eiland genaamd Patmos, wegens het woord van God en wegens de getuigenis van Jezus.
[1:10] Ik was in den geest op den dag des Heeren, en ik hoorde achter mij een groote stem als van een trompet, die zeide:
[1:11] Hetgeen gij ziet, schrijf dat in een boek, en zend het aan de zeven gemeenten, die in Asië zijn; naar Efesus, en naar Smyrna, en naar Pergamus, en naar Thyatira, en naar Sardis, en naar Filadelfia, en naar Laodicea. 
[1:12]  En ik wendde mij om te zien de stem die met mij gesproken had. En toen ik mij omwendde zag ik zeven gouden kandelaren,
[1:13] en in het midden der zeven kandelaren een die op een menschenzoon geleek, gekleed in een kleed tot aan de voeten, en omgord aan de borst met een gouden gordel;
[1:14] zijn hoofd en haar waren wit als witte wol, als sneeuw, en zijn oogen als een vlamme vuurs;
[1:15] en zijn voeten waren gelijk aan gloeiend koper, als gloeiend gemaakt in een oven, en zijn stem was als een geluid van vele wateren.
[1:16] En in zijn rechterhand had Hij zeven sterren, en uit zijn mond was een scherp zwaard uitgaande, dat van beide kanten sneed, en zijn aangezicht was zooals de zon schijnt in haar kracht.
[1:17] En toen ik Hem zag viel ik aan zijn voeten als een doode. En Hij leide zijn rechterhand op mij, zeggende: vrees niet, Ik ben de Eerste en de Laatste, en de Levende; 
[1:18] en Ik ben dood geweest en zie, Ik ben levend tot in alle eeuwigheid; en Ik heb de sleutels van den dood en het doodenrijk.
[1:19] Schrijf dan wat gij gezien hebt, en wat is, en wat geschieden zal na dezen:
[1:20] de verborgenheid der zeven sterren die gij gezien hebt in mijn rechterhand, en de zeven gouden kandelaren. De zeven sterren zijn engelen van de zeven gemeenten, en de zeven kandelaren zijn de zeven gemeenten.  
[2:1] Schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Efesus is: Dit zegt Hij die de zeven sterren in zijn rechterhand houdt, die wandelt in het midden der zeven gouden kandelaren:
[2:2] Ik ken uw werken, en uw moeite, en uw volharding, en dat gij de kwaden niet kunt verdragen, en dat gij beproefd hebt degenen die zich zelven apostelen noemen, en het niet zijn, en hebt ze leugenaars bevonden; 
[2:3] en gij hebt volharding, en om mijns Naams wil hebt gij verdragen, en gij zijt niet moede geworden.
[2:4] Maar Ik heb tegen u dat gij uw eerste liefde hebt verlaten.
[2:5] Gedenk dan vanwaar gij zijt uitgevallen, en doe boetvaardigheid en uw eerste werken; want anders overval Ik u en Ik zal uw kandelaar uit zijn plaats wegnemen, als gij geen boetvaardigheid doet.
[2:6] Maar dit hebt gij, dat gij de werken der Nikolaïeten haat, die Ik ook haat.
[2:7] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt aan de gemeenten. Den overwinnaar, dien zal Ik te eten geven van den boom des levens, die in het paradijs van God is. 
[2:8]  En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Smyrna is: Dit zegt de Eerste en de Laatste, die dood was en levend werd:
[2:9] Ik ken uw verdrukking en armoede— doch gij zijt rijk— en de lastering van de zijde dergenen die zich zelven Joden noemen, en het niet zijn, maar een synagoge des Satans zijn ze.
[2:10] Vrees niets van hetgeen gij zult lijden. Zie, de duivel zal er uit ulieden in de gevangenis werpen, opdat gij beproefd zoudt worden, en gij zult een verdrukking hebben van tien dagen. Zijt getrouw tot den dood toe en Ik zal u geven de kroon des levens.
[2:11] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt aan de gemeenten. De overwinnaar, hij zal geenszins beschadigd worden van den tweeden dood. 
[2:12]  En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Pergamus is: Dit zegt Hij die het scherpe zwaard heeft dat van beide kanten snijdt:
[2:13] Ik weet waar gij woont, namelijk daar waar des Satans troon is. En gij bewaart mijn Naam en mijn geloof hebt gij niet verloochend in die dagen toen Antipas, mijn getrouwe getuige was, die gedood is bij ulieden waar de Satan woont.
[2:14] Doch Ik heb eenige dingen tegen u: dat gij er daar hebt die de leering vasthouden van Balaam, die aan Balak leerde om een aanstoot in den weg te werpen voor de kinderen Israels, om hen afgodsoffer te doen eten en te doen hoereeren.
[2:15] Zoo hebt gij er ook die op gelijke wijze de leering der Nikolaïeten vasthouden.
[2:16] Doe boetvaardigheid! want anders overval Ik u haastig en ik zal tegen hen strijden met het zwaard mijns monds.
[2:17] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt tot de gemeenten. Den overwinnaar zal Ik geven van het verborgen Manna, en Ik zal hem geven een witten steen, en op dien steen een nieuwen naam geschreven, dien niemand kent dan die hem ontvangt. 
[2:18]  En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Thyatira is: Dat zegt de Zoon van God, die zijn oogen heeft als een vlamme vuurs, en wiens voeten gelijk zijn aan gloeiend koper:
[2:19] Ik weet uw werken, en liefde, en geloof, en bediening, en volharding, en uw laatste werken, die meer zijn dan de eersten.
[2:20] Maar Ik heb tegen u dat gij de vrouw Jesabel verdraagt, die zich zelve een profetesse noemt en onderwijs geeft, en mijn dienaren vervoert om te hoereeren en afgodsoffer te eten.
[2:21] En Ik heb haar tijd gegeven om boetvaardigheid te doen, en zij heeft niet willen boetvaardigheid doen wegens haar hoererij.
[2:22] Zie, Ik werp haar te bed, en degenen die met haar gehoereerd hebben, tot groote verdrukking, zoo zij geen boetvaardigheid doen wegens hun werken.
[2:23] En haar kinderen zal Ik in den dood ombrengen en al de gemeenten zullen weten dat Ik het ben die nieren en harten doorzoek, en Ik zal ulieden geven een ieder naar zijn werken.
[2:24] Doch Ik zeg tot ulieden, tot de anderen die in Thyatira zijn, zoovelen deze leering niet hebben, die de diepten des Satans niet kennen, zooals zij zeggen: Ik zal op ulieden geen anderen last leggen.
[2:25] Alleenlijk, wat gij hebt houdt dat vast, totdat Ik zal komen!
[2:26] En den overwinnaar en die mijn werken bewaart tot ten einde, dien zal Ik macht geven over de volken,
[2:27] en hij zal ze hoeden met een ijzeren roede, zooals de vaten tot gruis verbrijzeld worden, gelijk Ik zelf de macht van mijn Vader ontvangen heb,
[2:28] en Ik zal hem de morgenster geven.
[2:29] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt tot de gemeenten.  
[3:1] En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Sardis is: Dit zegt Hij die de zeven Geesten Gods heeft en de zeven sterren: Ik weet uw werken, dat gij den naam hebt dat gij leeft, en gij zijt dood.
[3:2] Zijt wakker, en versterk het overige dat gaat sterven; want ik heb uw werken niet vol gevonden voor het aangezicht van mijn God.
[3:3] Gedenk dan hoe gij het ontvangen en gehoord hebt, en bewaar het, en doe boetvaardigheid. Indien gij dan niet zult waken, zal Ik komen als een dief, en gij zult geenszins weten in welke ure Ik u overvallen zal.
[3:4] Maar eenige weinige namen hebt gij in Sardis, die hun kleederen niet besmet hebben, en die zullen met Mij wandelen in witte kleederen, omdat zij het waardig zijn.
[3:5] De overwinnaar zal aldus in witte kleederen gekleed worden, en Ik zal zijn naam geenszins uitwisschen uit het boek des levens, en Ik zal zijn naam belijden voor het aangezicht mijns Vaders en voor het aangezicht zijner engelen.
[3:6] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt tot de gemeenten. 
[3:7]  En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Filadelfia is: Dit zegt de Heilige, de Waarachtige, die den sleutel Davids heeft, die opendoet en niemand zal sluiten, en die sluit en niemand doet open.
[3:8] Ik weet uw werken; zie, Ik heb voor uw aangezicht een geopende deur gegeven, die niemand kan sluiten; want gij hebt kleine kracht, en gij hebt mijn woord bewaard, en mijn Naam niet verloochend.
[3:9] Zie, Ik geef er u uit de synagoge des Satans, van degenen die zich zelven zeggen Joden te zijn, en het niet zijn, maar liegen; zie, Ik zal hen doen komen en doen nederbuigen voor uw voeten, en zij zullen weten dat Ik u bemin.
[3:10] Omdat gij het woord mijner volharding bewaard hebt, zoo zal Ik ook u bewaren uit de ure der bekoring, die zal komen over de geheele aarde, om te bekoren degenen die op de aarde wonen.
[3:11] Ik kom haastig! houd vast wat gij hebt, opdat niemand uw kroon neme!
[3:12] Den overwinnaar zal Ik maken tot een pilaar in den tempel mijns Gods, en hij zal daar geenszins meer uitgaan: en Ik zal op hem schrijven den Naam mijns Gods, en den naam van de stad mijns Gods, van het nieuwe Jerusalem, dat nederdalende is uit den hemel van mijn God, en. ook mijn nieuwen Naam.
[3:13] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt tot de gemeenten. 
[3:14]  En schrijf aan den engel der gemeente die in Laodicea is: Dit zegt de Amen, de getrouwe en waarachtige Getuige, het Begin der schepping Gods:
[3:15] Ik weet uw werken, dat gij noch koud zijt noch heet. Och, dat gij koud waart of heet!
[3:16] Zoo dan, omdat gij lauw zijt, en noch heet noch koud, Ik zal u uit mijn mond spuwen.
[3:17] Want gij zegt: ik ben rijk en verrijkt, en ik heb aan niets gebrek; en gij weet niet dat gij zijt de ellendige en ongelukkige, en arme en blinde en naakte.
[3:18] Ik raad u van Mij te koopen goud, dat door vuur beproefd is, opdat gij rijk wordt, en witte kleederen, opdat de schande uwer naaktheid bekleed en niet openbaar zij; en balsem om uw oogen te balsemen, opdat gij zien zoudt.
[3:19] Ik tuchtig en straf zoovelen als Ik bemin; zijt dan ijverig en doe boetvaardigheid.
[3:20] Zie, Ik sta bij de deur en Ik klop. Als iemand mijn stem hoort en de deur opendoet, dan zal Ik tot hem binnen komen en met hem maaltijd houden, en hij met Mij.
[3:21] Den overwinnaar, hem zal Ik geven te zitten met Mij in mijn troon, zooals Ik ook, heb overwonnen en gezeten ben met mijn Vader in zijn troon.
[3:22] Die een oor heeft, hij hoore wat de Geest zegt tot de gemeenten.  
[4:1] Na dezen zag ik, en zie, een geopende deur in den hemel. En de eerste stem die ik gehoord had als van een trompet, die sprak met mij, zeggende: Klim hier op en Ik zal u toonen wat na dezen geschieden moet!
[4:2] Terstond werd ik in den geest, en zie er was een troon gezet in den hemel, en Een zat er op den troon.
[4:3] En die daar zat was gelijk aan een jaspis–steen, en een sardins, en er was een regenboog rond den troon, gelijk aan een smaragd. 
[4:4]  En rond den troon zag ik vier en twintig troonen, en op de troonen vier en twintig ouderlingen gezeten, gekleed in witte kleederen, en op hun hoofden gouden kroonen.
[4:5] En uit den troon gingen bliksemen, en stemmen, en donderslagen. En zeven fakkels van vuur waren brandende vóór den troon; die zijn de zeven Geesten Gods.
[4:6] En vóór den troon was als een zee van glas, als kristal; en in het midden van den troon en rond den troon waren vier levende wezens, vol oogen van voren en van achter.
[4:7] En het eerste levende wezen was gelijk aan een leeuw, en het tweede levende wezen gelijk aan een kalf, en het derde levende wezen had het aangezicht als van een mensch, en het vierde levende wezen was gelijk aan een vliegenden arend.
[4:8] En de vier levende wezens, die ieder afzonderlijk zes vleugelen hadden, waren rondom en van binnen vol oogen; en dag en nacht hebben zij geen rust, zeggende: heilig, heilig, heilig, de Heere God, de Almachtige, die was, en die is, en die komende is!
[4:9] En als de levende wezens glorie en eer en dankzegging zullen geven aan Hem die op den troon zit, den Levende tot in alle eeuwigheid,
[4:10] dan zullen de vier en twintig ouderlingen nedervallen vóór dengene die op den troon zit, en zullen aanbidden den Levende tot in alle eeuwigheid, en zullen hun kroonen nederwerpen voor het aangezicht van den troon, zeggende:
[4:11] Waardig zijt Gij, onze Heer en God! om te aanvaarden de glorie, en de eere, en de kracht; want Gij hebt alle dingen geschapen, en door uw wil bestaan zij en zijn zij geschapen.  
[5:1] En ik zag aan de rechterhand van dengene die op den troon zat een boek, beschreven van binnen en van achter, verzegeld met zeven zegels.
[5:2] En ik zag een sterken engel, die uitriep met een groote stem: wie is er waardig om dit boek open te doen en zijn zegelen los te maken?
[5:3] En niemand, in den hemel, of op de aarde, of onder de aarde, kon het boek opendoen of het inzien.
[5:4] En ik weende zeer, omdat niemand waardig bevonden was om het boek open te doen of het in te zien.
[5:5] En een uit de ouderlingen zeide tot mij: ween niet! zie, de Leeuw die uit den stam van Juda is, de Spruite Davids, heeft overwonnen, om het boek open te doen en zijn zeven zegelen. 
[5:6]  En ik zag in het midden des troons en der vier levende wezens, en in het midden der ouderlingen, een Lam staan als geslacht, dat zeven hoornen had en zeven oogen; deze zijn de zeven Geesten Gods, die zijn uitgezonden tot de geheele aarde.
[5:7] En het kwam en nam het boek uit de rechterhand van Hem die op den troon zat. 
[5:8]  En als het dat boek genomen had, vielen de vier levende wezens en de vier en twintig ouderlingen voor het aangezicht van het Lam, hebbende ieder een harp en gouden schalen, vol van reukwerk, dat zijn de gebeden der heiligen.
[5:9] En zij zongen een nieuw lied, zeggende: Gij zijt waardig om het boek te nemen en zijn zegelen open te doen, want Gij zijt geslacht en hebt Gode gekocht door uw bloed, menschen uit alle geslacht en taal en volk en natie,
[5:10] en Gij hebt hen voor onzen God gemaakt tot een koninkrijk en tot priesters, en zij zullen regeeren op de aarde.
[5:11] En ik zag en hoorde als een stem van vele engelen rondom den troon en de levende wezens en de ouderlingen, en hun getal was tien duizendmaal tien duizenden en duizenden van duizenden,
[5:12] zeggende met een groote stem: Waardig is het Lam dat geslacht is om te aanvaarden de macht, en rijkdom, en wijsheid, en kracht, en eerbied, en glorie, en dankzegging!
[5:13] En alle schepsel dat in den hemel is, en op de aarde, en onder de aarde, en op de zee, en al wat daarin is, hoorde ik ook zeggen: aan Hem die op den troon zit, en aan het Lam, zij de dankzegging, en de eerbied, en de glorie, en de heerschappij, tot in alle eeuwigheid!
[5:14] En de vier levende wezens zeiden: Amen! En de ouderlingen vielen neder en aanbaden.  
[6:1] En ik zag dat het Lam een uit de zeven zegelen opendeed, en ik hoorde een uit de vier levende wezens spreken als met een donderstem: Kom en zie!
[6:2] En ik zag en zie, een wit paard, en die daarop zat had een boog; en hem werd een kroon gegeven, en hij ging uit als overwinnaar en om te overwinnen. 
[6:3]  En als het Lam het tweede zegel opendeed, hoorde ik het tweede levende wezen zeggen Kom en zie!
[6:4] En er kwam een ander paard uit dat rossig was; en aan dengene die daarop zat werd de macht gegeven om den vrede van de aarde te nemen en opdat zij elkander zouden dooden, en aan hem werd een groot zwaard gegeven. 
[6:5]  En als het Lam het derde zegel opendeed, hoorde ik het derde levende wezen zeggen: Kom en zie! En ik zag en zie, een zwart paard, en die daarop zat had een weegschaal in de hand.
[6:6] En ik hoorde als een stem in het midden der vier levende wezens, die zeide: een maatje tarwe voor een penning, en drie maatjes gerst voor een penning; en de olie en den wijn moogt gij niet beschadigen! 
[6:7]  En als het Lam het vierde zegel opendeed, hoorde ik de stem van het vierde levende wezen zeggen: Kom en zie!
[6:8] En ik zag en zie, een vaal paard, en die daarop zat, zijn naam was de Dood, en het doodenrijk volgde met hem. En aan dezen werd macht gegeven over het vierde deel der aarde, om te dooden met het zwaard, en met den honger, en met den dood, en door de wilde beesten der aarde. 
[6:9]  En toen het Lam het vijfde zegel opendeed, zag ik beneden onder den altaar de zielen dergenen die gedood waren om het woord Gods en om de getuigenis die zij behielden,
[6:10] en zij riepen met een groote stem, zeggende: Tot wanneer, o heilige en waarachtige Meester, oordeelt en wreekt Gij ons bloed niet, van degenen die op de aarde wonen?
[6:11] En aan ieder van hen werd een wit overkleed gegeven, en hun werd gezegd dat zij nog een korten tijd rustig moesten zijn, totdat ook hun mededienaars en hun broeders, die zouden gedood worden zooals ook zij, den loop zouden vervuld hebben. 
[6:12]  En ik zag, toen het Lam het zesde zegel opendeed, en er werd een groote aardbeving; en de zon werd zwart als een haren zak, en de geheele maan werd als bloed,
[6:13] en de sterren des hemels vielen op de aarde, zooals een vijgeboom die zijn onrijpe vijgen afwerpt als hij door een sterken wind geschud wordt;
[6:14] en de hemel is verdwenen zooals een boek dat in een gerold is, en alle berg en eiland is uit zijn plaats bewogen!
[6:15] en de koningen der aarde, en de vorsten, en de legeroversten, en de rijken, en de machtigen, en alle dienstknecht en vrije, verborgen zich zelven in de spelonken en in de rotsen der bergen,
[6:16] en zeiden tot de bergen en tot de rotsen: valt op ons en verbergt ons van het aangezicht van Hem die op den troon zit en van de gramschap des Lams!
[6:17] Want de groote dag hunner gramschap is gekomen, en wie kan bestaan?  
[7:1] En daarna zag ik vier engelen staan aan de vier hoeken der aarde, die de vier winden der aarde terug hielden, opdat er geen wind zou waaien op de aarde, noch op de zee, noch op eenigen boom. 
[7:2]  En ik zag een anderen engel opkomen van den opgang der zon, die het zegel van den levenden God had, en hij riep met een groote stem tot de vier engelen aan wie de macht gegeven was om de aarde en de zee te beschadigen,
[7:3] zeggende: beschadigt de aarde niet, noch de zee, noch de boomen, totdat wij de dienaren van onzen God zullen verzegeld hebben op hun voorhoofden! 
[7:4]  En ik hoorde het getal der verzegelden: honderd vier en veertig duizend, verzegelden uit elken stam der zonen Israels.
[7:5] Uit den stam van Juda twaalf duizend verzegelden; uit den stam van Ruben twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Gad twaalf duizend;
[7:6] Uit den stam van Aser twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Naftali twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Manasse twaalf duizend;
[7:7] uit den stam van Simeon twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Levi twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Issaschar twaalf duizend;
[7:8] uit den stam van Zebulon twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Jozef twaalf duizend; uit den stam van Benjamin twaalf duizend verzegelden. 
[7:9]  Na dezen zag ik, en ziet, een groote menigte, die niemand tellen kon, uit alle volk, en stammen, en natiën en talen, staande voor den troon en voor het Lam, gekleed in witte overkleederen, en palmtakken waren in hun handen.
[7:10] En zij riepen met een groote stem, zeggende: de verlossing zij onzen Gode die op den troon zit, en het Lam!
[7:11] En al de engelen stonden rond den troon en rond de ouderlingen en de vier levende wezens, en zij vielen voor den troon op hun aangezichten en aanbaden God,
[7:12] zeggende: Amen! De lofzegging, en de glorie, en de wijsheid, en de dankzeging, en de eerbied, en de macht, en de sterkte, zij onzen God tot in alle eeuwigheid! Amen. 
[7:13]  En een uit de ouderlingen antwoordde en zeide tot mij: dezen, die gekleed zijn in de witte kleederen, wie zijn ze, en vanwaar zijn ze gekomen?
[7:14] En ik zeide tot hem: heer, gij weet het! En hij zeide tot mij: dezen zijn het, die uit de groote verdrukking komen, en zij hebben hun overkleederen gewasschen, en die wit gemaakt in het bloed des Lams.
[7:15] Daarom zijn zij voor den troon van God, en dienen Hem dag en nacht in zijn tempel, en die op den troon zit zal zijn tent over hen uitspannen.
[7:16] Zij zullen geen honger meer hebben noch dorst meer hebben, en ook zal op hen de zon niet vallen noch eenige hitte,
[7:17] want het Lam, dat in het midden van den troon is, zal hen weiden en zal hen leiden langs fonteinen van wateren des levens; en God zal iederen traan van hun oogen afwisschen.  
[8:1] En toen het Lam het zevende zegel opendeed, ontstond er een stilte in den hemel, van omtrent een half uur. 
[8:2]  En ik zag de zeven engelen die voor Gods aangezicht staan, en aan hen werden zeven trompetten gegeven. 
[8:3]  En een ander engel kwam en stond hij den altaar, hebbende een gouden wierookvat; en aan hem werd veel reukwerk gegeven, opdat hij dit met de gebeden van alle heiligen zou leggen op den gouden altaar die voor het aangezicht van den troon was.
[8:4] En de rook van het reukwerk klom op met de gebeden der heiligen, uit de hand des engels, voor Gods aangezicht.
[8:5] En de engel nam het wierookvat, en vulde dat van het vuur des altaars, en wierp het naar de aarde; en er geschiedden donderslagen en stemmen, en bliksemen, en aardbeving. 
[8:6]  En de zeven engelen, die de zeven trompetten hadden, maakten zich gereed om te trompetten.
[8:7] En de eerste engel heeft getrompet; en er ontstond hagel en vuur, gemengd met bloed, en het werd naar de aarde geworpen; en het derde deel der aarde is verbrand, en het derde deel der boomen is verbrand, en al het groene kruid is verbrand. 
[8:8]  En de tweede engel heeft getrompet; en er werd als een groote berg brandende van vuur in de zee geworpen; en het derde deel der zee werd bloed,
[8:9] en het derde deel der schepselen, die leven hebben in de zee, stierven, en het derde deel der schepen is vergaan. 
[8:10]  En de derde engel heeft getrompet; en er viel uit den hemel een groote ster, brandende als een fakkel, en zij viel op het derde deel der rivieren en op de fonteinen der wateren.
[8:11] En de naam der ster wordt genoemd Alsem; en het derde deel der wateren werd tot alsem, en velen van de menschen stierven door de wateren, omdat zij bitter geworden waren. 
[8:12]  En de vierde engel heeft getrompet; en het derde deel der zon werd geslagen, en het derde deel der maan, en het derde deel der sterren, opdat het derde deel van dezen zou verduisterd zijn, en dat het derde deel van den dag niet zou schijnen, en de nacht evenzoo.
[8:13] En ik zag en ik hoorde een arend vliegen door het midden des hemels, zeggende met een groote stem: wee, wee, wee, dengenen die op de aarde wonen vanwege de overige trompetstemmen van de drie engelen die nog zullen trompetten!  
[9:1] En de vijfde engel heeft getrompet; en ik zag een ster uit den hemel gevallen naar de aarde, en aan haar werd de sleutel gegeven van den put des afgronds.
[9:2] En zij deed den put des afgronds open; en er kwam rook op uit den afgrond, als rook van een grooten oven, en de zon en de lucht werden verduisterd door den rook des afgronds.
[9:3] En uit den rook kwamen sprinkhanen naar de aarde, en aan dezen werd macht gegeven, zooals de schorpioenen der aarde macht hebben.
[9:4] En aan hen werd gezegd dat zij het gras der aarde niet zouden beschadigen, noch eenig groen, noch eenigen boom, maar wel de menschen die niet het zegel van God op hun voorhoofden hebben.
[9:5] En aan hen werd de macht gegeven, niet om die te dooden maar om hen te pijnigen, vijf maanden lang; en hun pijniging was als de pijniging van een schorpioen, als hij een mensch steekt.
[9:6] En in die dagen zullen de menschen den dood zoeken en zullen dien niet vinden, en zij zullen begeeren te sterven en de dood zal van hen vluchten.
[9:7] En de gedaante der sprinkhanen was gelijk aan paarden die toegerust zijn tot den oorlog, en op hun hoofden waren als kroonen gelijk van goud, en hun aangezichten waren als aangezichten van menschen;
[9:8] en zij hadden haren als haren van vrouwen, en hun tanden waren als van leeuwen;
[9:9] en zij hadden harnassen als harnassen van ijzer, en het gedruisch hunner vleugelen was als een gedruisch van wagenen, van vele paarden die naar den oorlog loopen;
[9:10] en zij hadden staarten gelijk aan schorpioenen en angels, en in hun staarten is hun macht om de menschen te beschadigen, vijf maanden.
[9:11] Zij hadden tot hun koning den engel des afgronds, wiens naam in het Hebreeuwsch is Abaddon, en in het Grieksch is zijn naam Apollyon.
[9:12] Het eene wee is voorbij; ziet, er komen nog twee weeën na dezen! 
[9:13]  En de zesde engel heeft getrompet; en ik hoorde een stem uit de vier hoornen van den gouden altaar die voor Gods aangezicht is,
[9:14] zeggende tot den zesden engel, die de trompet hield: maak de vier engelen los, die gebonden zijn bij de groote rivier den Eufraat!
[9:15] En de vier engelen werden losgemaakt, die gereed waren tegen de ure en den dag en de maand en het jaar, opdat zij het derde deel der menschen zouden dooden.
[9:16] En het getal dergenen die te paard streden was tweemaal tienduizendmaal tienduizenden. Ik hoorde hun getal.
[9:17] En aldus zag ik de paarden in het visioen, en degenen die daarop zaten, die vurige, en hemelsblauwe, en sulferkleurige harnassen hadden; en de koppen der paarden waren als koppen van leeuwen, en uit hun monden gingen vuur en rook en sulfer.
[9:18] Van deze drie plagen werd het derde deel der menschen gedood, door het vuur, en den rook en het sulfer, die uit hun bekken gingen.
[9:19] Want de macht der paarden is in hun mond en in hun staarten. Want hun staarten zijn gelijk aan slangen, en hebben koppen, en daarmede beschadigen zij.
[9:20] En de overigen van de menschen, die niet gedood waren in deze plagen, hebben geen boetvaardigheid gedaan over de werken hunner handen, opdat zij niet zouden nederbuigen voor de booze geesten, en de afgoden van goud en van zilver en van koper en van steen en van hout, die noch zien kunnen, noch hooren, noch gaan.
[9:21] En zij hebben geen boetvaardigheid gedaan over hun doodslagen, noch over hun tooverijen, noch over hun hoererijen, noch over hun diefstallen.  
[10:1] En ik zag een anderen sterken engel uit den hemel afkomen, bekleed met een wolk, en de regenboog was op zijn hoofd, en zijn aangezicht was als de zon, en zijn voeten als kolommen van vuur;
[10:2] en in zijn hand had hij een open boeksken. En hij zette zijn rechtervoet op de zee, en den linker op de aarde,
[10:3] en hij riep met een groote stem gelijk een leeuw brult. En toen hij geroepen had lieten de zeven donderslagen hun stem hooren.
[10:4] En toen de zeven donderslagen gesproken hadden, wilde ik schreven. En ik hoorde een stem uit den hemel zeggende: verzegel wat de zeven donderslagen hebben gesproken en schrijf dat niet op!
[10:5] En de engel, dien ik zag staan op de zee en op de aarde, hief zijn rechterhand op naar den hemel,
[10:6] en hij zwoer bij den Levende tot in alle eeuwigheid, die den hemel en wat daarin is geschapen heeft, de aarde en wat daarin is, en de zee en wat daarin is, dat er geen tijd meer zijn zal,
[10:7] maar dat in de dagen der stem van den zevenden engel, als hij zal trompetten, alsdan de verborgenheid Gods zal vervuld worden, zooals Hij verkondigd heeft aan zijn eigen dienaren, de profeten.
[10:8] En de stem, die ik uit den hemel gehoord had, sprak wederom met mij en zeide: ga heen, neem het geopende boeksken dat in de hand is van den engel die op de zee en op de aarde staat!
[10:9] En ik ging tot den engel, zeggende tot hem: geef mij het boeksken. En hij zeide tot mij: neem het en eet het op! en het zal uw ingewand bitter maken maar in uw mond zal het zoet zijn als honig.
[10:10] En ik nam het boeksken uit de hand des engels en ik at het op. En het was in mijn mond als honig zoo zoet, en als ik het opgegeten had werd mijn ingewand bitter.
[10:11] En hij zeide tot mij: gij zult wederom moeten profeteeren over vele volken, en natiën, en talen, en koningen.  
[11:1] En aan mij werd een rietstok gegeven, gelijk een meetroede, en tot mij werd gezegd: sta op en meet den tempel Gods en den altaar, en degenen die daarin aanbidden!
[11:2] En het voorhof, dat buiten den tempel is, laat dat uit en meet dat niet, want dat is aan de volken gegeven, en de heilige stad zullen zij vertreden, twee en veertig maanden.
[11:3] En ik zal aan mijn twee getuigen geven om te profeteeren, duizend twee honderd en zestig dagen, in zakken gekleed.
[11:4] Deze zijn de twee olijfboomen, en de twee kandelaars, die staan voor het aangezicht van den Heere der aarde.
[11:5] En als iemand hen wil beschadigen, dan zal er vuur uit hun mond gaan en hun vijanden verteeren; en als iemand hen zal willen beschadigen, die moet alzoo gedood worden.
[11:6] Dezen hebben macht om den hemel te sluiten, opdat er geen regen valle in de dagen hunner profeteering; en zij hebben macht over de wateren, om die in bloed te veranderen, en om de aarde te slaan met allerlei plage, zoo dikwijls zij zullen willen.
[11:7] En als zij hun getuigenis zullen geëindigd hebben, dan zal het beest, dat uit den afgrond opkomt, met hen oorlog voeren, en hen overwinnen en hen dooden.
[11:8] En hun lijken zullen liggen op de straat der groote stad, die geestelijk genoemd wordt Sodom en Egypte, waar ook hun Heere gekruisigd is.
[11:9] En menschen uit de volken, en stammen, en talen, en natiën, zullen hun lijken zien, drie en een halven dag, en zij zullen niet toelaten dat hun lijken in een graf worden gelegd.
[11:10] En die op de aarde wonen zullen over hen vroolijk zijn en verheugd, en zij zullen aan malkander geschenken zenden, omdat die twee profeten geplaagd hadden degenen die op de aarde wonen.
[11:11] En na die drie en een halven dag kwam de adem des levens uit God in hen; en zij stonden op hun voeten, en een groote vreeze viel op degenen die hen zagen.
[11:12] En zij hoorden een groote stem uit den hemel, die tot hen zeide: klimt hier op! — En zij klommen op naar den hemel in de wolk, en hun vijanden zagen hen.
[11:13] En in die zelfde ure geschiedde er een groote aardbeving; en het tiende deel der stad viel omver, en in die aardbeving stierven er zeven duizend namen van menschen; en de overigen werden bevreesd en gaven glorie aan den God des hemels.
[11:14] Het tweede wee is voor bij; ziet, het derde wee komt haastig! 
[11:15]  En de zevende engel heeft getrompet; en er geschiedden groote stemmen in den hemel, zeggende: het koninkrijk der wereld is geworden van onzen Heere en van zijn Christus, en Hij zal heerschen tot in alle eeuwigheid!
[11:16] En de vier en twintig ouderlingen, die voor Gods aangezicht zijn, zittende op hun troonen, vielen op hun aangezichten en aanbaden God,
[11:17] zeggende: wij danken U, Heere God, de Almachtige, die is en die was, dat Gij uw groote macht hebt genomen en als Koning hebt geheerscht;
[11:18] en de volken waren toornig geworden, en uw gramschap is gekomen, en de tijd der dooden om geoordeeld te worden en om den loon te geven aan uw dienaren de profeten, en aan de heiligen, en aan degenen die uw Naam vreezen, aan de kleinen en de grooten, en om te verderven degenen die de aarde verdierven!
[11:19] En de tempel Gods die in den hemel is werd opengedaan, en de ark zijns verbonds werd gezien in zijn tempel, en er geschiedden bliksemen, en stemmen, en donderslagen, en een aardbeving, en een groote hagel.  
[12:1] En een groot teeken werd gezien in den hemel; een vrouw bekleed met de zon, en de maan onder haar voeten, en op haar hoofd een kroon van twaalf sterren;
[12:2] en zwanger zijnde, riep zij, in barensnood zijnde, en in de pijn der verlossing.
[12:3] En er werd een ander teeken gezien in den hemel, en ziet, een groote rosse draak, hebbende zeven koppen en tien hoornen, en op zijn koppen zeven kroonen.
[12:4] En zijn staart trok het derde deel der sterren van den hemel, en wierp die op de aarde. En de draak stond voor het aangezicht der vrouw, die baren zou, om het kind te verslinden als zij het gebaard zou hebben.
[12:5] En zij baarde een mannelijken zoon, die al de volken zou hoeden met een ijzeren roede. En haar kind werd weggerukt tot God en tot zijn troon.
[12:6] En de vrouw vluchtte naar de woestijn, alwaar zij een plaats had van God toebereid, opdat zij daar haar voeden zouden, duizend twee honderd en zestig dagen. 
[12:7]  En er ontstond een oorlog in den hemel; Michael en zijn engelen voerden oorlog met den draak. En de draak voerde ook oorlog en zijn engelen;
[12:8] en zij konden er niet tegen op, en hun plaats werd niet meer gevonden in den hemel.
[12:9] En de groote draak, de oude slang, die genoemd wordt duivel en Satanas, die de geheele wereld verleidt, is geworpen: hij is geworpen op de aarde en zijn engelen zijn met hem geworpen. 
[12:10]  En ik hoorde een groote stem in den hemel zeggen: nu is de verlossing, en de kracht, en het koninkrijk van onzen God en de macht van zijn Christus want de aanklager van onze broeders, die hen dag en nacht voor Gods aangezicht aanklaagde, is nedergeworpen.
[12:11] En zij hebben hem overwonnen door het bloed van het Lam en door het woord hunner getuigenis, en zij hebben hun leven niet liefgehad tot den dood toe.
[12:12] Daarom verblijdt u, o hemelen en die daarin woont! Wee de aarde en de zee, want de duivel is tot u afgekomen, hebbende een groote gramschap, wetende dat hij maar korten tijd heeft! 
[12:13]  En toen de draak zag dat hij naar de aarde geworpen was, vervolgde hij de vrouw die den mannelijken zoon gebaard had.
[12:14] En aan de vrouw zijn de twee vleugelen van den grooten arend gegeven, opdat zij vliegen zou naar de woestijn, naar haar plaats, alwaar zij gevoed wordt een tijd, en tijden, en een halven tijd, van voor het aangezicht der slang.
[12:15] En de slang wierp uit haar mond achter de vrouw water als een rivier, om haar door de rivier te doen wegvoeren.
[12:16] En de aarde kwam de vrouw te hulp, en de aarde opende haar mond en verzwolg de rivier die de draak uit zijn muil geworpen had. 
[12:17]  En de draak werd vol gramschap tegen de vrouw, en hij ging om oorlog te voeren met de anderen van haar nakomelingen, die de geboden Gods bewaren en de getuigenis van Jezus hebben.
[12:18] En hij ging staan bij den oever der zee,  
[13:1] En ik zag uit de zee een beest opkomen, dat tien hoornen had en zeven koppen, en op zijn hoornen tien diademen, en op zijn koppen namen van lastering.
[13:2] En het beest dat ik zag was als een pardel, en zijn pooten als van een beer, en zijn muil was als een leeuwenmuil; en de draak gaf het zijn macht en zijn troon en groote kracht.
[13:3] en een van zijn koppen zag ik als tot den dood toe gewond, en zijn doodelijke wonde werd genezen. En de geheele aarde verwonderde zich achter het beest;
[13:4] en zij aanbaden den draak, omdat hij de macht aan het beest gegeven had, en zij aanbaden het beest, zeggende: wie is gelijk aan dit beest, en wie kan daarmee oorlog voeren?
[13:5] En er werd aan het beest een muil gegeven om groote dingen en lasteringen te spreken, en het werd macht gegeven om dit te doen twee en veertig maanden.
[13:6] En het opende zijn muil tot lasteringen tegen God, om zijn Naam te lasteren, en zijn tabernakel, en degenen die in den hemel wonen.
[13:7] En aan het beest werd gegeven om oorlog te voeren met de heiligen en om hen te overwinnen; en het werd macht gegeven over alle stam, en volk, en taal, en natie.
[13:8] En allen die op de aarde wonen zullen het aanbidden, wier naam niet geschreven is in het boek des levens des Lams, dat geslacht is van de grondlegging der wereld af.
[13:9] Als iemand een oor heeft, dat hij hoore!
[13:10] Als iemand naar de gevangenis leidt, die gaat naar de gevangenis; als iemand met het zwaard zal dooden, die moet zelf met het zwaard gedood worden. Hier is de volharding en het geloof der heiligen. 
[13:11]  En ik zag een ander beest opkomen uit de aarde en het had twee hoornen, gelijk aan een lam en het sprak als een draak.
[13:12] En het oefent al de macht uit van het eerste beest voor zijn aangezicht, en het maakt dat de aarde en degenen die er op wonen zich nederbuigen voor het eerste beest, welks doodelijke wonde genezen was.
[13:13] En het doet groote teekenen, zoodat het zelfs vuur uit den hemel doet afdalen naar de aarde, voor het aangezicht der menschen.
[13:14] En het bedriegt degenen die op de aarde wonen door de teekenen die het gegeven zijn om te doen voor het aangezicht van het dier, zeggende tot degenen die op de aarde wonen, dat zij een beeld zouden maken voor het beest, dat de wonde van het zwaard had en toch in leven was.
[13:15] En het werd aan hetzelve gegeven om aan het beeld van het beest een geest te geven, zoodat zelfs het beeld van het beest zou spreken en maken dat zoude gedood worden al wie zich niet nederbuigen zou voor het beeld van het beest.
[13:16] En het maakt dat aan allen, aan de kleinen en de grooten, en aan de rijken en aan de armen, en aan de vrijen en aan de dienstbaren, een merkteeken gegeven worde, op hun rechterhand of op hun voorhoofd;
[13:17] en dat niemand kan koopen of verkoopen dan alleen die het merkteeken, den naam van het beest heeft, of het getal van zijn naam.
[13:18] Hier is de wijsheid. Die verstand heeft berekene het getal van het beest; want het is een getal van een mensch. En zijn getal is 666.  
[14:1] En ik zag, en ziet, het Lam, staande op den berg Sions, en met Hem honderd vier en veertig duizend, hebbende zijn Naam en den Naam zijns Vaders geschreven op hun voorhoofden.
[14:2] En ik hoorde een stem uit den hemel als een stem van vele wateren, en als een stem van een grooten donderslag; en de stem die ik hoorde was als van citerspelers die op hun citer speelden.
[14:3] En zij zongen een nieuw lied voor het aangezicht van den troon en voor het aangezicht van de vier levende wezens, en van de ouderlingen. En niemand kon dat lied leeren, dan alleen de honderd vier en veertig duizend, die gekocht waren van de aarde.
[14:4] Dezen zijn het die met vrouwen niet bevlekt zijn, want zij zijn maagden. Dezen zijn zij, die het Lam volgen waar het ook heengaat. Dezen zijn gekocht van uit de menschen, een eersteling voor God en het Lam.
[14:5] En in hun mond is geen leugen gevonden, want zij zijn onberispelijk. 
[14:6]  En ik zag een anderen engel, vliegende door het midden des hemels, hebbende het eeuwig Evangelie, om te verkondigen onder degenen die op de aarde wonen, en onder alle natie, en stam, en taal, en volk,
[14:7] zeggende met een groote stem: vreest God en geeft Hem glorie, want de ure zijns oordeels is gekomen, en buigt u neder voor Hem die gemaakt heeft, den hemel, en de aarde, en de zee, en de fonteinen der wateren! 
[14:8]  En een ander, een tweede engel, is gevolgd, die zeide: Gevallen, gevallen, is het groote Babylon! dat van den wijn der gramschap zijner hoererij al de volken heeft dronken gemaakt! 
[14:9]  En een ander, een derde engel, is hen gevolgd, zeggende met een groote stem: als iemand nederbuigt voor het beest en zijn beeld, en het merkteeken ontvangt op zijn voorhoofd of op zijn hand,
[14:10] die zal ook zelf drinken van den wijn der gramschap Gods, die ongemengd is ingeschonken in den beker zijns toorns; en hij zal gepijnigd worden met vuur en sulfer, voor het aangezicht der heilige engelen en voor het aangezicht des Lams!
[14:11] En de rook hunner pijniging klimt op tot in alle eeuwigheid, en zij hebben geen rust dag en nacht die voor het beest en voor zijn beeld nederknielen, en als iemand het merkteeken zijns naams ontvangt!
[14:12] Hier is de volharding der heiligen, die de geboden Gods bewaren en het geloof van Jezus. 
[14:13]  En ik hoorde een stem uit den hemel die zeide: Schrijf: zalig de dooden die in den Heere sterven! Van nu af zegt de Geest: ja zij zullen rusten van hun arbeid, want hun werken volgen met hen! 
[14:14]  En ik zag, en ziet, een witte wolk, en op de wolk een gezeten, gelijk aan een zoon des menschen, hebbende op zijn hoofd een kroon van goud en in zijn hand een scherpe zeisen.
[14:15] En een ander engel kwam uit den tempel, roepende met een groote stem tot dengene die op de wolk zat: zend mij zeisen en maai! want de ure is gekomen om te maaien, omdat de oogst der aarde is rijp geworden!
[14:16] En die op de wolk zat zond zijn zeisen uit op de aarde, en de aarde werd gemaaid.
[14:17] En een ander engel kwam uit den tempel die in den hemel is, hebbende ook zelf een scherpe zeisen.
[14:18] En een ander engel kwam uit den altaar, hebbende macht over het vuur, en hij riep met een groote stem tot dengene die de scherpe zeisen had, zeggende: zend uw scherpe zeisen en snijd af de druiftrossen van den wijngaard der aarde, want zijn druiven zijn rijp geworden!
[14:19] En de engel zond zijn zeisen naar de aarde, en hij sneed den wijngaard der aarde, en wierp dien in de groote wijnpers der gramschap Gods.
[14:20] En de wijnpers werd buiten de stad getreden, en er kwam bloed uit de wijnpers tot aan de toornen der paarden, duizend en zes honderd stadiën ver.  
[15:1] En ik zag een ander groot en wonderlijk teeken in den hemel: zeven engelen, die de zeven laatste plagen hadden, want in deze is de gramschap Gods volkomen. 
[15:2]  En ik zag als een zee van glas, vermengd met vuur, en degenen die als overwinnaars komen van het beest, en van zijn beeld, en aan het getal zijns naams, staande bij de zee van glas, hebbende citers van God.
[15:3] En zij zongen het lied van Mozes, den dienstknecht Gods, en het lied des Lams, zeggende: Groot en wonderbaar zijn uw werken, o Heere God de Almachtige! rechtvaardig en waarachtig zijn van wegen, o Koning der eeuwen!
[15:4] Wie zal, o Heere, uw Naam niet vreezen en glorie geven? Want Gij alleen zijt heilig! Want al de volken zullen komen en zich voor uw aangezicht nederbuigen, omdat uw oordeelen openbaar geworden zijn! 
[15:5]  En daarna zag ik en ziet, de tempel des tabernakels der getuigenis in den hemel was geopend.
[15:6] En de engelen, die de zeven plagen hadden, kwamen uit den tempel, bekleed met zuiver blinkend lijmvaad, en omgord aan de borsten met gouden gordels.
[15:7] En een uit de vier levende wezens gaf aan de zeven engelen zeven schalen van goud, gevuld met de gramschap Gods, die leeft tot in alle eeuwigheid. 
[15:8]  En de tempel werd vervuld met rook uit de glorie Gods en uit zijn kracht, en niemand kon in den tempel ingaan, totdat de zeven plagen der zeven engelen vervuld zouden zijn.  
[16:1] En ik hoorde een groote stem uit den tempel, die sprak tot de zeven engelen: Gaat heen en giet de zeven schalen der gramschap Gods uit op de aarde!
[16:2] En de eerste ging heen en goot zijn schaal uit over de aarde; en er kwam een kwaad en boosaardig gezweer over de menschen, die het merkteeken hadden van het beest, en die voor zijn beeld zich nederbogen. 
[16:3]  En de tweede engel goot zijn schaal uit op de zee; en zij werd bloed als van een doode, en alle levende ziel stierf, die in de zee was 
[16:4]  En de derde engel goot zijn schaal uit op de rivieren, en op de fonteinen der wateren; en zij werden bloed.
[16:5] En ik hoorde den engel der wateren zeggen: rechtvaardig zijt Gij, die zijt, en die waart, Gij Heilige! want Gij hebt dit geoordeeld!
[16:6] Omdat zij het bloed der heiligen en der profeten vergoten hebben, zoo hebt Gij hun ook bloed te drinken gegeven; zij zijn het waardig!
[16:7] En ik hoorde den altaar zeggen: ja, Heere God, de Almachtige! waarachtig en rechtvaardig zijn uw oordeelen! 
[16:8]  En de vierde engel goot zijn schaal uit op de zon; en haar werd gegeven om de menschen door vuur te verhitten.
[16:9] En de menschen werden verhit met groote hitte, en zij lasterden den Naam van God die de macht heeft over die plagen, en zij deden geen boetvaardigheid om Hem glorie te geven. 
[16:10]  En de vijfde engel goot zijn schaal uit over den troon van het beest; en zijn koninkrijk werd verduisterd, en zij kauwden hun tong vanwege de pijn,
[16:11] en zij lasterden den God des hemels vanwege hun pijnen en vanwege hun gezweren, en zij deden geen boetvaardigheid vanwege hun werken. 
[16:12]  En de zesde engel goot zijn schaal uit over de groote rivier, den Eufraat; en zijn water droogde uit, om den weg te banen der koningen van het Oosten.
[16:13] En ik zag uit den muil van den draak, en uit den muil van het beest, en uit den muil van den schijnprofeet, drie onzuivere geesten uitkomen, als kikvorschen,
[16:14] want het zijn geesten van duivelen, teekenen doende, die uitgaan over de koningen der geheele aarde, om die te vergaderen tot den oorlog van den grooten dag des almachtigen Gods.
[16:15] Ziet, Ik kom als een dief! Zalig die wakende is en zijn kleederen bewaart, opdat hij niet naakt wandele en men zijn schandelijkheid niet zie!
[16:16] En zij vergaderden hen ter plaatse die in het Hebreeuwsch genoemd wordt: Armagedon. 
[16:17]  En de zevende engel goot zijn schaal uit over de lucht; en er kwam een groote stem uit den tempel, van den troon, die zeide: het is geschied!
[16:18] En er geschiedden bliksemen, en stemmen, en donderslagen, en er was een groote aardbeving, zooals er geen geweest is van dat de mensch op aarde is, een zoodanige aardbeving, zóó groot.
[16:19] En de groote stad werd verdeeld in drie deelen, en de steden der volken vielen; en het groote Babylon is voor Gods aangezicht gedacht geworden, om het den drinkbeker te geven van den wijn der gramschap zijns toorns.
[16:20] En alle eiland vluchtte weg, en er werden geen bergen meer gevonden.
[16:21] En een groote hagel, als een talentpond zwaar, viel neder uit den hemel over de menschen; en de menschen lasterden God vanwege de plage des hagels, want de plage daarvan is zeer groot.  
[17:1] En er kwam een uit de zeven engelen, die de zeven schalen hadden, en hij sprak met mij zeggende: kom hier, ik zal u het oordeel doen zien van de groote hoere, die gezeten is op de vele wateren;
[17:2] met wie de koningen der aarde hoererij bedreven hebben, en zij die de aarde bewonen zijn dronken geworden van den wijn harer hoererij.
[17:3] En hij voerde mij weg in den geest naar een woestijn. En ik zag een vrouw zitten op een scharlaken rood beest, dat vol was van lasterlijke namen, en dat zeven koppen en tien hoornen had. 
[17:4]  En de vrouw was bekleed met purper en scharlaken, en versierd met goud en met kostelijk gesteente en met paarlen; en zij had in haar hand een drinkbeker van goud, die vol was van gruwelen en van de onzuiverheid harer hoererij;
[17:5] en op haar voorhoofd had zij een naam geschreven: Verborgenheid, Babylon de groote, de moeder der hoererijen en der gruwelen der aarde.
[17:6] En ik zag dat de vrouw dronken was van het bloed der heiligen en van het bloed der getuigen van Jezus. En als ik haar zag, stond ik verwonderd met groote verwondering. 
[17:7]  En de engel zeide tot mij: waarom staat gij verwonderd? Ik zal u de geheimenis zeggen van de vrouw en van het beest dat haar draagt, dat de zeven koppen en de tien hoornen heeft.
[17:8] Het beest, dat gij gezien hebt, was en is niet; en het zal opkomen uit den afgrond en ten verderve gaan, en degenen die op de aarde wonen, wier namen niet geschreven zijn op het boek des levens van de grondlegging der wereld, — die zullen verwonderd staan, als zij het beest zien, hoe het was en niet is en zal zijn.
[17:9] Hier is de zin die wijsheid heeft: de zeven koppen zijn zeven bergen, waarop de vrouw gezeten is.
[17:10] En zij zijn zeven koningen; de vijf zijn gevallen, de een is, de ander is nog niet gekomen; en als hij zal gekomen zijn dan moet hij een korten tijd blijven.
[17:11] En het beest dat was en niet is, is ook zelf een achtste koning, en hij is uit de zeven en hij gaat ten verderve.
[17:12] En de tien hoornen die gij gezien hebt zijn tien koningen, die het koninkrijk nog niet ontvangen hebben, maar de heerschappij als koningen zullen zij voor één ure ontvangen met het beest.
[17:13] Dezen hebben één zelfde voornemen, en hun macht en hun heerschappij zullen zij geven aan het beest.
[17:14] Dezen zullen strijden tegen het Lam, en het Lam zal hen overwinnen, want Heere van heeren is Hij en Koning van koningen, en degenen die met Hem zijn, geroepenen en uitverkorenen en geloovigen, zullen ook overwinnen.
[17:15] En de engel zeide tot mij: de wateren die gij ziet, waar de hoere gezeten is, zijn volken, en scharen, en natiën, en tongen.
[17:16] En de tien hoornen die gij gezien hebt en het beest, die zullen de hoere haten, en zullen haar woest maken en naakt, en zij zullen haar vleesch eten, en haar met vuur verbranden.
[17:17] Want God heeft in hun harten gegeven om zijn voornemen te doen, en om één zelfde voornemen te doen, en om hun koninkrijk aan het beest te geven, totdat de woorden Gods zullen vervuld zijn.
[17:18] En de vrouw die gij gezien hebt is de groote stad die de regeering heeft over de koningen der aarde.  
[18:1] Na dezen zag ik een anderen engel afdalen uit den hemel, die groote macht had, en de aarde werd verlicht van zijn glorie.
[18:2] En hij riep met een sterke stem zeggende: Gevallen, gevallen is Babylon de groote, en zij is geworden tot een woonplaats van booze geesten, en een schuilplaats van alle onzuivere geesten, en een schuilplaats van alle onzuiver en hatelijk gevogelte!
[18:3] want van den wijn der gramschap harer hoererij hebben al de volken gedronken, en de koningen der aarde hebben met haar hoererij bedreven, en de kooplieden der aarde zijn rijk geworden uit de kracht van haar weelde. 
[18:4]  En ik hoorde een andere stem uit den hemel, zeggende: Gaat van haar uit, mijn volk! opdat gij geen deelgenootschap hebt aan haar zonden, en opdat gij niet ontvangt uit haar plagen;
[18:5] want haar zonden zijn opeen gestapeld tot aan den hemel, en God is haar onrechtvaardigheden gedachtig!
[18:6] Vergeldt haar zooals zij u vergolden heeft, en vergeldt haar dubbel naar haar werken! in den drinkbeker waarin zij geschonken heeft, schenkt haar dubbel!
[18:7] Zooveel als zij zich zelve glorie gegeven en in weelde geleefd heeft, doet haar zooveel pijn en rouw aan, want in haar hart zegt zij: als een koningin ben ik gezeten, en weduwe ben ik niet, en rouw zal ik in ‘t geheel niet zien!
[18:8] Daarom zullen haar plagen in één dag komen, dood en rouw en honger, en met vuur zal zij verbrand worden; want sterk is de Heere, de God die haar oordeelt! 
[18:9]  En de koningen der aarde, die met haar hoererij bedreven en in weelde geleefd hebben, zullen over haar weenen en misbaar maken, als zij zien zullen den rook van haar brand;
[18:10] van verre staande uit vreeze van haar pijne, zeggende: wee, wee! de stad, die groote, Babylon die sterke stad, want in één ure is haar oordeel gekomen!
[18:11] En de kooplieden der stad zullen weenen en treuren over haar, omdat niemand meer hun koopwaren zal koopen:
[18:12] koopwaren van goud, en van zilver, en van kostelijk gesteente, en van paarlen, en van fijn lijnwaad, en van purper, en van zijde, en van scharlaken; en alle welriekend hout, en allerlei vaatwerk van ivoor, en allerlei vaatwerk van het kostelijkste hout, en van koper, en van ijzer, en van marmer;
[18:13] en kaneel, en reukwerk, en welriekende zalf, en myrrhe, en wierook, en wijn, en olie, en meelbloem, en tarwe, en vee, en schapen, en koopwaren van paarden, en van wagens, en van slaven, en van menschenzielen.
[18:14] En de vrucht die uw ziel begeerde is van u weggegaan, en al de lekkernijen en de wellustigheden zijn van u te niet gegaan, en zij worden in het geheel niet meer gevonden.
[18:15] De kooplieden dezer dingen, die van haar rijk geworden zijn, zullen van verre staan vanwege de vrees harer pijniging, weenende en treurende,
[18:16] en zeggende: wee, wee, de stad, die groote, die gekleed was met fijn lijnwaad en purper en scharlaken, en bedekt met goud, en kostelijk gesteente en paarlen! Want in één ure is zoo groote rijkdom verwoest!
[18:17] En iedere stuurman, en ieder die ter zee vaart, en matrozen, en zoovelen als hun brood winnen op zee, stonden verre,
[18:18] en riepen, ziende den rook van haar brand, zeggende: welke stad is gelijk aan die groote stad?
[18:19] En zij wierpen stof op hun hoofden, en riepen al weenende en treurende, zeggende: wee, wee! de stad, die groote, waarin allen rijk geworden zijn van haar weelde, die schepen in de zee hadden; want in één ure is zij verwoest!
[18:20] Verheugt u over haar, o hemel, en gij heiligen, en apostelen, en profeten, want God heeft uw oordeel over haar geoordeeld! 
[18:21]  En één sterke engel nam een steen op, als een grooten molensteen, en wierp dien in de zee, zeggende: alzoo zal Babylon, die groote stad, met geweld geworpen worden, en zij zal in het geheel niet meer gevonden worden!
[18:22] en de stem van harpspelers, en van zangers, en van fluitspelers, en van trompetters zal in u niet meer gehoord worden; en geen kunstenaar van eenige kunst zal meer in u gevonden worden; en het geluid van een molen zal in u niet meer gehoord worden;
[18:23] en het licht eener lamp zal in u niet meer schijnen, en de stem van een bruidegom en een bruid zal in u niet meer gehoord worden; want uw kooplieden waren de machtigen der aarde, omdat door uw tooverij al de volken verleid zijn geworden.
[18:24] En in haar is het bloed gevonden van profeten, en van heiligen, en van allen die op de aarde gedood zijn.  
[19:1] Na dezen hoorde ik als een groote stem eener groote menigte in den hemel, zeggende: Hallelujah! de verlossing en de glorie en de kracht zij onzen Gode!
[19:2] want zijn oordeelen zijn waarachtig en rechtvaardig, omdat Hij de groote hoere geoordeeld heeft die door haar hoererij de aarde verdorven heeft, en omdat Hij het bloed zijner dienaren van haar hand gewroken heeft!
[19:3] En voor de tweede maal zeiden zij: Hallelujah! En haar rook gaat op tot in alle eeuwigheid.
[19:4] En de vier en twintig ouderlingen en de vier levende wezens vielen neder en aanbaden God die op den troon gezeten is, zeggende: Amen, Hallelujah!
[19:5] En er kwam een stem uit den troon die zeide: geeft lof aan onzen God, gij al zijn dienaren! gij die Hem vreest, de kleinen en de grooten! 
[19:6]  En ik hoorde als een stem eener groote menigte, en als een stem van vele wateren, en als een stem van sterke donderslagen, die zeiden: Hallelujah! Want de Heere, onze God, de Almachtige, regeert!
[19:7] Laat ons blijde zijn en vreugde bedrijven, en laat ons de glorie aan Hem geven, want de bruiloft des Lams is gekomen en zijn vrouw heeft zich gereed gemaakt!
[19:8] En haar is gegeven dat zij zich bekleede met fijn lijnwaad, helder en zuiver, want het fijn lijnwaad zijn de rechtvaardigheden der heiligen. 
[19:9]  En hij zeide tot mij: Schrijf: zalig degenen die geroepen zijn tot den maaltijd van de bruiloft des Lams! En hij zeide tot mij: deze zijn de waarachtige woorden Gods!
[19:10] En ik viel neder voor zijn voeten om hem te aanbidden. En hij zeide tot mij: zie toe, doe het niet! ik ben de mededienaar van u en van uw broederen, die de getuigenis van Jezus hebben; aanbid God. Want de getuigenis van Jezus is de geest der profetie. 
[19:11]  En ik zag den hemel opengedaan, en ziet, een wit paard, en die daarop zat, genaamd Getrouw en Waarachtig; en Hij oordeelt en strijdt in rechtvaardigheid.
[19:12] Zijn oogen waren een vlam van vuur, en over zijn hoofd waren vele diademen; en Hij had een Naam geschreven dien niemand weet dan alleen Hij zelf.
[19:13] En Hij was gekleed in een kleed dat met bloed besprenkeld was en zijn Naam wordt genoemd: het Woord van God.
[19:14] En de legers in den hemel volgden Hem op witte paarden, gekleed in fijn lijnwaad, helder en zuiver.
[19:15] En uit zijn mond ging een scherpsnijdend zwaard, opdat Hij daarmede de volken slaan zou. En Hij zal hen hoeden met een staf van ijzer, en Hij treedt de wijnpers des toorns der gramschap van den almachtigen God.
[19:16] En Hij heeft op zijn kleed en op zijn heup tot Naam geschreven: Koning van koningen en Heer van heeren. 
[19:17]  En ik zag één engel in de zon staan en hij riep met een groote stem, zeggende tot al de vogelen die vliegen in het hemelruim: komt, verzamelt u tot den grooten maaltijd Gods,
[19:18] opdat gij eten moogt het vleesch van koningen, en het vleesch van legeroversten, en het vleesch van sterken, en het vleesch van paarden en van degenen die er op zitten, en het vleesch van allen, zoowel van vrijen als van dienstbaren, en van kleinen en grooten.
[19:19] En ik zag het beest en de koningen der aarde, en hun legers verzameld om oorlog te voeren tegen Hem die op het paard was gezeten en tegen zijn legers.
[19:20] En het beest werd gegrepen en daarmede de schijnprofeet, die de teekenen gedaan had voor zijn aangezicht, waardoor hij verleid had degenen die het merkteeken van het beest hadden ontvangen en die voor zijn beeld hadden geknield. Levende zijn die twee geworpen in den poel des vuurs, die van sulfer brandt.
[19:21] En de overigen werden gedood door het zwaard dat uit den mond kwam van Hem die op het paard was gezeten, en al de vogelen werden verzadigd van hun vleesch.  
[20:1] En ik zag een engel afkomen uit den hemel, hebbende den sleutel des afgronds en een groote keten op zijn hand.
[20:2] En hij greep den draak, de oude slang, die is de duivel en Satanas, en bond hem voor duizend jaar,
[20:3] en wierp hem naar den afgrond en hij sloot dien toe en verzegelde dien over hem, opdat hij de volken niet meer zou verleiden, totdat de duizend jaar voleindigd zouden zijn. Daarna moet hij voor een korten tijd losgemaakt worden. 
[20:4]  En ik zag troonen en zij zaten daarop, en het oordeel werd hun gegeven. En ik zag de zielen dergenen die onthoofd waren om de getuigenis van Jezus en om het woord Gods, en dezulken die niet voor het beest geknield hadden, noch voor zijn beeld en die het merkteeken op hun voorhoofd en op hun hand niet ontvangen hadden; en zij leefden en heerschten met den Christus duizend jaar.
[20:5] De overigen der dooden leefden niet, totdat de duizend jaar voleindigd zouden zijn. Deze is de eerste verrijzenis.
[20:6] Zalig en heilig die deel heeft in die eerste verrijzenis; over dezen heeft de tweede dood geen macht, maar zij zullen priesters zijn voor God en den Christus, en zullen met Hem heerschen de duizend jaar. 
[20:7]  En wanneer de duizend jaar zullen voleindigd zijn, dan zal de Satan losgemaakt worden uit zijn gevangenis,
[20:8] en hij zal uitgaan om de volken te verleiden die in de vier hoeken der aarde zijn, den God en den Magog, om die te verzamelen tot den oorlog; wier getal is als het zand der zee. 
[20:9]  En zij zijn opgekomen over de breedte der aarde en zij omringden de legerplaats der heiligen en de beminde stad; en er daalde vuur uit den hemel van God en het verslond hen.
[20:10] En de duivel die hen verleidde, werd geworpen in den poel des vuurs en des sulfers, waar het beest is en de schijnprofeet; en zij zullen gepijnigd worden dag en nacht tot in alle eeuwigheid. 
[20:11]  En ik zag een grooten witten troon en Hem die daarop gezeten was, van wiens aangezicht de aarde en de hemel wegvluchtten, en voor hen werd geen plaats gevonden.
[20:12] En ik zag de dooden, de grooten en de kleinen, staande voor het aangezicht van den troon, en er werden boeken geopend. En een ander boek werd geopend dat het boek des levens is. En de dooden werden geoordeeld uit hetgeen in de boeken geschreven was, naar hun werken.
[20:13] En de zee gaf de dooden die in haar waren, en de dood en het doodenrijk gaven de dooden die in hen waren; en zij werden geoordeeld een ieder naar zijn werken.
[20:14] En de dood en het doodenrijk werden geworpen naar den poel des vuurs. Dit is de tweede dood, de poel des vuurs.
[20:15] En als iemand niet gevonden werd in het boek des levens geschreven te zijn, dan werd hij geworpen naar den poel des vuurs.  
[21:1] En ik zag een nieuwen hemel en een nieuwe aarde; want de eerste hemel en de eerste aarde waren voorbijgegaan en de zee was er niet meer.
[21:2] En de heilige stad Jerusalem zag ik nederdalende uit den hemel van God, toebereid als een bruid die versierd is voor haar bruidegom.
[21:3] En ik hoorde een groote stem uit den troon, die zeide: Ziet, de tabernakel Gods is met de menschen, en Hij zal met hen wonen, en zij zullen zijn volk zijn, en God zelf zal met hen en hun God zijn.
[21:4] En God zal iedere traan uit hun oogen afdroogen, en er zal geen dood meer zijn; noch rouw, noch geween, noch pijn zal er meer zijn, want de eerste dingen zijn voorbijgegaan!
[21:5] En die op den troon gezeten is zeide: Ziet, Ik maak alles nieuw! En Hij zeide: schrijf, want deze woorden zijn getrouw en waarachtig.
[21:6] En Hij zeide tot mij: Het is geschied! Ik ben de Alfa en de Omega, het begin en het einde. Ik zal aan den dorstige geven uit de fontein van het water des levens voor niet!
[21:7] Die overwint zal deze dingen beërven, en Ik zal hem een God zijn en hij zal Mij een zoon zijn.
[21:8] Maar wat aangaat den vreesachtigen en ongeloovigen, en gruwelijken, en doodslagers, en hoereerders, en toovenaars, en afgodendienaars en al den leugenaars, — hun deel is in den poel die brandt van vuur en sulfer, dat is de tweede dood. 
[21:9]  En er kwam een uit de zeven engelen die de zeven schalen hadden die vol geweest waren van de zeven laatste plagen, en hij sprak met mij zeggende: kom hier, ik zal u toonen de bruid, de vrouw des Lams!
[21:10] En hij voerde mij op in den geest naar een grooten en hoogen berg, en toonde mij de heilige stad Jerusalem, nederdalende uit den hemel van God, hebbende de glorie Gods.
[21:11] Haar glans was gelijk aan een zeer kostelijken steen, als een jaspissteen, glinsterend als kristal.
[21:12] Zij had een grooten en hoogen muur en had twaalf poorten, en bij die poorten twaalf engelen, en namen daarop geschreven, die de namen zijn van de twaalf stammen der zonen Israels.
[21:13] Van het oosten waren drie poorten, en van het noorden drie poorten, en van het zuiden drie poorten, en van het westen drie poorten.
[21:14] En de muur der stad had twaalf fundamenten, en daarop twaalf namen van de twaalf apostelen des Lams.
[21:15] En die met mij sprak had tot meetroede een rietstok van goud, om de stad, en haar poorten, en haar muur te meten.
[21:16] En de stad lag in het vierkant, en haar lengte was zoo groot als haar breedte. En hij mat de stad met den rietstok op twaalfduizend stadiën. Haar lengte en breedte en hoogte waren gelijk.
[21:17] En hij mat haar muur op honderd vier en veertig ellen, de maat van een mensch, die dezelfde is als van een engel.
[21:18] En de bouw van haar muur was jaspis en de stad was zuiver goud, gelijk aan zuiver glas.
[21:19] De fundamenten van den muur der stad waren versierd met allerlei kostelijk gesteente. Het eerste fundament was jaspis, het tweede saffier, het derde chalcedon, het vierde smaragd,
[21:20] het vijfde sardonik, het zesde sardius, het zevende chrysoliet, het achtste beryl, het negende topaas, het tiende chrysopraas, het elfde hyacint, het twaalfde amethyst.
[21:21] En de twaalf poorten waren twaalf paarlen; iedere poort in liet bijzonder was uit één paarl, en de straat der stad was zuiver goud als doorschijnend glas.
[21:22] En een tempel zag ik in haar niet, want de Heere, de almachtige God, is haar tempel, en het Lam.
[21:23] En de stad heeft de zon niet van noode, noch de maan, om haar te verlichten, want de glorie Gods verlicht haar en haar fakkel is het Lam.
[21:24] En de volken zullen wandelen bij haar licht en de koningen der aarde zullen hun glorie tot haar brengen.
[21:25] En haar poorten zullen bij dag geenszins gesloten zijn, want daar zal geen nacht zijn.
[21:26] En men zal de glorie en de eerbewijzingen der volken tot haar brengen.
[21:27] En tot haar zal geenszins inkomen al wat gemeen is, en gruwelijkheid doet en leugen, maar wel die opgeschreven zijn in het boek des levens van het Lam.  
[22:1] En de engel toonde mij een rivier van levend water, klaar als kristal, die voortkwam uit den troon van God en van het Lam.
[22:2] In het midden harer straat en aan weerskanten van de rivier stond een boom des levens, die twaalf vruchten draagt, alle maanden zijn vrucht voortbrengende; en de bladeren van den boom zijn tot genezing der volken.
[22:3] En er zal geen vervloeking meer zijn. En de troon van God en van het Lam zal in haar zijn, en zijn knechten zullen Hem dienen.
[22:4] En zij zullen zijn aangezicht zien en zijn Naam op hun voorhoofden hebben.
[22:5] En nacht zal er niet meer zijn en zij zullen geen fakkellicht of zonnelicht noodig hebben, want de Heere God zal over hen licht geven en zij zullen heerschen tot in alle eeuwigheid. 
[22:6]  En hij zeide tot mij: Deze woorden zijn getrouw en waarachtig, en de Heere, de God van de, geesten der profeten, heeft zijn engel gezonden om aan zijn dienaren te toonen de dingen die haast geschieden moeten.
[22:7] En ziet, Ik kom haastiglijk! Zalig hij die de woorden der profetie van dit boek bewaart. 
[22:8]  En ik, Johannes, ben het die deze dingen gezien en gehoord heb. En toen ik ze gehoord en gezien had viel ik neder om te aanbidden voor de voeten van den engel die mij deze dingen getoond had.
[22:9] En hij zeide tot mij: Zie toe en doe dat niet! Ik ben de mededienaar van u en van uw broeders de profeten, en van degenen die de woorden van dit boek bewaren. Aanbid God!
[22:10] En hij zeide tot mij: De woorden der profetie van dit boek zult gij niet verzegelen, want de tijd is nabij.
[22:11] Die onrecht doet, dat hij nog meer onrecht doe; en die onrein is, dat hij nog onreiner worde; en die rechtvaardig is, dat hij nog meer rechtvaardigheid doe; en die heilig is dat hij nog meer geheiligd worde. 
[22:12]  Ziet, Ik kom haastigijk! En mijn loon is met Mij, om aan een ieder te vergelden naar dat zijn werk is!
[22:13] Ik ben de Alfa en de Omega, de Eerste en de Laatste, het Begin en het Einde!
[22:14] Zalig zij die hun kleederen wasschen, opdat zij recht mogen hebben op dien boom des levens en ingaan mogen door de poorten in de stad.
[22:15] Buiten zijn de honden, en de toovenaars, en de hoereerders, en de doodslagers, en de afgodendienaars, en al wie den leugen doet en bemint.
[22:16] Ik, Jezus, heb mijn engel gezonden om voor ulieden van deze dingen te getuigen bij de gemeenten. Ik ben de Wortel en de Spruit van David, de blinkende Morgenster!
[22:17] En de Geest en de bruid zeggen: Kom! — En die het hoort, zegge: Kom! — En die dorst heeft, kome, en die wil, neme het water des levens, voor niet. 
[22:18]  Ik betuig aan al wie de woorden der profetie van dit boek hoort: zoo wie toedoet tot deze dingen, God zal over hem toedoen de plagen die in dit boek geschreven zijn!
[22:19] En zoo wie afdoet van de woorden des boeks dezer profetie, God zal zijn deel afdoen van den boom des levens, en uit de heilige stad en uit hetgeen in dat boek geschreven is.
[22:20] Die deze dingen getuigt zegt: Ja, Ik kom haastiglijk! — Amen, kom Heere Jezus!
[22:21] De genade van den Heere Jezus Christus zij met allen! Amen.
