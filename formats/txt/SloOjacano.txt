[1:1] BLAGOSLOVLJEN, (VESEL, srečen, cvetoč in zavidanja vreden) je mož, ki ne hodi in ne živi po zgledu brezbožnežev; da bi [sledil njihovim nasvetom, načrtom in namenom], niti ne stoji [vdan in neaktiven] na poteh, kjer hodijo grešniki, niti ne seda, [da bi si oddahnil in odpočil] kjer se zbirajo zasmehovalci [in oponašalci]. 
[1:2] Temveč so njegova radost in hrepenenje v Gospodovi postavi in o Njegovi postavi, (navodilih, lekcijah, Božjih učenjih), stalno premišljuje, (razglablja in študira), podnevi in ponoči.  
[1:3] In on bo kakor drevo, čvrsto posajeno [in negovano] s tokovi vodá, pripravljeno, da ob svojem času obrodi svoj sad; tudi njegovi listi ne bodo oveneli ali propadli; in vse kar dela, bo cvetelo [in dozorelo].  
[1:4] Z zlobnimi, [tistimi, ki so neubogljivi in živijo brez Boga], pa ni tako. Temveč so kakor pleve, [ničvredni, mrtvi, brez bistva], ki jih odnaša veter. 
[1:5] Zato zlobni, [tisti, ki so neubogljivi in živijo brez Boga], ne bodo obstali [opravičeni] na sodbi, niti grešniki ne v zboru pravičnih, [tistih, ki so iskreni in v pravem odnosu z Bogom]. 
[1:6] Kajti Gospod pozna in je popolnoma seznanjen s potjo pravičnih, toda pot brezbožnih, [tistih, ki živijo zunaj Božje volje], bo izginila, (končala v uničenju in prišla v nič). 
[2:1] ZAKAJ SE narodi zbirajo v razburjenju, [hrušču in zmedi glasov] in zakaj si ljudje zamišljajo, (razmišljajo in izumljajo) prazen naklep? 
[2:2] Kralji zemlje zasedajo svoja mesta; poglavarji se skupaj posvetujejo proti Gospodu in Njegovemu Maziljencu, (Mesiju, Kristusu). Oni pravijo:  
[2:3] "Raztrgajmo Njihove vezi [omejitev] in vrzimo iz sebe Njihove vrvi [nadzora]." 
[2:4] On, ki sedi v podaljšku nebes, se smeji; Gospod jih ima v posmeh [in v vrhunskem zaničevanju jih On zasmehuje]. 
[2:5] V Svoji globoki jezi jim On govori in jih nadleguje, (zastrašuje in bega), v Svojem nezadovoljstvu in razjarjenosti, rekoč: 
[2:6] "Kljub temu sem Jaz mazilil, (namestil in postavil), Svojega Kralja [trdno] na Svojo sveto goro Sion." 
[2:7] Razglasil bom Gospodov odlok: On Mi je rekel: "Ti si Moj Sin; ta dan [Jaz razglašam], da sem te Jaz zaplodil.  
[2:8] Zahtevaj od Mene in Jaz Ti bom dal narode kot Tvojo dediščino in najbolj oddaljene dele zemlje kot Tvojo lastnino. 
[2:9] Ti jih boš zlomil z železno palico; Ti jih boš raztreščil na kose kakor lončene predmete."  
[2:10] Sedaj torej, o vi kralji, ravnajte modro; dajte se poučiti in posvariti, o vi vladarji zemlje. 
[2:11] Gospodu služite s častnim strahospoštovanjem in straho-oboževanjem; radostite se in bodite razigrani s trepetanjem, [da Ga ne bi vznejevoljili]. 
[2:12] Poljubite Sina, [Njemu izkažite čast v čistosti], da se On ne bi razjezil in bi vi izginili na poti, ker se bo kmalu vnel Njegov bes. O blagoslovljeni, (veseli, srečni in zavidanja vredni) so vsi tisti, ki iščejo zatočišče in svoje zaupanje položijo Vanj! 
[3:1]  GOSPOD, KAKO so se pomnožili tisti, ki me nadlegujejo! Številni so tisti, ki se vzdigujejo zoper mene. 
[3:2] O meni številni pravijo: "Zanj ni pomoči v Bogu."
[3:3]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Toda Ti, o Gospod, si moj ščit, moja slava in vzdigovalec moje glave. 
[3:4] S svojim glasom jokam h Gospodu in On sliši in mi odgovarja iz Svoje svete gore.
[3:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ulegel sem se in spal; ponovno sem se zbudil, kajti zame skrbi Gospod. 
[3:6] Ne bom se bal deset tisočev ljudi, ki so se nahujskali zoper mene okrog in okrog. 
[3:7] Vzdigni se, o Gospod; reši me, o moj Bog! Ker si Ti udaril po licu vse moje sovražnike; Ti si brezbožnežem polomil zobe. 
[3:8] Rešitev duš pripada Gospodu; naj bo Tvoj blagoslov nad Tvojim ljudstvom. Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! 
[4:1]  ODGOVORI MI kadar kličem, o Bog moje pravičnosti, (pokončnosti, pravice in pravega odnosa s Teboj)! Ti si me osvobodil, ko sem bil obkoljen in me razširil, ko sem bil potrt; z menoj imej usmiljenje in usliši mojo molitev. 
[4:2] O vi človeški sinovi, kako dolgo boste mojo čast in slavo obračali v sramoto? Kako dolgo boste ljubili puhlost in jalovost in povpraševali za lažmi?
[4:3]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Toda vedite, da je Gospod oddvojil Zase [in dal priznanje] tistemu, ki je bogaboječ, [človeku ljubeče-skrbnosti]. Gospod posluša in je pozoren, ko kličem k Njemu. 
[4:4] Bodite jezni [ali stojte v strahospoštovanju] in ne grešite; posvetujte se z vašimi lastnimi srci pri vaših posteljah in utihnite, (obžalujte stvari, ki ste jih izrekli v vaših srcih.) 
[4:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ponudite pravične in prave žrtve; zaupajte, (zanašajte se na |Gospoda| in bodite prepričani) v Gospoda. 
[4:6] Mnogi pravijo: "Oh, da bi lahko videli nekaj dobrega!" Dvigni nad nas svetlobo Svojega obličja, o Gospod. 
[4:7] Ti si v moje srce položil več radosti in veselja, kot [ga poznajo oni], kadar je njihovo žito in novo vino bogato obrodilo. 
[4:8] V miru bom hkrati legel in spal, saj Ti, Gospod, mi sam daješ bivati v varnosti in prepričanem zaupanju. 
[5:1]  PRISLUHNI MOJIM besedam, o Gospod, bodi pozoren na moje vzdihovanje in ječanje. 
[5:2] Usliši glas mojega joka, moj Kralj in moj Bog, saj k Tebi molim. 
[5:3] Zjutraj Ti slišiš moj glas, o Gospod; zjutraj pripravim [molitev, žrtev] Zate in opazujem in čakam, [da Ti spregovoriš mojemu srcu]. 
[5:4] Kajti Ti nisi Bog, ki uživa v zlobnosti; niti ne bo hudoben [mož] toliko kot [začasno] prebival s Teboj. 
[5:5] Bahači ne morejo obstati pred Tvojim pogledom; Ti preziraš vse hudobneže. 
[5:6] Ti boš uničil tiste, ki govorijo laži; Gospod prezira [in zavrača] krvoločneža in goljufa. 
[5:7] Toda kar se mene tiče, bom v Tvojo hišo vstopil skozi obilje Tvoje stanovitne ljubezni in usmiljenja; oboževal bom k |Tebi| in pri Tvojemu svetemu templju v častitljivem strahu in strahospoštovanju pred Teboj. 
[5:8] Vodi me, o Gospod, v Svoji pravičnosti zaradi mojih sovražnikov; uravnavaj Svojo pot ravno, (naravnost in prav) pred mojim licem. 
[5:9] Kajti v njihovem govoru ni ničesar zaupanja vrednega ali stanovitnega ali resničnega; njihovo srce je poguba [ali pogubno brezno, zevajoč prepad]; njihovo grlo je odprt grob; s svojimi jeziki laskajo in izglajujejo.  
[5:10] Imej jih za krive, o Bog; naj padejo po svojih lastnih naklepih in nasvetih; izženi jih zaradi številnosti njihovih prestopkov, saj so se uprli zoper Tebe. 
[5:11] Toda naj se vsi tisti, ki se zatekajo in svoje zaupanje polagajo Vate, radostijo; naj vekomaj pojejo in vriskajo od radosti, ker Ti delaš zaščito nad njimi in jih braniš; naj bodo tudi tisti, ki ljubijo Tvoje ime, radostni v Tebi in razigrani. 
[5:12] Kajti Ti boš, Gospod, blagoslovil [brezkompromisno] pravičnega, [tistega, ki je pokončen in v pravem odnosu s Teboj]; kakor s ščitom ga boš Ti obdal z dobro voljo (zadovoljstvom in naklonjenostjo). 
[6:1]  O GOSPOD, v Svoji jezi me ne grajaj, niti me ne kaznuj in karaj v Svoji vneti nejevolji. 
[6:2] Usmili se me in bodi dober z menoj, o Gospod, kajti šibak sem, (medlim in sem oslabel); o Gospod, ozdravi me, ker so moje kosti potrte. 
[6:3] Tudi moj [notranji] jaz je, [tako kakor moje telo], izredno potrt in mučen. Toda Ti, o Gospod, kako dolgo še [dokler se Ti ne vrneš in mi spregovoriš besede miru]? 
[6:4] [V moje olajšanje] se vrni, o Gospod, osvobodi moje življenje; reši me zaradi Tvoje neomajne ljubezni in usmiljenja. 
[6:5] Kajti v smrti ni spominjanja Nate; kdo Ti bo v Šeolu, (kraju mrtvih), dal zahvalo? 
[6:6] Izmučen sem s svojim stokanjem; vso noč s solzami močim svojo blazino, svoje ležišče namakam s svojim jokom. 
[6:7] Moje oko postaja motno zaradi bridkosti; ostareva zaradi vseh mojih sovražnikov. 
[6:8] Odidite od mene vsi delavci krivičnosti, kajti Gospod je slišal glas mojega ihtenja.  
[6:9] Gospod je slišal mojo ponižno prošnjo; Gospod sprejema mojo molitev. 
[6:10] Naj bodo vsi moji sovražniki osramočeni in zelo vznemirjeni; naj se obrnejo nazaj in naj bodo nenadoma osramočeni. 
[7:1]  O GOSPOD, moj Bog, Vate se zatekam in polagam svoje zaupanje; reši me pred vsemi tistimi, ki me zasledujejo in preganjajo in me osvobodi, 
[7:2] sicer moj sovražnik iztrga moje življenje [od mojega telesa] kakor lev in me vleče stran, medtem ko ni nobenega, da bi me osvobodil. 
[7:3] O Gospod, moj Bog, če sem to storil, če je krivica v mojih rokah, 
[7:4] če sem s hudobijo povrnil tistemu, ki je bil v miru z menoj ali sem brez vzroka oropal tistega, ki je bil moj sovražnik, 
[7:5] naj sovražnik preganja moje življenje in ga vzame; da, naj moje življenje potepta na tla in mojo čast položi v prah.
[7:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Dvigni se, o Gospod, v Svoji jezi; vzdigni se proti srdu mojih sovražnikov; in zbudi [ter spodbudi] zame pravico in obrambo, [ki] si jo Ti zapovedal. 
[7:7] Naj se zbor narodov zbere okrog Tebe in vrni se na višavo nad njimi. 
[7:8] Gospod sodi ljudstva; sodi me, o Gospod in razsodi glede na mojo pravičnost, [mojo pravilnost, pravico in pravi odnos s Teboj] in glede na poštenost, ki je v meni. 
[7:9] Oh, naj se konča zlobnost zlobnih, toda postavi [brezkompromisno] pravične, [tiste, ki so pokončni in v soglasju s Teboj]; kajti Ti, ki preizkušaš srca in čustva in moči razmišljanja, si pravičen Bog.  
[7:10] Moja obramba in ščit se zanašata na Boga, ki rešuje iskrene v srcu. 
[7:11] Bog je pravičen Sodnik, da, Bog, ki je vsak dan ogorčen. 
[7:12] Če se človek ne obrne in ne pokesa, bo [Bog] nabrusil Svoj meč; On je napel in upognil Svoj [ogromen] lok in ga pripravil [s tlačenjem Svojega stopala]. 
[7:13] On je zanj pripravil tudi smrtonosna orožja; On dela Svoje puščice goreče bakle. 
[7:14] Poglej, [zlobnež] spočne krivico in je nosèč z vragolijo in daje rojstvo lažem. 
[7:15] Naredil je jamo in jo izdolbel in padel v luknjo, katero je sam naredil, [preden je bila past končana]. 
[7:16] Njegova vragolija bo zato v povračilo padla nazaj na njegovo lastno glavo in njegovo nasilje prihaja dol [s sproščeno umazanijo] na njegovo lastno teme. 
[7:17] Zahvaljeval se bom Gospodu zaradi njegove pravičnosti in pravice in pel bom hvalo imenu Gospoda Najvišjega. 
[8:1]  O GOSPOD, naš Gospod, kako odlično, (veličastno in slavno), je Tvoje ime na vsej zemlji! Ti si Svojo slavo postavil na |podaljšek nebes| [ali nad] podaljšek nebes. 
[8:2] Iz ust otročičev in neodstavljenih dojenčkov si Ti osnoval moč zaradi Svojih sovražnikov, da bi Ti lahko utišal nasprotnika in maščevalca.  
[8:3] Ko gledam in preudarjam Tvoj podaljšek nebes, delo Tvojih prstov, luno in zvezde, ki si jih Ti namestil in osnoval, 
[8:4] kaj je človek, da se ga Ti spominjaš in sin [iz zemlje rojenega] človeka, da je Tebi mar zanj? 
[8:5] In vendar si ga Ti naredil malo nižjega od Boga [ali nebeških bitij] in Ti si ga kronal s slavo in častjo. 
[8:6] Ti si ga naredil, da ima prevlado nad deli Tvojih rok; Ti si vse stvari položil pod njegova stopala:  
[8:7] Vse ovce in voli, da in poljske živali, 
[8:8] ptice ozračja in ribe morja in karkoli pride mimo po morskih stezah. 
[8:9] O Gospod, naš Gospod, kako odlično, (veličastno in slavno), je Tvoje ime na vsej zemlji! 
[9:1]  HVALIL TE bom, o Gospod, z vsem svojim srcem; pokazal, (pripovedoval, na glas povedal) bom o vseh Tvojih fantastičnih delih in čudovitih dejanjih! 
[9:2] Radostil se bom v Tebi in bom razigran; pel bom hvalo Tvojemu imenu, o Najvišji! 
[9:3] Ko so se moji sovražniki obrnili nazaj, so se spotaknili in bili uničeni pred Teboj. 
[9:4] Ker si Ti ohranil mojo pravico in mojo stvar; Ti si sedel na prestolu in pravično sodil. 
[9:5] Ti si grajal narode, Ti si uničil zlobne; Ti si njihovo ime izbrisal za vedno in večno. 
[9:6] Sovražnik je bil odrezan in izginil v večne razvaline, Ti si izruval in zrušil njihova mesta; spomin nanje je oslabel in izginil. 
[9:7] Toda Gospod bo ostal in nadaljeval za vedno; On je Svoj prestol pripravil in utrdil za sodbo.  
[9:8] In On bo sodil svet v pravičnosti, (pravici in nepristranskosti); On bo narodom nudil pravico v pokončnosti.  
[9:9] Gospod bo tudi zatočišče in visok stolp za zatirane, zatočišče in utrdba v težkih časih (draginje, revščine in obupa). 
[9:10] In tisti, ki poznajo Tvoje ime, [ki imajo izkustvo in spoznanje Tvojega usmiljenja], se bodo zanašali in svoje zaupanje prepričano položili Vate, kajti Ti, Gospod, nisi zapustil tistih, ki iščejo, (sprašujejo o |Tebi| in za) Teboj [na podlagi avtoritete Božje Besede in pravice njihove potrebe].  
[9:11] Pojte hvalnice Gospodu, ki biva na Sionu! Njegova dela razglašajte med narodi! 
[9:12] Kajti On, ki maščuje kri [Svojega ljudstva, prelito po krivici], se jih spominja; On ne pozabi klica užaloščenega, (ubogega in ponižnega). 
[9:13] Usmili se me in bodi prijazen do mene, o Gospod; premisli kako sem užaloščen od tistih, ki me sovražijo, Ti, ki me vzdiguješ od duri smrti, 
[9:14] da lahko prikažem, (preštejem in naglas povem) vse Tvoje hvale! V durih hčere Sionske se bom radostil v Tvoji rešitvi duš in Tvoji rešujoči pomoči. 
[9:15] Narodi so se pogreznili v jamo, ki so jo sami naredili; v mrežo, ki so jo skrili, se je ujelo njihovo lastno stopalo. 
[9:16] Gospod se je dal spoznati; On izvršuje sodbo; zlobni so ujeti v delo svojih lastnih rok. Higgaion [premišljevanje], sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! 
[9:17] Zlobni bo [prenagljeno, v prezgodnji smrti], vrnjen v Šeol, (kraj duhov preminulih zlobnih), celo vsi narodi, ki pozabijo ali so pozabljivi glede Boga. 
[9:18] Kajti pomoči potreben ne bo vedno pozabljen in pričakovanje in upanje krotkih ter ubogih ne bo propadlo za vselej. 
[9:19] Vzdigni se, o Gospod! Naj ne prevlada človek; naj bodo narodi sojeni pred Teboj. 
[9:20] Postavi jih v strah, [naj spoznajo svojo slabotno naravo], o Gospod, da bi se narodi lahko spoznali, da so samo ljudje. Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! 
[10:1] ZAKAJ TI stojiš daleč stran, o Gospod? Zakaj se Ti skrivaš, [zastiraš Svoje oči], v časih stiske, (nadloge in obupa)? 
[10:2] Zlobni v ponosu in ošabnosti goreče zasledujejo in preganjajo uboge; naj se ujamejo v naklepih, ki so si jih izmislili. 
[10:3] Kajti zloben človek se baha, (poje hvalnice) o željah svojega lastnega srca, pohlepen po dobičku pa preklinja in zaničuje, da, zanika in prezira Gospoda. 
[10:4] Zlobni v ponosu svoje vesti ne bo iskal, povpraševal po |Bogu| in hrepenel po Bogu; vse njegove misli so, da ni Boga, [torej On nikoli ne kaznuje]. 
[10:5] Njegove poti so bedne [ali obstajajo] v vseh časih; Tvoje sodbe, [Gospod], so daleč nad |njegovim pogledom| in visoko izven njegovega pogleda, [tako da nikoli ne razmišlja o njih]; glede vseh njegovih nasprotnikov, prezirljivo viha nos nad njimi in se jim posmehuje. 
[10:6] V svojem srcu misli: "Ne bom omahnil; kajti skozi vse rodove ne bom prišel v potrebo ali bil v nesreči." 
[10:7] Njegova usta so polna preklinjanja, prevare, zatiranja, (sleparstva); pod njegovim jezikom so težave in greh, (vragolija in zlo). 
[10:8] Sedi v zasedi v naseljih; na skrivnih mestih ubije nedolžnega; preži na ubogega, (nemočnega in nesrečnega). 
[10:9] V skrivališčih preži kakor lev v svoji goščavi; leži in čaka, da bi zgrabil ubogega, (nemočnega in nesrečnega); ubogega zgrabi, ko ga pritegne v svojo mrežo. 
[10:10] [Plen] zdrobi, potegne navzdol; in nemočni pade pod njegovimi mogočnimi [kremplji]. 
[10:11] [Sovražnik] v svojem srcu misli: "Bog je čisto pozabil; On je skril Svoje obličje; On nikoli ne bo videl [mojega dejanja]." 
[10:12] Vzdigni se, o Gospod! O Bog, dvigni Svojo roko; ne pozabi ponižnega, [potrpežljivega in zlomljenega]. 
[10:13] Zakaj zloben [mož] obsoja, (prezira in zanika) Boga? Zakaj je v svojem srcu pomislil: "Ti ne boš poklical na odgovor?" 
[10:14] Ti si to videl; da, Ti opaziš muko in žalost, (nevšečnost), da jo povrneš s Svojo roko. Nesrečni se zateka k Tebi; Ti si pomočnik siroti. 
[10:15] Zlomi roko zlobneža; in glede hudobneža, preiskuj njegovo zlobo, dokler je Ti ne najdeš več. 
[10:16] Gospod je Kralj za vedno in večno; narodi bodo izginili iz Njegove dežele. 
[10:17] O Gospod, Ti si slišal željo in hrepenenje ponižnega in zatiranega; Ti boš pripravil in okrepil in usmerjal njihova srca, Tvoje uho bo pripravljeno slišati, 
[10:18] da boš prisodil pravico sirotam in zatiranim, tako da jih ne bo več strašil človek, ki je iz zemlje. 
[11:1]  V Gospoda se zatekam [in polagam svoje zaupanje]; kako mi lahko rečete: "Zbeži kakor ptič k svoji gori?" 
[11:2] Kajti poglejte, zlobni upogibajo lok; svojo puščico nastavljajo na tetivo, da bi v temi [skrivoma] lahko streljali na iskrenega v srcu. 
[11:3] Če so temelji uničeni, kaj lahko stori [nepopustljivo] pravični ali kaj je On, [Pravični], izdelal ali dosegel? 
[11:4] Gospod je v Svojem svetem templju; Gospodov prestol je v nebesih. Njegove oči zapazijo; Njegove veke preizkušajo in potrjujejo človeške otroke.  
[11:5] Gospod preizkuša in potrjuje [nepopustljivo] pravičnega, toda Njegova duša sovraži zlobnega in tistega, ki ljubi nasilje.  
[11:6] Na zlobne bo On deževal hitro gorljivi premog ali zanke; ogenj, žveplo in [strašen] žgoč veter bo delež njihove čaše. 
[11:7] Kajti Gospod je [nepopustljivo] pravičen, On ljubi pravična dejanja; iskreni bodo gledali Njegovo obličje ali On gleda iskrenega. 
[12:1]  POMAGAJ, GOSPOD! Kajti tu ni več načelnih in bogaboječih ljudi; zvestoba in zvesti izginjajo izmed človeških sinov. 
[12:2] Vsak svojemu sosedu govori besede, ki so neuporabne ali brezvredne ali neresnične; z laskavimi ustnicami in dvoličnim srcem [varljivo] govorijo. 
[12:3] Naj Gospod odreže vse laskave ustnice in jezike, ki govorijo ponosno bahanje, 
[12:4] tiste, ki pravijo: "Z našimi jeziki prevladamo; naše ustnice so samo naše, [da jim ukazujemo po naši volji] – kdo je gospod in gospodar nad nami?" 
[12:5] "Sedaj se bom vzdignil," govori Gospod, "ker so ubogi zatirani, zaradi vzdihov pomoči potrebnih; Jaz ga bom postavil na varno in v rešitev duše, po kateri hrepeni." 
[12:6] Gospodove besede in obljube so čiste besede, kakor srebro prečiščeno v zemeljski peči, sedemkrat ponovno prečiščene. 
[12:7] Ti jih boš hranil in ohranil, o Gospod; Ti nas boš varoval in obvaroval pred tem [hudobnim] rodom za vedno. 
[12:8] Zlobni hodijo ali se plazijo naokrog na vseh straneh, kakor je podlost poveličevana [in nepristnost visoko cenjena] med človeškimi sinovi. 
[13:1]  KAKO DOLGO boš Ti pozabljal name, o Gospod? Za vedno? Kako dolgo boš Ti skrival Svoj obraz pred menoj? 
[13:2] Kako dolgo moram v sebi kopičiti skrbi in imeti bolest v svojem srcu dan za dnem? Kako dolgo se bo moj sovražnik povzdigoval nad menoj? 
[13:3] Preudari in odgovori mi, o Gospod, moj Bog; razsvetli oči [moje vere, da bom v smolnati temi zagledal Tvoj obraz], da ne zaspim spanja mrtvih, 
[13:4] da ne bi moj sovražnik rekel: "Prevladal sem nad njim," in tisti, ki me mučijo, se radostijo kadar sem pobit. 
[13:5] Toda veroval sem, se zanašal in bil prepričan v Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost; moje srce se bo radostilo in bo razigrano v Tvoji rešitvi duše. 
[13:6] Pel bom Gospodu, ker je On radodarno ravnal z menoj. 
[14:1]  [Praznoglavi] bedak je rekel v svojem srcu: "Ni Boga." Pokvarjeni so, storili so gnusna dejanja; nobenega ni, ki dela dobro ali pravilno.  
[14:2] Gospod je pogledal dol iz nebes na človeške otroke, da bi videl, ali jih je bilo kaj, ki bi razumeli, ravnali modro in iskali Boga, spraševali po |Njem| in o Njem in Ga potrebovali [iz življenjske potrebe]. 
[14:3] Vsi so zašli, vsi skupaj so postali izprijeni; nobenega ni, ki dela dobro ali pravilno, ne, niti enega.  
[14:4] Ali vsi delavci krivičnosti nimajo nobenega spoznanja, tisti, ki jedo moje ljudstvo, kakor jedo kruh in ki ne kličejo Gospoda? 
[14:5] Tam bodo v velikem strahu, [dobesedno – strašno jih bo groza], kajti Bog je z rodom [brezkompromisno] pravičnih, (tistih iskrenih in v pravem odnosu z Njim). 
[14:6] Vi [hudobneži] bi osramotili in zmedli načrte ubogega in potrpežljivega, toda Gospod je njegovo varno zatočišče. 
[14:7] Oh, da bi Izraelova rešitev duš prišla iz Siona! Ko bo Gospod obnovil usode Svojega ljudstva, potem se bo Jakob radostil in Izrael bo vesel.  
[15:1]  GOSPOD, KDO bo [začasno] bival v Tvojem svetišču? Kdo bo [stalno] bival na Tvoji sveti gori? 
[15:2] Kdor hodi in živi iskreno in brez krivde, ki dela pošteno in pravično ter govori in razmišlja resnico v svojem srcu, 
[15:3] kdor ne obrekuje s svojim jezikom, niti ne dela hudega svojemu prijatelju, niti ne sprejema obrekovanja proti svojemu sosedu; 
[15:4] v čigar očeh je hudobni preziran, toda kdor časti tiste, ki se bojijo Gospoda, (ki Ga častijo in obožujejo); ki se obvezuje v svojo lastno škodo in tega ne spreminja; 
[15:5] [kdor] ne daje svojega denarja za obresti [nekomu izmed svojih lastnih ljudi] in ki ne bo sprejel podkupnine zoper nedolžnega. Kdor počne te stvari, ne bo nikoli omajan.  
[16:1]  VARUJ in ščiti me, o Bog, kajti v Tebi sem našel zatočišče in Vate polagam svoje zaupanje in |Vate| se skrijem. 
[16:2] Gospodu pravim: "Ti si moj Gospod; ničesar nimam razen Tebe ali večjega kakor si Ti." 
[16:3] Kar se tiče bogaboječih (svetih), ki so v deželi, so odlični, plemeniti in sijajni, v njih je vse moje zadovoljstvo. 
[16:4] Pomnožene bodo bolesti tistih, ki izberejo drugega boga; ne bom ponujal njihovih krvavih pitnih daritev ali na svoje ustnice jemal njihovih imen. 
[16:5] Gospod je moj izbranec in določen delež, moja čaša; Ti držiš in ohranjaš mojo usodo. 
[16:6] Vrvi so zame padle na prijetnih krajih; da, dobro dediščino imam. 
[16:7] Blagoslavljal bom Gospoda, ki mi je dal nasvet; da, moje srce me poučuje v nočnih časih. 
[16:8] Gospoda nenehno postavljam pred seboj; ker je On na moji desnici, me ne bo odneslo. 
[16:9] Zato je moje srce veselo in moja slava, [moj notranji jaz], se radosti; tudi moje telo bo počivalo in prepričano prebivalo na varnem, 
[16:10] kajti Ti me ne boš zapustil Šeolu (kraju mrtvih), niti ne boš trpel, da bi Tvoj sveti [Sveti] videl trohnenje.  
[16:11] Ti mi boš pokazal pot življenja; v Tvoji prisotnosti je polnost radosti, na Tvoji desnici so užitki na veke vekov.  
[17:1]  USLIŠI PRAVICO (moj pravičen primer), o Gospod; prisluhni mojemu predirljivemu, ganljivemu kriku! Nastavi uho moji molitvi, ki prihaja iz nehlinjenih in nezvijačnih ust. 
[17:2] Naj moja obsodba na zagovarjanje pride od Tebe! Naj Tvoje oči zagledajo stvari, ki so pravične in poštene. 
[17:3] Ti si potrdil moje srce; Ti si me obiskal ponoči; Ti si me preizkusil, pa ničesar nisi našel, [nobenega hudega namena v meni]; odločil sem se, da moja usta ne bodo grešila. 
[17:4] Glede človekovih del, po besedi Tvojih ust sem se izogibal poti nasilnežev (poti uničevalca). 
[17:5] Moji koraki so se tesno držali Tvojih poti, [sledi Njega, ki je šel pred menoj]; moja stopala niso zdrsnila. 
[17:6] Klical sem k Tebi, o Bog, kajti Ti me boš uslišal; k meni nagni Svoje uho in usliši moj govor. 
[17:7] Pokaži Svojo veličastno ljubečo-skrbnost, o Ti, ki s Svojo desnico rešuješ tiste, ki zaupajo in se zatekajo Vate, pred tistimi, ki se vzdigujejo zoper njih. 
[17:8] Varuj in straži me kakor punčico Svojega očesa; skrij me v senci Svojih peruti, 
[17:9] pred zlobnimi, ki me plenijo in zatirajo, mojimi smrtnimi nasprotniki, ki me obdajajo. 
[17:10] Ograjeni so v svoji lastni blaginji in svoja srca so zaprli pred usmiljenjem; s svojimi usti izražajo pretirane zahteve in ponosno in arogantno govorijo. 
[17:11] Izsledijo nas na vsakem koraku, ki ga naredimo; sedaj nas obdajajo; naravnali so svoje oči, da bi nas vrgli ob tla, 
[17:12] kakor lev, požrešen in željan, da bi raztrgal svoj plen in kakor mlad lev, ki preži na skritih mestih. 
[17:13] Vzdigni se, o Gospod! Sooči se z njimi in prehiti jih, zruši jih! S Svojim mečem osvobodi moje življenje pred zlobnimi, 
[17:14] pred ljudmi po Svoji roki, o Gospod, pred ljudmi iz tega sveta, [temi ubogimi nočnimi molji], čigar delež v življenju je nesmiseln in prazen. Njihovi trebuhi so napolnjeni s Tvojimi skritimi zakladi, [s tem kar si Ti shranil]; njihovi otroci so presiti in ostanek [svojega] bogastva zapustijo svojim dojenčkom. 
[17:15] Kar se mene tiče, bom še naprej gledal Tvoje obličje v pravičnosti, (pravilnosti, pravici in pravem odnosu s Teboj); popolnoma zadovoljen bom, ko se prebudim, [da se znajdem] zroč Tvojo obliko [in imam prijeten odnos s Teboj]. 
[18:1]  LJUBIM TE strastno in predano, o Gospod, moja moč. 
[18:2] Gospod je moja skala, moja trdnjava in moj osvoboditelj; moj Bog, moja prodorna in trdna moč, Vate bom zaupal in se zatekal, moj ščit in rog rešitve moje duše, moj visoki stolp.  
[18:3] Klical bom h Gospodu, ki naj bo hvaljen; in tako bom rešen pred svojimi sovražniki.  
[18:4] Vrvi ali okovi smrti so me obdali in tokovi brezbožnosti in hudourniki pogube so me preplašili. 
[18:5] Vrvi Šeola, (kraja mrtvih), so me obdale; nadme so prišle smrtne pasti in me izzvale. 
[18:6] V svoji stiski, [ko sem bil navidezno ujet], sem klical h Gospodu in vpil k svojemu Bogu; On je uslišal moj glas iz Svojega svetišča (nebeškega prebivališča) in moj krik je prišel pred Njega, [prav] v Njegova ušesa. 
[18:7] Nato se je zemlja stresla in zamajala, tudi temelji gora so vztrepetali; se premaknili in stresli, kajti On je bil ogorčen in jezen. 
[18:8] Vzdignil se je dim iz Njegovih nosnic; in blisk iz Njegovih ust je požiral; zaradi njega je bilo vžgano oglje. 
[18:9] On je upognil tudi podaljšek nebes in prišel dol; in gosta tema je bila pod Njegovimi stopali. 
[18:10] In On je jahal na kerubu [nevihte] in [naglo] letel; da, On je hitel s krili vetra. 
[18:11] On je temo naredil za Svoje tajno skrivališče; kakor Njegov paviljon, (Njegov baldahin), so bile okrog in okrog Njega temne vode in gosti oblaki ozračij. 
[18:12] Iz blišča pred Njim so prihajali skozi Njegove goste oblake zrna toče in žareče oglje. 
[18:13] Tudi iz podaljška nebes je zagrmel Gospod in Najvišji je izustil Svoj glas med točo in žarečim ogljem. 
[18:14] In On je poslal Svoje puščice in jih razkropil; On je vzplamenel bliske in jih pognal v beg. 
[18:15] Nato so se pokazala dna morja in temelji sveta so ležali razkriti ob Tvojih grajah, o Gospod, ob izbruhu sape Tvojih nosnic. 
[18:16] On je segel iz višave, On me je vzel; On me je potegnil iz mnogih vodá. 
[18:17] Osvobodil me je pred mojim močnim sovražnikom in pred tistimi, ki so me sovražili in me prezirali, kajti zame so bili premočni. 
[18:18] Izzivali so me in na dan moje nesreče prišli nadme, toda Gospod je bil moja opora in moja pomoč. 
[18:19] On me je privedel tudi na planjavo: On me je reševal, ker je bil On zadovoljen z menoj in se je razveseljeval v meni. 
[18:20] Gospod me je nagradil glede na mojo pravičnost, (mojo zavestno neoporečnost in iskrenost z Njim); glede na čistost mojih rok mi je On povrnil. 
[18:21] Kajti Gospodove poti sem ohranil in nisem zlobno zapustil svojega Boga. 
[18:22] Kajti vsi Njegovi odloki so bili pred menoj in Njegovih zakonov nisem dal stran od sebe. 
[18:23] Pred Njim sem bil iskren in z Njim kreposten, vedno [na preži], da bi se ohranil prost pred grehom in krivdo. 
[18:24] Zato mi je Gospod povrnil glede na mojo pravičnost, (moje poštenje in pravilen odnos z Njim), glede na čistost mojih rok v Njegovem pogledu. 
[18:25] S prijaznim in usmiljenim se boš Ti pokazal prijaznega in usmiljenega, z iskrenim človekom se boš Ti sam pokazal iskrenega, 
[18:26] s čistim se boš Ti pokazal čistega in s sprijenim se boš Ti pokazal nasprotnega. 
[18:27] Kajti Ti osvobajaš trpeče in ponižne ljudi, toda ponižal boš tiste z ošabnimi pogledi. 
[18:28] Kajti Ti povzročaš, da je moja svetilka prižgana in da sveti; Gospod, moj Bog, osvetljuje mojo temo. 
[18:29] Kajti s Teboj lahko tečem skozi trume in s svojim Bogom lahko preskočim zid. 
[18:30] Kar se Boga tiče, Njegova pot je popolna! Gospodova beseda je preizkušena in preverjena; On je ščit vsem tistim, ki se zatekajo |Vanj| in svoje zaupanje polagajo Vanj. 
[18:31] Kajti kdo je Bog, razen Gospoda? Ali kdo je skala, razen našega Boga, 
[18:32] Boga, ki me opasuje z močjo in mojo pot dela popolno? 
[18:33] On dela moja stopala kakor stopala košute, [zmožne čvrsto stati ali napredovati na nevarnih višinah preizkušnje in težave]; On me varno postavlja na moje višine. 
[18:34] On uči moje roke za vojno, tako da moje roke lahko upognejo bronasti lok. 
[18:35] Ti si mi dal tudi ščit Svoje rešitve in Tvoja desnica me je držala pokonci; Tvoja blagost in blagohotnost sta me naredili imenitnega. 
[18:36] Ti si dal obilo prostora za moje stopinje pod menoj, da moja stopala ne bi zdrsnila. 
[18:37] Preganjal sem svoje sovražnike in jih prehitel; tudi se nisem ponovno obrnil, dokler niso bili pokončani. 
[18:38] Zadel sem jih tako, da niso bili sposobni vstati; ranjeni so padli pod moja stopala. 
[18:39] Kajti Ti si me opasal z močjo za bitko; Ti si pod menoj podjarmil tiste, ki so se vzdignili zoper mene in povzročili, da so se uklonili. 
[18:40] Ti si tudi storil, da moji sovražniki k meni obračajo hrbte, da lahko odrežem tiste, ki me sovražijo. 
[18:41] Oni so vpili [po pomoč], toda nobenega ni bilo, ki bi jih osvobodil – celo h Gospodu, toda On jim ni odgovoril. 
[18:42] Potem sem jih zmlel kakor prah pred vetrom; izpraznil sem jih ven kakor umazanijo in blato s cest. 
[18:43] Ti si me rešil pred pričkanji ljudi; Ti si me naredil za poglavarja narodov; narod, ki ga nisem poznal, mi je služil. 
[18:44] Takoj, ko so slišali o meni, so me ubogali; tujci so se klečeplazno podredili in mi navidezno izročili ubogljivost. 
[18:45] Tujci so se ustrašili in trepetajoč prišli iz svojih votlin ali oporišč. 
[18:46] Gospod živi! Blagoslovljena bodi moja skala; in naj bo vzvišen Bog rešitve moje duše, 
[18:47] Bog, ki me maščuje in ljudstva podjarmlja pod mene, 
[18:48] ki me osvobaja pred mojimi sovražniki; da, Ti me dviguješ nad tiste, ki se vzdigujejo zoper mene; Ti me osvobajaš pred nasilnežem. 
[18:49] Zato se bom zahvaljeval in Te povzdigoval, o Gospod, med narodi in pel hvalnice Tvojemu imenu.  
[18:50] Čudovite osvoboditve in zmage daje On Svojemu kralju; in On izkazuje usmiljenje in neomajno ljubezen Svojemu maziljencu Davidu in njegovemu potomstvu na veke.  
[19:1]  PODALJŠEK NEBES razglaša Božjo slavo; in nebesni svod prikazuje in sporoča Njegovo ročno delo.  
[19:2] Dan za dnem izliva govor in noč za nočjo naznanja znanje. 
[19:3] Nobenega govora niti izrečene besede ni [od zvezd]; njihovega glasu ni slišati. 
[19:4] In vendar njihov glas, [kakor dokaz], prežarja vso zemljo, njihovi izreki do konca sveta. Iz podaljška nebes je Bog naredil šotor za sonce,  
[19:5] ki je kakor ženin, ki prihaja iz svojih prostorov; in se radosti kakor krepek mož, da teče svojo pot. 
[19:6] Njegovo napredovanje je od konca podaljška nebes in njegov krog do njegovih koncev; in ničesar, [da, nihče] ni skrit pred njegovo vročino. 
[19:7] Gospodova postava je popolna, obnavlja [celotno] osebnost; Gospodovo pričevanje je zanesljivo, preprostega dela modrega. 
[19:8] Gospodova navodila so prava, razveseljujejo srce; Gospodova zapoved je čista in svetla, razsvetljuje oči. 
[19:9] [Častitljiv] strah Gospodov je čist, traja večno; vsi Gospodovi odloki so resnični in pravični. 
[19:10] Bolj naj bodo zaželeni kakor zlato, celo kakor veliko čistega zlata: so tudi slajši od medu in kapljanja iz satovja. 
[19:11] Poleg tega je z njimi Tvoj služabnik posvarjen, (opomnjen, razsvetljen in voden); in v njihovem ohranjanju je čudovita nagrada. 
[19:12] Kdo lahko razloči svoje pomote in napake? Očisti me od skritih [in nezavednih] krivd. 
[19:13] Svojega služabnika obvaruj tudi pred grehi prevzetnosti; naj nimajo oblasti nad menoj! Potem bom brez krivde in bom nedolžen ter prost velikega prestopka. 
[19:14] Naj bodo besede mojih ust in premišljevanja mojega srca sprejemljiva v Tvojem pogledu, o Gospod, moja [trdna, nepropustna] skala in moj odkupitelj. 
[20:1]  NAJ ti Gospod odgovori na dan stiske! Naj te ime Jakobovega Boga postavi visoko [in te brani]; 
[20:2] pošlje ti pomoč iz svetišča in podporo, poživi in pojača te s Siona; 
[20:3] spomni se vseh tvojih daritev in sprejme tvojo žgalno žrtev.
[20:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Naj te On usliši v skladu z željami tvojega srca in izpolni vse tvoje načrte. 
[20:5] Ob tvoji rešitvi duše bomo [vpili v] zmagoslavju in zmagi in v imenu našega Boga bomo vzdignili naše zastave. Naj Gospod izpolni vse tvoje zahteve. 
[20:6] Sedaj vem, da Gospod rešuje Svojega maziljenca; On mu bo odgovoril iz Njegovih svetih nebes z rešilno močjo Njegove desnice. 
[20:7] Nekateri zaupajo v |bojne vozove| in se ponašajo z bojnimi vozovi, nekateri pa s konji, toda mi bomo zaupali in se ponašali z imenom Gospoda, našega Boga. 
[20:8] Oni so upognjeni in zrušeni, toda mi smo vzdignjeni in stojimo pokončno. 
[20:9] O Gospod, daj zmago; naj nam Kralj odgovori kadar kličemo. 
[21:1]  KRALJ [David] se bo radostil v Tvoji moči, o Gospod; in kako veličastno se bo radostil v Tvoji rešitvi duše! 
[21:2] Ti si mu dal željo njegovega srca in nisi zadržal zahteve njegovih ustnic.
[21:3]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Kajti Ti pošiljaš blagoslove dobrih stvari, da ga srečajo; Ti na njegovo glavo postavljaš krono iz čistega zlata. 
[21:4] On Te je prosil življenja in Ti si mu ga dal – dolgo življenje za vedno in večno. 
[21:5] Njegova slava je čudovita zaradi Tvoje pomoči; blišč in veličastvo si Ti položil nanj. 
[21:6] Kajti Ti ga delaš, da je blagoslovljen in v blagoslov za večno; Ti ga delaš izredno veselega z radostjo Tvoje prisotnosti.  
[21:7] Kajti kralj veruje, se zanaša na |Gospoda| in je prepričan v Gospoda in zaradi usmiljenja ter stanovitne ljubezni Najvišjega ne bo nikoli omahnil. 
[21:8] Tvoja roka bo našla vse Tvoje sovražnike; Tvoja desnica bo našla vse tiste, ki Te sovražijo. 
[21:9] Ti jih boš naredil, kot če bi bili v žareči peči v času Tvoje jeze; Gospod jih bo požrl v Svojem besu in ogenj jih bo popolnoma použil. 
[21:10] Njihove potomce boš Ti iztrebil iz zemlje in njihove sinove izmed človeških otrok. 
[21:11] Kajti proti Tebi so načrtovali hudobijo; sprejeli so škodljiv načrt, katerega niso sposobni izvršiti. 
[21:12] Kajti Ti jih boš prisilil k begu; Ti boš v njihove obraze nameril Svoj lok [božanske pravice]. 
[21:13] Bodi vzvišen, Gospod, v Svoji moči; peli bomo in hvalili Tvojo oblast. 
[22:1]  MOJ BOG, moj Bog, zakaj si me Ti zapustil? Zakaj si Ti tako daleč od pomoči meni in od besed mojih vzdihov?  
[22:2] O moj Bog, kličem podnevi, toda Ti ne odgovoriš; in ponoči nisem miren ali ne najdem počitka. 
[22:3] Toda Ti si svet, o Ti, ki prebivaš v [svetišču, kjer] [so darovane] Izraelove hvalnice. 
[22:4] Naši očetje so zaupali Vate; zaupali so, (se naslanjali |Nate| in se zanašali Nate in so bili prepričani) in Ti si jih osvobodil. 
[22:5] Klicali so k Tebi in so bili osvobojeni; zaupali so, se naslanjali na |Tebe| in se prepričano zanašali na Tebe in niso bili osramočeni ali zbegani ali razočarani. 
[22:6] Toda jaz sem črv in ne človek; prezir ljudem in zaničevan od ljudstva.  
[22:7] Vsi, ki me vidijo, se mi smejijo in me zasmehujejo; zmrdujejo se in zmajujejo z glavo, rekoč:  
[22:8] "Zaupal je in se prepustil Gospodu, da ga bo On osvobodil. Naj ga On osvobodi, videč, da se On razveseljuje v njem!"  
[22:9] In vendar si Ti ta, ki me je potegnil iz maternice; Ti si mi dal upati in zaupati, ko sem bil na prsih svoje matere. 
[22:10] Nate sem bil vržen celó od rojstva; od trebuha moje matere si bil Ti moj Bog. 
[22:11] Ne bodi daleč od mene, kajti stiska je blizu, pa ni nikogar, ki bi pomagal. 
[22:12] Obdalo me je mnogo [sovražnikom podobnih] bikov; močni Bašánski biki so me utesnili.  
[22:13] Svoja usta so na široko odprli proti meni, kakor plena željan in rjoveč lev. 
[22:14] Izlil sem se kakor voda in vse moje kosti so iz sklepov. Moje srce je kakor vosek; omehčano [z bolečino] in raztopljeno v meni. 
[22:15] Moja moč je izsušena kot odlomek lončenine; [od žeje] se moj jezik lepi na moje čeljusti; in Ti si me privedel v smrtni prah.  
[22:16] Kajti obdali so me [kakor krdelo] psov; drhal hudobnežev me je obkrožila, prebodli so moje roke in moja stopala.  
[22:17] Lahko preštejem vse svoje kosti; [hudobneži] zijajo vame.  
[22:18] Med seboj si razdeljujejo moja oblačila in žrebajo za mojo suknjo, (dolgo, srajci podobno oblačilo, brezšivno podtuniko).  
[22:19] Toda ne bodi daleč od mene, o Gospod; o moja pomoč, hiti mi pomagat! 
[22:20] Osvobodi moje življenje pred mečem, moje ljubo življenje, [moje edino] pred močjo psa, [povzročitelja usmrtitve]. 
[22:21] Reši me iz levjega žrela; kajti Ti si mi [prijazno] odgovoril izpred rogov divjih volov. 
[22:22] Razglašal bom Tvoje ime svojim bratom; v sredi zbora Te bom hvalil.  
[22:23] Vi, ki se bojite, (častite in obožujete) Gospoda, hvalite Ga! Vsi vi Jakobovi potomci, slavite Ga. Bojte se, (častite in obožujte) Ga, vsi vi, Izraleovi potomci. 
[22:24] Kajti On ni preziral ali zaničeval bede trpljenja trpečega; niti Svojega obraza On ni skrival pred njim, temveč ko je klical k Njemu, je On slišal. 
[22:25] Moja hvalnica naj bo o Tebi v velikem zboru. Njemu bom izpolnil svoje zaobljube, [dane v času stiske], pred tistimi, ki se Ga bojijo, (častijo in obožujejo). 
[22:26] Ubogi in trpeči bodo jedli in bodo nasičeni; hvalili bodo Gospoda – tisti, ki [prizadevno] iščejo, poizvedujejo o |Njem| in po Njem in Ga potrebujejo [kot svojo največjo potrebo]. Naj bodo vaša srca pohitrena sedaj in na veke! 
[22:27] Vsi konci zemlje se bodo spomnili in se obrnili h Gospodu in vse družine narodov se bodo priklonile in oboževale pred Teboj, 
[22:28] zakaj kraljevanje in kraljestvo sta Gospodova in On je vladar nad narodi. 
[22:29] Vsi mogočneži na zemlji bodo jedli [v hvaležnosti] in oboževanju; vsi tisti, ki se pogreznejo v prah, se bodo priklonili pred Njim, celo kdor samega sebe ni mogel ohraniti pri življenju. 
[22:30] Potomstvo Mu bo služilo; o Gospodu bodo govorili prihodnjemu rodu. 
[22:31] Prišli bodo in bodo razglasili Njegovo pravičnost ljudstvu, ki bo šele rojeno - da je On to storil, [da je dokončano]!  
[23:1]  GOSPOD je moj Pastir, [da me hrani, vodi in ščiti], ne bom v pomanjkanju. 
[23:2] Na [svežih, mehkih] zelenih pašnikih mi daje ležišče; vodi me ob mirnih vodah in polnih počitka.  
[23:3] On osvežuje in obnavlja moje življenje, (mojo osebnost); On me vodi po poteh pravičnosti, [iskrenosti in pravilnega odnosa z Njim – ne ker bi si to zaslužil, temveč] zaradi Njegovega imena. 
[23:4] Da, čeprav hodim skozi [globoko, mračno] dolino smrtne sence, se ne bom bal ali strahoval nobene hudobije, ker si Ti z menoj; Tvoja šiba, [da me varuje] in Tvoja palica, [da me vodi], ti me tolažita. 
[23:5] Pred menoj pripravljaš mizo v navzočnosti mojih sovražnikov. Mojo glavo maziliš z oljem; moja [polna] čaša prekipeva. 
[23:6] Zagotovo ali samo dobrota, usmiljenje in zanesljiva ljubezen me bodo spremljale vse dni mojega življenja in skozi vso dolžino mojih dni bo hiša Gospodova [in Njegova prisotnost] moje prebivališče. 
[24:1]  ZEMLJA je Gospodova in njena polnost, svet in tisti, ki prebivajo na njem.  
[24:2] Kajti On jo je osnoval na morjih in jo uredil na tokovih in rekah. 
[24:3] Kdo se bo povzpel na goro Gospodovo? Ali kdo bo stal v Njegovem svetišču? 
[24:4] Kdor ima čiste roke in neoporečno srce, ki sebe ni povzdignil do hinavstva ali do tega, kar je lažnivo, niti ne prisega varljivo.  
[24:5] On bo prejel blagoslov od Gospoda in pravičnost od Boga rešitve svoje duše. 
[24:6] To je rod, [opis] tistih, ki Ga iščejo, [ki poizvedujejo o |Njem| in po Njem in Ga neizbežno zahtevajo], ki iščejo Tvoj obraz, [O Bog] Jakobov. 
[24:7]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Vzdignite svoje glave, o ve duri; in bodite vzdignjene, ve starodavna vrata, da lahko vstopi Kralj slave. 
[24:8] Kdo je Kralj slave? Gospod, močan in mogočen, Gospod, mogočen v bitki. 
[24:9] Vzdignite svoje glave, o ve duri; da, dvignite jih, ve starodavna vrata, da lahko vstopi Kralj slave. 
[24:10] Kdo je [torej On], ta Kralj slave? Gospod nad bojevniki, On je Kralj slave. Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! 
[25:1]  K TEBI, o Gospod, prinašam svoje življenje. 
[25:2] O moj Bog, zaupam, zanašam, naslanjam se na |Tebe| in Vate sem prepričan. Naj ne bom osramočen ali [moje upanje Vate] naj ne bo razočarano; naj moji sovražniki ne slavijo zmage nad menoj. 
[25:3] Da, naj ne bo nihče, ki zaupa |Vate| in poln upanja čaka ter išče Tebe, osramočen ali razočaran; naj bodo osramočeni tisti, ki zapustijo pravico ali brez vzroka ravnajo izdajalsko. 
[25:4] Pokaži mi Svoje poti, o Gospod; uči me Svojih steza. 
[25:5] Vodi me v Svoji resnici in zvestobi in uči me, kajti Ti si Bog rešitve moje duše, kajti [samo] Tebe [in zgolj Tebe] [pričakujoče] čakam skozi ves dan. 
[25:6] Spomni se, o Gospod, Svojega nežnega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti; kajti bili sta od vekomaj. 
[25:7] Ne spominjaj se grehov, (spodrsljajev in šibkosti), moje mladosti ali mojih prestopkov; po Svojem usmiljenju in stanovitni ljubezni se me spominjaj zaradi Svoje dobrote, o Gospod. 
[25:8] Dober in iskren je Gospod; zato bo On učil grešnike na [Svoji] poti. 
[25:9] On vodi ponižnega v to, kar je pravilno in ponižnega On uči Svoje poti. 
[25:10] Vse Gospodove steze so usmiljenje in stanovitna ljubezen, celo resnica in zvestoba so njim, ki ohranijo Njegovo zavezo in Njegova pričevanja. 
[25:11] Zaradi Svojega imena, o Gospod, odpusti mojo krivico in mojo krivdo, kajti veliki [sta]. 
[25:12] Kdo je človek, ki se častitljivo boji in obožuje Gospoda? Njega bo On poučil o poti, ki naj si jo izbere. 
[25:13] On sam bo prebival sproščeno in njegovi potomci bodo podedovali deželo. 
[25:14] Skrivnost [prijetnega, zadovoljujočega druženja z] Gospodom imajo tisti, ki se Ga bojijo, (častijo in obožujejo) in On jim bo pokazal Svojo zavezo in jim razkril njen [globlji, notranji] pomen.  
[25:15] Moje oči so vedno obrnjene h Gospodu, kajti On bo moja stopala potegnil iz zanke. 
[25:16] [Gospod] obrni se k meni in bodi mi milostljiv, kajti osamljen sem in trpeč. 
[25:17] Težave mojega srca se množijo; izpelji me iz mojih stisk. 
[25:18] Poglej moje trpljenje in mojo bolečino in odpusti vse moje grehe, [v mislih in dejanjih]. 
[25:19] Preceni moje sovražnike, ker mrgolijo; sovražijo me s krutim sovraštvom. 
[25:20] O varuj me, Gospod in osvobodi me; naj ne bom osramočen ali razočaran, kajti moje zaupanje in moje zatočišče sta v Tebi. 
[25:21] Naj me neoporečnost in iskrenost ohranita, kajti jaz čakam na |Tebe| in Te pričakujem. 
[25:22] Odkupi Izraela, o Bog, iz vseh njihovih težav. 
[26:1]  BRANI ME, o Gospod, kajti hodil sem v svoji neoporečnosti; [pričakujoče] sem zaupal v |Gospoda|, se naslanjal na |Gospoda| in se brez kolebanja zanašal na Gospoda in ne bom zdrsnil. 
[26:2] Preišči me, o Gospod in potrdi me; preizkusi moje srce in moj razum. 
[26:3] Kajti Tvoja ljubeča-skrbnost mi je pred očmi in hodil sem [zvesto] v Tvoji resnici. 
[26:4] Ne sedam z lažnivci in ne družim se s tistimi, ki se pretvarjajo; 
[26:5] sovražim družbo hudobnežev in nočem posedati z zlobneži. 
[26:6] V nedolžnosti si bom umil roke in šel okoli Tvojega oltarja, o Gospod, 
[26:7] da lahko naredim glas zahvale slišen in lahko pripovedujem o vseh Tvojih čudežnih delih. 
[26:8] Gospod, jaz ljubim stanovanje Tvoje hiše in prostor, kjer prebiva Tvoja slava. 
[26:9] Ne zberi me skupaj z grešniki in ne odpravi me [z njimi], niti mojega življenja s krvoločneži, 
[26:10] v čigar rokah je zloba, njihove desnice pa so polne podkupnine. 
[26:11] Toda kar se mene tiče, jaz bom hodil v svoji neoporečnosti, odkupi me in mi bodi usmiljen ter milostljiv. 
[26:12] Moje stopalo stoji na ravnem kraju; v zborih bom blagoslavljal Gospoda. 
[27:1]  GOSPOD je moja svetloba in rešitelj moje duše – koga naj bi se bal ali strahoval? Gospod je Zatočišče in utrdba mojega življenja – pred kom naj bi trepetal? 
[27:2] Ko so zlobneži, celo moji sovražniki in moji nasprotniki prišli nadme, da bi požrli moje meso, so se spotaknili in padli. 
[27:3] Čeprav se jih zelo veliko utabori proti meni, se moje srce ne bo plašilo; čeprav se vojna vzdigne zoper mene, [celo takrat] bom v tem prepričan. 
[27:4] Eno sem prosil Gospoda, to bom iskal in spraševal po |tem| in [vztrajno] zahteval: da lahko prebivam v hiši Gospodovi, [v Njegovi prisotnosti], vse dni svojega življenja, da zagledam in strmim nad lepoto, [prijetno privlačnostjo in očarljivo ljubkostjo] Gospoda in da premišljujem, proučujem in poizvedujem v Njegovem svetišču.  
[27:5] Kajti na dan stiske me bo On skril v Svojem zavetju; v skrivališču Svojega šotora me bo On skril; On me bo postavil visoko na skalo. 
[27:6] In sedaj bo moja glava vzdignjena nad moje sovražnike okrog mene; v Njegovem šotoru bom daroval daritve in klice radosti; pel bom, da, pel bom hvalnice Gospodu. 
[27:7] Usliši, o Gospod, kadar kličem na glas; imej usmiljenje in mi bodi milostljiv in mi odgovori! 
[27:8] Ti si rekel: "Išči Moj obraz, [poizveduj po |Moji prisotnosti| in zahtevaj Mojo prisotnost kot svojo življenjsko potrebo]." Moje srce Ti pravi: "Tvoj obraz, (Tvojo prisotnost), Gospod, bom iskal, poizvedoval po |Tebi| in zahteval [iz potrebe in na podlagi avtoritete Tvoje Besede]." 
[27:9] Svojega obraza ne skrij pred menoj; Svojega služabnika ne zavrni v jezi, Ti, ki si bil moja pomoč! Ne zavrzi me, niti me ne zapusti, o Bog rešitve moje duše! 
[27:10] Čeprav sta me moj oče in moja mati zapustila, me bo kljub temu Gospod vzel, [me posvojil kot Svojega otroka].  
[27:11] Uči me Svoje poti, o Gospod in vodi me po preprosti in ravni stezi zaradi mojih sovražnikov, [tistih, ki prežijo name]. 
[27:12] Ne izroči me volji mojih nasprotnikov, kajti zoper mene so se vzdignile lažne priče; izdihujejo krutost in nasilje. 
[27:13] [Kaj, le kaj, bi nastalo iz mene], če ne bi verjel, da bom v deželi živih videl Gospodovo dobroto! 
[27:14] Čakaj in upaj na |Gospoda| in pričakuj Gospoda; bodi hraber in znatnega poguma, naj bo tvoje srce močno in vzdržljivo. Da, čakaj na |Gospoda| in upaj na |Gospoda| in pričakuj Gospoda. 
[28:1]  K TEBI kličem, o Gospod, moja skala, ne bodi gluh in do mene molčeč, da ne bom, če boš Ti do mene molčeč, postal kakor tisti, ki gredo navzdol v jamo, [grob]. 
[28:2] Usliši glas moje ponižne prošnje, ko k Tebi kličem po pomoč, ko svoje roke dvigujem k Tvojemu najnotranjejšem svetišču, (Presvetemu). 
[28:3] Ne odvleci me stran skupaj z zlobnimi, skupaj z delavci krivičnosti, ki s svojimi sosedi govorijo mir, toda v njihovih srcih sta zlonamernost in vragolija. 
[28:4] Poplačaj jim glede na njihovo delo in glede na zlobnost njihovih dejanj; poplačaj jim glede na delo njihovih rok; vrni jim kar si zaslužijo.  
[28:5] Ker ne cenijo Gospodovih del, niti posegov Njegovih rok, jih bo On zrušil in jih ne bo ponovno zgradil. 
[28:6] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod, ker je On slišal glas mojih ponižnih prošenj. 
[28:7] Gospod je moja moč in moj [neprebojen] ščit; moje srce zaupa |Vanj|, se zanaša |Nanj| in se prepričano naslanja na Njega in pomagano mi je; zato se moje srce silno radosti in s svojo pesmijo Ga bom hvalil. 
[28:8] Gospod je njihova [nepopustljiva] moč in On je utrdba rešitve duše [meni], Njegovemu maziljencu. 
[28:9] Reši Svoje ljudstvo in blagoslovi Svojo dediščino; nahrani in pasi in nosi jih na veke. 
[29:1]  PRIPISUJTE Gospodu, o sinovi mogočnega, pripisujte Gospodu slavo in moč. 
[29:2] Dajte Gospodu slavo zaradi Njegovega imena; obožujte Gospoda v lepoti svetosti ali v svetem oblačilu. 
[29:3] Gospodov glas je nad vodami; Bog slave grmi; Gospod je nad mnogimi (velikimi) vodami. 
[29:4] Gospodov glas je močan; Gospodov glas je poln veličastva. 
[29:5] Gospodov glas lomi cedre; da, Gospod libanonske cedre lomi na koščke. 
[29:6] On jih tudi pripravi, da poskakujejo kakor tele; Libanon in Sirjón (gora Hermon), kakor mlad divji bivol. 
[29:7] Gospodov glas razkolje in razsvetli razvejane viličaste strele. 
[29:8] Gospodov glas povzroča, da divjina vztrepeta; Gospod trese kadéško divjino. 
[29:9] Gospodov glas povzroča, da košute skotijo svoje mladiče in Njegov glas razgali gozdove, medtem ko v Njegovem svetišču vsakdo pravi: "Slava!" 
[29:10] Gospod je prestoloval kot Kralj nad potopom; Gospod [še vedno] prestoluje kot Kralj, [in] na veke! 
[29:11] Gospod bo Svojim ljudem dal [neizčrpno in nepropustno] moč; Gospod bo Svoje ljudi blagoslovil z mirom. 
[30:1]  POVZDIGOVAL TE bom, o Gospod, kajti Ti si me vzdignil in nisi dopustil, da bi se moji sovražniki radostili nad menoj. 
[30:2] O Gospod, moj Bog, klical sem k Tebi in Ti si me ozdravil. 
[30:3] O Gospod, Ti si moje življenje privedel iz Šeola, (kraja mrtvih); Ti si me ohranjal živega, da ne bi šel dol v jamo, (grob). 
[30:4] Pojte Gospodu, o vi Njegovi sveti in dajte zahvalo ob spominjanju Njegovega svetega imena. 
[30:5] Kajti Njegova jeza je le za trenutek, toda Njegova naklonjenost je za vse življenje ali v Njegovi naklonjenosti je življenje. Jok lahko ostaja čez noč, toda zjutraj pride radost.  
[30:6] Kar se mene tiče, sem v svojem razcvetu rekel: "Nikoli ne bom omajan." 
[30:7] Po Svoji naklonjenosti, o Gospod, si me Ti postavil kot močno goro; Ti si skril Svoj obraz, jaz pa sem bil vznemirjen. 
[30:8] Klical sem k Tebi, o Gospod in h Gospodu sem ponižno prosil. 
[30:9] Kakšna korist je od moje krvi, ko grem dol v jamo, (grob)? Ali Te bo hvalil prah? Ali bo ljudem razglašal Tvojo resnico in zvestobo? 
[30:10] Usliši, o Gospod, imej usmiljenje in mi bodi milostljiv! O Gospod, bodi moj pomočnik! 
[30:11] Ti si moje žalovanje zame spremenil v ples; Ti si mi snel raševino in me opasal z veseljem, 
[30:12] da bi do konca moj jezik in moje srce in vse veličastvo znotraj mene lahko pelo hvalo Tebi in ne bi utihnilo. O Gospod, moj Bog, zahvaljeval se Ti bom na veke. 
[31:1]  VATE, o Gospod, polagam svoje upanje in iščem zatočišče; naj ne bom nikoli osramočen ali [imajoč svoje upanje v Tebi], razočaran; osvobodi me v Svoji pravičnosti! 
[31:2] Skloni k meni Svoje uho, hitro me osvobodi! Bodi moja skala zatočišča, močna trdnjava, da me rešiš! 
[31:3] Da, Ti si moja skala in moja trdnjava; zato me vodi in usmerjaj zaradi Svojega imena. 
[31:4] Potegni me iz mreže, ki so jo skrivaj nastavili zame, kajti Ti si moja moč in moja utrdba. 
[31:5] V Tvoje roke izročam svojega duha; Ti si me odkupil, o Gospod, Bog resnice in zvestobe.  
[31:6] [Ti in] jaz zaničujeva tiste, ki se ozirajo na ničeve malike; toda jaz zaupam v |Gospoda|, se zanašam na |Gospoda| in se prepričano naslanjam na Gospoda. 
[31:7] Razveselil in radostil se bom v Tvojem usmiljenju in stanovitni ljubezni, ker si Ti videl moje trpljenje, Ti si zabeležil stiske mojega življenja 
[31:8] in Ti me nisi dal v roko sovražnika, Ti si moja stopala postavil na plano. 
[31:9] Imej usmiljenje in bodi mi milostljiv, o Gospod, kajti v stiski sem; moje oko je oslabelo od žalosti, prav tako moj notranji jaz in moje telo. 
[31:10] Kajti svoje življenje preživljam v bolesti in svoja leta z vzdihovanjem; moja moč je odpovedala zaradi moje krivičnosti in celo moje kosti so se iztrošile. 
[31:11] Vsem svojim sovražnikom sem postal graja, toda posebno svojim sosedom in groza svojim znancem, ki na ulici bežijo pred menoj. 
[31:12] Pozabljen sem kakor mrtev človek in nor; sem kakor razbita posoda. 
[31:13] Kajti slišal sem obrekovanje mnogih; groza je na vsaki strani! Medtem ko so skupaj načrtovali proti meni, so spletkarili, da bi mi vzeli življenje. 
[31:14] Toda zaupal sem v |Tebe|, se zanašal na |Tebe| in bil prepričan Vate, o Gospod; rekel sem: "Ti si moj Bog." 
[31:15] Moji časi so v Tvojih rokah; osvobodi me iz rok mojih sovražnikov in tistih, ki me zasledujejo in me preganjajo. 
[31:16] Naj Tvoj obraz sije na Tvojega služabnika; reši me zavoljo Svojega usmiljenja in Svoje ljubeče-skrbnosti. 
[31:17] Naj ne bom osramočen, o Gospod, ali razočaran, kajti jaz kličem k Tebi; naj bodo zlobneži osramočeni, naj bodo tiho v Šeolu, (kraju mrtvih). 
[31:18] Naj bodo ustnice, ki lažejo, utišane, katere predrzno govorijo, nasproti [neprenehoma] pravičnemu, s ponosom in zaničevanjem. 
[31:19] Oh, kako velika je Tvoja dobrota, ki si jo Ti shranil za tiste, ki se Te bojijo, častijo in obožujejo, dobrota, ki si jo Ti naredil za tiste, ki zaupajo in se zatekajo Vate pred človeškimi sinovi! 
[31:20] V skrivališče Svoje prisotnosti jih Ti skriješ pred človeškimi spletkami; Ti jih pred prepiri jezikov skrivaj varuješ v Svojem šotoru. 
[31:21] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod! Kajti On mi je pokazal Svojo čudovito ljubečo uslugo, ko sem bil oblegan kot v obleganem mestu. 
[31:22] Glede sebe sem v svoji naglici in vznemirjenju rekel: "Odrezan sem izpred Tvojih oči." Toda Ti si slišal glas mojih ponižnih prošenj, ko sem k Tebi klical po pomoč. 
[31:23] O ljubite Gospoda, vsi vi Njegovi sveti! Gospod ohranja zvestega in obilno povrača tistemu, ki ravna ošabno. 
[31:24] Bodite močni in naj se vaše srce opogumi, vsi vi, ki čakate na |Gospoda| in upate na |Gospoda| in pričakujete Gospoda! 
[32:1]  BLAGOSLOVLJEN, (VESEL, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je kdor ima odpuščanje svojega prestopka neprenehoma izvajano nad seboj, čigar greh je pokrit. 
[32:2] Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, komur Gospod ne prišteva krivde in v čigar duhu ni prevare.  
[32:3] Ko sem ostajal tiho, [preden sem priznal], so moje kosti hirale zaradi mojega stokanja skozi ves dan. 
[32:4] Kajti podnevi in ponoči je Tvoja roka [nezadovoljstva] ležala težka na meni; moja vlaga je bila spremenjena v sušo poletja.
[32:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Tebi sem priznal svoj greh in svoje krivde nisem skrival. Rekel sem: "Svoje prestopke bom priznal Gospodu, [neprenehoma razkrival preteklost, dokler ni vsa povedana]" – potem si mi Ti [v trenutku] odpustil krivdo in krivico mojega greha.
[32:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Kajti to [odpuščanje] dopušča vsakomur, kdor je bogaboječ, moliti – moliti k Tebi v času, ko si Ti lahko najden; zagotovo, ko velike vode [preizkušnje] preplavijo, oni ne bodo dosegli [duha v] njem. 
[32:7] Ti si zame skrivališče; Ti, Gospod, me obvaruj pred stisko, Ti me obdaj s pesmimi in vzkliki osvoboditve.
[32:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Jaz, [Gospod], te bom poučeval in učil o poti, po kateri naj bi šel; Jaz ti bom svetoval s Svojim očesom nad teboj. 
[32:9] Ne bodi tak kakor konj ali mula, ki jima manjka razumevanja, katerima moramo usta trdno držati z žvalmi in uzdo, sicer ne bosta šla s teboj. 
[32:10] Številne so bolesti zlobnega, toda kdor zaupa v |Gospoda|, se zanaša na |Gospoda| in se prepričano naslanja na Gospoda, bo obdan z usmiljenjem in ljubečo-skrbnostjo. 
[32:11] Veselite se v Gospodu in se radostite, vi [brezkompromisno] pravični, [vi, ki ste iskreni in v pravilnem odnosu z Njim]; zavpijte od radosti, vsi vi iskreni v srcu! 
[33:1] RADOSTITE SE v Gospodu, o vi [brezkompromisno] pravični, [vi, ki ste iskreni in v pravem odnosu z Bogom]; kajti hvala pristoji in je primerna za tiste, ki so iskreni [v srcu]. 
[33:2] Dajte hvalo Gospodu z liro; pojte Mu hvalnice s harfo desetih strun. 
[33:3] Pojte Mu novo pesem; igrajte vešče [na strune] z glasnim in radostnim zvokom. 
[33:4] Kajti beseda Gospodova je pravilna; in vse Njegovo delo je narejeno v zvestobi. 
[33:5] On ljubi pravičnost in pravico; zemlja je polna Gospodove ljubeče-skrbnosti. 
[33:6] Po Gospodovi besedi je bil narejen podaljšek nebes in vsa njegova množica z dihom Njegovih ust.  
[33:7] On zbira vode morij kakor v steklenico; On daje globine v shrambe. 
[33:8] Naj se vsa zemlja boji Gospoda, [Ga časti in obožuje]; naj vsi prebivalci sveta stojijo v strahospoštovanju pred Njim. 
[33:9] Kajti On je spregovoril in je bilo narejeno; On je ukazal in je bilo neomajno. 
[33:10] Gospod uničuje namere narodov; On dela misli in načrte narodov neučinkovite. 
[33:11] Gospodov načrt ostaja na veke, misli Njegovega srca skozi vse rodove. 
[33:12] Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je narod, čigar Bog je Gospod, ljudstvo, ki ga je On izbral za Svojo dediščino. 
[33:13] Gospod gleda iz nebes. On opazuje vse človeške sinove; 
[33:14] iz svojega bivališča On gleda [osredotočen] na vse prebivalce zemlje – 
[33:15] On, ki oblikuje srca njih vseh, ki preudarja vse njihovo početje. 
[33:16] Nobenega kralja ne reši ogromna velikost in moč njegove vojske; mogočen mož ni osvobojen po [svoji] precejšnji moči. 
[33:17] Konj je oropan vrednosti za zmago; niti je ne pribori s svojo veliko močjo. 
[33:18] Poglejte, Gospodovo oko je nad tistimi, ki se Ga bojijo, [ki Ga častijo in obožujejo s strahospoštovanjem], ki čakajo Nanj in upajo v Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost, 
[33:19] da bi jih osvobodil iz smrti in jih v lakoti ohranil žive. 
[33:20] Naše notranje biti [iskreno] čakajo na Gospoda; On je naša pomoč in naš ščit. 
[33:21] Kajti v Njem se naše srce radosti, ker smo zaupali, (se zanašali in bili prepričani) v Njegovo sveto ime. 
[33:22] Naj bo Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost, o Gospod, nad nami, v sorazmerju z našim čakanjem in upanjem Nate. 
[34:1]  BLAGOSLAVLJAL BOM Gospoda v vseh časih; Njegova hvalnica bo neprenehoma v mojih ustih. 
[34:2] Moje življenje se ponaša v Gospodu; naj ponižni in trpeči sliši in naj bo vesel. 
[34:3] O poveličujte Gospoda z menoj in skupaj povzdigujmo Njegovo ime. 
[34:4] Iskal sem |Gospoda|, (povpraševal sem po) Gospodu in Ga zahteval [nujno in na podlagi avtoritete Njegove Besede] in On me je slišal in me osvobodil vseh mojih strahov.  
[34:5] Oni so Ga pogledali in žareli; njihovi obrazi od sramu ne bodo nikdar zardeli ali bili zmedeni. 
[34:6] Ta ubogi človek je zaklical in Gospod ga je slišal ter ga rešil iz vseh njegovih težav. 
[34:7]  Angel Gospodov šotori okrog tistih, [ki Ga častijo in obožujejo s strahospoštovanjem] in vsakega izmed njih On osvobaja.  
[34:8] O okusite in vidite, da je Gospod, [naš Bog], dober! Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden), je človek, ki zaupa in se zateka Vanj.  
[34:9] O bojte se Gospoda, vi Njegovi sveti, [častite in obožujte Ga]! Kajti ni pomanjkanja za tiste, ki Ga resnično častijo in obožujejo z bogaboječim strahom. 
[34:10] Mladim levom primanjkuje hrane in trpijo lakoto, toda tistim, ki iščejo, (povprašujejo po |Gospodu| in zahtevajo) Gospoda, [po pravici njihove potrebe in na podlagi avtoritete Njegove Besede], ne bo nikomur izmed njih manjkala katerakoli koristna stvar. 
[34:11] Pridite vi otroci, poslušajte me; učil vas bom častiti in se obožujoče bati Gospoda. 
[34:12] Kakšen človek je ta, ki si želi življenja in hrepeni po mnogih dnevih, da bi lahko videl dobro? 
[34:13] Zadržuj svoj jezik od hudega in svoje ustnice od govorjenja prevare. 
[34:14] Loči se od hudega in delaj dobro; išči, povprašuj po |miru| in prosi za mir in zasleduj ga, (pojdi za) njim! 
[34:15] Gospodove oči so obrnjene k [brezkompromisno] pravičnemu in Njegova ušesa so odprta k njihovemu klicu. 
[34:16] Gospodov obraz je zoper tiste, ki delajo hudo, da bi spomin nanje odstranil iz zemlje.  
[34:17] Ko pravični kličejo po pomoč, Gospod sliši in jih osvobodi iz vseh njihovih stisk in težav. 
[34:18] Gospod je blizu tistim, ki so zlomljenega srca in rešuje takšne, ki so zaradi greha strti od bolesti in so ponižno in temeljito spokorjeni. 
[34:19] Številne hudobije izzovejo [čvrsto] pravičnega, toda Gospod ga osvobaja iz vseh. 
[34:20] On varuje vse njegove kosti; niti ena izmed njih ni zlomljena. 
[34:21] Hudobija bo povzročila smrt zlobnega; in tisti, ki sovražijo pravičnega in poštenega, bodo spoznani za krive in bodo obsojeni. 
[34:22] Gospod odkupuje življenja Svojih služabnikov in nihče izmed tistih, ki se zatekajo in zaupajo Vanj, ne bo obsojen ali spoznan za krivega. 
[35:1]  KOSAJ SE, o Gospod, s tistimi, ki se kosajo z menoj; bojuj se proti tistim, ki se bojujejo zoper mene! 
[35:2] Zgrabi ščit in oklep in vstani v mojo pomoč! 
[35:3] Zavihti sulico in kopje in zapri pot tistim, ki me zasledujejo in me preganjajo. Reci mi: "Jaz sem tvoja osvoboditev!" 
[35:4] Naj bodo v sramoto in osramočeni tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje; naj bodo zavrnjeni in zbegani, ki načrtujejo mojo bolečino! 
[35:5] Naj bodo kakor pleve pred vetrom, Angel Gospodov naj jih žene naprej! 
[35:6] Naj njihova pot vodi skozi temne in spolzke kraje, Angel Gospodov naj jih preganja in povzroča trpljenje. 
[35:7] Kajti svojo mrežo so brez razloga nastavili zame; brez razloga so izkopali jamo uničenja za moje življenje. 
[35:8] Naj uničenje nepričakovano doleti [mojega sovražnika]; naj mreža, ki jo je skril zame, ujame njega; naj pade v prav tisto uničenje. 
[35:9] Potem se bom radoval v Gospodu; radostil se bom v Njegovi osvoboditvi. 
[35:10] Vse moje kosti bodo rekle: "Gospod, kdo je kakor Ti, Ti, ki osvobajaš ubogega in žalostnega pred tistim, ki je zanj premočan, da, ubogega in pomoči potrebnega pred tistim, ki mu njegove stvari iztrga proč?" 
[35:11] Zlobne in krivične priče vstajajo; sprašujejo me o stvareh, ki jih ne poznam. 
[35:12] Vračajo mi s hudim za dobro, v moje lastno prikrajšanje. 
[35:13] Toda kar se mene tiče, ko so bili oni bolni, je bila moja obleka raševina; trpinčil sem se s postom in molil z glavo, sklonjeno na svoje prsi. 
[35:14] Obnašal sem se, kot bi žaloval za svojim prijateljem ali svojim bratom; upognjen sem bil v bolesti, kakor nekdo, ki objokuje svojo mater. 
[35:15] Toda v mojem spotikanju in šepanju so se radostili in skupaj zbrali [proti meni]; razbijači, (obrekovalci in sramotilci) so se zbrali proti meni, pa jih nisem poznal; niso me nehali obrekovati in sramotiti. 
[35:16] Kakor posvetni zasmehovalci na zabavah, [ki se posmehujejo za ceno kolača], so s svojimi zobmi škrtali proti meni. 
[35:17] Gospod, kako dolgo boš Ti |še| naprej to gledal [brez ukrepanja]? Reši moje življenje pred njihovimi uničenji, moje ljubo in edino življenje pred levi! 
[35:18] Zahvaljeval se Ti bom v velikem zboru; hvalil Te bom med mogočno množico. 
[35:19] Ne pusti tistim, ki so po krivici moji sovražniki, da se radostijo nad menoj; niti ne pusti mežikati z očmi tistim, ki me sovražijo brez vzroka.  
[35:20] Kajti ne govorijo miru, temveč si izmišljajo prevare proti tistim, ki so tihi v deželi. 
[35:21] Da, svoja usta na široko odpirajo proti meni; pravijo: "Aha! Aha! Naše oči so to videle!" 
[35:22] Ti si to videl, o Gospod; ne ohrani molka! O Gospod, ne bodi daleč stran od mene! 
[35:23] Vzdigni Se, zbudi se k moji pravdi, celo k moji stvari, moj Bog in moj Gospod! 
[35:24] Sodi in brani me, o Gospod, moj Bog, po Tvoji pravičnosti, (Tvoji pravilnosti in pravici); in ne daj, da se [moji sovražniki] radostijo nad menoj! 
[35:25] Naj v svojih srcih ne govorijo: "Aha, to je to, kar smo hoteli!" Naj ne govorijo: "Mi smo ga požrli in ga popolnoma uničili." 
[35:26] Naj bodo osramočeni in zbegani skupaj tisti, ki se radostijo moje nesreče! Naj bodo ogrnjeni s sramoto in osramočenjem tisti, ki se napihujejo in povišujejo nad menoj! 
[35:27] Naj tisti, ki cenijo mojo pravično stvar in imajo veselje v moji iskrenosti, zavriskajo od radosti in naj bodo veseli in naj neprenehoma govorijo: "Naj bo Gospod poveličan, On, ki se veseli v uspevanju Svojega služabnika." 
[35:28] In moj jezik bo govoril o Tvoji pravičnosti, pravilnosti in pravici in o [mojih razlogih za] Tvojo hvalo skozi ves dan. 
[36:1]  PRESTOPEK, [kot prerokba], govori zlobnemu globoko v njegovem srcu. Pred njegovimi očmi ni strahu ali Božje groze.  
[36:2] Kajti laska si in se zavaja v svojih lastnih očeh, da njegova krivičnost ne bo odkrita in zasovražena. 
[36:3] Besede njegovih ust so napačne in zavajajoče; prenehal je biti moder in delati dobro. 
[36:4] Na svoji postelji načrtuje krivično dejanje; samega sebe postavlja na način, ki ni dober; ne zavrača ali prezira hudega. 
[36:5] Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost, o Gospod, se raztezata do ozračij in Tvoja zvestoba do oblakov. 
[36:6] Tvoja pravičnost je kakor Božje gore, Tvoje sodbe so kakor velika globina. O Gospod, Ti ohranjaš človeka in žival. 
[36:7] Kako dragocena je Tvoja neomajna stanovitna ljubezen, o Bog! Človeški otroci se zatekajo in svoje zaupanje polagajo pod senco Tvojih peruti. 
[36:8] Uživajo in se gostijo v obilju Tvoje hiše; in Ti jih pripravljaš, da pijejo od toka Tvojih užitkov. 
[36:9] Kajti s Teboj je izvir življenja; v Tvoji luči vidimo luč.  
[36:10] O, ohranjaj Svojo ljubečo-skrbnost tistim, ki Te poznajo, Svojo pravičnost, (rešitev duš), iskrenim v srcu. 
[36:11] Naj me stopalo ponosa ne prevzame in naj me roka zlobnega ne prežene. 
[36:12] Delavci krivičnosti padejo tam in ležijo na tleh; potisnjeni so ob tla in ne bodo sposobni vstati. 
[37:1]  NE VZNEMIRJAJ se zaradi hudobnežev, niti ne zavidaj tistim, ki delajo nepostavnosti, (tisto, kar ni iskreno in v pravem odnosu z Bogom). 
[37:2] Kajti kmalu bodo pokošeni kakor trava in bodo oveneli kakor zelena zel. 
[37:3] Zaupaj, (naslanjaj, zanašaj se na |Gospoda| in bodi prepričan) v Gospoda in delaj dobro; tako boš prebival v deželi in se zagotovo hranil z Njegovo zvestobo in boš resnično nahranjen. 
[37:4] Prav tako se razveseljuj v Gospodu in On ti bo izpolnil želje in skrivne prošnje tvojega srca. 
[37:5] Svojo pot predaj Gospodu [in vsako skrb svojega bremena zvali ter položi Nanj]; zaupaj, (naslanjaj, zanašaj se |Nanj| in bodi prepričan) tudi Vanj in On bo to izvršil. 
[37:6] In On bo storil, da bosta tvoja iskrenost in pravilen odnos z Bogom šla naprej kakor svetloba in tvoja pravica in pravilnost kakor [sijoče sonce] opoldneva. 
[37:7] Bodi miren in počivaj v Gospodu; počakaj Nanj in se potrpežljivo naslanjaj Nanj; ne vznemirjaj se zaradi tistega, ki na svoji poti cveti, zaradi človeka katerega zlobni načrti minevajo. 
[37:8] Loči se od jeze in zapusti bes; ne vznemirjaj se – to stremi le k hudobnemu ravnanju. 
[37:9] Kajti hudobneži bodo odrezani, toda tisti, ki čakajo in upajo in iščejo Gospoda, bodo [na koncu] podedovali zemljo.  
[37:10] Kajti samo še malo in hudobnežev ne bo več; čeprav boš pazljivo gledal tja, kjer so bili, jih ne bo več najti.  
[37:11] Toda krotki bodo [na koncu] podedovali zemljo in se razveseljevali v obilju miru.  
[37:12] Zlobni spletkarijo proti [brezkompromisno] pravičnim, (iskrenim in v pravem odnosu z Bogom); s svojimi zobmi škripajo proti njim. 
[37:13] Gospod se smeji [zlobnim], kajti On vidi, da prihaja njihov lasten dan [poraza]. 
[37:14] Zlobni izvlačijo meč in upogibajo svoje loke, da bi pobili uboge in pomoči potrebne, da bi umorili tiste, ki hodijo iskreno, (neoporečno v dejanju in v besedi). 
[37:15] Meči [zlobnih] bodo vstopili v njihova lastna srca in njihovi loki bodo zlomljeni. 
[37:16] Bolje je malo, ki ga imajo [brezkompromisno] pravični, kakor obilje [lastnine] mnogih, ki se motijo in so zlobni.  
[37:17] Kajti roke zlobnih bodo zlomljene, toda Gospod podpira [dosledno] pravične. 
[37:18] Gospod pozna dneve iskrenih in neoporečnih in njihova dediščina bo ostala za vedno. 
[37:19] V hudem času ne bodo osramočeni; in v dneh lakote bodo nasičeni. 
[37:20] Toda zlobni bodo propadli in Gospodovi sovražniki bodo kakor maščoba jagnjet, [ki je použita v dimu] in kakor slava pašnikov. Izginili bodo; razkadili se bodo kakor dim. 
[37:21] Zlobni si izposojajo in ne plačujejo ponovno, [kajti lahko so nezmožni], toda [brezkompromisno] pravični ravnajo prijazno in dajejo, [kajti zmožni so]. 
[37:22] Kajti tisti, ki so blagoslovljeni od Boga, bodo [na koncu] podedovali zemljo, toda tisti, ki so od Njega prekleti, bodo odrezani.  
[37:23] Koraki [dobrega] človeka so vodeni in utrjeni od Gospoda, ko se On razveseljuje v njegovi poti [in si On daje opravka z vsakim njegovim korakom]. 
[37:24] Čeprav pade, ne bo popolnoma vržen ob tla, kajti Gospod njegovo roko zgrabi v podporo in ga drži pokonci. 
[37:25] Bil sem mlad, sedaj pa sem star, vendar [brezkompromisno] pravične nisem videl zapuščene ali njihove potomce prosjačiti kruha. 
[37:26] Skozi ves dan so usmiljeni in milostno ravnajo; posojajo in njihovi potomci so blagoslovljeni. 
[37:27] Ločite se od hudega in delajte dobro; in za vedno boste prebivali [varno]. 
[37:28] Kajti Gospod se razveseljuje v pravičnosti in ne zapusti Svojih svetih; ohranjeni so za vedno, toda potomstvo zlobnih bo [sčasoma] odrezano. 
[37:29] [Potem] bodo [dosledno] pravični podedovali deželo in za vedno prebivali na njej. 
[37:30] Usta [brezkompromisno] pravičnega izražajo modrost in njegov jezik govori s pravičnostjo. 
[37:31] Postava njegovega Boga je v njegovem srcu; noben izmed njegovih korakov ne bo zdrsnil. 
[37:32] Zlobni preže v pričakovanju na [brezkompromisno] pravične in iščejo, da bi jih usmrtili. 
[37:33] Gospod jih ne bo prepustil v njihove roke ali [jim dovolil], da jih bodo obsodili, ko bodo sojeni. 
[37:34] Čakaj na |Gospoda| in pričakuj Gospoda in ohranjaj in pazi na Njegovo pot in On te bo povišal, da boš nasledil deželo; [na koncu], ko bodo zlobni odrezani, boš ti to videl. 
[37:35] Videl sem zlobneža v veliki moči in širitvi samega sebe, kakor zeleno drevo v svoji domači zemlji, 
[37:36] in vendar je minil in poglej, ni ga bilo več; da, iskal sem in povpraševal o njem, toda ni ga bilo možno najti. 
[37:37] Zaznamuj nedolžnega človeka in poglej iskrenega, kajti tam je vesel konec za človeka miru. 
[37:38] Glede prestopnikov; skupaj bodo uničeni; na koncu bodo zlobni odrezani. 
[37:39] Toda rešitev duš [dosledno] pravičnih je od Gospoda; On je njihovo Zatočišče in varna trdnjava v času stiske. 
[37:40] In Gospod jim pomaga in jih osvobodi; On jih osvobodi pred zlobnimi in jih reši, ker zaupajo in se zatekajo Vanj. 
[38:1]  O GOSPOD, ne grajaj me v Svojem besu, niti me ne kaznuj v Svojem žgočem nezadovoljstvu. 
[38:2] Kajti Tvoje puščice so se zadrle vame in trdno obtičale in Tvoja roka je prišla nadme in me boleče pritisnila. 
[38:3] Nič zdravega ni v mojem mesu zaradi Tvojega ogorčenja; niti ni nobenega zdravja ali počitka v mojih kosteh zaradi mojega greha. 
[38:4] Kajti moje krivičnosti so šle čez mojo glavo [kakor valovi poplave]; kakor težko breme so zame tehtale preveč. 
[38:5] Moje rane so odvratne in okužene zaradi moje neumnosti. 
[38:6] Silno sem zvit in upognjen; skozi ves dan hodim naokrog in tožim. 
[38:7] Kajti moja ledja gorijo v meni; in v mojem mesu ni nič zdravega. 
[38:8] Oslabel sem in strašno poškodovan, [na smrt premražen in precej iztrošen]; tarnam zaradi nemira in objokovanja svojega srca. 
[38:9] Gospod, vse moje hrepenenje je pred Teboj; in moje vzdihovanje ni skrito pred Teboj. 
[38:10] Moje srce drhti, moja moč me zapušča; glede svetlobe mojih oči, je tudi ta odšla od mene. 
[38:11] Moji zaljubljenci in moji prijatelji stojijo daleč od moje nadloge; in moji sosedi in moji bližnji stojijo daleč stran.  
[38:12] In tudi tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje, postavljajo zame zanke in tisti, ki iščejo in hočejo moje trpljenje, govorijo spretne in škodljive stvari; skozi ves dan razmišljajo prevarantsko in zavajajoče. 
[38:13] Toda jaz, kakor gluh človek, ne slišim; in sem kakor onemel človek, ki ne odpre svojih ust. 
[38:14] Da, postal sem kakor človek, ki ne sliši; v čigar ustih ni argumentov ali odgovorov. 
[38:15] Kajti Vate, o Gospod, upam; Ti boš odgovoril, o Gospod, moj Bog. 
[38:16] Kajti jaz molim: "Naj se ne radostijo nad menoj tisti, ki se bahajo proti meni, ko zdrsne moje stopalo." 
[38:17] Kajti pripravljen sem se ustaviti in pasti; moja bolečina in bolest sta neprestano pred menoj. 
[38:18] Kajti priznavam svojo krivdo in krivičnost; zaradi svojega greha sem napolnjen z bolestjo.  
[38:19] Toda moji sovražniki so silni in močni in tisti, ki me po krivici sovražijo, se množijo. 
[38:20] Tudi tisti, ki povračajo dobro s hudim, so moji nasprotniki, kajti sledim stvari, ki je dobra. 
[38:21] Ne zapusti me, o Gospod, o moj Bog, ne bodi daleč stran od mene. 
[38:22] Hiti mi pomagat, o Gospod, rešitelj moje duše. 
[39:1]  REKEL SEM: "Previden bom in pazil bom na svoje poti, da ne bi grešil s svojim jezikom; svoja usta bom obrzdal kakor z uzdo, medtem ko so zlobni pred menoj." 
[39:2] Onemel sem z molkom, svoj mir sem ohranil brez koristi in nisem imel tolažbe stran od dobrega, medtem ko se je moja stiska obnovila. 
[39:3] Moje srce je bilo žgoče v meni. Medtem ko sem premišljeval, je gorel ogenj; potem sem spregovoril s svojim jezikom: 
[39:4] "Gospod, naj spoznam svoj konec in [da bi cenil] obseg svojih dni – kar to je; naj spoznam in dojamem kako slaboten sem, [kako začasno je moje bivanje tukaj]. 
[39:5] Poglej, Ti si moje dni naredil tako [kratke kakor] pedi in moje življenje je kakor nič v Tvojih očeh. Resnično je vsak človek na svojem vrhuncu zgolj dih!
[39:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Zagotovo vsak človek hodi naokrog – kakor senca v igri z gibi; zagotovo, ker je jalovost in praznina v njegovem garanju; vsak kopiči bogastva, ne da bi vedel kdo jih bo pobral.  
[39:7] In sedaj, Gospod, kaj še čakam in pričakujem? Moje upanje in pričakovanje sta v Tebi. 
[39:8] Osvobodi me pred vsemi mojimi prestopki; naj ne bom v prezir in grajo [samozavestnemu] norcu! 
[39:9] Jaz sem nem, svojih ust ne odprem, kajti Ti si tisti, ki je to naredil. 
[39:10] Umakni Svoj udarec stran od mene; použiva me spor in udarec Tvoje roke. 
[39:11] Kadar Ti z ukori popravljaš in kaznuješ človeka za greh, Ti trošiš njegovo lepoto kakor molje in kar mu je ljubo, shira; zagotovo je vsak človek zgolj dih.
[39:12]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Usliši mojo molitev, o Gospod in nastavi uho mojemu joku; ne zadržuj Svojega miru ob mojih solzah! Saj sem Tvoj prehoden gost, začasen prebivalec, kakor so bili vsi moji očetje. 
[39:13] O, umakni z mene pogled in mi prizanesi, da lahko obnovim svojo vedrost in vzpodbudno moč in spoznam veselje, preden grem in me ni več." 
[40:1]  POTRPEŽLJIVO IN pričakujoče sem čakal na Gospoda; in On se je nagnil k meni in slišal moj klic. 
[40:2] Potegnil me je iz strašnega brezna, [brezna hrušča in uničenja], ven iz umazane gline (gobezdanja in sluzavosti) in moja stopala postavil na skalo, utrdil moje korake in osnoval moje poti. 
[40:3] In On je v moja usta položil novo pesem, pesem hvale našemu Bogu. Mnogi bodo videli in se bali, (častili in oboževali) ter svoje zaupanje in prepričano zanašanje položili v Gospoda.  
[40:4] Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, ki naredi Gospoda za svoje zatočišče in zaupa in se ne obrne k ponosu ali k sledilcem lažnih bogov. 
[40:5] Mnoga, o Gospod, moj Bog, so čudovita dela, ki si jih Ti naredil in Tvoje misli za nas; nihče se ne more primerjati s Teboj! Če naj bi razglašal in govoril o njih, so preštevilna, da bi bila prešteta. 
[40:6] Žrtve in daritve si Ti ne želiš, niti Ti nimaš zadovoljstva v njih; Ti si mi dal sposobnost slišati in ubogati [Tvojo postavo, bolj dragoceno služenje kakor] žgalne daritve in daritve za greh, [katere] Ti ne zahtevaš. 
[40:7] Potem sem rekel: "Poglej, prihajam; v zvitku knjige je pisano o meni; 
[40:8] moje veselje je, da izpolnjujem Tvojo voljo, o moj Bog; da, Tvoja postava je znotraj mojega srca."  
[40:9] Vesele novice o pravičnosti sem razglašal v velikem zboru, [novice o iskrenosti in pravilnem odnosu z Bogom]. Poglej, svojih ustnic nisem zadrževal, kot Ti veš, o Gospod. 
[40:10] Tvoje pravičnosti znotraj svojega srca nisem prikril; razglasil sem Tvojo zvestobo in Tvojo rešitev duše. Tvoje neomajne ljubezni in Tvoje resnice nisem skrival pred velikim zborom.  
[40:11] Ne zadržuj Svojega nežnega usmiljenja pred menoj, o Gospod; naj me Tvoja ljubeča-skrbnost in Tvoja resnica nenehno ohranjata! 
[40:12] Kajti nepreštevne hudobije so me obdale naokrog; moje krivičnosti so se tako zgrnile nadme, da nisem sposoben pogledati gor. Več jih je kakor las na moji glavi in moje srce me je razočaralo ter me zapustilo. 
[40:13] Bodi vesel, o Gospod, da me osvobodiš; o Gospod, hiti mi pomagat! 
[40:14] Naj bodo osramočeni in zbegani skupaj tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje, da bi ga uničili; naj bodo potisnjeni nazaj in onečaščeni tisti, ki mi želijo hudo in imajo v mojem trpljenju zadovoljstvo! 
[40:15] Naj bodo zapuščeni zaradi njihove sramote tisti, ki mi pravijo: "Aha, aha!" 
[40:16] Naj se vsi tisti, ki Te iščejo in zahtevajo, radostijo in naj bodo veseli v Tebi; naj takšni, ki ljubijo Tvojo rešitev duše, nenehno govorijo: "Gospod naj bo poveličevan!" 
[40:17] [Glede mene], jaz sem ubog in pomoči potreben, navzlic temu Gospod premišljuje in načrtuje zame. Ti si moja pomoč in moj osvoboditelj. O moj Bog, ne mudi se!  
[41:1]  BLAGOSLOVLJEN, (VESEL, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je kdor ceni slabotne in uboge; Gospod ga bo osvobodil v času hudobije in stiske. 
[41:2] Gospod ga bo ščitil in ga ohranil pri življenju; imenovali ga bodo blagoslovljen v deželi; in Ti ga ne boš predal volji njegovih sovražnikov. 
[41:3] Gospod ga bo vzdrževal, poživljal in krepil na njegovi postelji pešanja; vso njegovo posteljo boš Ti, [O Gospod], v njegovi bolezni obrnil, spremenil in preoblikoval. 
[41:4] Rekel sem: "Gospod, bodi usmiljen in milostljiv z menoj; ozdravi moj notranji jaz, kajti proti Tebi sem grešil." 
[41:5] Moji sovražniki o meni govorijo hudo, [govoreč]: "Kdaj bo umrl in bo njegovo ime izginilo?" 
[41:6] In ko nekdo pride, da bi me videl, govori lažne in prazne besede, medtem ko njegovo srce zbira škodljivo opravljanje [proti meni]; ko gre stran, ga pove naokrog. 
[41:7] Vsi, ki me sovražijo, skupaj šepetajo o meni; proti meni si izmišljajo mojo bolečino, [zame si predstavljajo najslabše]. 
[41:8] "Hudobna bolezen," govorijo oni, "je izlita nad njim in se ga trdno drži; in sedaj, ko je priklenjen na posteljo, ne bo ponovno vstal." 
[41:9] Celo moj lasten poznani prijatelj, v katerega sem zaupal, (se zanašal in bil prepričan), ki je jedel od mojega kruha, je svojo peto vzdignil proti meni.  
[41:10] Toda Ti, o Gospod, mi bodi usmiljen in milostljiv in me vzdigni pokonci, da jim bom lahko povrnil. 
[41:11] Po tem spoznavam, da si mi Ti naklonjen in se razveseljuješ v meni, ker moj sovražnik ne slavi nad menoj. 
[41:12] In glede mene, Ti si me podpiral v moji celovitosti in me za vedno postavil v Tvojo prisotnost. 
[41:13] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod, Izraelov Bog, od večnosti in do večnosti, [od te dobe, do naslednje in za vedno]! Amen in Amen (tako naj bo). 
[42:1]  KAKOR jelen vzdihuje in hrepeni po potokih voda, tako jaz vzdihujem in hrepenim po Tebi, o Bog. 
[42:2] Moj notranji jaz žeja po Bogu, po živem Bogu. Kdaj bom prišel in zagledal Božji obraz?  
[42:3] Solze so mi bile hrana podnevi in ponoči, medtem ko mi ljudje ves dan govorijo: "Kje je tvoj Bog?" 
[42:4] Teh stvari se [vneto] spominjam in se izlivam znotraj sebe: kako sem počasi šel pred množico in jih vodil v povorki do Božje hiše, [kakor vodja glasbenikov pred svojim zborom, ki časovno določa stopinje po zvoku glasbe in petju pesmi], z glasom vpitja in hvalnice množice, ki praznuje. 
[42:5] Zakaj si potrt, o moj notranji jaz? In zakaj bi vzdihoval nad menoj in bil nemiren znotraj mene? Upaj v Boga in v pričakovanju čakaj Nanj, kajti še vedno bom hvalil Njega, mojega pomočnika in mojega Boga. 
[42:6] O moj Bog, moje življenje je potrto nad menoj [in breme se mi zdi težje, kakor lahko prenesem]; zato se Te bom [iskreno] spominjal iz dežele [reke] Jordan in [vrhov gore] Hermon, iz majhne gore Micár. 
[42:7] [Rjoveče] brezno kliče [rjovečemu] breznu ob grmenju Tvojih vodnih nalivov; vse Tvoje butanje valov in Tvoji valeči se valovi so šli čezme. 
[42:8] Kljub temu bo Gospod zaukazal Svoji ljubeči-skrbnosti podnevi, in ponoči bo Njegova pesem z menoj, molitev k Bogu mojega življenja. 
[42:9] Rekel bom Bogu, svoji skali: "Zakaj si me Ti pozabil? Zakaj hodim tarnajoč zaradi tlačenja sovražnika?" 
[42:10] Kakor z mečem, [ki zadeva] moje kosti, se mi moji sovražniki posmehujejo in mi očitajo, medtem ko mi nenehno govorijo: "Kje je tvoj Bog?" 
[42:11] Zakaj si potrt, o moj notranji jaz? In zakaj bi vzdihoval nad menoj in bil nemiren v meni? Upaj v Boga in v pričakovanju čakaj Nanj, kajti kljub temu bom hvalil Njega, ki je pomoč mojega obličja in moj Bog. 
[43:1] SODI in zagovarjaj me, o Bog; poteguj se in brani mojo stvar proti brezbožnemu narodu. O osvobodi me pred prevarantom in krivičnežem! 
[43:2] Kajti Ti si Bog moje moči, [moja trdnjava – v katero se zatekam]; zakaj si me Ti zavrgel? Zakaj hodim tarnajoč zaradi stiskanja sovražnika? 
[43:3] O odpošlji Svojo luč in Svojo resnico, naj me vodita; naj me privedeta k Tvojemu svetemu hribu in k Tvojemu bivališču. 
[43:4] Potem bom šel do Božjega oltarja, k Bogu, moji izredni radosti; da, z liro Te bom hvalil, o Bog, moj Bog! 
[43:5] Zakaj si potrt, o moj notranji jaz? In zakaj bi vzdihoval nad menoj in bil nemiren v meni? Upaj v Boga in v pričakovanju čakaj Nanj, kajti še vedno bom hvalil Njega, ki je pomoč mojega [žalostnega] obličja in moj Bog. 
[44:1]  S SVOJIMI ušesi smo slišali, o Bog; naši očetje so nam povedali, [kakšno] delo si Ti storil v njihovih dneh, v dneh davnine. 
[44:2] Ti si s Svojo roko izgnal narode in Tvoja moč je bila, ki je [Izraelu] dala dom z izruvanjem [poganskih] ljudstev, toda [Izraela] si Ti razširil. 
[44:3] Kajti [kánaanske dežele] niso dobili v last s svojim lastnim mečem, niti jih ni rešila njihova lastna roka; temveč [je to storila] Tvoja desnica in Tvoja roka in svetloba Tvojega obličja, ker si jim bil Ti naklonjen in si se razveseljeval v njih. 
[44:4] Ti si moj Kralj, o Bog; ukaži zmage in osvoboditev za Jakoba (Izraela). 
[44:5] Zaradi Tebe bomo naše sovražnike potisnili dol; zaradi Tvojega imena bomo poteptali tiste, ki se vzdigujejo proti nam. 
[44:6] Kajti jaz ne bom zaupal v |svoj lok| in se zanašal na svoj lok, niti me ne bo rešil moj meč. 
[44:7] Toda Ti si nas rešil pred našimi sovražniki in osramotil tiste, ki nas sovražijo. 
[44:8] V Bogu se ponašamo skozi ves dan in Tvojemu imenu bomo dali hvalo za vedno.
[44:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Toda sedaj si nas Ti zavrgel in nas privedel v nečast in Ti ne odhajaš z našimi vojskami. 
[44:10] Prisiliš nas, da se pred sovražnikom obračamo nazaj in tisti, ki nas sovražijo, si plen jemljejo zase. 
[44:11] Naredil si nas kakor ovce, namenjene za zakol in nas raztresel v izgnanstvo med narode. 
[44:12] Ti zastonj prodajaš Svoje ljudstvo in si z njihovo ceno nisi povečal Svojega imetja. 
[44:13] Naredil si nas v zasmeh našim sosedom, porog in predmet posmeha tistim, ki nas obdajajo. 
[44:14] Narejaš nas za pregovor med narodi, zmajevanje z glavami med ljudstvom. 
[44:15] Moja sramota je pred menoj skozi ves dan in moj obraz je pokrila sramota 
[44:16] ob besedah zasmehovalcev in žaljivcev, zaradi sovražnika in maščevalca. 
[44:17] Vse to je prišlo na nas, pa vendar nismo pozabili Nate, niti nismo bili nezvesti Tvoji zavezi, [ki si jo Ti sklenil z našimi očeti]. 
[44:18] Naša srca niso odvrnjena, niti naši koraki niso odklonjeni od Tvojih poti, 
[44:19] čeprav si nas Ti mučno zlomil na kraju šakalov in nas pokril z globoko temačnostjo, celo s senco smrti. 
[44:20] Če smo pozabili ime našega Boga ali iztegovali naše roke k tujemu bogu, 
[44:21] ali ne bi Bog tega odkril? Kajti On pozna skrivnosti srca. 
[44:22] Ne, temveč zaradi Tebe nas skozi ves dan ubijajo; smatrajo nas kakor ovce za zakol.  
[44:23] Prebudi se! Zakaj Ti spiš, o Gospod? Vzdigni Se, ne odvrzi nas za vedno! 
[44:24] Zakaj Ti skrivaš Svoj obraz in pozabljaš naše trpljenje in naše zatiranje? 
[44:25] Kajti naša življenja so upognjena do prahu; naša telesa so prilepljena ob tla. 
[44:26] Dvigni se! Pridi nam pomagat in nas osvobodi zaradi Svojega usmiljenja in zaradi Svoje neomajne ljubezni! 
[45:1]  MOJE SRCE prekipeva s tematiko bogaboječnosti; svoj psalm naslavljam na Kralja. Moj jezik je kakor pero pripravljenega pisarja. 
[45:2] Ti si pravičnejši kakor človeški otroci; na Tvoje ustnice je izlita milostljivost; zato Te je Bog blagoslovil za vedno. 
[45:3] Na Svoje stegno si opaši Svoj meč, o Mogočni, v Svoji slavi in Svojem veličastju! 
[45:4] In v Svojem veličastju zmagovito jezdi naprej na strani resnice, ponižnosti in pravičnosti, (iskrenosti in pravega odnosa z Bogom); in naj te Tvoja desnica vodi do strahovitih stvari. 
[45:5] Tvoje puščice so ostre; narodi padajo pod Teboj; Tvoje puščice prebadajo srca Kraljevih sovražnikov. 
[45:6] Tvoj prestol, o Bog, je za večno in vedno; žezlo pravičnosti je žezlo Tvojega kraljestva. 
[45:7] Ti ljubiš pravičnost, iskrenost in pravilen odnos z Bogom in sovražiš zlobnost; zato Te je Bog, Tvoj Bog, mazilil z oljem veselja nad Tvojimi vrstniki.  
[45:8] Tvoja oblačila so vsa nadišavljena z miro, alojo in cimetovcem; glasbila s strunami Te razveseljujejo. 
[45:9] Kraljeve hčere so med Tvojimi častitljivimi ženami; na Tvoji desni stoji kraljica v zlatu Ofirja. 
[45:10] Poslušaj, o hči, preudari, podredi in strinjaj se z mojim navodilom: pozabi tudi na svoje lastno ljudstvo in hišo svojega očeta; 
[45:11] tako si bo Kralj zaželel tvoje lepote; kajti On je tvoj Gospod, bodi podrejena in časti in spoštuj Ga. 
[45:12] In, o Tirska hči, najbogatejši izmed ljudstva bodo z darilom milo prosili za tvojo naklonjenost. 
[45:13] Kraljeva hči v notranjem delu [palače] je vsa veličastna; njeno oblačilo je vtkano z zlatom.  
[45:14] Privedena bo h Kralju v vezenem oblačilu; z devicami, njenimi družicami, ki ji sledijo, bo pripeljana k Tebi. 
[45:15] Z veseljem in vriskanjem bodo pripeljane; vstopile bodo v Kraljevo palačo. 
[45:16] Namesto Tvojih očetov bodo Tvoji sinovi, ki jih boš Ti naredil za prince po vsej deželi. 
[45:17] Jaz bom naredil Tvoje ime, da se bo pomnilo v vseh rodovih; zato Te bodo ljudje hvalili in se Ti zahvaljevali za večno in vedno. 
[46:1]  BOG JE naše Zatočišče in moč, [mogočna in neprehodna za skušnjavo], zelo prisotna in dobro-preizkušena pomoč v stiski. 
[46:2] Zato se ne bomo bali, čeprav bi se zemlja spremenila in čeprav bi se gore stresle v sredino morij, 
[46:3] čeprav njene vode hrumijo in se penijo, čeprav se ob njenem naraščanju in hrušču tresejo gore.
[46:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Obstaja reka katere tokovi bodo razveselili Božje mesto, sveti kraj šotorov Najvišjega. 
[46:5] Bog je v njeni sredi, ne bo omajana; Bog ji bo pomagal navsezgodaj, [ob svitanju jutra]. 
[46:6] Narodi so besneli, kraljestva so se opotekala in bila omajana; On je izustil Svoj glas, zemlja se je stopila. 
[46:7] Gospod nad bojevniki je z nami; Bog Jakobov je naše Zatočišče, (naša trdnjava in visoki stolp).
[46:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Pridite, poglejte Gospodova dela, ki je naredil opustošenja in čudeže na zemlji. 
[46:9] On dela, da vojne prenehajo do konca zemlje; On lok zdrobi na koščke in puščico prelomi na dvoje; On bojne vozove sežiga v ognju. 
[46:10] Pusti in miruj in védi, (spoznaj in razumi), da Jaz sem Bog. Jaz bom poveličevan med narodi! Jaz bom poveličevan na zemlji! 
[46:11] Gospod nad bojevniki je z nami; Bog Jakobov je naše Zatočišče, (naš visoki stolp in utrdba). Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! 
[47:1]  O PLOSKAJTE z rokami, vsa ljudstva! Vzklikajte k Bogu z glasom zmagoslavja in pesmi radosti! 
[47:2] Kajti Gospod, Najvišji, vzbuja grozo, strahospoštovanje in strah; On je veličasten Kralj nad vso zemljo. 
[47:3] On je ljudstva podjarmil pod nas in narode pod naša stopala. 
[47:4] On je izbral našo dediščino za nas, slavo in ponos Jakoba, katerega On ljubi. 
[47:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Bog se je povzpel med vzklikanjem, Gospod ob zvoku trobente. 
[47:6] Pojte hvalnice Bogu, pojte hvalnice! Pojte hvalnice našemu kralju, pojte hvalnice! 
[47:7] Kajti Bog je Kralj vse zemlje; pojte hvalnice v mojstrskem psalmu in z razumevanjem. 
[47:8] Bog vlada nad narodi; Bog sedi na Svojem svetem prestolu. 
[47:9] Princi in odličniki ljudstev so zbrani skupaj, [združeno] ljudstvo za Abrahamovega Boga, kajti ščiti zemlje pripadajo Bogu; On je visoko vzvišen. 
[48:1]  VZVIŠEN JE Gospod in visoko naj bo hvaljen v mestu našega Boga! Njegova sveta gora, 
[48:2] svetla in lepa v vzdigovanju, je radost vse zemlje – Gora Sion, [Davidovo Mesto], na severni strani [gora Moríja in svetišče], [celotno] mesto Velikega Kralja!  
[48:3] Bog je samega Sebe naredil poznanega v njenih palačah kot Zatočišče, (visoki stolp in utrdba). 
[48:4] Kajti glej, kralji so se zbrali, prišli so naprej in skupaj preminuli. 
[48:5] Pogledali so, bili so osupli; udarjeni so bili z grozo in se pognali v beg, [zgroženi in onemogočeni]. 
[48:6] Prevzelo jih je trepetanje in bolečina kakor pri ženi na porodu. 
[48:7] Z vzhodnim vetrom si Ti zdrobil taršíške ladje. 
[48:8] Tako kot smo slišali, tako smo videli v mestu Gospoda nad bojevniki, v mestu našega Boga: Bog ga bo osnoval za vedno.
[48:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Mi smo premišljevali o Tvoji neomajni ljubezni, o Bog, v sredi Tvojega svetišča. 
[48:10] Kakor je Tvoje ime, o Bog, taka je Tvoja hvala do koncev zemlje; Tvoja desnica je polna pravičnosti, (pravilnosti in pravice). 
[48:11] Naj bo gora Sion vesela! Naj se hčere judovske radostijo zaradi Tvojih [pravičnih] sodb! 
[48:12] Hodite naokrog po Sionu in zaokrožite okrog nje, preštejte njene stolpe, (njena vzvišena in plemenita dejanja preteklih dni), 
[48:13] dobro preudarite njene okope, pojdite skozi njene palače in trdnjave, da boste lahko povedali prihodnjemu rodu [in prenehajte se spominjati razočaranj]. 
[48:14] Kajti ta Bog je naš Bog za vedno in večno; On bo naš vodnik [celo] do smrti. 
[49:1]  POSLUŠAJTE TO, vsa ljudstva; nastavite uho, vsi vi prebivalci sveta, 
[49:2] oboji, nizki in visoki, bogati in revni skupaj: 
[49:3] moja usta bodo govorila modrost; in premišljevanje mojega srca bo razumevanje. 
[49:4] Jaz se bom podredil in pritrdil priliki ali pregovoru; na glasbo lire bom razvil svojo uganko (svoj problem). 
[49:5] Zakaj bi se bal v dneh hudobije, ko me krivica tistih, ki bi me prevarali, obdaja na vsaki strani, 
[49:6] celo od tistih, ki zaupajo in se zanašajo na svoje bogastvo in se bahajo iz obilice njihovega bogastva? 
[49:7] Nobeden izmed njih ne more nikakor odkupiti [ali sebe ali] svojega brata, niti dati Bogu odkupnine zanj – 
[49:8] kajti odkupnina za življenje je predraga in [cena, ki jo nekdo lahko plača] nikoli ne more zadoščati – 
[49:9] tako da bi lahko živel za vedno in nikoli ne bi videl jame (groba) in razpada. 
[49:10] Kajti vidi, da celo modri ljudje umrejo; [samozavesten] bedak in nori enako izgineta in svoje imetje pustita drugim. 
[49:11] Njihovo notranje mišljenje je, da se bodo njihove hiše nadaljevale za vedno in njihovi kraji bivanja za vse rodove; svojo zemljo imenujejo sebi lastno, [ločeno od Boga] in po svojih lastnih imenih. 
[49:12] Toda človek, z vso svojo častjo in bliščem, ne ostane; je kakor živali, ki poginejo. 
[49:13] To je usoda tistih, ki so bedasto prepričani in vendar po njih ljudje odobravajo njihove izreke.
[49:14]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Kakor ovce so določeni za Šeol, (kraj mrtvih); smrt bo njihov pastir. In iskreni bodo zjutraj gospodovali nad njimi; in njihova oblika in lepota bosta použiti, kajti Šeol bo njihovo bivališče. 
[49:15] Toda Bog me bo odkupil od oblasti Šeola, (kraja mrtvih); kajti On me bo sprejel.
[49:16]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ne boj se, kadar [brezbožnež] postane bogat, kadar se bogastvo in slava njegove hiše poveča; 
[49:17] kajti kadar umre, ne bo ničesar odnesel; njegova slava se ne bo spustila za njim. 
[49:18] Čeprav medtem, ko živi, samega sebe šteje za veselega in uspevajočega in čeprav človek dobi hvalo, ko mu gre dobro [zase], 
[49:19] bo šel k rodu svojih očetov, ki nikoli več ne bodo videli svetlobe. 
[49:20] Človek, ki ga imajo v časti in ne razume, je kakor živali, ki poginejo. 
[50:1]  MOGOČEN Bog, Gospod, govori in kliče zemljo od sončnega vzhoda do njegovega zahoda. 
[50:2] S Siona, popolnosti lepote, sije Bog. 
[50:3] Naš Bog prihaja in ne ostaja tiho; ogenj použiva pred Njim in okrog Njega divja mogočen orkan. 
[50:4] Kliče k podaljšku nebes zgoraj in k zemlji, da bi On lahko sodil Svoje ljudstvo: 
[50:5] "Zberite se skupaj k Meni, Moji sveti, [tisti, ki ste našli milost v Mojih očeh], tisti, ki ste z žrtvijo naredili zavezo z Menoj." 
[50:6] In podaljšek nebes razglaša Njegovo pravičnost, (pravilnost in pravico), kajti Bog, On je sodnik.
[50:7]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! "Poslušaj, o Moje ljudstvo in Jaz bom govoril; o Izrael, Jaz bom pričal za vas in proti vam: Jaz sem Bog, vaš Bog. 
[50:8] Ne karam vas zaradi vaših žrtev; vaše žgalne daritve so nenehno pred Menoj. 
[50:9] Nobenega bika ne bom sprejel iz vaše hiše, niti kozla iz vaših ograd. 
[50:10] Kajti vsaka žival gozda je Moja in govedo na tisočerih gričih ali na gorah, kjer so tisoči. 
[50:11] Poznam in seznanjen sem z vsemi gorskimi pticami in divje živali polja so Moje in so z Menoj, v Mojem umu. 
[50:12] Če bi bil lačen, Jaz ne bi rekel vam, kajti svet in njegova polnost sta Moji.  
[50:13] Ali naj jem meso bikov ali pijem kri koz? 
[50:14] Ponudite Bogu žrtev zahvaljevanja in izplačajte svoje zaobljube Najvišjemu, 
[50:15] in sklicujte se Name v dnevu stiske; Jaz vas bom osvobodil, vi pa Me boste spoštovali in slavili." 
[50:16] Toda zlobnim pravi Bog: "Kakšno pravico imate vi, da navajate Moje zakone ali vzamete Mojo zavezo ali zaobljubo na svoje ustnice, 
[50:17] vidim, da sovražite poduk ter opomin in Moje besede mečete za seboj [jih zavračate]? 
[50:18] Ko vidite tatu, se povežete z njim in ste postali soudeleženci z zakonolomci. 
[50:19] Svoja usta dajete hudobiji in vaš jezik snuje prevaro. 
[50:20] Sedite in govorite proti svojemu bratu; obrekujete sina vaše lastne matere. 
[50:21] Te stvari ste storili, pa sem Jaz ohranil molk; vi ste mislili, da sem bil Jaz nekoč prav takšen kakor vi. Toda [sedaj] vas bom Jaz ukoril in pred vaše oči položil urejene [obtožbe]. 
[50:22] Sedaj preudarite tole, vi, ki pozabljate Boga, drugače vas bom Jaz raztrgal na koščke in nikogar ne bo, ki bi osvobodil. 
[50:23] Kdor prinese daritev hvale in zahvaljevanja, spoštuje in slavi Mene; in kdor pravilno uravnava svojo pot, [ki pripravlja pot, da se mu lahko pokažem], tistemu bom Jaz pokazal Božjo rešitev duše." 
[51:1]  IMEJ USMILJENJE nad menoj, o Bog, glede na Svojo neomajno ljubezen; glede na mnoštvo Svojega nežnega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti izbriši moje prestopke. 
[51:2] Operi me temeljito [in vedno znova] od moje krivice ter krivde in očisti me in naredi me popolnoma očiščenega od mojega greha! 
[51:3] Kajti jaz se zavedam svojih prestopkov in jih priznavam; moj greh je vedno pred menoj. 
[51:4] Proti Tebi, Tebi samemu, sem grešil in naredil to, kar je hudo v Tvojem pogledu, tako da si Ti opravičen v Svoji obsodbi in brezhiben v Svoji sodbi.  
[51:5] Poglej, rojen sem bil v [stanju] krivde; moja mati, ki me je spočela, je bila grešna [in tudi jaz sem grešen].  
[51:6] Poglej, Ti si želiš resnico v notranjem bitju; primoraj me torej, poznati modrost v mojem najnotranjejšem srcu. 
[51:7] Očisti me s hizopom in jaz bom [obredno] čist; operi me in jaz bom [v resnici] bolj bel kakor sneg. 
[51:8] Primoraj me, da bom slišal radost in veselje in bil zadovoljen; naj se kosti, ki si jih Ti zlomil, radostijo. 
[51:9] Skrij Svoj obraz pred mojimi grehi in izbriši vso mojo krivdo in krivičnosti. 
[51:10] Ustvari v meni čisto srce, o Bog in obnovi pravega, stanovitnega in neomajnega duha znotraj mene. 
[51:11] Ne zavrzi me izpred Svoje prisotnosti in Svojega Svetega Duha ne vzemi od mene. 
[51:12] Obnovi mi radost Tvoje rešitve duše in z voljnim duhom me podpiraj. 
[51:13] Potem bom prestopnike učil Tvojih poti in grešniki bodo spreobrnjeni in vrnjeni k Tebi. 
[51:14] Osvobodi me pred krivdo za kri in smrtjo, o Bog, Bog rešitve moje duše in moj jezik bo glasno pel o Tvoji pravičnosti, (Tvoji pravilnosti in Tvoji pravici). 
[51:15] O Gospod, odpri moje ustnice in moja usta bodo naznanila Tvojo hvalo. 
[51:16] Kajti Ti se ne veseliš v žrtvovanju, drugače bi jo dal; v žgalni daritvi Ti ne najdeš nobenega zadovoljstva.  
[51:17] Moja žrtev, [žrtev, ki je sprejemljiva] Bogu, je zlomljen duh; zlomljeno in skesano srce, [zlomljeno z bolestjo zaradi greha in ponižno in temeljito spokorno], takšno, o Bog, Ti ne boš preziral. 
[51:18] Delaj dobro v Svoji dobri volji Sionu; pozidaj jeruzalemsko obzidje. 
[51:19] Potem se boš Ti razveseljeval v žrtvah pravičnosti, pravice in pravilnosti z žgalnimi daritvami in celotnimi žgalnimi daritvami; potem bodo bikci ponujeni na Tvojem oltarju. 
[52:1]  ZAKAJ SE bahaš z vragolijo storjeno proti ljubeči-skrbnosti Boga [in bogaboječega], o mogočen, [grešen] človek, dan za dnem? 
[52:2] Tvoj jezik si izmišlja zlobnost; je kakor ostra britev, deluje prevarantsko. 
[52:3] Bolj ljubiš hudobijo kakor dobro in rajši lažeš, kakor bi govoril pravičnost, pravico in pravilno.
[52:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ti ljubiš vse uničujoče in použivajoče besede, o varljiv jezik. 
[52:5] Bog te bo prav tako polomil in uničil za vedno; On te bo zgrabil in izruval iz tvojega šotora in te izkoreninil iz dežele živih.
[52:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! [Brezkompromisno] pravični bo [to] tudi videl in bo v častitljivem strahu in strahospoštovanju, toda glede tebe se bodo [porogljivo] smejali, govoreč: 
[52:7] "Poglejte, to je človek, ki ni naredil Boga za svojo moč (svojo trdnjavo in visoki stolp), temveč je zaupal v |obilje svojega bogastva| in se prepričano zanašal na obilje svojega bogastva, iščoč zatočišče in varnost zase zaradi svoje zlobnosti." 
[52:8] Toda jaz sem kakor zeleno oljčno drevo v Božji hiši; zaupam in se prepričano zanašam na ljubečo-skrbnost in Božje usmiljenje za vedno in večno. 
[52:9] Zahvaljeval sem Ti bom in zaupal Vate za vedno, ker si Ti to storil, [me osvobodil in me obvaroval]. Čakal bom na |Tvoje ime|, upal v |Tvoje ime| in pričakoval v Tvojem imenu, kajti to je dobro v prisotnosti Tvojih svetih, (Tvojih prijaznih in hvalevrednih.) 
[53:1]  [PRAZNOGLAVI] bedak je rekel v svojem srcu: "Ni Boga." Pokvarjeni so in hudobni in delajo gnusno krivičnost; nikogar ni, ki dela dobro. 
[53:2] Bog je pogledal dol iz nebes na človeške otroke, da bi videl ali jih je bilo kaj, ki bi razumeli, ki bi iskali, (povpraševali po |Bogu| in obupno zahtevali) Boga. 
[53:3] Vsak od njih se je poslabšal, [zdrsnil nazaj in odpadel]; vsi skupaj so postali umazani in pokvarjeni; nikogar ni, ki dela dobro, ne, niti enega.  
[53:4] Ali tisti, ki delajo hudobijo, nimajo spoznanja, (nobenega razumevanja)? Moje ljudi jedo kakor jedo kruh; ne kličejo k Bogu. 
[53:5] Tam so, v grozi in strahu, kjer ni [in ni bilo] nobene groze in strahu! Kajti Bog je raztresel kosti tistega, ki tabori proti tebi; ti si jih osramotil, ker jih je Bog zavrnil. 
[53:6] Oh, da bi rešitev duš in osvoboditev Izraela prišla s Siona! Ko Bog obnovi usode Svojih ljudi, potem se bo Jakob radostil in Izrael bo vesel. 
[54:1]  REŠI ME, o Bog, po Svojem imenu; sodi in brani me po Svoji mogočni sili in oblasti. 
[54:2] Usliši moje zagovarjanje in mojo molitev, o Bog; prisluhni besedam mojih ust. 
[54:3] Kajti tujci in predrzneži se vzdigujejo zoper mene in nasilneži in tisti neusmiljeni iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje; Boga si ne postavljajo predse.
[54:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Poglejte, Bog je moj pomočnik in zaveznik; Gospod je moja podpora in je s tistimi, ki podpirajo moje življenje. 
[54:5] On bo mojim sovražnikom povrnil hudobijo; v Svoji zvestobi jim [Gospod] naredi konec. 
[54:6] S prostovoljnim darovanjem Ti bom žrtvoval; zahvaljeval se bom in hvalil Tvoje ime, o Gospod, kajti to je dobro. 
[54:7] Kajti On me je osvodobil iz vsake težave in moje oko je [v zmagoslavju] gledalo na moje sovražnike. 
[55:1]  POSLUŠAJ mojo molitev, o Bog in Sebe ne skrivaj pred mojo ponižno prošnjo! 
[55:2] Pazi name in mi odgovori; nemiren sem in zmeden v svoji pritožbi in moram ječati 
[55:3] [in zmeden sem] ob zvoku sovražnika zaradi tlačenja in groženj zlobnih; kajti naprtili bi mi stisko in v besu me preganjajo. 
[55:4] Moje srce v meni je mučno boleče in lotili so se me smrtni strahovi. 
[55:5] Strah in trepet sta prišla name; groza in strah sta me preplavila. 
[55:6] Jaz pa pravim: "Oh, da bi imel krila kakor golob! Odletel bi stran in bi počival. 
[55:7] Da, odtaval bi daleč proč, nastanil bi se v divjini.
[55:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Podvizal bi se, da bi ušel in našel zavetje pred viharnim vetrom in orkanom." 
[55:9] Uniči [njihove načrte], o Gospod, zmedi njihove jezike, kajti videl sem nasilje in prepir v mestu. 
[55:10] Podnevi in ponoči pohajkujejo po njegovem zidovju; krivda in vragolija sta v njegovi sredi. 
[55:11] Nasilje in uničenje sta znotraj njega; prevara in zvijača ne zapustita njegovih ulic in trgov. 
[55:12] Kajti ni sovražnik tisti, ki mi očita in me zasmehuje – potem bi to zmogel prenesti; niti ni nekdo, ki me je sovražil, ki bi se predrzno širokoustil proti meni – potem bi se lahko skril pred njim. 
[55:13] Toda to si bil ti, človek meni enak, moj družabnik in moj poznani prijatelj. 
[55:14] Imela sva prijetno skupno druženje in skupaj sva hodila v Božjo hišo. 
[55:15] Naj opustošenje in smrt nenadoma prideta nadnje; naj gredo živi dol v Šeol, (kraj mrtvih), kajti hudobije so v njihovih prebivališčih, v njihovih srcih in v njihovem najnotranjejšem delu. 
[55:16] Kar se mene tiče, jaz bom klical k Bogu in Gospod me bo rešil. 
[55:17] Zvečer in zjutraj in opoldne bom izrekal svojo pritožbo in ječal in vzdihoval in On bo slišal moj glas. 
[55:18] On je odkupil moje življenje v miru pred bitko, ki je bila proti meni [tako, da se mi ni nihče približal], kajti mnogi so bili, ki so se borili z menoj. 
[55:19] Bog jih bo slišal in jih ponižal, celo On, ki ostaja od davno – sela, [ustavi se, in mirno razmisli o tem]! – zato, ker pri njih ni bilo nobene menjave [srca] in se ne bojijo, ne častijo in ne obožujejo Boga. 
[55:20] [Moj družabnik] je iztegnil svoje roke proti tistim, ki so bili v miru z njim; on je prelomil in oskrunil svoj sporazum [prijateljstva in zvestobe]. 
[55:21] Besede njegovih ust so bile bolj gladke kakor smetana ali maslo, toda v njegovem srcu je bila vojna; njegove besede so bile mehkejše od olja, vendar so bile izvlečeni meči. 
[55:22] Vrzite svoje breme na Gospoda, [sprostite njegovo težo] in On vas bo vzdrževal; On ne bo nikoli dopustil, da bi bil [dosledno] pravičen omajan, (pripravljen k zdrsu, padcu ali neuspehu).  
[55:23] Toda Ti, o Bog, boš zlobneža pripeljal dol v jamo uničenja; krvoločneži in verolomni ne bodo preživeli niti polovice svojih dni. Toda jaz bom zaupal v |Tebe|, se naslanjal na |Tebe| in se prepričano zanašal Nate. 
[56:1]  BODI MI usmiljen in milostljiv, o Bog, kajti človek bi me poteptal ali použil; skozi ves dan me nasprotnik zatira. 
[56:2] Tisti, ki prežijo name, bi me požrli ali teptali skozi ves dan, kajti številni so, ki se borijo zoper mene, o Najvišji! 
[56:3] Kadar sem v strahu, bom imel zaupanje |Vate| in svoje zaupanje in zanašanje bom položil Vate. 
[56:4] S [pomočjo] Boga bom hvalil Njegovo besedo; na Boga se naslanjam, zanašam in prepričano polagam svoje zaupanje; ne bom se bal. Kaj mi lahko stori človek, ki je meso? 
[56:5] Skozi ves dan obračajo moje besede in mi delajo težave; vse njihove misli so proti meni za hudobijo in mojo bolečino. 
[56:6] Zbirajo se skupaj, skrivajo se, pazijo na moje korake, celo kot bi [pričakujoče] čakali na moje življenje. 
[56:7] Mislijo, da bodo ubežali s krivdo in ali bodo? V Svojem ogorčenju zruši ljudstva, o Bog. 
[56:8] Ti šteješ in zapisuješ moja pohajanja; moje solze daješ v Svojo steklenico – ali niso v Tvoji knjigi? 
[56:9] Potem se bodo moji sovražniki obrnili nazaj na dan, ko kličem; to vem, kajti Bog je na moji strani.  
[56:10] V Boga, katerega besedo hvalim, v Gospoda, katerega besedo hvalim, 
[56:11] v Boga sem položil svoje zaupanje in prepričano zanašanje; ne bom se bal. Kaj mi more storiti človek? 
[56:12] Tvoje zaobljube so nad menoj, o Bog; Tebi bom vračal hvalo in Tebi bom dajal daritve hvale. 
[56:13] Kajti Ti si moje življenje osvobodil pred smrtjo, da in moja stopala pred padcem, da bi lahko hodil pred Bogom v luči življenja in živečih. 
[57:1]  BODI MI usmiljen in milostljiv, o Bog, bodi mi usmiljen in milostljiv, kajti moja duša se zateka in najde zavetišče in zaupnost v Tebi, da, v senco Tvojih peruti se bom zatekel in prepričan bom, dokler nesreče in rušilna neurja ne minejo. 
[57:2] Klical bom k Bogu Najvišjemu, ki deluje v mojo korist in me nagrajuje, [ki zame uresničuje Svoje namene in jih zagotovo izpolni]! 
[57:3] On bo poslal iz nebes in me rešil pred obrekovanji in očitki tistega, ki bi me poteptal ali me požrl in On ga bo osramotil. Sela, [ustavi se, in mirno razmisli o tem]! Bog bo poslal Svoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost in Svojo resnico in zvestobo. 
[57:4] Moje življenje je med levi; ležati moram med tistimi, ki so v plamenih – človeškimi sinovi, katerih zobje so sulice in puščice, njihovi jeziki ostri meči. 
[57:5] Bodi poveličevan, o Bog, nad podaljškom nebes! Naj bo Tvoja slava čez vso zemljo! 
[57:6] Nastavili so mrežo mojim korakom; celó moje življenje je bilo upognjeno. Izkopali so jamo na moji poti; sami so padli v njeno sredo.
[57:7]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Moje srce je nespremenljivo, o Bog, moje srce je trdno in prepričano! Pel bom in igral. 
[57:8] Zbudi se, moja slava, (moj notranji jaz); zbudita se harfa in lira! Jaz se bom zbudil navsezgodaj, [zbudil bom zoro]! 
[57:9] Hvalil Te bom in se zahvaljeval, o Gospod, med ljudstvi; med narodi Ti bom pel hvalnice. 
[57:10] Kajti Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost sta veličastni, segata do podaljška nebes in Tvoja resnica in zvestoba do oblakov. 
[57:11] Bodi poveličevan, o Bog, nad podaljškom nebes; naj bo Tvoja slava čez vso zemljo. 
[58:1]  ALI VI zares v tišini govorite pravičnost, o vi mogočneži? [Ali je pravičnost, pravilnost in pravica, da bi vi govorili čisto bedasto?] Ali sodite pošteno in iskreno, o vi človeški sinovi? 
[58:2] Ne, v vaših srcih si izmišljate zlobnost; v deželi razdeljujete nasilje svojih rok. 
[58:3] Brezbožneži so sprijeni in odtujeni od maternice; skrenejo takoj, ko so rojeni, govoreč laži. 
[58:4] Njihov strup je kakor strup kače; so kakor gluh modras ali rogata kača, ki si zatisne uho, 
[58:5] ki ne posluša glasu krotilcev ali očarljivca, ki nikoli ne uroči tako zvijačno. 
[58:6] Polomi jim zobe, o Bog, v njihovih ustih; izbij čekane mladih levov, o Gospod. 
[58:7] Naj se razblinijo kakor voda, ki naglo teče; ko nameri svoje puščice, naj bodo kakor bi bile brez konic ali preklane. 
[58:8] Naj bodo kakor polž, ki raztaplja slino ob tem, ko se pomika naprej ali kakor gnojna rana, ki upada, kakor [otrok, katerega] žena rodi predčasno, ki ni videl sonca. 
[58:9] Preden vaše posode lahko občutijo trnje, [ki je postavljeno podnje za gorivo], jih bo On vzel stran, kakor z vrtinčastim vetrom, zelene in prav tako goreče. 
[58:10] [Neupogljivo] pravični se bo radostil, ko vidi povračilo; svoja stopala bo namakal v krvi zlobnih. 
[58:11] Ljudje bodo rekli: "Zagotovo je nagrada za [brezkompromisno] pravičnega; zagotovo je Bog, ki sodi na zemlji." 
[59:1]  OSVOBODI ME pred mojimi sovražniki, o moj Bog; brani in varuj me pred tistimi, ki se vzdigujejo zoper mene. 
[59:2] Osvobodi me pred |tistimi| in vzdigni me nad tiste, ki počnejo hudobijo in me reši pred krvoločneži. 
[59:3] Kajti, poglej, prežijo za moje življenje; strastni in mogočni možje se skupaj povezujejo proti meni, ne zaradi mojega prestopka, niti zaradi kateregakoli mojega greha, o Gospod. 
[59:4] Tečejo in se pripravljajo, čeprav v meni ni krivde; dvigni Se, [O Gospod], da se snideš z menoj in mi pomagaš in vidiš! 
[59:5] Ti, o Gospod Bog nad bojevniki, Izraelov Bog, vzdigni se, da obiščeš vse narode; nikomur ne prizanašaj in ne bodi usmiljen z nikomer, ki izdajalsko načrtuje hudobijo.
[59:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Vračajo se zvečer, zavijajo in renčijo kakor psi in se [klatijo] po mestu. 
[59:7] Poglej, s svojimi usti bljuvajo [žaljivke]; meči [sarkazma, posmeha, obrekovanja in laži] so na njihovih ustnicah, kajti mislijo: "Kdo nas sliši?" 
[59:8] Toda Ti, o Gospod, se jim boš smejal [v preziru]; Ti boš vse narode imel v posmeh. 
[59:9] O moja moč, jaz bom gledal in pazil Nate in pel hvalnice; kajti Bog je moja obramba, (moj varuh in visoki stolp). 
[59:10] Moj Bog se bo v Svojem usmiljenju in neomajni ljubezni sešel z menoj; Bog me bo pustil gledati [zmagovito] na moje sovražnike, (tiste, ki prežijo name). 
[59:11] Ne pokončaj jih, da ne bi moje ljudstvo pozabilo; razkropi jih s Svojo močjo in jih prisili, da bodo blodili sem ter tja in jih ponižaj, o Gospod naš ščit! 
[59:12] Za greh njihovih ust in besede njihovih ustnic naj bodo celo ujeti in vzeti v njihovem ponosu in za preklinjanje in laganje, ki ga izrekajo. 
[59:13] Použij jih v silovitem besu, použij jih tako, da jih ne bo več; in do koncev sveta naj spoznajo, da Bog vlada nad Jakobom (Izraelom).
[59:14]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! In zvečer naj se vrnejo; naj zavijajo in renčijo kakor psi in se gredo klatiti po mestu. 
[59:15] Naj pohajajo gor in dol za hrano in se mudijo vso noč, če niso zadovoljeni, (niso dobili svoje izpolnjenosti). 
[59:16] Toda jaz bom pel o Tvoji mogočni moči in oblasti; da, jaz bom na glas pel o Tvojem usmiljenju in ljubeči-skrbnosti zjutraj; kajti Ti si mi bil obramba, (trdnjava in visoki stolp) in zatočišče na dan moje stiske. 
[59:17] K Tebi, o moja moč, bom pel hvalnice; kajti Bog je moja obramba, moja trdnjava in visoki stolp, Bog, ki mi izkazuje usmiljenje in neomajno ljubezen. 
[60:1]  O BOG, Ti si nas zavrnil in nas zavrgel, zlomil [naše obrambe] in nas razkropil; Ti si bil jezen – o obnovi nas in Se zopet obrni k nam! 
[60:2] Ti si storil, da je zemlja drgetala in trepetala, Ti si jo razklal, [odprl]; popravi njene vrzeli, kajti trese se in opoteka. 
[60:3] Ti si storil, da je Tvoje ljudstvo trpelo težke stvari; Ti si nam dal piti vino, ki nas naredi opotekajoče in oslepljene. 
[60:4] [Toda sedaj] si Ti postavil zastavo za tiste, ki se bojijo in Te obožujoče častijo, [h kateri lahko pobegnejo pred lokom], prapor prikazan zaradi resnice.
[60:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Da bi Tvoji ljubljeni lahko bili osvobojeni, reši s Svojo desnico in odgovori nam [ali meni]. 
[60:6] Bog je govoril v Svoji svetosti, [v Svojih obljubah]: "Jaz se bom radostil, Jaz bom delil in razdelil [deželo] Sihem in Sukótsko dolino [od zahoda do vzhoda]. 
[60:7] Gileád je Moj in Manáse je Moj; Efrájim je prav tako Moja čelada, (obramba Moje glave); Juda je Moje žezlo in Moj zakonodajalec. 
[60:8] Moáb je Moj umivalnik, [ponižan na najostudnejše hlapčevstvo]; na Edóm Jaz mečem Svoj čevelj v zmagoslavju; nad Filistejo Jaz vzdignem krik zmage." 
[60:9] Kdo bo mene, [Davida], privedel v močno mesto [Petra]? Kdo me bo vodil v Edóm? 
[60:10] Ali nas nisi Ti zavrnil, o Bog? In ali ne boš Ti šel naprej, o Bog, z našimi vojskami? 
[60:11] O daj nam pomoč proti sovražniku, kajti prazna, (neučinkovita in brez namena), je pomoč ali rešitev duše od človeka. 
[60:12] Zaradi Boga bomo delali hrabro, kajti On je Ta, ki bo poteptal naše nasprotnike. 
[61:1]  USLIŠI MOJ klic, o Bog; prisluhni moji molitvi. 
[61:2] Iz konca zemlje bom klical k Tebi, ko je moje srce preplavljeno in medleče; vodi me do skale, ki je višja od mene, [da, skale, ki je previsoka zame]. 
[61:3] Kajti Ti si mi bil zatočišče in pribežališče, čvrst stolp proti sovražniku. 
[61:4] V Tvojem svetišču bom prebival za vedno; naj najdem pribežališče in zaupanje v zatočišču Tvojih peruti.
[61:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Kajti Ti, o Bog, si slišal moje zaobljube; Ti si mi dal dediščino tistih, ki se bojijo, častijo in spoštujejo Tvoje ime. 
[61:6] Naj Ti [resnično] podaljšaš Kraljevo življenje, [pridodajaš dneve k dnevom] in Njegova leta naj bodo do zadnjega rodu [tega sveta in rodov sveta, ki prihaja]. 
[61:7] Naj On za vedno sedi ustoličen pred Božjim [obličjem]; o uredi, da bi lahko ljubeča-skrbnost in zvestoba bdeli nad Njim! 
[61:8] Tako bom pel hvalo Tvojemu imenu za vedno, dan za dnem odplačeval svoje zaobljube. 
[62:1]  NA BOGA samega moja duša čaka v tišini; od Njega prihaja rešitev moje duše. 
[62:2] Samo On je moja skala in rešitelj moje duše, moja obramba in moja trdnjava, ne bom močno omajan. 
[62:3] Kako dolgo boste trdovratno vztrajali pri človeku, da bi ga lahko ubili, vsi vi, kakor nagnjen zid, kakor razmajana ograda? 
[62:4] Posvetujejo se samo, da bi ga vrgli dol iz njegove višine, [da bi ga osramotili]; veselijo se v lažeh. Blagoslavljajo s svojimi usti, toda v notranjosti preklinjajo.
[62:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Moja duša, čakaj samo na Boga in se Mu tiho podredi; kajti moje upanje in pričakovanje sta od Njega. 
[62:6] Samo On je moja skala in rešitelj moje duše; On je moja obramba in moja trdnjava, ne bom omajan. 
[62:7] Z Bogom počiva rešitev moje duše in moja slava; On je moja skala neupogljive moči in neprebojne trdote in moje zatočišče je v Bogu! 
[62:8] Zaupajte v |Njega|, naslanjajte se |Nanj|, zanesite se |Nanj| in imejte zaupljivost v Njem ob vseh časih, vi ljudje; svoja srca izlivajte pred Njim. Bog je za nas zatočišče, (trdnjava in visoki stolp).
[62:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Možje nizkega stanu, [na socialni lestvici], so praznina, (ničevost, dih), možje visokega stanu, [na enaki lestvici], pa so laž in zabloda. Na tehtnicah gredo navzgor; skupaj so lažji od diha. 
[62:10] Ne zaupaj v |oderuštvo in zatiranje| in prepričano se ne zanesi na oderuštvo in zatiranje in ne upaj prazno v tatvino; če se dobrine povečujejo, nanje ne navezuj svojega srca. 
[62:11] Bog je govoril enkrat, dvakrat sem slišal tole: da oblast pripada Bogu. 
[62:12] Prav tako Tebi, o Gospod, pripada usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost, kajti Ti vsakemu človeku vračaš glede na njegovo delo.  
[63:1]  O Bog, Ti si moj Bog, iskreno Te bom iskal; moj notranji jaz žeja po Tebi, moje meso hrepeni in medli po Tebi v suhi in iztrošeni deželi, kjer ni nobene vode. 
[63:2] Tako sem pogledal Nate v svetišču, da bi videl Tvojo oblast in Tvojo slavo. 
[63:3] Zato ker je Tvoja ljubeča-skrbnost boljša od življenja, bodo moje ustnice hvalile Tebe. 
[63:4] Tako Te bom blagoslavljal, medtem ko živim; svoje roke bom povzdigoval v Tvojem imenu. 
[63:5] Moje celotno bitje bo zadovoljno kakor z mozgom in maščobo; in moja usta Te bodo hvalila z radostnimi ustnicami, 
[63:6] ko se Te spominjam na svoji postelji in premišljujem o Tebi v nočnih stražah. 
[63:7] Kajti Ti si bil moja pomoč in v senci Tvojih peruti se bom radostil. 
[63:8] Moje celotno bitje Ti tesno sledi in se Te tesno oklepa; Tvoja desnica me drži pokonci. 
[63:9] Toda tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje, da bi ga zrušili in uničili, bodo [sami uničeni in] šli v nižje dele zemlje, [v podzemlje mrtvih]. 
[63:10] Izročeni bodo oblasti meča; plen bodo za lisice in šakale. 
[63:11] Toda kralj se bo radostil v Bogu; vsak kdor prisega pri Njem, [to je, ki sebe obvezuje z Božjo oblastjo, priznava Njegovo nadvlado in sebe posveti Njegovi slavi in samemu služenju; vsak takšen] bo slavil, kajti usta tistih, ki govore laži, bodo ustavljena. 
[64:1]  SLIŠI MOJ glas, o Bog, v moji pritožbi; varuj in ohrani moje življenje pred nasiljem sovražnika. 
[64:2] Skrij me pred skrivnim posvetovanjem in zaroto brezbožneža, pred načrtovanjem hudobnežev, 
[64:3] ki svoje jezike brusijo kakor meč, ki zastrupljene besede namerjajo kakor puščice, 
[64:4] ki iz zasede streljajo na nedolžnega človeka; nenadoma streljajo nanj brez samo-obtoževanja ali strahu. 
[64:5] Spodbujajo se v hudobnem namenu, govorijo o skrivnem polaganju zank; govorijo: "Kdo nas bo odkril?" 
[64:6] Premišljujejo dejanja nepravičnosti in pravijo: "Mi smo dosegli dobro-izmišljeno stvar! Kajti notranje mišljenje vsakogar [je neraziskavno] in njegovo srce je globoko." 
[64:7] Toda Bog bo nanje ustrelil nepričakovano puščico; in nenadoma bodo ranjeni. 
[64:8] In prisiljeni bodo, da se spotaknejo, njihovi lastni jeziki se bodo obrnili proti njim; vsi, ki strmijo vanje, bodo zmajevali z glavami in bežali stran. 
[64:9] In vsi ljudje se bodo [častitljivo] bali in bodo v strahospoštovanju; in razglašali bodo Božje delo, kajti modro bodo preudarili in priznali, da je to Njegovo delo. 
[64:10] [Brezkompromisno] pravični bodo zadovoljni v Gospodu in bodo zaupali in se zatekali Vanj; in vsi iskreni v srcu bodo slavili in ponudili hvalo. 
[65:1]  TEBI pripada tišina, (vdan čudež čaščenja, ki izbruhne v hvalo) in hvala pripada in je primerna Tebi, o Bog, na Sionu; in Tebi bodo opravljene prisege. 
[65:2] O Ti, ki uslišiš molitev, k Tebi bo prišlo vse meso. 
[65:3] Krivičnosti in zelo raznovrstna krivda prevladujejo proti meni; [in vendar] glede naših prestopkov, Ti odpuščaš in jih odstranjaš, [delaš zanje odkupitev in jih pokrivaš pred Svojim pogledom]! 
[65:4] Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, ki ga Ti izbereš in povzročiš, da pride blizu, da bi lahko prebival v Tvojih dvorih! Mi bomo zadovoljni z dobroto Tvoje hiše, Tvojega svetišča. 
[65:5] Po strašnih in slavnih stvareh, [ki ustrahujejo zlobne, toda povzročijo, da bogaboječi pojejo hvalnice], nam Ti odgovarjaš v pravičnosti, (pravilnosti in pravici), o Bog rešitve naših duš, Ti, ki si zaupanje in upanje vseh koncev zemlje in tistih daleč stran na morjih; 
[65:6] ki si s [Svojo] mogočnostjo osnoval gore, bil opasan z oblastjo, 
[65:7] ki še vedno umirjaš besnenje morij, besnenje njihovih valov in hrušč ljudstev, 
[65:8] tako da se tisti, ki bivajo v najoddaljenejših krajih zemlje, bojijo znakov [narave] Tvoje prisotnosti. Ti pripravljaš kraja, kjer imata rojstvo jutro in večer, da vzklikata od radosti. 
[65:9] Ti obiskuješ zemljo in jo nasičuješ z vodo; Ti jo silno bogatiš; Božja reka je polna vode; ko si Ti tako pripravil zemljo, jih Ti oskrbiš z žitom. 
[65:10] Ti obilno zalivaš poljske brazde, Ti naravnavaš njene robove; Ti zemljo mehčaš z nalivi, blagoslavljaš klike njenega rastja. 
[65:11] Ti leto venčaš s Svojim obiljem in dobroto in sledi [koles] Tvojih [bojnih voz] se cedijo od maščobe. 
[65:12] [Razkošni] pašniki v neobdelani deželi se cedijo [od vlage] in griči se opasujejo z radostjo. 
[65:13] Travniki so oblečeni s čredami, prav tako so doline pokrite z žitom; vpijejo od radosti in skupaj pojejo. 
[66:1]  NAREDI radosten hrup k Bogu, vsa zemlja; 
[66:2] prepevajte čast in slavo Njegovemu imenu; Njegovo hvalo naredite veličastno! 
[66:3] Recite Bogu: "Kako osupljiva in kako strašno veličastna so Tvoja dela! Zaradi veličine Tvoje oblasti se Ti bodo Tvoji sovražniki podredili [s hlinjeno in nejevoljno ubogljivostjo]. 
[66:4] Vsa zemlja se Ti bo priklonila in Ti pela [hvalnice]; v pesmi bodo hvalili Tvoje ime."
[66:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Pridite in glejte Božja dela; poglejte kako [On reši Svoje ljudstvo tako, da udari njihove sovražnike; On je] strašen v Svojih delih za človeške otroke. 
[66:6] On je morje spremenil v suho zemljo, peš so prečkali skozi reko; tam smo se radostili v Njem. 
[66:7] On vlada s Svojo mogočnostjo za vedno, Njegove oči ogledujejo in nadzorujejo nad narodi; naj se uporniki ne povzdigujejo.
[66:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Blagoslavljajte našega Boga, o ljudstva, dajte Mu hvaležno zahvalo in naj se sliši glas Njegove hvale, 
[66:9] ki nas je postavil in ohranil med živečimi in ni dopustil, da bi naša stopala zdrsnila. 
[66:10] Kajti Ti, o Bog, si nas potrdil; Ti si nas preizkusil, kakor se preizkuša srebro, očiščeno in prečiščeno. 
[66:11] Ti si nas privedel v mrežo, (zaporniško utrdbo, ječo); Ti si na naša ledja položil težko breme. 
[66:12] [Ko smo bili na tleh] si Ti povzročil, da so ljudje jahali čez naše glave; šli smo skozi ogenj in skozi vodo, toda Ti si nas privedel ven na prostran, vlažen kraj, [k obilju in osvežitvi in na prosto]. 
[66:13] Prišel bom v Tvojo hišo z žgalnimi daritvami [celotne posvetitve]; plačal Ti bom svoje zaobljube, 
[66:14] ki so jih izrekle moje ustnice in obljubila moja usta, ko sem bil v stiski. 
[66:15] Daroval Ti bom žgalne daritve tolstih jagnjet z ovni, použitimi v prijetno-dišečem dimu; ponudil bom bikce in kozle.
[66:16]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Pridite in poslušajte vsi vi, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče bojite Boga in razglasil bom kaj je On storil zame! 
[66:17] Glasno sem klical k Njemu; On je bil povzdigovan in visoka hvala je bila pod mojim jezikom. 
[66:18] Če v svojem srcu čislam krivičnost, me Gospod ne bo uslišal;  
[66:19] toda zagotovo me je Bog slišal; On je bil pozoren na glas moje molitve. 
[66:20] Blagoslovljen bodi Bog, ki ni zavrnil moje molitve, niti ni od mene odstranil Svojega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti, [kakor je vedno] z menoj. 
[67:1]  BOG NAM bodi usmiljen ter milostljiv in blagoslovi nas in povzroči, da bo Njegov obraz sijal nad nami in med nami –
[67:2]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! - da bi bila Tvoja pot lahko spoznana na zemlji, Tvoja rešilna oblast, (Tvoje osvobojenje in Tvoja rešitev duš), med vsemi narodi. 
[67:3] Naj Te hvalijo ljudstva, [se obrnejo stran od svojih malikov] in se Ti zahvaljujejo, o Bog; naj Te vsa ljudstva hvalijo in se zahvaljujejo. 
[67:4] O naj bodo narodi veseli in naj pojejo od radosti, kajti Ti boš sodil ljudstva pravično in vodil, usmerjal ali gnal narode na zemlji.
[67:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Naj Te hvalijo ljudstva, [se obrnejo stran od svojih malikov] in se zahvaljujejo Tebi, o Bog; naj Te vsa ljudstva hvalijo in se zahvaljujejo! 
[67:6] Zemlja je dala svojo žetev, [v dokaz Božjega odobravanja]; Bog, celo naš lasten Bog, nas bo blagoslovil. 
[67:7] Bog nas bo blagoslovil in vsi konci zemlje se Ga bodo častitljivo bali. 
[68:1]  BOG JE [že] pričel vstajati in Njegovi sovražniki se razkropijo; naj tudi tisti, ki Ga sovražijo, bežijo pred Njim! 
[68:2] Kakor je dim odgnan stran, tako jih odženi stran; kakor se vosek stopi pred ognjem, tako naj zlobni izginejo pred prisotnostjo Boga. 
[68:3] Toda [brezkompromisno] pravični naj bodo zadovoljni; naj bodo razigrani in v slavi pred Bogom, da, naj se [navdušeno] radostijo. 
[68:4] Pojte Bogu, pojte hvalnice Njegovemu imenu, odprite široko pot za Njega, ki jaha skozi puščave – Njegovo ime je Gospod – bodite razigrani in v slavi pred Njim! 
[68:5] Oče tistih brez očeta in sodnik ter varuh vdov je Bog v Svojem svetem prebivališču. 
[68:6] Bog postavlja osamele v družine in zapuščenim daje dom v katerem prebivajo; On ujetnike vodi ven v blaginjo; toda uporniki prebivajo v izsušeni deželi. 
[68:7] O Bog, ko si Ti šel naprej pred Svojim ljudstvom, ko si Ti korakal skozi divjino –
[68:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! - se je zemlja tresla, tudi podaljšek nebes je navzdol izlival [dež] ob prisotnosti Boga; tamkaj se je Sinaj tresel ob prisotnosti Boga, Izraelovega Boga. 
[68:9] Ti, o Bog, si poslal obilen dež; Ti si obnovil in potrdil Svojo dediščino, ko je pešala in bila izmučena. 
[68:10] Tvoja čreda je našla prebivališče v njej; Ti, o Bog, si v Svoji dobroti poskrbel za ubogega in pomoči potrebnega. 
[68:11] Gospod daje besedo [moči]; žene, ki nosijo in objavljajo [novice], so sijajne bojevnice. 
[68:12] Kralji sovražnikovih vojskà bežijo, oni bežijo! Tista, ki se zadržuje doma, deli plen, [ki je ostal zadaj]. 
[68:13] Čeprav bi [zabušantje] lahko ležali med ovčjimi ogradami, [v malomarni sproščenosti, so vendar za Izraela] krila golobice prekrita s srebrom, njena peresa, nenavadno ozelenela z zlatom, [so vojni plen odvzet sovražniku]. 
[68:14] Ko je Vsemogočni razpršil kralje v [deželi], je bilo kakor kadar sneži na Calmónu, [gozdnatem hribu blizu Sihema]. 
[68:15] Ali je gora Bašán visoka gora izmed vrhov, gora Bašán, [vzhodno od Jordana], Božja gora? 
[68:16] Zakaj gledate z zamero in zavistjo, ve gore z veliko vrhovi, goro [mesta imenovanega Sion], katero si je Bog zaželel za Svoje prebivališče? Da, Gospod bo za vedno prebival v njej. 
[68:17] Bojnih Božjih vozov je dvajset tisoč, celo tisoči nad tisočerimi. Gospod je med njimi, kakor je bil On na Sinaju, [tako tudi] v svetem mestu, (svetišču v Jeruzalemu). 
[68:18]  Ti si se povzpel na višavo. Ti si odpeljal proč v ujetništvo niz poraženih sovražnikov; Ti si sprejel darove ljudi, da, tudi od upornih, da bi Gospod Bog lahko tam z njimi prebival.  
[68:19] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod, ki prenaša naša bremena in nas nosi dan za dnem, celo Bog, ki je rešitev naše duše!
[68:20]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Bog nam je Bog osvobojenj in rešitve duš; in Bogu, Gospodu, pripada pobeg pred smrtjo, [nas osvobojuje]. 
[68:21] Toda Bog bo raztreščil glave Svojih sovražnikov, lasato téme tega, ki mirno nadaljuje v svojih prestopkih in krivih poteh. 
[68:22] Gospod je rekel: "Jaz bom privedel [tvoje sovražnike] nazaj iz Bašána; Jaz jih bom privedel nazaj iz globin [Rdečega] morja, 
[68:23] da bi jih ti lahko zdrobil, namakajoč svoje stopalo v krvi, da bi jeziki tvojih psov lahko imeli svoj delež od sovražnika." 
[68:24] Oni vidijo Tvoja ravnanja, o Bog, celó [svečane sprevode] mojega Boga, mojega Kralja, v svetišče, [v svetosti]. 
[68:25] Pevci gredo spredaj, igralci na glasbila zadaj; med njimi device igrajo na tamburine. 
[68:26] Blagoslavljaj, zahvaljuj se in hvaležno hvali Boga v celotnih zborih, celo Gospoda, o vi, ki ste od [Jakoba], Izraelovega izvira. 
[68:27] Tukaj je majhen Benjamin na čelu [sprevoda], Judovi princi in njihovo spremstvo, Zábulonovi princi in Neftálijevi princi. 
[68:28] Vaš Bog je ukazal vašo moč, [vašo mogočnost v Njegovem služenju in neprebojno odpornost na skušnjavo]; o Bog, pokaži Svojo moč in ojačaj to, kar si Ti izdelal za nas! 
[68:29] [Iz spoštovanja] do Tvojega svetišča v Jeruzalemu, Ti bodo kralji prinašali darila. 
[68:30] Ukori divje zveri, ki prebivajo med trstjem [v Egiptu], čredo bikov (vodij), s teleti ljudstev; pod nogami poteptaj tiste, ki hrepene po davčnem denarju; razženi ljudi, ki se veselijo v vojni. 
[68:31] Princi bodo prišli ven iz Egipta; Etiopija bo hitela iztegovati svoje roke [z daritvami pokornosti] Bogu. 
[68:32] Pojte Bogu, o kraljestva zemlje, pojte hvalnice Gospodu!
[68:33]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! [Pojte hvalnice] Njemu, ki jaha na podaljšku nebes, starodavnemu podaljšku nebes; glejte, On pošlje naprej Svoj glas, Svoj mogočen glas. 
[68:34] Oblast in moč pripisuj Bogu; Njegovo veličastvo je nad Izraelom in Njegova moč in mogočnost sta v ozračju. 
[68:35] O Bog, strahospoštovanje-navdihujoč, nadvse prepričljiv in strašen si Ti iz Svojih svetih krajev; sam Izraelov Bog daje moč in polnost sile Svojemu narodu. Blagoslovljen bodi Bog! 
[69:1]  REŠI ME, o Bog, kajti vode so prišle do mojega vratu, [pretijo mojemu življenju]. 
[69:2] Tonem v globokem blatu, tam kjer ni trdnih tal; prispel sem v globoke vode, kjer me preplavljajo valovi. 
[69:3] Izčrpan sem od svojega klicanja; moje grlo je izsušeno; moje oči pešajo s čakanjem, [upajoč] na svojega Boga. 
[69:4] Tistih, ki me sovražijo brez razloga, je več kakor las na moji glavi; tisti, ki bi me odrezali in uničili, ki so po krivem moji sovražniki, so številni in močni. Jaz sem [prisiljen] povrniti, česar nisem ukradel.  
[69:5] O Bog, Ti poznaš mojo neumnost in nepremišljenost; moji grehi in moja krivda niso skriti pred Teboj. 
[69:6] Naj ne bodo tisti, ki Te čakajo in upajo in iščejo, o Gospod nad bojevniki, zaradi mene osramočeni; naj ne bodo tisti, ki Te iščejo in sprašujejo po |Tebi| in |Te| zahtevajo, [kakor svojo življenjsko potrebo] zaradi mene privedeni v zmedenost in sramoto, o Izraelov Bog. 
[69:7] Kajti zaradi Tebe sem prenašal zasmehovanje in očitke; zmeda in sramota sta pokrili moj obraz. 
[69:8] Postal sem tujec svojim bratom in tujec otrokom svoje matere.  
[69:9] Kajti gorečnost za Tvojo hišo me je použila in očitki in žalitve teh, ki očitajo in Te žalijo, so padli name.  
[69:10] Ko sem jokal in samega sebe ponižal s postom, sem bil v posmeh in ponižanje; 
[69:11] ko sem si naredil raševino za svoje oblačilo, sem jim postal pregovor (predmet prezira). 
[69:12] Tisti, ki sedijo v durih [mesta], se pogovarjajo o meni in jaz sem pesem pijancem. 
[69:13] Toda kar se mene tiče, moja molitev je k Tebi, o Gospod. Ob sprejemljivem in primernem času, o Bog, v množini Tvojega usmiljenja in obilju Tvoje ljubeče-skrbnosti me usliši in mi odgovori v resnici in zvestobi Tvoje rešitve duše. 
[69:14] Reši me iz blata in ne dopusti da potonem; naj bom osvobojen pred temi, ki me sovražijo in |osvobojen| ven iz globokih voda. 
[69:15] Naj me poplavne vode ne preplavijo in premagajo, niti ne dopusti, da me požre brezno, niti naj [izkopana] jama, [mogoče z vodo na dnu], ne zapre svojih ust nad menoj. 
[69:16] Sliši in odgovori mi, o Gospod, kajti Tvoja ljubeča-skrbnost je prijetna in tolažilna; po Svojem obilnem nežnem usmiljenju in neomajni ljubezni se obrni k meni. 
[69:17] Ne skrivaj Svojega obraza pred Svojim služabnikom, kajti v stiski sem; o hitro mi odgovori! 
[69:18] Približaj se mi in me odkupi; plačaj odkupnino in me osvobodi zaradi mojih sovražnikov, [da se ne bi oni veselili v moji podaljšani stiski]! 
[69:19] Ti poznaš mojo grajo in mojo sramoto in mojo nečast; moji nasprotniki so vsi pred Teboj, [popolnoma so Ti poznani]. 
[69:20] Očitki in graja so zlomili moje srce; poln sem potrtosti in bolan od žalosti. Iskal sem usmiljenja, toda ni ga bilo in tolažnikov, toda nisem našel nobenega. 
[69:21] Dali so mi tudi žolč, [strupen in grenak], za mojo hrano in v moji žeji so mi dali piti kis, (kislo vino).  
[69:22] Naj njihova lastna miza, [z vsem obiljem in razkošjem], postane zanje zanka; in kadar so varni v miru [ali na njihovih žrtvenih praznikih, naj ti postanejo] zanje zanka. 
[69:23] Naj bodo njihove oči zatemnjene, da ne bodo mogli videti in njihova ledja jim naredi neprenehoma drhteča [od strahu, osuplosti in oslabelosti]. 
[69:24] Nanje izlij Svojo ogorčenost in naj jih divjost Tvoje goreče jeze z njimi dohiti. 
[69:25] Naj njihovo bivališče in njihovo taborišče postane opustošenje; naj nihče ne prebiva v njihovih šotorih.  
[69:26] Kajti zasledujejo in preganjajo tistega, katerega si Ti udaril in opravljajo te, katere si Ti ranil, [dodajajoč] njihovi žalosti in bolečini. 
[69:27] Naj se [neodpuščena] pokvarjenost in krivica zbirata nad vsakim izmed njih [v Tvoji knjigi] in naj ne pridejo v Tvojo pravičnost ali da so opravičeni in oproščeni po Tebi. 
[69:28] Naj bodo izbrisani iz knjige živih in knjige življenja in naj ne bodo vpoklicani med [brezkompromisno] pravične, (te pokončne in v pravem odnosu z Bogom).  
[69:29] Toda jaz sem ubog, žalosten in v bolečini; naj me Tvoja rešitev duše, o Bog postavi na višave. 
[69:30] Gospodovo ime bom hvalil s pesmijo in poveličeval Ga bom z zahvaljevanjem 
[69:31] in to bo Gospodu bolj ugajalo kakor vol ali bikec, ki ima rogove in kopita. 
[69:32] Ponižni bodo to videli in bodo veseli; vi, ki iščete Boga, vprašujoč in zahtevajoč Ga [kakor svojo prvo potrebo], naj vaša srca oživijo in živijo!  
[69:33] Kajti Gospod sliši revne in pomoči potrebne in ne prezira Svojih ujetnikov, (Njegovih nesrečnih in ranjenih). 
[69:34] Naj Ga hvalijo nebesa in zemlja, morja in vse kar se giblje v njih. 
[69:35] Kajti Bog bo rešil Sion in obnovil mesta Judeje; in [Njegovi služabniki] bodo ostali in prebivali tam ter jo imeli v svoji posesti; 
[69:36] otroci Njegovih služabnikov jo bodo podedovali in tisti, ki ljubijo Njegovo ime, bodo prebivali v njej. 
[70:1]  PODVIZAJ SE, o Bog, da me osvobodiš; podvizaj se, da mi pomagaš, o Gospod! 
[70:2] Naj bodo osramočeni in zbegani tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo moje življenje; naj bodo obrnjeni nazaj in privedeni v zmešnjavo in sramoto tisti, ki hrepenijo in se radostijo v moji bolečini. 
[70:3] Naj bodo obrnjeni nazaj in |bodo| osupli zaradi njihove sramote in onečaščeni tisti, ki pravijo: "Aha, aha!" 
[70:4] Naj se vsi tisti, ki povprašujejo, hrepenijo po |Tebi| in za Teboj in Te zahtevajo [kakor svojo življenjsko potrebo], radostijo in bodo veseli v Tebi; in naj tisti, ki ljubijo Tvojo rešitev duš, nenehno govorijo: "Naj bo Bog poveličan!" 
[70:5] Toda jaz sem ubog in pomoči potreben; podvizaj se k meni, o Bog! Ti si moja pomoč in moj osvoboditelj; o Gospod, ne mudi se! 
[71:1] VATE, o Gospod, polagam svoje zaupanje in se prepričano zatekam; naj ne bom nikoli postavljen v sramoto ali zmedenost! 
[71:2] Osvobodi me v Svoji pravičnosti in mi povzroči, da zbežim; Svoje uho upogni k meni in me reši! 
[71:3] Bodi mi skala zatočišča za prebivanje in varovana trdnjava, v katero se lahko nenehno zatekam, katero si Ti določil, da me rešiš, kajti Ti si moja skala in moja trdnjava. 
[71:4] Reši me, o moj Bog, iz roke zlobnega, iz prijema nepravičnega in brezobzirnega človeka. 
[71:5] Kajti Ti si moje upanje; o Gospod Bog, Ti si moje zaupanje od moje mladosti in vir moje zaupnosti. 
[71:6] Nate sem se naslanjal in se zanašal od rojstva; Ti si ta, ki me je vzel iz materinega trebuha in Ti si bil od tistega dne moj dobrotnik. Moja hvala je nenehno o Tebi. 
[71:7] Sem kakor čudež in presenečenje mnogim, toda Ti si moje močno zatočišče. 
[71:8] Moja usta bodo napolnjena s Tvojim hvaljenjem in s Tvojim čaščenjem ves dan. 
[71:9] Ne odženi me, niti me v času moje visoke starosti ne pošlji proč; ne zapusti me, ko je moja krepkost iztrošena in moje moči odpovedujejo. 
[71:10] Kajti moji sovražniki govorijo zoper mene; tisti, ki gledajo za mojim življenjem, se skupaj posvetujejo, 
[71:11] govoreč: "Bog ga je zapustil; zasledujmo in preganjajmo in vzmemimo ga, kajti nikogar ni, da ga osvobodi." 
[71:12] O Bog, ne bodi daleč od mene! O moj Bog, hiti mi pomagat! 
[71:13] Naj bodo osramočeni in použiti tisti, ki nasprotujejo mojemu življenju; naj bodo prekriti z očitkom, zaničevanjem in nečastjo tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo mojo bolečino. 
[71:14] Toda jaz bom nenehno upal in še bolj in bolj Te bom hvalil. 
[71:15] Moja usta bodo govorila o Tvojih pravičnih dejanjih in Tvojih dejanjih rešitve duš ves dan, kajti njihovo število je večje kot ga poznam. 
[71:16] Prišel bom v moči in z mogočnimi dejanji Gospoda Boga; omenjal in hvalil bom Tvojo pravičnost, celo samo Tvojo. 
[71:17] O Bog, Ti si me poučeval od moje mladosti in doslej sem razglašal Tvoja čudežna dela. 
[71:18] Da, celo ko bom star in sivolas, o Bog, me ne zapusti, [temveč me ohranjaj živega], dokler nisem Tvoje mogočne moči razglasil [temu] rodu in Tvojo mogočnost ter oblast vsem, ki bodo prišli. 
[71:19] Tudi tvoja pravičnost, o Bog, je zelo visoka, [sega do podaljška nebes], Ti, ki si naredil velike stvari; o Bog, kdo je kakor Ti ali kdo je Tebi enak? 
[71:20] Ti, ki si nam [vsem] pokazal boleče in velike težave, nas boš ponovno pohitril in nas boš ponovno privedel iz globin zemlje. 
[71:21] Povečaj mojo veličino, (mojo čast) in se obrni ter me tolaži. 
[71:22] Prav tako Te bom hvalil s harfo, celo Tvojo resnico in zvestobo, o moj Bog; k Tebi bom pel hvalnice z liro, o Sveti Izraelov. 
[71:23] Moje ustnice in moje notranje bitje, katerega si Ti odkupil, bosta vpila od radosti med petjem hvalnic Tebi. 
[71:24] Tudi moj jezik bo govoril o Tvoji pravičnosti skozi ves dan; kajti osramočeni so, kajti zbegani so tisti, ki iščejo in zahtevajo mojo bolečino. 
[72:1]  DAJ KRALJU [spoznanje o] Tvojem [načinu] sojenja, o Bog in [duha] Tvoje pravičnosti kraljevemu sinu, [da bo vodil vsa njegova dejanja]. 
[72:2] Naj sodi in vlada Tvojemu ljudstvu s pravičnostjo in Tvojim ubogim in trpečim s sodbo ter pravico. 
[72:3] Gore bodo prinesle ljudstvu in gričem mir, zaradi [splošne uveljavitve] pravičnosti. 
[72:4] Naj sodi in brani uboge iz ljudstva, osvobodi otroke pomoči potrebnega in zdrobi zatiralca, 
[72:5] tako da |Te| bodo lahko častili in se Te bali, medtem ko sonce in luna ostajata skozi vse rodove. 
[72:6] Naj bo on, [Salomon kot pripadnik večjega Sina Kralja Davida], kakor dež, ki pride zjutraj na pokošeno travo, kakor nalivi, ki zalivajo zemljo. 
[72:7] V Njegovih, [Kristusovih] dneh bodo [brezkompromisno] pravični cveteli in mir bo obilen, dokler tam ni več lune.  
[72:8] On, [Kristus], bo imel prevlado tudi od morja do morja in od reke [Evfrat] do koncev zemlje.  
[72:9] Tisti, ki prebivajo v divjini, se bodo priklonili pred Njim, Njegovi sovražniki pa bodo lizali prah. 
[72:10] Kralji Taršíša in obal bodo prinesli daritve; kralji Sabe in Sebe bodo ponudili darove. 
[72:11] Da, vsi kralji bodo pokleknili pred Njim, vsi narodi Mu bodo služili.  
[72:12] Kajti On osvobaja pomoči potrebnega kadar kliče, tudi ubogega in tistega, ki nima pomočnika. 
[72:13] On bo imel usmiljenje z ubogim in slabotnim ter pomoči potrebnim in rešil bo življenja pomoči potrebnim. 
[72:14] On bo odkupil njihova življenja iz zatiranja in prevare ter nasilja in dragocena ter draga bo njihova kri v Njegovem pogledu. 
[72:15] In On bo živel; in Njemu bo dano zlato Sabe; tudi molitev bo narejena Zanj in zaradi Njega neprenehoma in skozi ves dan Ga bodo blagoslavljali in hvalili. 
[72:16] Tam bo obilje žita v zemlji na vrhu gora, [najmanj rodovitnih mestih v deželi]; njen sadež bo valovil kakor [gozdovi] Libanona in [prebivalci] mesta bodo uspevali kakor trava na zemlji. 
[72:17] Njegovo ime bo trajalo za vedno; Njegovo ime se bo nadaljevalo tako dolgo kakor sonce, [zares, Njegovo ime se nadaljuje pred soncem]. In ljudje bodo blagoslovljeni in se bodo blagoslavljali po Njem; vsi narodi Ga bodo klicali blagoslovljen! 
[72:18] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod Bog, Izraelov Bog, kateri sam dela čudežne stvari! 
[72:19] Blagoslovljeno bodi Njegovo veličastno ime za vedno; naj bo celotna zemlja napolnjena z Njegovo slavo! Amen in Amen! 
[72:20] Molitve Davida, Jesejevega sina, so končane. 
[73:1]  RESNIČNO, BOG je [edino] dobro Izraelu, celo tistim, ki so iskreni in čisti v srcu. 
[73:2] Toda kar se mene tiče, so moja stopala skoraj odšla, moji koraki so bili zelo blizu zdrsa. 
[73:3] Kajti zavisten sem bil bedakom in domišljavcem, kadar sem videl uspevanje zlobnih. 
[73:4] Kajti v svoji smrti ne trpijo ostrih bolečin, temveč je njihova moč trdna. 
[73:5] Niso v težavah kakor drugi ljudje; niti niso udarjeni in nadlegovani kakor drugi ljudje. 
[73:6] Zato jim je ponos kakor veriga okoli njihovih vratov; nasilje jih pokriva kakor oblačilo, [kakor dolga, razkošna obleka]. 
[73:7] Njihove oči izstopajo z debelostjo, imajo več kot si srce lahko želi; in fantazije njihovih misli prekipevajo [z neumnostjo]. 
[73:8] Norčujejo se in zlobno izrekajo tlačenje; naduto govorijo [iz višave, škodoželjno in bogokletno]. 
[73:9] S svojimi usti so se zoperstavili proti in govorijo dol iz podaljška nebes in njihovi jeziki se hvalijo po zemlji, [celo podaljšek nebes napadajo z bogokletji in zemljo zamažejo z obrekovanji].  
[73:10] Zato se Njegovo ljudstvo vrača sèm in vodá polne čaše, [ponujene od zlobnih], so [slepo] izpraznjene po njih. 
[73:11] Pravijo pa: "Kako lahko Bog ve? Ali obstaja vednost v Najvišjem?" 
[73:12] Poglejte, ti so brezbožni, ki vedno uspevajo in so sproščeni v svetu; rastejo v bogastvu. 
[73:13] Zagotovo sem potem zaman očistil svoje srce in svoje roke umil v nedolžnosti. 
[73:14] Ves dolg dan sem bil udarjan in trpinčen in kaznovan vsako jutro. 
[73:15] Če bi tako govoril [in dal izraz svojim občutkom], bi bil neresničen in izdajalsko postopal proti rodu Tvojih otrok. 
[73:16] Toda ko sem preudarjal, kako to razumeti, je bil to zame prevelik trud in preveč boleč, 
[73:17] dokler nisem šel v Božje svetišče; potem sem razumel, [kajti pretehtal sem] njihov konec. 
[73:18] [Navsezadnje] Ti [zlobne] nastavljaš na spolzka mesta; Ti jih mečeš dol v propad in uničenje. 
[73:19] Kako oni v trenutku postanejo opustošenje! Popolnoma so použiti s strahotami! 
[73:20] Kakor sanje, [ki se dozdevajo resnične], dokler se nekdo ne prebudi, tako, o Gospod, ko se Ti vzdigneš, [da bi se ozrl na zlobne], boš Ti preziral njihovo zunanjo predstavo. 
[73:21] Kajti moje srce je bilo užaloščeno, zagrenjeno in v stanju vrenja in v svojem srcu sem bil zboden, [kakor z ostrim modrasovim zobom]. 
[73:22] Tako bedast, neumen in surov sem bil in neveden; bil sem kakor žival pred Teboj. 
[73:23] Kljub temu sem neprenehoma s Teboj; Ti me držiš za desnico. 
[73:24] Ti me boš vodil s Svojim nasvetom in me pozneje sprejel v čast in slavo. 
[73:25] Koga imam v nebesih razen Tebe? In nobenega veselja ali želje nimam na zemlji poleg Tebe. 
[73:26] Moje meso in moje srce lahko odpovesta, toda Bog je skala in trdna moč mojega srca in moj Delež za vedno. 
[73:27] Kajti poglej, tisti, ki so daleč od Tebe, bodo izginili; Ti boš uničil vse, ki so do Tebe hinavski in Te zapuščajo kakor [duhovne] vlačuge. 
[73:28] Toda zame je dobro, da se pritegnem bliže k Bogu; svoje zaupanje sem položil v Gospoda Boga in Ga naredil za svoje zatočišče, da lahko pripovedujem o vseh Tvojih delih. 
[74:1]  O BOG, zakaj nas Ti zavračaš za vedno? Zakaj Tvoja jeza gori in se kadi proti ovcam Tvoje paše? 
[74:2] [Iskreno] se spomni Svojega zbora, ki si ga Ti pridobil od davnine, ki si ga Ti odkupil, da bo pleme Tvoje dediščine; spomni se gore Sion, kjer si Ti prebival. 
[74:3] Svoja stopala [hitro] usmeri k stalnim razvalinam in puščobam; sovražnik je v svetišču vse opustošil in oskrunil. 
[74:4] V sredi Tvojega svetega kraja so Tvoji sovražniki besneli [s svojimi bojnimi klici], svoje lastne [malikovalske] simbole so postavili za znamenja [zmage]. 
[74:5] Izgledali so kakor ljudje, ki so vzdignili sekire na najdebelejše izmed dreves, da bi sami sebi naredili sloves. 
[74:6] In potem so ves izrezljan les svetega mesta razbili s sekiricami in kladivi. 
[74:7] Zažgali so Tvoje svetišče; onečastili so kraj za prebivališče Tvojega Imena, s poteptanjem v tla. 
[74:8] V svojih srcih so rekli: "Naredimo opustošenje [takšnih mest] v celoti." Zažgali so vse Božje hiše za srečanja v deželi. 
[74:9] Mi ne vidimo naših znamenj; nobenega preroka ni več, niti nihče izmed nas ne ve za kako dolgo. 
[74:10] O Bog, kako dolgo se bo nasprotnik posmehoval in grajal? Ali bo sovražnik preklinjal in žalil Tvoje ime za vedno? 
[74:11] Zakaj Ti zadržuješ Svojo roko, celo Svojo desnico? Izvleci jo ven iz Svojega naročja in použij jih, [naredi jim konec]! 
[74:12] In vendar je Bog moj Kralj od davno, dela rešitev duš v sredi zemlje. 
[74:13] Ti si s Svojo oblastjo razdelil [Rdeče] morje; Ti si v vodah polomil glave [egiptovskim] zmajem.  
[74:14] Ti si zdrobil glave Leviatána, (Egipta); Ti si ga dal kot hrano za ustvarjena bitja, ki naseljujejo divjino. 
[74:15] Ti si razklal [skalo, odkril] studence in tokove; Ti si posušil mogočne, večno tekoče reke (Jordana).  
[74:16] Dan je Tvoj, noč je prav tako Tvoja; Ti si osnoval [zvezdnato] svetlobo in sonce. 
[74:17] Ti si določil vse meje zemlje, [razdelitve kopnega in morja ter narodov]; Ti si naredil poletje in zimo.  
[74:18] [Iskreno] se spominjaj kako se je bil sovražnik posmehoval, o Gospod in Te grajal in kako so bedasti in brezbožni ljudje preklinjali Tvoje ime. 
[74:19] Oh, ne daj življenja svoje grlice divji zveri, (požrešni množici); ne pozabi življenja [množice] Svojih ubogih za vedno. 
[74:20] Imej spoštovanje za zavezo, [ki si jo Ti sklenil z Abrahamom], kajti temni kraji zemlje so polni prebivališč nasilja. 
[74:21] Oh, ne dopusti, da bi se potrti vrnili v sramoti; naj zatirani in pomoči potrebni hvalijo Tvoje ime. 
[74:22] Vzdigni se, o Bog, zagovarjaj Svojo lastno stvar; [iskreno] se spominjaj kako se bedasti in brezbožni človek posmehuje in Te graja dan za dnem in skozi ves dan. 
[74:23] Ne pozabi [protestirajočih] glasov Tvojih nasprotnikov, hrupa tistih, ki se vzdigujejo zoper Tebe, ki se neprenehoma vzpenjajo. 
[75:1]  MI DAJEMO hvalo in zahvalo Tebi, o Bog, hvalimo in se zahvaljujemo; Tvoja čudežna dela razglašajo, da je Tvoje Ime blizu in tisti, ki se sklicujejo na Tvoje Ime, naštevajo Tvoje čudeže. 
[75:2] Ko pride primeren čas, [za izvršbo Mojih sodb], bom Jaz sodil pošteno, [govori Gospod]. 
[75:3] Ko se zemlja opoteka in vsi njeni prebivalci, sem Jaz ta, ki bom uravnovesil in ohranjal njene stebre stabilne.
[75:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Jaz sem rekel ošabnim in bahavim: "Ne ravnajte ošabno, [ne bahajte se]"; in zlobnim: "Ne povzdigujte roga, [posebnega poveličevanja]. 
[75:5] Ne vzdigujte svojega [napadalnega] roga na višino, ne govorite z naduto in predrzno ošabnostjo." 
[75:6] Kajti ne iz vzhoda, ne iz zahoda, niti ne iz juga ne pride povišanje in povzdigovanje.  
[75:7] Toda Bog je Sodnik! On odstrani enega in povzdigne drugega. 
[75:8] Kajti v Gospodovi roki je čaša [Njegovega besa] in vino se peni in je rdeče, dobro premešano; in On ga izliva iz nje in vsi zlobni zemlje jo morajo izprazniti in piti njene usedline.  
[75:9] Toda jaz bom razglašal in se radostil za vedno; pel bom hvalnice Jakobovemu Bogu. 
[75:10] Prav tako bom Jaz odrezal vse rogove brezbožnih, [govori Gospod], toda rogovi [brezkompromisno] pravičnih bodo povzdignjeni. 
[76:1]  V JUDU je Bog poznan in sloveč; Njegovo ime je visoko hvaljeno in je v Izraelu veličastno. 
[76:2] V [Jeru]Salemu je prav tako Njegovo svetišče in Njegovo prebivališče je na Sionu. 
[76:3] Tam je On zlomil bliskajoče puščice loka, ščit, meč in vojna orožja.
[76:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Slavnejši in sijajnejši si Ti od gora plena, [čudovitejši in veličastnejši, bolj kakor večne gore]. 
[76:5] Neustrašni so oropani svojega plena, spali so spanje [smrti]; in nihče izmed mogočnih ljudi ni mogel vzdigniti njihovih rok. 
[76:6] Ob Tvoji graji, o Bog Jakobov, sta oba, bojni voz [voznik] in konj vržena v smrtno spanje [smrti].  
[76:7] Tebe, celo Tebe se je treba bati [s strahospoštovanjem in čaščenjem]! Kdo lahko obstane v Tvoji prisotnosti, ko se Tvoja jeza enkrat vzdigne? 
[76:8] Ti si povzročil, da se je sodba slišala iz nebes; zemlja se je zbala in ustrašila – 
[76:9] ko se je Bog vzdignil, da bi [postavil] sodbo, da bi rešil vse krotke in zatirane na zemlji.
[76:10]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Zagotovo Te bo hvalil človekov bes; ostanek besa boš Ti zadrževal in opasal in Se z njim oborožil. 
[76:11] Zaobljubite se in plačajte Gospodu, vašemu Bogu; naj vsi, ki so okrog Njega, prinesejo darove Njemu, ki se ga je treba [častitljivo] bati. 
[76:12] On bo princem odrezal duha [ponosa in besnosti]; On je strašen za [brezbožne] kralje zemlje. 
[77:1]  S SVOJIM glasom bom klical k Bogu, celo k Bogu s svojim glasom in On bo nagnil uho in mi prisluhnil. 
[77:2] Na dan svoje stiske iščem, (povprašujem po |Gospodu| in obupno zahtevam) Gospoda; ponoči je moja roka iztegnjena [v molitvi] brez zavlačevanja; zavračam, da bi bil tolažen. 
[77:3] [Iskreno] se spominjam Boga; zaskrbljen sem in vzdihujem; zamišljen sem v molitvi in moj duh medli [preplavljen].
[77:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ti držiš moje oči pred zaprtjem; tako sem stiskan, da ne morem govoriti. 
[77:5] Preudarjam pretekle dni, leta minulih časov [uspešnosti]. 
[77:6] V spomin si kličem svojo pesem ponoči; s svojim srcem premišljujem in moj duh marljivo preiskuje: 
[77:7] "Ali bo Gospod zavrgel za vedno? In ali On nič več ne bo naklonjen? 
[77:8] Ali sta Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost prenehala za vedno? Ali so se Njegove obljube končale za vse čase? 
[77:9] Ali je Bog [namerno] zapustil ali pozabil Svojo milostljivost? Ali je On v jezi zaprl Svoje sočutje?"
[77:10]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! In jaz pravim: "Ta [očitna zapustitev Izraela od Boga] je moja določena usoda in preizkušnja, toda spominjal se bom let desnice Najvišjega, [v ljubeči-skrbnosti iztegnjeni k nam], kajti to je moja žalost, da se desnica Najvišjega spreminja." 
[77:11] Gospodova dejanja si bom [iskreno priklical v spomin]; da, [iskreno] se bom spominjal čudežev, ki si jih [Ti izvedel za naše očete] iz davnine. 
[77:12] Premišljeval bom tudi o vseh Tvojih delih in preudarjal vsa Tvoja [mogočna] dejanja. 
[77:13] Tvoja pot, o Bog, je v svetišču, [v svetosti, proč od greha in krivde]. Kdo je veličasten Bog, kakor je naš Bog? 
[77:14] Ti si Bog, ki delaš čudeže; Ti si prikazal Svojo moč med ljudstvi. 
[77:15] Ti si s Svojo [mogočno] roko odkupil svoje ljudstvo, Jakobove in Jožefove sinove.
[77:16]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ko so vode [pri Rdečem morju in Jordanu] zagledale Tebe, o Bog, so bile prestrašene; tudi globine so vzdrgetale, kajti [vse] vode so zagledale Tebe. 
[77:17] Oblaki so izlivali vodo, ozračja so poslala zvok [zamolklega grmenja]; Tvoje puščice so šle naprej [v viličastih bliskih]. 
[77:18] Glas Tvojega grmenja je bil v vrtincu, bliski so osvetljevali svet; zemlja je trepetala in se tresla. 
[77:19] Tvoja pot [v osvobojenju Tvojega ljudstva] je bila skozi morje in Tvoje steze skozi velike vode in vendar Tvoje stopinje niso bile sledljive, temveč so bile zabrisane. 
[77:20] Ti si Svoje ljudstvo vodil kakor čredo po Mojzesovi in Aaronovi roki. 
[78:1]  PRISLUHNI, o moje ljudstvo, mojemu učenju; nagnite svoja ušesa k besedam mojih ust. 
[78:2] Svoja usta bom odprl v prispodobi, (v poučevanju s številnimi primeri); izrekel bom temne izreke iz davnine, [ki skrivajo pomembno resnico] – 
[78:3] ki smo jih slišali in spoznali in so nam naši očetje povedali. 
[78:4] Ne bomo jih skrivali pred njihovimi otroci, temveč bomo prihajajočemu rodu povedali hvalevredna dejanja Gospoda in Njegovo veličino in čudovita dela, ki jih je On izvedel. 
[78:5] Kajti On je osnoval pričevanje, (jasno navodilo) v Jakobu in določil zakon v Izraelu, zapovedujoč našim očetom, da naj bi svojim otrokom dali vedeti [veličastna dejstva o Božjih ravnanjih z Izraelom], 
[78:6] da jih bo rod, ki prihaja, lahko poznal, da se bodo otroci, ki bodo šele rojeni, lahko vzdignili in jih pripovedovali svojim otrokom, 
[78:7] da bi svoje upanje lahko postavili v Boga in ne bi pozabili Božjih del, temveč bi lahko ohranili Njegove zapovedi 
[78:8] in tako ne bi bili kakor njihovi očetje – trdovraten in uporen rod, rod, ki svojih src ni naravnal pravilno, niti svojih src ni pripravil, da bi spoznala Boga in čigar duhovi niso bili trdni in zvesti Bogu. 
[78:9] Efrájimovi otroci so bili oboroženi in nosili loke, pa so se na dan bitke obrnili nazaj. 
[78:10] Niso ohranili Božje zaveze in zavrnili so, da bi hodili glede na Njegovo postavo 
[78:11] in pozabili so Njegova dela in Njegove čudeže, ki jih jim je On prikazal. 
[78:12] Fantastične stvari je On storil v očeh njihovih očetov v egiptovski deželi, na polju Coana, [kjer je imel faraon sedež]. 
[78:13] On je razdelil [Rdeče] morje in jim povzročil, da so šli skozenj in On je storil, da so vode stale kakor kup.  
[78:14] Prav tako jih je On podnevi vodil s [stebrom] dima in vso noč s svetlobo ognja.  
[78:15] On je razcepil skale v divjini in jim dal obilno piti kakor iz globine. 
[78:16] Prav tako je On iz skale privedel potoke, [pri Refidímu in Kadéšu] in je povzročil, da so vode tekle navzdol kakor reke.  
[78:17] Navzlic temu so še vedno grešili proti Njemu z izzivanjem in upiranjem proti Najvišjemu v divjini, (v deželi suše). 
[78:18] In v svojih srcih so skušali Boga z zahtevami po hrani glede na njihove [sebične] želje in poželenja. 
[78:19] Da, govorili so proti Bogu; rekli so: "Ali lahko Bog oskrbi [hrano za] mizo v divjini? 
[78:20] Poglejte, On je tako udaril skalo, da so iz nje brizgnile vode in so tokovi prekipevali; toda ali On lahko da tudi kruh? Ali On lahko priskrbi meso za Svoje ljudstvo?" 
[78:21] Zato, ko je Gospod slišal, je bil On [poln] besa; ogenj je bil razvnet proti Jakobu, Njegova jeza se je vzdignila proti Izraelu, 
[78:22] kajti v Boga niso verjeli, [niso se zanašali Nanj, niso se naslanjali Nanj] in niso zaupali v Njegovo rešitev duš, (Njegovo moč, da reši). 
[78:23] Kljub temu je On ukazal oblakom zgoraj in odprl vrata nebes; 
[78:24] in nanje je On deževal mano, da bi jedli in dal jim je nebeškega žita.  
[78:25] Vsak je jedel kruh mogočnih, [človek je jedel hrano angelov]; Bog jim je poslal hrane v obilju. 
[78:26] On je pustil, da je v podaljšku nebes pihal vzhodni veter in s Svojo močjo je On vodil južni veter. 
[78:27] Prav tako je On nanje deževal meso kakor prah in krilate ptice, [prepelice], kakor pesek morij.  
[78:28] In On je [pticam] dopustil padati v sredo njihovega tabora, okrog njihovih šotorov. 
[78:29] Tako so jedli in so bili dobro nasičeni; On jim je dal tisto, po čemer so hrepeneli in si poželeli. 
[78:30] Toda komaj so utišali svoje hrepenenje, medtem ko je bila njihova hrana še v njihovih ustih,  
[78:31] je nadnje prišel Božji bes in pobil najmočnejše in najodpornejše izmed njih ter zrušil izbrano izraelsko mladino. 
[78:32] Vsemu temu navkljub, so še bolj grešili, kajti niso verjeli |Vanj|, (se niso zanašali |Nanj| in se niso naslanjali Nanj zaradi) Njegovih čudežnih del. 
[78:33] Zato je On njihove dni použil kakor dih, [v praznini, lažnosti in jalovosti] in njihova leta v grozi ter nenadni naglici. 
[78:34] Ko je On pogubil [nekatere izmed] njih, [je ostanek] prizadevno povpraševal po Njem in so se pokesali ter [za nekaj časa] iskreno iskali Boga. 
[78:35] In [iskreno] so se spominjali, da je bil Bog njihova skala in Najvišji njihov odkupitelj. 
[78:36] Kljub temu so Mu laskali s svojimi usti in Mu lagali s svojimi jeziki. 
[78:37] Kajti njihova srca niso bila pravilna ali iskrena z Njim, niti niso bili zvesti in stanovitni Njegovi zavezi.  
[78:38] Toda On, poln [usmiljenega] sočutja, je odpustil njihove krivice in jih ni uničil; da, mnogokrat je svojo jezo On obrnil stran in ni zbudil vsega Svojega besa ter jeze. 
[78:39] Kajti On se je [iskreno] spominjal, da so bili zgolj meso, veter, ki gre in se ne vrača. 
[78:40] Kako pogosto so kljubovali in se upirali proti Njemu v divjini in Ga žalostili v puščavi! 
[78:41] In ponovno so se obrnili nazaj in preizkušali Boga, izzivali in razjarjali Svetega Izraelovega. 
[78:42] Niso se [resno] spominjali [čudežev delovanja] Njegove roke, niti dneva, ko jih je On osvobodil pred sovražnikom, 
[78:43] kako je On storil Svoje čudeže v Egiptu in Svoje čudeže na polju Coana, [kjer je imel faraon sedež] 
[78:44] in njihove reke in njihove potoke je spremenil v kri, tako da iz njih niso mogli piti. 
[78:45] On je mednje poslal roje [strupenih] muh, ki so jih žrle in žabe, ki so jih uničile. 
[78:46] Prav tako je On dal njihove pridelke gosenici in [sad] njihovega dela kobilici. 
[78:47] Njihove vinske trte je On uničil s točo in njihova figova drevesa s pozebo in [velikimi kepami] ledu. 
[78:48] On je [povzročil, da so zaprli njihovo govedo ali] so jih prav tako prepustili toči in njihove črede vročim strelam.  
[78:49] On je nanje izpustil ogorčenost Svoje jeze, Svoj bes in nadlogo s tem, ko je mednje poslal [poslanstvo] angelov pogube in gorja. 
[78:50] On je izravnal in naredil ravno pot za Njegovo jezo, [da ji je dal prosto smer]; [egiptovskim družinam] On ni prizanašal pred smrtjo, temveč je njihovo živino izročil kugi in življenja [njihovih najstarejših] udarcu. 
[78:51] On je udaril vse prvorojence v Egiptu, glavnino njihove moči v šotorih [dežele] Hamovih [sinov]. 
[78:52] Toda [Bog] je vodil Svoje lastno ljudstvo naprej kakor ovce in jih vodil [s skrbnostjo pastirja], kakor čredo v divjini. 
[78:53] In On jih je vodil varno naprej in v prepričanem zaupanju, tako da se niso bali; toda morje je poplavilo njihove sovražnike.  
[78:54] In On jih je privedel do Njegove svete meje, meje [Kánaana], Njegovega svetišča, celo do te gore [Sion], ki jo je pridobila Njegova desnica. 
[78:55] Prav tako je On pred [Izraelom] pregnal narode in njihovo deželo razdelil kot dediščino, jo odmeril in razparceliral; in On je storil, da so Izraelova plemena prebivala v šotorih razlaščenih. 
[78:56] In vendar so ga skušali in izzivali in se upirali proti Najvišjemu Bogu in niso ohranjali Njegovih pričevanj. 
[78:57] Temveč so se obrnili nazaj in ravnali nezvesto in izdajalsko, kakor njihovi očetje; bili so zviti kakor upognjen in varljiv lok, [ki se ne bo odzval na lokostrelčevo merjenje]. 
[78:58] Kajti s svojimi višinami [za malikovalsko oboževanje] so Ga izzivali do [pravične] jeze in Ga do ljubosumja razdražili s svojimi vrezanimi podobami. 
[78:59] Ko je Bog to slišal, je bil On poln [svetega] besa; in On je popolnoma zavrnil Izraela, z močnim prezirom in gnusom [njegovih poti], 
[78:60] tako da je On zapustil svetišče pri Šilu, šotor v katerem je On prebival med ljudmi [in se nikoli več ni vrnil vanj], 
[78:61] in Svojo silo in oblast, (skrinjo zaveze), je izročil v ujetništvo in Svojo slavo v roke sovražniku, (Filistejcem).  
[78:62] Prav tako je On Svoje ljudstvo predal meču in bil ogorčen nad Svojo dediščino, [Izraelom].  
[78:63] Ogenj [vojne] je použil njihove mladeniče in njihove zapuščene device niso bile hvaljene v poročni pesmi. 
[78:64] Njihova duhovnika [Hofní in Pinhás] sta padla pod mečem in njuni vdovi nista naredili nobenega objokovanja, [kajti trupla niso prišla nazaj iz prizorišča bitke in tudi Pinhásova vdova je ta dan umrla].  
[78:65] Potem se je Gospod zbudil kakor iz spanja, kakor močan mož, čigar zavest o moči je povzdignjena z vinom. 
[78:66] In On je udaril Svoje nasprotnike v hrbet, [medtem ko so bežali]; On jih je predal v trajno sramoto in grajo. 
[78:67] Še več, On je zavrnil Jožefov šotor in ni izbral Efrájimovega plemena, [v katerem je bilo svetišče ponavadi postavljeno]. 
[78:68] Temveč je On izbral Judovo pleme, [kot Izraelovega vodja], goro Sion, katero je On vzljubil, [da bi nadomestil Šilo kot Svojo prestolnico]. 
[78:69] In On je zgradil Svoje svetišče, [vzvišeno] kakor višave [podaljška nebes] in kakor zemljo, ki jo je On osnoval za vedno. 
[78:70] On je izbral Davida, Svojega služabnika in ga vzel izza ovčjih ograd;  
[78:71] od skrbi za ovce, ki so imele svoje mladiče, ga je On privedel, da je bil pastir Jakoba, Njegovega ljudstva, Izraela, Njegove dediščine.  
[78:72] Tako je bil [David] njihov pastir z iskrenim srcem; on jih je vodil z bistroumnostjo in spretnostjo, [ki je vodila] njegovi roki. 
[79:1]  O, Bog, narodi so prišli v [deželo Tvojega ljudstva], Tvojo dediščino; Tvoje posvečeno svetišče so onečastili; Jeruzalem so spremenili v kupe razvalin. 
[79:2] Mrtva trupla Tvojih služabnikov so dali kot hrano pticam podaljška nebes, meso tvojih svetih zemeljskim zverem. 
[79:3] Njihovo kri so izlili kakor vodo naokoli Jeruzalema in nikogar ni bilo, ki bi jih pokopal. 
[79:4] [Zaradi takšnih ponižanj] smo postali v porog in grajo našim sosedom, zasmehovanje in posmeh tistim, ki so okrog nas. 
[79:5] Kako dolgo, o Gospod? Ali boš Ti za vedno jezen? Ali bo Tvoje ljubosumje, [ki ne more prenesti deljene prisege zvestobe], gorelo kakor ogenj? 
[79:6] Svoj bes izlij na poganske narode, ki Te ne priznavajo in na kraljestva, ki ne kličejo Tvojega imena.  
[79:7] Kajti použili so Jakoba in opustošili njegovo prebivališče in njegov pašnik. 
[79:8] O, [iskreno] se ne spominjaj krivičnosti in krivd naših dedov zoper nas! Naj hitro pride Tvoje sočutje in nežno usmiljenje, da nas sreča, kajti privedeni smo zelo nizko. 
[79:9] Pomagaj nam, o Bog rešitve naših duš, zaradi slave Svojega imena! Osvobodi nas, odpusti nam in izbriši naše grehe zaradi Svojega imena. 
[79:10] Zakaj naj bi poganski narodi rekli: "Kje je njihov Bog?" Naj bo maščevanje za prelito kri Tvojih služabnikov znano med narodi v našem pogledu, [ne odloženo do nekega prihodnjega rodu]. 
[79:11] Naj vzdihovanje in stokanje ujetnika pride pred Tebe; glede na veličino Svoje oblasti in Svoje roke prizanesi tistim, ki so določeni, da umro! 
[79:12] In sedemkratno povrni v naročje naših sosedov porogljivke, s katerimi so se nam rogali in se Ti posmehovali, o Gospod! 
[79:13] Potem bomo mi, Tvoje ljudstvo, ovce Tvojega pašnika, Tebi dali zahvale za vedno; mi bomo pokazali in objavljali Tvojo hvalo iz roda v rod. 
[80:1]  PRISLUHNI, o Izraelov pastir, Ti, ki vodiš Jožefa kakor čredo; Ti, ki sediš ustoličen na kerubih [skrinje zaveze], zasij 
[80:2] pred Efrájimom in Benjaminom in Manásejem! Zbudi Svojo mogočnost in pridi, da nas rešiš! 
[80:3] Postavi nas ponovno, o Bog; in Svojemu obrazu povzroči, da bo [v zadovoljstvu in odobravanju] sijal [na nas] in mi bomo rešeni! 
[80:4] O Gospod Bog nad bojevniki, kako dolgo boš Ti jezen na molitve Svojega ljudstva? 
[80:5] Ti si jih hranil s kruhom solzá in Ti si jim v veliki meri dal piti solze. 
[80:6] Ti nas delaš v spor in posmeh našim sosedom in naši sovražniki se posmehujejo med seboj. 
[80:7] Ponovno nas obnovi, o Bog nad bojevniki; in povzroči, da bo Tvoj obraz sijal [na nas z naklonjenostjo kakor od davnine] in mi bomo rešeni! 
[80:8] Ti si izpeljal vinsko trto [Izraela] iz Egipta. Ti si pregnal [poganske] narode in jo vsadil [v Kánaan]. 
[80:9] Ti si pred njo pripravil prostor in pognala je globoko korenino in ta je napolnila deželo. 
[80:10] Gore so bile pokrite z njeno senco in njene veje so bile kakor velike cedre, [Božje cedre]. 
[80:11] [Izrael] je svoje veje pognal do [Sredozemskega] morja in svoje odrastke do reke [Evfrat].  
[80:12] Zakaj si Ti polomil njegove žive meje in zidove, tako da vsi, ki gredo mimo, trgajo od njegovih sadov? 
[80:13] Merjasec iz gozda ga pustoši in divja poljska žival se hrani z njim. 
[80:14] Ponovno se obrni, mi Te rotimo, o Bog nad bojevniki! Poglej dol iz nebes in vidi, obišči in imej spoštovanje do te vinske trte! 
[80:15] [Varuj in vzdržuj] živino, ki jo je Tvoja roka zasadila in odrastek, (sin), ki si ga Ti gojil in ga naredil močnega Zase. 
[80:16] Požgali so jo z ognjem, posekana je; naj izginejo ob ukoru izraza Tvojega obraza. 
[80:17] Naj bo Tvoja roka na možu Tvoje desnice, na sinu človekovemu, katerega si Ti naredil močnega Zase. 
[80:18] Potem ne bomo odšli od Tebe; oživi nas, (daj nam življenje) in klicali bomo Tvoje ime. 
[80:19] Obnovi nas, o Gospod Bog nad bojevniki; povzroči, da bo Tvoj obraz sijal [v zadovoljstvu, odobravanju in naklonjenosti na nas] in mi bomo rešeni! 
[81:1]  POJ NAGLAS Bogu, naši moči! Vpij od radosti k Jakobovemu Bogu! 
[81:2] Dvigni pesem, zaigraj na tamburin, prijetno liro s harfo. 
[81:3] Pihaj na trobento ob mlaju, ob polni luni, na naš prazničen dan. 
[81:4] Kajti to je zakon za Izraela, predpis Jakobovega Boga. 
[81:5] To je On ukazal v Jožefu [ rešenik] za pričevanje, ko je On šel ven nad egiptovsko deželo. Govor Tistega, ki ga nisem poznal, sem slišal [govoriti]: 
[81:6] "Jaz sem odstranil njegovo ramo od bremena; njegove roke so bile osvobojene od košare. 
[81:7] Klical si v stiski in Jaz sem te osvobodil, Jaz sem ti odgovoril v skrivnem kraju groma; Jaz sem te skušal pri vodah Meríba. 
[81:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Sliši, o Moje ljudstvo in Jaz vas bom svaril – o Izrael, če bi Me poslušali! 
[81:9] Tedaj med vami ne bo tujega boga, niti ne boste oboževali kakšnega nenavadnega boga. 
[81:10] Jaz sem Gospod, vaš Bog, ki sem vas pripeljal ven iz egiptovske dežele. Svoja usta odprite na široko in Jaz jih bom napolnil. 
[81:11] Toda Moje ljudstvo ni hotelo poslušati Mojega glasu in Izrael ni hotel imeti ničesar z Menoj. 
[81:12] Tako sem jih Jaz predal poželenju njihovih lastnih src in jim pustil iti za njihovo lastno trmasto voljo, da bi lahko sledili svojim lastnim nasvetom.  
[81:13] Oh, da bi Me Moje ljudstvo poslušalo, da bi Izrael hodil po Mojih poteh! 
[81:14] Potem bi Jaz hitro podjarmil njihove sovražnike in Svojo roko obrnil proti njihovim nasprotnikom. 
[81:15] [Če bi Me Izrael v Egiptu poslušal, potem] bi tisti, ki so sovražili Gospoda, s klečeplazenjem prišli pred Njega in njihov poraz bi trajal za vedno. 
[81:16] [Bog] bi hranil [Izraela sedaj] tudi z najboljšim žitom; in z medom iz skale bi te Jaz zadovoljil." 
[82:1]  BOG STOJI v zboru Božjih [predstavnikov]; v sredi sodnih uradnikov ali sodnikov On daje sodbo [kakor] med bogovi: 
[82:2] "Kako dolgo boste vi, [sodni uradniki ali sodniki], sodili nepravično in kazali pristranskost zlobnim?
[82:3]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ravnajte pravično do šibkih, (ubogih) in tistih brez očeta; ohranjajte pravice prizadetih in pomoči potrebnih. 
[82:4] Osvobodite uboge in pomoči potrebne; rešite jih iz roke zlobnih." 
[82:5] [Sodni uradniki in sodniki] ne vedo, niti ne bodo razumeli; oni hodijo naprej v temi [samovšečnega zadovoljstva]; vsi temelji zemlje, [temeljna načela, na katerih počiva uprava pravice], se tresejo. 
[82:6] Jaz sem rekel: "Vi ste bogovi, [ker sodite v Mojem imenu, kot Moji predstavniki]; zares, vi vsi ste otroci Najvišjega.  
[82:7] Toda umrli boste kakor ljudje in padli kakor nekdo izmed princev." 
[82:8] Vzdigni se, o Bog, sodi zemljo! Kajti Tebi pripadajo vsi narodi.  
[83:1]  NE OHRANI tišine, o Bog; ne vzdržuj Svojega miru ali ne bodi tiho, o Bog. 
[83:2] Kajti poglej, Tvoji sovražniki so v hrupu in tisti, ki Te sovražijo, so vzdignili svoje glave.  
[83:3] Vešče polagajo načrte proti Tvojemu ljudstvu in se skupaj posvetujejo proti Tvojim skritim in dragocenim. 
[83:4] Rekli so: "Pridite, izbrišimo jih kot narod; naj Izraelovo ime ne bo več v spomin." 
[83:5] Kajti skupaj so se posvetovali v soglasju in enega srca; proti Tebi delajo zavezo – 
[83:6] Edómovi in Izmaelovi šotori, iz Moába in Hagárovci, 
[83:7] Gebál in Amón in Amálek, Filisteja s prebivalci Tira. 
[83:8] Tudi Asirija se jim je pridružila; pomagali so Lotovim otrokom, [Amóncem in Moábcem] in so jim bili v pomoč.
[83:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Stori jim kakor [si Ti storil] Midjánu, kakor Siseráju in Jabínu pri potoku Kišónu,  
[83:10] ki je izginil pri En Doru, ki je postal kakor gnojilo za zemljo. 
[83:11] Njihove odličnike naredi kakor Oréba in Zeéba, da, vse njihove prince kakor Zebaha in Calmunája,  
[83:12] ki so rekli: "Od Božje paše si prilastimo zase." 
[83:13] O moj Bog, naredi jih kakor vrtinčast prah, kakor strnišče ali pleve pred vetrom! 
[83:14] Kakor ogenj použije gozd in kakor plamen vžge gore, 
[83:15] tako jih preganjaj in prizadeni s Svojim divjim viharjem in jih prestraši s Svojim silovitim vrtinčastim viharjem ali orkanom. 
[83:16] Njihove obraze napolni s sramoto, da bi lahko iskali, povpraševali po |Tvojem imenu| in vztrajno zahtevali Tvoje ime, o Gospod. 
[83:17] Naj bodo osramočeni in onemogočeni za vedno; da, naj bodo osramočeni in naj izginejo, 
[83:18] da bodo lahko spoznali, da si Ti, čigar ime samo je Gospod, Najvišji nad vso zemljo. 
[84:1]  KAKO LJUBKA so Tvoja svetišča, o Gospod nad bojevniki! 
[84:2] Moja duša hrepeni, da, celo hira in ima domotožje po Gospodovih dvorih; moje srce in moje meso vzklikata od veselja in pojeta od radosti živemu Bogu. 
[84:3] Da, vrabec je našel hišo in lastovica gnezdo zase, kjer lahko vali svoje mladiče – celo Tvoje oltarje, o Gospod nad bojevniki, moj Kralj in moj Bog. 
[84:4] Blagoslovljeni, (veseli, srečni, zavidanja vredni) so tisti, ki prebivajo v Tvoji hiši in v Tvoji prisotnosti; skozi ves dan bodo peli Tvoje hvalnice.
[84:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden), je človek čigar moč je v Tebi, v čigar srcu so široke poti k Sionu. 
[84:6] Ko gredo skozi dolino Joka (Baka), jo naredijo za mesto izvirov; prav tako zgodnji dež napolni [tolmune] z blagoslovi. 
[84:7] Gredo iz moči v moč, [povečujoč zmagovalno moč]; vsak izmed njih se pojavi pred Bogom na Sionu. 
[84:8] O Gospod Bog nad bojevniki, usliši mojo molitev; poslušaj, o Bog Jakobov!
[84:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Poglej naš ščit [kralja kot Tvojega posrednika], o Bog in poglej na obraz Svojega maziljenca! 
[84:10] Kajti dan v Tvojih dvorih je boljši kakor tisoč [kjerkoli drugje]; jaz bi bil raje vratar in stal na hišnem pragu svojega Boga kakor [sproščeno] bival v šotorih zlobnosti. 
[84:11] Kajti Gospod Bog je sonce in ščit; Gospod podarja [sedanjo] milost in naklonjenost in [prihodnjo] slavo, (čast, blišč in nebeško blaženost)! Nobene dobre stvari On ne bo zadržal pred tistimi, ki hodijo iskreno. 
[84:12] O Gospod nad bojevniki, blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, ki zaupa Vate, [se zanaša in verjame Vate, vse izvršuje in prepričano gleda k Tebi in to brez strahu ali zaskrbljenosti]! 
[85:1]  GOSPOD, TI si bil [končno] naklonjen in si milostno ravnal s Svojo deželo [Kánaan]; Ti si [iz Babilona] pripeljal nazaj Jakobove ujetnike. 
[85:2] Ti si odpustil in vzel stran krivdo Svojega ljudstva, Ti si pokril ves njihov greh.
[85:3]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno spoznaj kaj to pomeni]! Ti si umaknil ves Svoj bes in prizadetost, Ti si se obrnil stran od plameneče jeze, [s katero si si Ti dal duška]. 
[85:4] Obnovi nas, o Bog, rešitev naših duš in povzroči, da bo Tvoja jeza proti nam [za vedno] prenehala. 
[85:5] Ali se boš Ti za vedno jezil nad nami? Ali boš Ti podaljševal Svojo jezo [in nenaklonjenost] ter jo razširil na vse rodove? 
[85:6] Ali nas ne boš Ti ponovno oživil, da se Tvoje ljudstvo lahko radosti v Tebi? 
[85:7] Pokaži nam Svoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost, o Gospod in zagotovi nam Svojo rešitev duš. 
[85:8] [S pričakovanjem] bom prisluhnil kaj bo rekel Bog, Gospod, kajti Svojemu ljudstvu bo On govoril mir, Svojim svetim, (tistim, ki so v pravilnem odnosu z Njim) – toda ne dopusti, da bi se ponovno obrnili k [samozavestni] norosti. 
[85:9] Zagotovo je Njegova rešitev duš blizu tistim, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo Njega [in je pripravljena, da bo prisvojena], da [očitna prisotnost Boga, Njegova] slava, lahko šotori in ostaja v naši deželi. 
[85:10] Usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost ter resnica so se skupaj srečale; pravičnost in mir sta se poljubila. 
[85:11] Resnica bo pognala iz zemlje in pravičnost bo gledala dol iz nebes. 
[85:12] Da, Gospod bo dal kar je dobro in naša dežela bo dajala svoj donos. 
[85:13] Pravičnost bo šla pred Njim in Njegove stopinje bo naredila za pot, po kateri naj se hodi. 
[86:1]  NAGNI SVOJE uho, o Gospod in odgovori mi, kajti ubog sem in stiskan, pomoči potreben in hrepeneč. 
[86:2] Ohrani moje življenje, kajti bogaboječ sem in predan; o moj Bog, reši Svojega služabnika, kajti Vate zaupam, [se naslanjam in Vate verjamem, predajajoč vse |Tebi| in prepričano zroč k Tebi, brez strahu ali dvoma]. 
[86:3] Bodi mi usmiljen in milostljiv, o Gospod, kajti k Tebi kličem ves dan. 
[86:4] Pripravi mene, Svojega služabnika, da se radostim, o Gospod, kajti samega sebe vzdigujem k Tebi. 
[86:5] Kajti ti, o Gospod, si dober in pripravljen odpustiti [naše prestopke in jih poslati stran, dopuščajoč jim, da gredo popolnoma in za vedno]; in Ti si bogat v usmiljenju in ljubeči-skrbnosti do vseh tistih, ki kličejo k Tebi. 
[86:6] Prisluhni, o Gospod, moji molitvi; in poslušaj klic mojih ponižnih prošenj. 
[86:7] Na dan svoje stiske bom klical k Tebi, kajti Ti mi boš odgovoril. 
[86:8] Tam ni nobenega, ki bi bil med bogovi podoben Tebi, o Gospod, niti njihova dela niso podobna Tvojim. 
[86:9] Vsi narodi, ki si jih Ti naredil, bodo prišli in pokleknili pred Teboj, o Gospod; in bodo slavili Tvoje ime. 
[86:10] Kajti Ti si veličasten in delaš čudeže! Ti sam si Bog. 
[86:11] Uči me Svoje poti, o Gospod, da bi lahko hodil in živel v Tvoji resnici; vodi in zedini moje srce, [izključno, častitljivo], da bi se bal in spoštoval Tvoje ime.  
[86:12] Priznal in hvalil bom Tebe, o Gospod, moj Bog, s svojim celotnim (združenim) srcem; in na veke vekov bom slavil Tvoje ime. 
[86:13] Kajti veličastna sta Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost do mene; in Ti si me osvobodil pred globinami Šeola, [pred prekomernimi globinami trpljenja]. 
[86:14] O Bog, ponosni in predrzni so se vzdignili proti meni; drhal nasilnih in brezobzirnih mož je iskala in zahtevala moje življenje in Tebe niso postavljali predse. 
[86:15] Toda Ti, o Gospod, si usmiljen in milostljiv Bog, počasen za jezo in obilen v usmiljenju in ljubeči-skrbnosti in resnici. 
[86:16] O obrni se k meni in imej usmiljenje in bodi mi milostljiv; zagotovi moč, (mogočnost in neomajnost v skušnjavah) Svojemu služabniku in reši sina Svoje dekle. 
[86:17] Pokaži mi znamenje [Tvoje očitne] dobre volje in naklonjenosti, da ga bodo tisti, ki me sovražijo, lahko videli in bodo osramočeni, kajti Ti, Gospod, [mi boš pokazal Svoje odobravanje, kadar mi Ti] pomagaš in me tolažiš. 
[87:1]  NA svetih hribih stoji mesto [Jeruzalem in svetišče], ki ga je osnoval Bog. 
[87:2] Gospod ljubi sionske duri, [skozi katera vstopajo množice božjepopotnikov iz vseh narodov], bolj kakor vsa Jakobova, (Izraelova) prebivališča. 
[87:3] Slavne stvari se govorijo o tebi, o Božje mesto.
[87:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno spoznaj kaj to pomeni]! Omenjal bom Rahab [pesniško ime za Egipt] in Babilon, kakor med tistimi, ki poznajo [Božje mesto] – poglej, Filisteja in Tir, z Etiopijo (Kušem) – [rekoč]: "Ta človek je bil rojen tam." 
[87:5] Da, o Sionu bo rečeno: "Ta človek in tisti človek sta bila rojena v njem, kajti osnoval ga bo sam Najvišji." 
[87:6] Gospod bo štel, ko bo On popisoval prebivalstvo, da je bil ta človek rojen tam.
[87:7]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Pevci, kakor tudi igralci na glasbila, bodo rekli: "Vsi moji izviri, (moji viri življenja in radosti) so v tebi, [mestu našega Boga]." 
[88:1]  O GOSPOD, Bog rešitve moje duše, k Tebi sem klical po pomoč podnevi; ponoči sem v Tvoji prisotnosti.  
[88:2] Naj moja molitev pride pred Tebe in resnično vstopi v Tvojo prisotnost; Svoje uho nagni k mojemu klicu! 
[88:3] Kajti poln težav sem in moje življenje se približuje Šeolu, (kraju mrtvih). 
[88:4] Prištet sem med tiste, ki gredo dol v jamo, (grob); sem kakor človek, ki nima pomoči ali moči, [zgolj senca], 
[88:5] zavržen med mrtvimi, kot umorjeni, ki ležijo v [brezimnem] grobu, katerih se Ti [resno] nič več ne spominjaš in so odrezani od Tvoje roke. 
[88:6] Ti si me položil v globine najgloblje jame, v temo, v globine. 
[88:7] Tvoj bes težko leži na meni in Ti si me prizadel z vsemi Svojimi valovi. 
[88:8]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ti si moje [poznane] prijatelje postavil daleč od mene; Ti si me naredil njim za gnusobo. Utišan sem in ne morem priti naprej. 
[88:9] Moje oko postaja motno zaradi bolesti in trpljenja. Gospod, vsak dan sem klical k Tebi; k Tebi sem iztegnil svoji roki. 
[88:10] Ali boš Ti kazal čudeže mrtvim? Ali bodo preminuli vstali in Te hvalili?
[88:11]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Ali bo Tvoja neomajna ljubezen razglašena v grobu? Ali Tvoja zvestoba v Ábadonu, (Šeolu, kot kraju zrušenja in pogubljenja)? 
[88:12] Ali bodo Tvoji čudeži spoznani v temi? In Tvoja pravičnost na kraju pozabe, [kjer mrtvi pozabljajo in so pozabljeni]? 
[88:13] Toda jaz kličem k Tebi, o Gospod; in zjutraj bo moja molitev prišla Tebi nasproti. 
[88:14] Gospod, zakaj me Ti zavračaš? Zakaj Ti skrivaš Svoj obraz pred menoj?  
[88:15] Trpel sem in od svoje mladosti sem bil blizu smrti; medtem ko sem trpel Tvoje grozote, sem zmeden, [slabim]. 
[88:16] Tvoj siloviti bes je šel čezme; Tvoje strahote so me uničile. 
[88:17] Obdajajo me kakor poplave skozi ves dan; skupaj so se zgrnili nadme. 
[88:18] Zaljubljenca in prijatelja si Ti postavil daleč od mene; moja poznana prijatelja sta tema in grob. 
[89:1]   ZA VEDNO bom pel o usmiljenju in o Gospodovi ljubeči-skrbnosti; s svojimi usti bom razglašal Tvojo zvestobo iz roda v rod. 
[89:2] Kajti rekel sem: "Usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost bosta zgrajeni za vedno; Svojo zvestobo boš Ti vzpostavil, [nespremenljivo in večno], prav v podaljšku nebes." 
[89:3] [Ti si rekel]: "Jaz sem naredil zavezo s Svojim izbrancem, Jaz sem prisegel Davidu, Svojemu služabniku: 
[89:4] 'Tvoje Seme bom Jaz postavil za vedno in Jaz bom zgradil tvoj prestol za vse rodove.'"
[89:5]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Naj nebesa (angeli) hvalijo Tvoje čudeže, o Gospod, tudi Tvojo zvestobo v zborih svetih (svetih angelov). 
[89:6] Kajti kdo v podaljšku nebes se lahko primerja z Gospodom? Kdo med mogočnimi [nebeškimi bitji] se lahko primerja z Gospodom 
[89:7] Bogom, ki se ga zelo bojijo in častijo v zboru svetih (angelskih) in ki se ga je treba bati in ga obožujoče častiti nad vsemi tistimi, ki so okrog Njega? 
[89:8] O Gospod Bog nad bojevniki, kdo je mogočnež podoben Tebi, o Gospod? In Tvoja zvestoba je okrog Tebe, [bistven del Tebe ob vseh časih]. 
[89:9] Ti vladaš besnenju morja; ko se njegovi valovi vzdignejo, jih Ti umirjaš. 
[89:10] Ti si zlomil Rahab (Egipt), na koščke; s Svojo mogočno roko si Ti razpršil Svoje sovražnike. 
[89:11] Podaljšek nebes je Tvoj, tudi zemlja je Tvoja; svet in vse kar je v njem, Ti si jih osnoval. 
[89:12] Sever in jug, Ti si ju ustvaril; gora Tabor in gora Hermon radostno hvalita Tvoje ime. 
[89:13] Ti imaš mogočno roko; močna je Tvoja roka, Tvoja desnica lebdi visoko. 
[89:14] Pravičnost in pravica sta temelj Tvojega prestola; usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost ter resnica gredo pred Tvojim obrazom. 
[89:15] Blagoslovljeni, (veseli, srečni, zavidanja vredni) so ljudje, ki poznajo radosten zvok, [ki razumejo in cenijo duhovne blagoslove, ki jih predstavljajo praznovanja]; hodijo, o Gospod, v luči in naklonjenosti Tvojega obličja! 
[89:16] V Tvojem imenu se ves dan radostijo in v Tvoji pravičnosti so navdušeni. 
[89:17] Kajti Ti si slava njihove moči, [njihov ponosen okras] in po Tvoji naklonjenosti je naš rog povzdignjen in mi hodimo z vzdignjenimi obrazi! 
[89:18] Kajti naš ščit pripada Gospodu in naš kralj Svetemu Izraelovemu. 
[89:19] Nekoč si Ti v viziji govoril Svojim predanim in rekel: "Jaz sem opremil tistega, ki je mogočen [junak, s tem da sem mu dal oblast, da pomaga – da bo zmagovalec za Izraela]; povzdignil sem tega izbranega izmed ljudstva. 
[89:20] Jaz sem našel Davida, Svojega služabnika; s Svojim svetim oljem sem ga Jaz mazilil,  
[89:21] z njim bo Moja roka nastanjena in bo večno ostajala; Moja roka ga bo prav tako ojačila. 
[89:22] Sovražnik od njega ne bo izsiljeval ali mu delal nasilja ali ga prelisičil, niti ga ne bo zlobni prizadeval in poniževal. 
[89:23] Jaz bom potolkel njegove sovražnike pred njegovim obrazom in udaril tiste, ki ga sovražijo. 
[89:24] Moja zvestoba in Moje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost bodo z njim in v Mojem imenu bo njegov rog povzdignjen, [podeljena mu bosta velika moč in blaginja]. 
[89:25] Njegovo roko bom prav tako postavil v oblast na [Sredozemskem] morju in njegovo desnico na reke [Evfrata s svojimi pritoki]. 
[89:26] Klical bo k Meni: "Ti si moj Oče, moj Bog in skala rešitve moje duše!" 
[89:27] Prav tako mu bom Jaz naredil prvorojenca, najvišjega izmed zemeljskih kraljev.  
[89:28] Svoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost mu bom Jaz ohranjal na veke vekov in Moja zaveza bo trdno stala in bo zvesta z njim. 
[89:29] Njegovemu Potomcu bom prav tako Jaz storil, da vztraja za vedno in njegov prestol kakor nebeški dnevi.  
[89:30] Če njegovi otroci zapustijo Mojo postavo in ne hodijo po Mojih predpisih, 
[89:31] če prelomijo ali osramotijo Moje zakone in ne ohranjajo Mojih zapovedi, 
[89:32] potem bom Jaz kaznoval njihov prestopek s palico [opomina] in njihovo krivdo z udarci.  
[89:33] Kljub temu Svoje ljubeče-skrbnosti Jaz ne bom odtegnil od njega, niti ne dopustil, da bi Moja zvestoba odpovedala, [lagala in bila varljiva z njim]. 
[89:34] Svoje zaveze Jaz ne bom prelomil ali osramotil, niti ne bom spreminjal stvari, ki je šla iz Mojih ustnic. 
[89:35] Enkrat [za vselej] sem Jaz prisegel pri Svoji svetosti, ki ne more biti kršena; Jaz Davidu ne bom lagal: 
[89:36] njegov Potomec bo vztrajal za vedno in njegov prestol [se bo nadaljeval] kot sonce pred Menoj.  
[89:37] Postavljen bo za vedno kakor luna, zvesta priča v podaljšku nebes. 
[89:38]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Toda [v očitnem nasprotju z vsem tem] si Ti, [celo Ti, zvesti Gospod], izganjal in zavračal; Ti si bil poln besa proti Svojemu maziljencu. 
[89:39] Ti si preziral in sovražil in opustil zavezo s Svojim služabnikom; Ti si njegovo krono osramotil tako, da si jo vrgel na tla. 
[89:40] Ti si polomil vse njegove ograde in njegovo zidovje; Ti si njegove utrdbe privedel do ruševin. 
[89:41] Vsi, ki hodijo mimo po cesti, ga plenijo in ropajo; postal je prezir in graja svojim sosedom. 
[89:42] Ti si povzdignil desnico njegovim sovražnikom; Ti si naredil, da se vsi njegovi sovražniki radostijo. 
[89:43] Še več, Ti si konico njegovega meča obrnil nazaj in ga nisi naredil, da bi v bitki obstal. 
[89:44] Ti si naredil, da sta njegova slava in blišč prenehali in si njegov prestol zalučal na tla. 
[89:45] Dneve njegove mladosti si Ti skrajšal; Ti si ga pokril s sramoto.
[89:46]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Kako dolgo, o Gospod? Ali se boš Ti skrival za vedno? Kako dolgo bo Tvoj bes gorel kakor ogenj? 
[89:47] O [iskreno] se spominjaj kako kratek je moj čas in kako je moje življenje le bednost. Kajti za kakšno praznost, lažnost, jalovost in slabotnost si Ti ustvaril vse ljudi! 
[89:48] Kateri človek lahko živi in ne bo videl smrti, ali samega sebe lahko osvobodi od [močne] roke Šeola, (kraja mrtvih)?
[89:49]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Gospod, kje so Tvoje prejšnje ljubeče-skrbnosti, [pokazane v dneh vladanja Davida in Salomona], ki si jih ti v Svoji zvestobi prisegel Davidu? 
[89:50] Spomni se, Gospod in [na Svoje srce] si iskreno vtisni grajo Svojih služabnikov, zaničevanih in užaljenih, kako v svojem naročju prenašam grajo vseh mnogih in mogočnih ljudstev, 
[89:51] s katerimi so se Tvoji sovražniki posmehovali, o Gospod, s katerimi so zasmehovali stopinje Tvojih maziljencev. 
[89:52] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod na veke vekov! Amen in Amen. 
[90:1]  GOSPOD, TI si bil naše prebivališče in naše zatočišče v vseh rodovih, [govori Mojzes]. 
[90:2] Preden so bile rojene gore ali celo preden si Ti oblikoval in dal rojstvo zemlji in svetu, celo od večnosti do večnosti, si Ti Bog. 
[90:3] Ti spreminjaš moža nazaj v prah in trohnenje ter praviš: "Vrnite se, o sinovi zemeljski, [k zemlji]!" 
[90:4] Kajti tisoč let v Tvojem pogledu je kakor včerajšnji dan, ki je minil, ali kakor straža v noči.  
[90:5] Ti odnašaš te [neubogljive ljudi, obsojene, da bodo umrli znotraj štiridesetih let] kot s poplavo; so kot spanje, [nerazločni in pozabljeni takoj, ko izginejo]. Zjutraj so kot trava, ki raste – 
[90:6] zjutraj uspeva in plane kvišku; zvečer jo požanjejo in ovene. 
[90:7] Kajti mi, [Izraelci v divjini], smo použiti s Tvojo jezo in s Tvojem besom smo stiskani, premagani in preplašeni. 
[90:8] Naše krivice, naše skrivno srce in njegovi grehi, [ki bi jih tako radi prikrili celo pred seboj], si jih Ti postavil v [razkrivajočo] luč Svojega obličja. 
[90:9] Kajti vsi naši dnevi, [tukaj v tej divjini, pravi Mojzes], minevajo v Tvojem besu; naša leta preživljamo kot zgodbo, ki je bila povedana, [kajti odrasli vemo, da smo obsojeni na skorajšnjo smrt, ne da bi dosegli Kánaan].  
[90:10] Dnevi naših let so tri zarezna leta in deset |let|, (sedemdeset let) – ali celo, če smo močni, štiri zarezna leta, (osemdeset let); vendar je njihov ponos [v dodatnih letih] samo delo in bolest, kajti kmalu mine in mi odletimo. 
[90:11] Kdo pozna moč Tvoje jeze? [Kdo vredno povezuje to kratkost življenja s Tvojim prepoznavanjem greha?] In Tvoj bes, kdo ga povezuje s častitljivim in obožujočim strahom, ki pripada Tebi? 
[90:12] Tako nas nauči štetja naših dni, da bomo lahko pridobili srce modrosti. 
[90:13] Odvrni se, o Gospod, [od Svoje silovite jeze]! Kako dolgo? – Prekliči Svojo obsodbo in bodi sočuten in popustljiv do Svojih služabnikov. 
[90:14] O, zadovolji nas s Svojim usmiljenjem in ljubečo-skrbnostjo zjutraj, [sedaj, preden bomo starejši], da se bomo lahko radostili in vse svoje dni bili zadovoljni. 
[90:15] Razveseli nas v sorazmerju z dnevi, v katerih si nas Ti žalostil in z leti, v katerih smo trpeli hudobijo. 
[90:16] Naj se Tvoje delo, [znamenja Tvoje oblasti], razodenejo Tvojim služabnikom in Tvoje [slavno] veličastvo njihovim otrokom. 
[90:17] Nad nami pa naj bodo lepota in veselje ter naklonjenost Gospoda, našega Boga; potrdi in ustanovi delo naših rok – da, delo naših rok, potrdi in ustanovi ga. 
[91:1] KDOR prebiva v skrivališču Najvišjega, bo ostal trden in neomajen v senci Vsemogočnega, [čigar moči ne more kljubovati noben sovražnik]. 
[91:2] O Gospodu bom rekel: "On je moje Zatočišče in moja trdnjava, moj Bog; Nanj se naslanjam in zanašam in Vanj [prepričano] verujem!" 
[91:3] Kajti [potem] te bo On osvobodil pred ptičarjevo zanko in pred smrtonosno kugo. 
[91:4] [Potem] te bo On pokril s Svojimi perutmi in pod Njegovimi krili boš veroval in našel zatočišče; Njegova resnica in Njegova zvestoba sta ščit in oklep. 
[91:5] Ne boš se bal nočne strahote, ne puščice (hudobnih spletk in obrekovanj zlobnih), ki lete podnevi, 
[91:6] tudi ne kuge, ki se prikrade v temi, ne opustošenja in nenadne smrti, ki preseneti in opustoši opoldne. 
[91:7] Lahko jih pade tisoč na tvoji strani in deset tisoč na tvoji desnici, toda tebi se to ne bo približalo. 
[91:8] Samo opazovalec boš, [sam nedostopen v skrivališču Najvišjega], ko boš priča plačilu zlobnih. 
[91:9] Ker si naredil Gospoda za svoje zatočišče in Najvišjega za svoje bivališče,  
[91:10] te ne bo zadela hudobija, ne kakršna koli kuga ali nadloga se ne bo približala tvojemu šotoru. 
[91:11] Kajti On bo Svoje angele [posebej] zadolžil zate, naj te spremljajo in branijo in varujejo na vseh tvojih poteh [ubogljivosti in služenja]. 
[91:12] Nosili te bodo na svojih rokah, da s svojim stopalom ne zadeneš ob kamen.  
[91:13] Stopal boš na leva in gada; mladega leva in kačo boš poteptal pod nogami.  
[91:14] Ker je svojo ljubezen naravnal Name, zato ga bom Jaz osvobodil; visoko ga bom postavil, ker pozna in razume Moje ime, [ima osebno spoznanje o Mojem usmiljenju, ljubezni in skrbnosti – zaupa in se zanaša Name, vedoč, da ga ne bom nikoli zapustil, ne, nikoli]. 
[91:15] Klical Me bo in Jaz mu bom odgovoril; z njim bom v stiski, osvobodil ga bom in mu izkazal čast. 
[91:16] Zadovoljil ga bom z dolgim življenjem in mu pokazal Svojo rešitev duše. 
[92:1]  TO JE dobra in zadovoljujoča stvar dajati hvalo Gospodu, peti hvalnice [z glasbeno spremljavo] Tvojemu imenu, o Najvišji, 
[92:2] prikazati Tvojo ljubečo-skrbnost zjutraj in Tvojo zvestobo ponoči, 
[92:3] z glasbilom desetih strun in z lutnjo, s svečanim zvokom na liro. 
[92:4] Kajti Ti, o Gospod, si me razveselil s Svojimi deli; ob dejanjih Tvojih rok radostno pojem. 
[92:5] Kako velika so Tvoja delovanja, o Gospod! Tvoje misli so zelo globoke. 
[92:6] Človek v svojem grobem in neobdelanem stanju ne spozna, niti [samozavesten] bedak tega ne razume: 
[92:7] da, čeprav zlobni poganjajo kakor trava in vsi hudobneži uspevajo, so obsojeni, da bodo uničeni za vedno. 
[92:8] Toda Ti, Gospod, si na veke na višavi. 
[92:9] Kajti poglej, Tvoji nasprotniki, o Gospod, kajti poglej, Tvoji sovražniki bodo izginili; vsi hudobneži bodo razkropljeni. 
[92:10] Toda moj rog, (znamenje preobilne moči in veličastne milosti), si Ti povzdignil kot pri divjem govedu; maziljen sem s svežim oljem. 
[92:11] Moje oko gleda na tiste, ki prežijo name; moja ušesa slišijo hudobneže, ki vstajajo proti meni. 
[92:12] [Brezkompromisno] pravični bodo uspevali kakor palma, [bodo dolgo-živeči, vzvišeni, iskreni, koristni in rodovitni]; poganjali bodo kakor [veličastne, trdne, trpežne in nepodkupljive] cedre na Libanonu. 
[92:13] Zasajeni v hiši Gospodovi bodo uspevali v dvorih našega Boga. 
[92:14] [Rastoč v milosti] bodo v visoki starosti še vedno obrodili sad; polni bodo življenjske moči, [duhovne čvrstosti] in [bogati v] zdravi rasti, [zaupanja, ljubezni in zadovoljstva]. 
[92:15] [So živi spomeniki], da pokažejo, da je Gospod iskren in zvest Svojim obljubam; On je moja skala in v Njem ni nobene krivičnosti.  
[93:1] GOSPOD vlada, On je oblečen v veličastvo; Gospod je ogrnjen, On Se je opasal s silo in močjo; svet je prav tako postavljen, da ne more biti omajan. 
[93:2] Tvoj prestol je postavljen od davno; Ti si od vekomaj. 
[93:3] Poplave so se dvignile, o Gospod, poplave so vzdignile svoj glas; poplave dvigujejo bučanje svojih valov. 
[93:4] Gospod na višavi je mogočnejši in slavnejši kot hrup mnogih vodá, da, kot mogočno butanje valov in valovi morja. 
[93:5] Tvoja pričevanja so zelo zanesljiva; svetost, [očitna v ločitvi od greha, s preprostim zaupanjem in pogumno ubogljivostjo], se poda Tvoji hiši, o Gospod, za vedno. 
[94:1] O GOSPOD Bog, Ti, komur pripada maščevanje, o Bog, Ti, komur pripada maščevanje, zasij! 
[94:2] Dvigni se, o Sodnik zemlje; ponosnemu vrni primerno povračilo! 
[94:3] Gospod, kako dolgo bodo zlobni, kako dolgo bodo zlobni slavili in se povzdigovali? 
[94:4] Izlivajo vzvišene besede, govorijo trde stvari; vsi hudobneži se oholo bahajo.  
[94:5] Drobijo Tvoje ljudstvo, o Gospod in prizadevajo Tvojo dediščino. 
[94:6] Ubijajo vdovo in prehodnega tujca ter morijo nezavarovano siroto. 
[94:7] Kljub temu pravijo: "Gospod ne vidi, niti Bog Jakobov tega ne opazi." 
[94:8] Preudarite in razumite, vi neumneži med ljudmi! In vi [samozavestni] bedaki, kdaj boste postali modri? 
[94:9] On, ki je zasadil uho, naj bi On ne slišal? On, ki je oblikoval oko, naj bi On ne videl? 
[94:10] On, ki kaznuje in poučuje narode, ali On ne bo kaznoval, On, ki uči človeka spoznanja? 
[94:11] Gospod pozna človekove misli, da so ničeve, (prazne in jalove – samo dih).  
[94:12] Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, ki ga Ti kaznuješ in poučuješ, o Gospod in ga učiš iz Svoje postave, 
[94:13] da bi mu Ti lahko dal moč, da samega sebe ohranja mirnega v dneh nesreče, dokler za zlobneža ni izkopana [neizogibna] jama propada. 
[94:14] Kajti Gospod ne bo zavrgel niti zaničeval Svojega ljudstva, niti On ne bo zapustil Svoje dediščine. 
[94:15] Kajti pravica se bo vrnila k [brezkompromisno] pravičnemu in vsi iskreni v srcu ji bodo sledili. 
[94:16] Kdo bo zame vstal proti hudobnežem? Kdo bo zame vstal proti delavcem krivičnosti? 
[94:17] Če ne bi bil Gospod moja pomoč, bi kmalu prebival v [deželi, kjer je] tišina. 
[94:18] Ko sem rekel: "Moje stopalo zdrsava," sta me Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost, o Gospod, držali pokonci. 
[94:19] V množici mojih [vznemirljivih] misli znotraj mene, me Tvoje tolažbe vedrijo in veselijo mojo dušo! 
[94:20] Bo imel prestol krivičnosti skupnost s Teboj – tisti, ki si izmišljajo in skrivajo svoja nepravična dejanja pod [sveto ime] postave? 
[94:21] Skupaj se zbirajo proti življenju [neprenehoma] pravičnega in nedolžnega obsojajo na smrt. 
[94:22] Toda Gospod je postal moj visoki stolp in obramba in moj Bog skala mojega zatočišča. 
[94:23] In On bo njihovo lastno krivdo obrnil nazaj nanje in jih izbrisal s sredstvi njihove lastne zlobnosti; Gospod, naš Bog, jih bo izbrisal. 
[95:1] O PRIDITE, pojmo Gospodu; naredimo radosten zvok skali rešitve naših duš! 
[95:2] Pridimo pred Njegovo prisotnost z zahvaljevanjem; naredimo Mu radosten zvok s pesmimi hvale! 
[95:3] Kajti Gospod je veličasten Bog in veličasten Kralj nad vsemi bogovi. 
[95:4] V Njegovi roki so globoki kraji zemlje; višine in moč hribov so prav tako Njegovi. 
[95:5] Morje je Njegovo, kajti On ga je naredil; in Njegove roke so oblikovale kopno. 
[95:6] O pridite, obožujmo in se priklonimo, pokleknimo pred Gospodom, našim Stvarnikom, [v častitljivi hvali in ponižni prošnji]. 
[95:7] Kajti On je naš Bog in mi smo ljudstvo Njegove paše in ovce Njegove roke. Če boste danes slišali Njegov glas,  
[95:8] ne otrdite svojih src kakor pri Meríbi in kakor pri Masi na dan skušnjave v divjini,  
[95:9] ko so vaši očetje skušali Mojo potrpežljivost in Me preizkušali, Me postavljali, da se izkažem in so videli Moja dela [sodbe]. 
[95:10] Dolgih štirideset let sem se žalostil in se mi je gnusil ta rod, Jaz pa sem rekel: "To je ljudstvo, ki v svojih srcih dela narobe in ne odobravajo, prepoznavajo ali upoštevajo Mojih poti." 
[95:11] Zato sem v Svojem besu prisegel, da ne bodo vstopili v Moj počitek, [v deželo obljube].  
[96:1] O POJTE Gospodu novo pesem; pojte Gospodu, vsa zemlja! 
[96:2] Pojte Gospodu, blagoslavljajte, (vdano hvalite) Njegovo ime; pokažite Njegovo rešitev duš od dne do dne. 
[96:3] Razglašajte Njegovo slavo med narodi, Njegova fantastična dela med vsemi ljudstvi. 
[96:4] Kajti veličasten je Gospod in zelo naj bo hvaljen; Njega se je treba častitljivo bati in oboževan naj bo nad vsemi [tako-imenovanimi] bogovi.  
[96:5] Kajti vsi bogovi narodov so [brezživljenjski] maliki, toda Gospod je naredil podaljšek nebes. 
[96:6] Čast in veličastvo sta pred Njim; moč in lepota sta v Njegovem svetišču. 
[96:7] Pripisujte Gospodu, o ve družine izmed ljudstev, pripisujte Gospodu slavo in moč. 
[96:8] Dajte Gospodu slavo zaradi Njegovega imena; prinesite dar in pridite [pred Njega] v Njegove dvore. 
[96:9] O obožujte Gospoda v lepoti svetosti; trepetajte pred |Njim| in se častitljivo bojte Njega, vsa zemlja. 
[96:10] Povejte med narodi, da vlada Gospod; prav tako je svet osnovan, tako da se ne more omajati; On bo sodil in vladal ljudem pravično in s pravico.  
[96:11] Naj bo podaljšek nebes vesel in naj se zemlja radosti; naj morje buči in vse stvari, ki ga napolnjujejo; 
[96:12] naj bo polje zmagoslavno in vse kar je na njem! Potem bodo vsa gozdna drevesa pela od radosti 
[96:13] pred Gospodom, kajti On prihaja, kajti On prihaja, da sodi in vlada zemlji! On bo sodil svet s pravičnostjo in pravico ter ljudstva s Svojo zvestobo in resnico.  
[97:1] GOSPOD vlada, naj se zemlja radosti; naj bodo množice otokov in obal vesele! 
[97:2] Oblaki in tema so okrog Njega, [kot pri Sinaju]; pravičnost in pravica sta temelj Njegovega prestola.  
[97:3] Ogenj gre pred Njim in naokrog požiga Njegove nasprotnike. 
[97:4] Njegovi bliski osvetljujejo svet; zemlja gleda in trepeta. 
[97:5] Hribi so se ob prisotnosti Gospoda stopili kakor vosek, ob prisotnosti Gospoda celotne zemlje. 
[97:6] Podaljšek nebes razglaša Njegovo pravičnost in vsa ljudstva vidijo Njegovo slavo. 
[97:7] Naj bodo osramočeni vsi tisti, ki služijo vrezanim podobam, ki se bahajo z maliki. Padite na tla pred Njim, vsi vi bogovi.  
[97:8] Sion je slišal in je bil vesel in hčere judovske so se radostile [v olajšanju] zaradi Tvojih sodb, o Gospod. 
[97:9] Kajti Ti, Gospod, si vzvišen nad vso zemljo; Ti si povzdigovan visoko nad vsemi bogovi. 
[97:10] O vi, ki ljubite Gospoda, sovražite hudobijo; On ohranja življenja Svojim svetim, (Božjim otrokom), On jih osvobaja iz roke zlobnega.  
[97:11] Luč je posejana za [brezkompromisno] pravične in raztrošena vzdolž njihove poti in radost za iskrene v srcu, [nezadržna radost, ki prihaja iz zavedanja o Njegovi naklonjenost in zaščiti]. 
[97:12] Radostite se v Gospodu, vi [neprenehoma] pravični, (iskreni in v pravem odnosu z Bogom) in zahvaljujte se ob spominu na Njegovo svetost. 
[98:1]  O POJTE Gospodu novo pesem, kajti On je storil čudovite stvari; Njegova desna roka in Njegova sveta roka sta Zanj izdelali rešitev duš. 
[98:2] Gospod je objavil Svojo rešitev duš; Svojo pravičnost je On odkrito pokazal v očeh narodov.  
[98:3] On se je [iskreno] spomnil Svojega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti, Svoje resnice in Svoje zvestobe do Izraelove hiše; vsi konci zemlje so prisostvovali rešitvi duš našega Boga.  
[98:4] Vriskajte Gospodu, vsa zemlja; izbruhnite in pojte od radosti, da, pojte hvalnice! 
[98:5] Vriskajte hvalnice Gospodu z liro, z liro in glasom napeva. 
[98:6] S trobentami in zvokom roga naredite radosten zvok pred Kraljem, Gospodom! 
[98:7] Naj morje buči in vse kar ga napolnjuje, svet in tisti, ki prebivajo na njem! 
[98:8] Naj reke ploskajo z rokami; naj skupaj hribi pojó od radosti 
[98:9] pred Gospodom, kajti On prihaja sodit [in vladat] zemlji; s pravičnostjo bo On sodil [in vladal] svetu in ljudstvom z nepristranskostjo. 
[99:1] GOSPOD vlada, naj ljudstva trepetajo [s častitljivim strahom]! On sedi [ustoličen] nad kerubi, naj se trese zemlja! 
[99:2] Gospod je veličasten na Sionu in On je visoko nad vsemi ljudstvi. 
[99:3] Naj priznajo in hvalijo Tvoje veličastno ime, strašno in čaščenje vzbujajoče! Sveto je in On je svet!  
[99:4] Moč kralja, ki ljubi pravičnost in nepristranskost Ti postavljaš v iskrenosti; Ti izvršuješ pravico in pravičnost v Jakobu (Izraelu). 
[99:5] Povzdiguj Gospoda, našega Boga in obožuj pri Njegovi pručki! On je svet! 
[99:6] Mojzes in Aron sta bila med Njegovimi duhovniki in Samuel je bil med tistimi, ki so klicali Njegovo ime; klicali so Gospoda in On jim je odgovoril. 
[99:7] On jim je spregovoril v oblačnem stebru; hranili so Njegova pričevanja in predpise, ki jim jih je On dal.  
[99:8] Ti si jim odgovarjal, o Gospod, naš Bog; Ti si jim bil Bog, ki odpušča, čeprav maščuješ njihova hudobna ravnanja in zlobne postopke. 
[99:9] Povzdigujte Gospoda, našega Boga in obožujte pri Njegovem svetem hribu, kajti Gospod, naš Bog, je svet! 
[100:1]  NAREDITE radosten zvok Gospodu, vse ve dežele! 
[100:2] Služite Gospodu z veseljem! S petjem pridite pred Njegovo prisotnost! 
[100:3] Vedite, (zaznajte, prepoznajte in razumite z odobravanjem), da Gospod je Bog! On je, ki nas je naredil, ne mi sami sebe [in mi smo Njegovi]! Mi smo Njegovo ljudstvo in ovce Njegove paše.  
[100:4] Vstopite skozi Njegove duri z zahvaljevanjem in darom hvaležnosti in v Njegove dvore s hvalo! Bodite hvaležni in tako recite Njemu, blagoslavljajte in ljubeče hvalite Njegovo ime! 
[100:5] Kajti Gospod je dober; Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost sta večna, Njegova zvestoba in resnica vztrajata vsem rodovom. 
[101:1]  PEL BOM o usmiljenju in ljubeči-skrbnosti in pravici; Tebi, o Gospod, bom pel. 
[101:2] Obnašal se bom modro in dajal prednost brezhibni poti – o kdaj boš Ti prišel k meni? V svoji hiši bom hodil v popolnosti in z brezhibnim srcem. 
[101:3] Pred svoje oči ne bom postavil nobene slabe ali zlobne stvari. Sovražim delo tistih, ki se obrnejo vstran [od prave poti]; to me ne bo zajelo. 
[101:4] Sprijeno srce se bo ločilo od mene; ne bom poznal nobene hudobne osebe ali stvari. 
[101:5] Kdorkoli tajno obrekuje svojega soseda, tistega bom odrezal [od sebe]; tistega, ki ima ošaben videz in ponosno in domišljavo srce, ne morem in ne bom trpel. 
[101:6] Moje oči bodo [z naklonjenostjo gledale] na zveste v deželi, da bodo lahko prebivali z menoj; kdor hodi brezhibno, ta mi bo služil. 
[101:7] Kdor vara, ne bo prebival v moji hiši; kdor govori laži, ne bo nadaljeval v moji prisotnosti. 
[101:8] Jutro za jutrom bom ruval vse zlobne v deželi, da bom iz Gospodovega mesta lahko odstranil vse hudobneže. 
[102:1]  USLIŠI MOJO molitev, o Gospod in naj moj klic pride k Tebi. 
[102:2] Ne skrivaj Svojega obraza pred menoj na dan, ko sem v stiski! Svoje uho nagni k meni; na dan, ko kličem, mi hitro odgovori. 
[102:3] Kajti moji dnevi se zapravljajo kakor dim in moje kosti gorijo kot bakla ali kot ognjišče. 
[102:4] Moje srce je pokošeno kakor trava in ovenelo, tako da sem [v zatopljenosti] pozabil jesti svojo hrano. 
[102:5] Zaradi mojega glasnega vzdihovanja [od trpljenja in težav] se moje meso lepi na moje kosti. 
[102:6] Sem kot otožen pelikan ali jastreb iz divjine; sem kot [osamljena] sova iz pustih krajev. 
[102:7] Nespečen sem in ležim buden, [tožeč], kot zapuščena puščica sama na vrhu strehe. 
[102:8] Moji nasprotniki se posmehujejo in mi očitajo ves dan; in tisti, ki so jezni name, moje ime uporabljajo kot prekletstvo. 
[102:9] Kajti jedel sem pepel, [v katerem sem sedel], kot če bi bil kruh in svojo pijačo sem mešal z jokom 
[102:10] zaradi Tvoje užaljenosti in Tvojega besa, kajti Ti si me vzel in me zavrgel. 
[102:11] Moji dnevi so kot večerna senca, ki se razteguje in pojema [s soncem]; jaz pa sem ovenel kakor trava. 
[102:12] Toda Ti, o Gospod, prestoluješ za vedno; in slava Tvojega imena vztraja vsem rodovom. 
[102:13] Ti se boš vzdignil in imel usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost za Sion, kajti čas je, da imaš usmiljenje in sočutje zanjo; da, določeni čas je prišel, [namenjeni trenutek].  
[102:14] Kajti Tvoji služabniki si jemljejo [otožno] zadovoljstvo v kamenju [njenih razvalin] in kažejo pomilovanje za njen prah. 
[102:15] Tako se bodo narodi bali in obožujoče častili ime Gospoda in vsi kralji zemlje Tvojo slavo.  
[102:16] Ko Gospod zgradi Sion, se bo On pojavil v Svoji slavi; 
[102:17] On bo spoštoval prošnjo zapuščenih in ne bo preziral njihove molitve. 
[102:18] Naj bo to zapisano za rodove, ki še niso rojeni, da bo ljudstvo, ki bo šele ustvarjeno, hvalilo Gospoda. 
[102:19] Kajti On je gledal dol iz višine Svojega svetišča, iz nebes je Gospod pogledal zemljo, 
[102:20] da bi slišal ječanje in vzdihovanje jetnikov, da osvobodi tiste, ki so namenjeni za smrt, 
[102:21] tako da ljudje lahko razglašajo ime Gospoda na Sionu in Njegovo hvalo v Jeruzalemu, 
[102:22] ko so ljudstva zbrana skupaj in kraljestva, da bi oboževala in služila Gospodu. 
[102:23] On je prizadel in oslabil mojo moč, ponižal me je na poti in me [z bolestjo] privedel na dno; On je skrajšal moje dni, [prezgodaj me je postaral]. 
[102:24] Jaz sem rekel: "O moj Bog, ne vzemi me stran v sredi mojih dni, Ti, čigar leta se nadaljujejo skozi vse rodove." 
[102:25] Na začetku si Ti obstajal in zemlji položil temelje; podaljšek nebes je delo Tvojih rok. 
[102:26] Izginili bodo, toda Ti boš ostal in vztrajal; da, vsi izmed njih se bodo izrabili in postarali kakor oblačilo. Kakor obleko jih boš Ti zamenjal in spremenjeni bodo ter preminuli. 
[102:27] Toda Ti boš ostal isti in Tvoja leta ne bodo imela konca.  
[102:28] Otroci Tvojih služabnikov bodo prebivali varno in nadaljevali in njihovi potomci bodo postavljeni pred Teboj. 
[103:1]  BLAGOSLAVLJAJ, (OBOŽUJOČE, hvaležno slavi) Gospoda, o moja duša; in vse, kar je [najgloblje] v meni, naj blagoslavlja Njegovo sveto ime! 
[103:2] Blagoslavljaj, (obožujoče, hvaležno slavi) Gospoda, o moja duša in ne pozabi nobene [od] vseh Njegovih dobrot – 
[103:3] kdo odpušča [vsako od] vseh tvojih krivic, kdo ozdravlja [vsako od] vseh tvojih bolezni, 
[103:4] kdo odkupuje tvoje življenje iz brezna in pokvarjenosti, kdo te olepša, počasti in krona z ljubečo-skrbnostjo in nežnim usmiljenjem; 
[103:5] kdo teši tvoja usta z dobrinami [tvojo potrebo in željo pri tvoji osebni starosti in položaju], tako da je tvoja prenovljena mladost podobna orlovi, [močna, zmagujoča in visoko leteča]!  
[103:6] Gospod izvršuje pravičnost in pravico, [ne samo zame, temveč] za vse, ki so zatirani. 
[103:7] On je dal spoznati Svoje poti [pravičnosti in pravice] Mojzesu, Svoja dela Izraelovim otrokom. 
[103:8] Gospod je usmiljen in dobrotljiv, počasen v jezi in obilen v usmiljenju ter ljubeči-skrbnosti.  
[103:9] Ne bo vedno grajal ali nasprotoval, niti On ne bo večno ohranjal Svoje jeze ali držal zamere. 
[103:10] Z nami ni ravnal po naših grehih in nas ni nagradil glede na naše krivde. 
[103:11] Kajti kakor je podaljšek nebes visoko nad zemljo, tako čudoviti sta Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost do tistih, ki se Ga častitljivo in polni oboževanja bojijo. 
[103:12] Kakor je vzhod oddaljen od zahoda, tako daleč je On od nas odstranil naše prestopke. 
[103:13] Kakor oče ljubi in pomiluje svoje otroke, tako Gospod ljubi in pomiluje tiste, ki se Ga bojijo [s čaščenjem, oboževanjem in strahospoštovanjem]. 
[103:14] Kajti On pozna naš sestav, On se [tehtno] spominja in si [na Svoje srce] vtisnjuje, da smo prah. 
[103:15] Glede človeka, njegovi dnevi so kakor trava; kakor cvetlica na polju, tako on uspeva. 
[103:16] Komaj zaveje veter mimo nje in že je ni več in njen kraj je ne bo več poznal. 
[103:17] Toda usmiljenje in Gospodova ljubeča-skrbnost sta od večnosti do večnosti nad tistimi, ki se Ga bojijo s čaščenjem in oboževanjem in Njegova pravičnost je do otrok otrok – 
[103:18] tistim, ki ohranjajo Njegovo zavezo [z njenim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem] in tistim, ki se [iskreno] spominjajo Njegovih zapovedi, da bi jih izpolnjevali, [vtiskujoč si jih na svoja srca]. 
[103:19] Gospod je osnoval svoj prestol v podaljšku nebes in Njegovo kraljestvo vlada nad vsemi. 
[103:20] Blagoslavljajte, (obožujoče, hvaležno slavite) Gospoda, vi Njegovi angeli, vi silaki, ki izpolnjujete Njegove zapovedi s poslušanjem glasu Njegove besede. 
[103:21] Blagoslavljajte, (obožujoče, hvaležno slavite) Gospoda, vse ve Njegove vojske, vi Njegovi služabniki, ki delate v Njegovo zadovoljstvo. 
[103:22] Blagoslavljajte Gospoda, vsa Njegova dela, na vseh krajih Njegovega gospostva; blagoslavljaj, (obožujoče, hvaležno slavi) Gospoda, o moja duša! 
[104:1] BLAGOSLAVLJAJ, (OBOŽUJOČE, hvaležno hvali) Gospoda, o moja duša! O Gospod, moj Bog, Ti si zelo velik! Ti si ogrnjen s častjo in veličastvom – 
[104:2] [Ti si Ta], ki Sebe pokriva z lučjo kakor z oblačilom, ki podaljšek nebes razteza kakor zaveso ali šotor, 
[104:3] ki polaga stropnike gornje sobe Svojega prebivališča v vodah [nad nebesnim svodom], ki dela oblake za Svoj bojni voz, ki hodi na perutih vetra, 
[104:4] ki dela vetrove za Svoje poslance, ognjene plamene za Svoje služabnike.  
[104:5] Ti si položil temelje zemlje, da ne bi bila za vedno omajana.  
[104:6] Ti si jo pokril z globino kakor z oblačilom; vode so stale nad gorami.  
[104:7] Ob Tvojem grajanju so zbežali, ob glasu Tvojega grmenja so se podvizali stran. 
[104:8] Gore so se dvignile, doline so se pogreznile na kraj, ki si ga Ti določil zanje. 
[104:9] Ti si postavil mejo [za vode], katero ne morejo prestopiti, da se ponovno ne obrnejo in ne poplavijo zemlje. 
[104:10] On pošilja izvire v doline; njihove vode tečejo med gorami. 
[104:11] Dajejo piti vsaki [divji] živali polja; divji osli tam gasijo svojo žejo. 
[104:12] Poleg njih imajo svoja gnezda ptice podaljška nebes; pojejo med vejami.  
[104:13] On zaliva gore iz Svojih zgornjih sob; zemlja je potešena in je bogata s sadom Njegovih del. 
[104:14] On povzroča rast vegetacije za govedo in vse kar zemlja proizvaja za človeka, da to obdeluje, da lahko rodi hrano iz zemlje – 
[104:15] in vino, ki razveseljuje človekovo srce, da naredi njegov obraz bolj sijoč kakor olje in kruh, da podpira, osvežuje in okrepi človekovo srce. 
[104:16] Gospodova drevesa so obilno zalivana in napolnjena s sokom, libanonske cedre, ki jih je On vsadil, 
[104:17] kjer ptice delajo svoja gnezda; glede štorklje, jelke so njena hiša. 
[104:18] Visoke gore so za divje koze; skale so zatočišče za zajce in jazbece. 
[104:19] [Gospod] je določil luno za letne čase; sonce pozna [natančen čas] svojega zahoda. 
[104:20] Ti, [O Gospod], narediš temo in nastane noč, v kateri se plazijo vsakršne divje gozdne živali. 
[104:21] Mladi levi rjovijo po svojem plenu in iščejo svojo hrano od Boga. 
[104:22] Ko vzide sonce, se umaknejo in ležejo v svoje brloge. 
[104:23] Človek gre na svoje delo in ostane pri svoji nalogi do večera. 
[104:24] O Gospod, kako mnoga in raznolika so Tvoja dela! V modrosti si jih Ti vsa naredil; zemlja je polna Tvojih bogastev in Tvojih ustvarjenih bitij. 
[104:25] Tamkaj je morje, veliko in široko, v katerem mrgoli brez števila plazečih se stvari, majhnih in velikih ustvarjenih bitij. 
[104:26] Tam gredo morske ladje in Leviatán (morska pošast), ki si jo Ti oblikoval, da se zabava v njem. 
[104:27] Te vse čakajo in so odvisne od Tebe, da jim Ti lahko daš njihovo hrano ob primernem času. 
[104:28] Ko jim jo Ti daš, jo zbirajo; Ti odpiraš Svojo roko in so napolnjene z dobrimi stvarmi. 
[104:29] Ko Ti skriješ Svoj obraz, so zbegane in obupane; ko jim Ti odvzameš njihov dih, poginejo in se vrnejo v svoj prah. 
[104:30] Ko Ti pošlješ Svojega Duha in jim daš dih, so ustvarjene in Ti zopet napolniš obličje tal. 
[104:31] Naj Gospodova slava vztraja za vedno; naj se Gospod radosti v Svojih delih – 
[104:32] ki gleda na zemljo in ta se trese in trepeta, ki se dotakne gora in te se kadijo! 
[104:33] Pel bom Gospodu dokler živim; svojemu Bogu bom pel hvalo, medtem ko imam kakršenkoli obstoj. 
[104:34] Naj Mu bo moje premišljevanje prijetno; kar se mene tiče, jaz se bom radostil v Gospodu. 
[104:35] Naj bodo grešniki použiti z zemlje in naj ne bo več zlobnih. Blagoslavljaj, (obožujoče, hvaležno hvali) Gospoda, o moja duša! Hvali Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[105:1] O ZAHVALJUJTE se Gospodu, kličite k Njegovemu imenu, Njegova dela naredite poznana med ljudstvi! 
[105:2] Pojte Mu, pojte Mu hvalnice; premišljujte o |vseh Njegovih čudovitih delih| in govorite o vseh Njegovih čudovitih delih in jih prizadevno hvalite. 
[105:3] Bodite ponosni na Njegovo sveto ime; naj se radostijo srca tistih, ki iščejo in zahtevajo Gospoda [kot svojo nujno potrebo]. 
[105:4] Iščite, povprašujte po |Gospodu| in za Gospodom in nujno potrebujte Njega in Njegovo moč, (Njegovo mogočnost in neomajnost za skušnjavo); iščite in zahtevajte Njegov obraz in Njegovo prisotnost, [neprenehoma], večno. 
[105:5] [Iskreno] se spominjajte čudovitih dejanj, ki jih je storil On, Njegovih čudežev in čudes, sodb in obsodb, ki jih je On razglasil [nad Svojimi sovražniki, kakor v Egiptu].  
[105:6] O vi potomci Abrahama, Njegovega služabnika, vi Jakobovi otroci, Njegovi izvoljenci, 
[105:7] On je Gospod, naš Bog; Njegove sodbe so po vsej zemlji. 
[105:8] On je [iskreno] skrben do Svoje zaveze in je za vedno vtisnjena na Njegovo srce, beseda, ki jo je On ukazal in osnoval tisočerim rodovom, 
[105:9] zaveza, ki jo je On sklenil z Abrahamom in Njegova zaprisežena obljuba Izaku,  
[105:10] katero je On potrdil Jakobu kot zakon, Izraelu kot večno zavezo, 
[105:11] rekoč: "K tebi bom Jaz dal deželo Kánaan kot tvoj odmerjeni delež, lastnino in dediščino." 
[105:12] Ko so bili le maloštevilni, dejansko le nekaj njih in so bili začasni prebivalci in tujci v njej, 
[105:13] ko so šli od enega naroda do drugega, od enega kraljestva do drugega ljudstva, 
[105:14] ni On nobenemu človeku dopustil, da bi jim delal krivico; dejansko je On zavoljo njih grajal kralje,  
[105:15] govoreč: "Ne dotikajte se Mojih maziljencev in Mojim prerokom ne škodujte."  
[105:16] Še več, On je poklical lakoto na [egiptovsko] deželo; On je odrezal vsak vir kruha.  
[105:17] On je poslal človeka pred njimi, celo Jožefa, ki je bil prodan kot služabnik.  
[105:18] Njegova stopala so poškodovali z okovi; položen je bil v železne verige in njegova duša je vstopila v železo, 
[105:19] dokler se ni njegova beseda [njegovim krutim bratom] uresničila, dokler ga ni Gospodova beseda skušala in preizkusila. 
[105:20] Kralj je poslal in ga izpustil, celo vladar ljudstev in ga izpustil na prostost. 
[105:21] Jožefa je naredil za velikaša svoje hiše in vladarja vsega svojega imetja,  
[105:22] da bi svoje prince zavezal njegovi volji in svoje starešine učil modrosti. 
[105:23] Izrael je prav tako prišel v Egipt; in Jakob je prebival v Hamovi deželi.  
[105:24] Tam je [Gospod] silno namnožil Svoje ljudstvo in jih naredil močnejše od njihovih zatiralcev. 
[105:25] On je obrnil srca [Egipčanov], da sovražijo Njegovo ljudstvo, da so z Njegovimi služabniki zvito ravnali. 
[105:26] On je poslal Mojzesa, Svojega služabnika in Arona, katerega je On izbral. 
[105:27] Onadva sta pokazala Njegova znamenja med njimi, čudeže in čudesa v Hamovi deželi (Egiptu). 
[105:28] On je poslal [gosto] temo in deželo naredil temno in onadva, [dva Božja služabnika], se nista uprla zoper Njegovo besedo.  
[105:29] On je [egiptovske] vode spremenil v kri in povzročil, da so njihove ribe poginile.  
[105:30] Njihova dežela je rodila žab v obilju, celo v sobanah njihovih kraljev.  
[105:31] On je spregovoril in na vse njihove meje so prišli roji hroščev in muh in komarjev in uši.  
[105:32] On jim je dal točo za dež, z bliskanjem podobnemu plamenečemu ognju v njihovi deželi.  
[105:33] On je udaril tudi njihove trte in njihove fige in polomil je [z ledom obtežena] drevesa njihovih meja.  
[105:34] On je spregovoril in kobilice rojilke so prišle in kobilice in to brezštevilne,  
[105:35] in pojedle vse rastje v njihovi deželi in použile sad njihove zemlje. 
[105:36] On je udaril tudi vse prvorojence v njihovi deželi, začetek in glavno prvino vse njihove moči.  
[105:37] On je prav tako spremil [Izraela] s srebrom in zlatom in med njihovimi plemeni ni bilo niti ene slabotne osebe.  
[105:38] Ko so odšli, je bil Egipt zadovoljen, kajti strah pred njimi je padel na ljudi.  
[105:39] Gospod je razprostrl oblak za pokrivalo [podnevi] in ogenj, da daje luč ponoči.  
[105:40] [Izraelci] so zahtevali in On je privedel prepelice in jih zadovoljil z nebeškim kruhom.  
[105:41] On je odprl skalo in voda je brizgnila ven; v suhih krajih je tekla kakor reka.  
[105:42] Kajti On se je [iskreno] spomnil Svoje svete besede in obljube Abrahamu, Svojemu služabniku.  
[105:43] In On je Svoje ljudstvo spremil z radostjo, ter Svoje izvoljence z zadovoljstvom in petjem, 
[105:44] in dal jim je dežele [kánaanskih] narodov in želi so sadove dela tistih ljudstev,  
[105:45] da bi bili lahko pozorni na Njegove odloke in ohranjali Njegove zakone [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[106:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) o dajte hvalo Gospodu, kajti On je dober; kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno!  
[106:2] Kdo lahko ubesedi in pripoveduje mogočna Gospodova dejanja? Ali kdo lahko pokaže vso hvalo, [ki Mu pripada]? 
[106:3] Blagoslovljeni, (veseli, srečni, zavidanja vredni) so tisti, ki so pozorni na pravico, [pošteno ravnajo z drugimi] in ki delajo pravilno in so ob vseh časih v pravem odnosu z Bogom. 
[106:4] [Iskreno] se me spominjaj, o Gospod, ko si Ti naklonjen Svojemu ljudstvu! O prav tako me obišči kadar jih Ti osvobodiš in mi zagotovi Svojo rešitev duše! – 
[106:5] da bi lahko videl in delil blaginjo Tvojih izbrancev, da bi se lahko radostil v veselju Tvojega naroda, da bi lahko slavil s Tvojo dediščino. 
[106:6] Grešili smo, kakor so tudi naši očetje; zagrešili smo krivičnost, počeli smo zlobno.  
[106:7] Naši očetje v Egiptu niso razumeli, niti niso cenili Tvojih čudežev; niso se [iskreno] spominjali množice Tvojih milosti, niti si [na svoja srca] niso vtisnili Tvoje ljubeče-skrbnosti, temveč so bili uporni in so izzivali Gospoda ob morju, celo ob Rdečem morju.  
[106:8] Kljub temu jih je On rešil zaradi Svojega imena, [da dokaže pravičnost nebeškega značaja], da bi Svojo mogočno oblast On lahko naredil znano. 
[106:9] Prav tako je On ukoril Rdeče morje in se je posušilo; tako jih je On vodil skozi globine kakor skozi pašnik.  
[106:10] In On jih je rešil iz roke tistega, ki jih je sovražil in jih odkupil iz roke [egipčanskega] sovražnika.  
[106:11] In vode so pokrile njihove nasprotnike; niti eden izmed njih ni ostal.  
[106:12] Potem je [Izrael] verjel Njegovim besedam, [zaupal je vanje, se zanašal nanje]; opevali so Njegovo hvalo. 
[106:13] Toda hitro so pozabili Njegova dela; niso [iskreno] čakali, [da se] zanje [razvijejo] Njegovi načrti, 
[106:14] temveč so skrajno hlepeli v divjini in skušali ter preizkušali ovirati Boga [s Svojimi vztrajnimi željami] v puščavi.  
[106:15] In On jim je dal njihovo zahtevo, toda v njihove duše je poslal pustost in [njihovo število zmanjšal z] boleznijo in smrtjo.  
[106:16] V taboru so prav tako zavidali Mojzesu in Aronu, [visokemu duhovniku], Gospodovemu svetemu.  
[106:17] Zato se je zemlja odprla in požrla Datána in se zaprla nad Abirámovo družbo.  
[106:18] In ogenj je izbruhnil v njihovi družbi; ogenj je požgal zlobne.  
[106:19] Naredili so tele v Horebu in oboževali staljeno podobo.  
[106:20] Tako so zamenjali Njega, ki je bil njihova Slava, za podobo goveda, ki jé travo, [svojo Čast so zamenjali za podobo teleta]! 
[106:21] Pozabili so Boga, svojega Odrešenika, ki je v Egiptu storil tako veličastne stvari, 
[106:22] čudeže in čudesa v Hamovi deželi, strašne in osupljive stvari ob Rdečem morju. 
[106:23] Zato je On rekel, da jih bo On uničil. [In On bi tako storil], če ne bi Mojzes, Njegov izbranec, stopil v vrzel pred Njim, da odvrne Njegov grozeči bes.  
[106:24] Potem so zaničevali in prezirali prijetno in zaželeno deželo [Kánaan]; niso verjeli Njegovi besedi, [niti niso zaupali vanjo, niso se zanašali nanjo, niti se je niso držali]; 
[106:25] temveč so godrnjali v svojih šotorih in niso prisluhnili Gospodovemu glasu. 
[106:26] Zato je On dvignil Svojo roko, [kot bi delal prisego] proti njim, da jim bo On povzročil, da popadejo v divjini, 
[106:27] |da| izžene njihove potomce med narode in jih raztrese po deželah [zemlje]. 
[106:28] Prav tako so se pridružili [tistemu maliku] Baalu iz Peorja in jedli žrtve [ponujene] neživim [bogovom]. 
[106:29] Tako so s svojimi ravnanji Gospoda izzivali k jezi in med njimi je izbruhnila kuga. 
[106:30] Potem je vstal Pinhás [duhovnik] in izvršil sodbo in tako je bila kuga ustavljena.  
[106:31] In to mu je bilo šteto za pravičnost, (pravilno ravnanje in pravilen odnos z Bogom), vsem rodovom za vedno. 
[106:32] Prav tako so jezili Gospoda pri vodah Meríbe, tako da se je zaradi njih Mojzesu slabo godilo.  
[106:33] kajti izzivali so [Mojzesovega] duha, tako da je s svojimi ustnicami prenagljeno govoril. 
[106:34] [Poganskih] narodov niso uničili, kakor jim je Gospod zapovedal, 
[106:35] temveč so se zapletali z [malikovalskimi] narodi in se učili njihovih poti in del 
[106:36] ter služili njihovim malikom, ki so bili zanje zanka. 
[106:37] Da, svoje sinove in svoje hčere so žrtvovali demonom  
[106:38] in prelivali nedolžno kri, celo kri njihovih sinov in njihovih hčera, ki so jih žrtvovali kánaanskim malikom; in dežela je bila onesnažena z njihovo krvjo. 
[106:39] Tako so bili oskrunjeni s svojimi lastnimi deli ter igrali vlačugo in s svojimi lastnimi deli [malikovalskih obredov] izvajali malikovanje. 
[106:40] Zato je bil Gospodov bes razvnet proti Svojemu ljudstvu, do take mere, da je On zaničeval in zavrnil Svojo lastno dediščino.  
[106:41] In On jih je dal v roke [poganskih] narodov in tisti, ki so jih sovražili, so vladali nad njimi. 
[106:42] Njihovi sovražniki so jih prav tako zatirali in podrejeni so bili pod roko svojih sovražnikov. 
[106:43] Mnogokrat jih je [Bog] osvobodil, toda v svoji nameri so bili uporni in zaradi svoje krivičnosti so nizko potonili. 
[106:44] Kljub temu se je On ozrl na njihovo stisko, ko je On slišal njihov jok; 
[106:45] in On se je zaradi njih [iskreno] spomnil Svoje zaveze in omilil njihovo obsodbo hudobije, [tolažeč in lajšajoč Se], glede na obilje Svojega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti, [ko so klicali k Njemu]. 
[106:46] Prav tako je On povzročil, da je [Izrael] našel sočutje med tistimi, ki so jih odnesli proč, v ujetništvo. 
[106:47] Osvobodi nas, o Gospod, naš Bog in zberi nas izmed narodov, da se bomo lahko zahvaljevali Tvojemu svetemu imenu in Te slavili v hvaljenju. 
[106:48] Blagoslovljen, (obožujoče in hvaležno hvaljen), bodi Gospod, Izraelov Bog, od večnosti do večnosti! In vse ljudstvo naj reče: "Amen!" Hvalite Gospoda!" (Aleluja!)  
[107:1] O DAJTE zahvalo Gospodu, kajti On je dober; kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno! 
[107:2] Naj tako rečejo Gospodovi odkupljenci, katere je On osvobodil iz roke nasprotnika, 
[107:3] in jih zbral iz dežel, od vzhoda in od zahoda, od severa in od [Rdečega] morja na jugu. 
[107:4] Nekateri so odtavali v divjino po osamljeni puščavski poti; niso našli mesta za bivanje. 
[107:5] Lačni in žejni so oslabeli; njihova življenja so bila blizu propada. 
[107:6] Potem so v svoji stiski klicali h Gospodu in On jih je osvobodil iz njihovih težav. 
[107:7] On jih je izpeljal po ravni in pravi poti, da bi lahko šli v mesto, kjer bi si lahko postavili svoje domove. 
[107:8] Oh, da bi ljudje hvalili [in se izpovedali] Gospodu zaradi Njegove dobrote in ljubeče-skrbnosti in Njegovih čudovitih del človeškim otrokom! 
[107:9] Kajti On zadovoljuje hrepenečo dušo in lačno dušo napolnjuje z dobrim. 
[107:10] Nekateri so sedeli v temi in v smrtni senci, bili so zvezani v trpljenju in v okovih,  
[107:11] zato, ker so se uprli zoper besede Boga in prezirali nasvet Najvišjega. 
[107:12] Zato je njihova srca On upognil s težkim delom; spotaknili so se in padli in nikogar ni bilo, ki bi pomagal. 
[107:13] Potem so v svoji stiski klicali h Gospodu in On jih je rešil iz njihovih težav. 
[107:14] On jih je privedel ven iz teme in smrtne sence in prelomil vezi, ki so jih držale.  
[107:15] Oh, da bi ljudje hvalili [in se izpovedali] Gospodu zaradi Njegove dobrote in ljubeče-skrbnosti in Njegovih čudovitih del človeškim otrokom! 
[107:16] Kajti On je zlomil bronaste duri in razrezal železne rešetke. 
[107:17] Nekateri so bedaki, [so oboleli] zaradi načina svojih prestopkov in so prizadeti zaradi svojih krivičnosti. 
[107:18] Njim se gnusi vsaka vrsta hrane in približujejo se durim smrti. 
[107:19] Potem so v svoji stiski klicali h Gospodu in On jih osvobodi iz njihovih težav. 
[107:20] On pošlje Svojo besedo in jih ozdravi in reši iz jame in pogubljenja.  
[107:21] Oh, da bi ljudje hvalili [in se izpovedali] Gospodu zaradi Njegove dobrote in ljubeče-skrbnosti in Njegovih čudovitih del človeškim otrokom!  
[107:22] In žrtvujejo naj žrtve zahvaljevanja in naštevajo naj Njegova dejanja z vzkliki radosti in petjem! 
[107:23] Nekateri gredo dol do morja in prek njega potujejo z ladjami, da poslujejo v velikih vodah; 
[107:24] ti vidijo Gospodova dela in Njegove čudeže v globinah. 
[107:25] Kajti On ukazuje in vzdiguje viharni veter, ki dviguje morske valove. 
[107:26] [Tisti v tujini] se vzpenjajo do podaljška nebes, ponovno gredo dol do globin; njihov pogum se raztopi zaradi njihovega položaja. 
[107:27] Obračajo se sem ter tja in se opotekajo kakor pijanec in so pri koncu s svojo razumnostjo, [vsa njihova modrost je šla v nič]. 
[107:28] Potem so v svoji stiski klicali h Gospodu in On jih privede ven iz njihovih težav. 
[107:29] On utiša vihar v miren in nežen šepet, tako da so morski valovi mirni.  
[107:30] Potem so ljudje zadovoljni zaradi miru in On jih privede v njihov zaželen pristan. 
[107:31] Oh, da bi ljudje hvalili [in se izpovedali] Gospodu zaradi Njegove dobrote in ljubeče-skrbnosti in Njegovih čudovitih del človeškim otrokom! 
[107:32] Naj Ga prav tako povzdigujejo v zboru ljudstva in Ga hvalijo v družbi starešin. 
[107:33] On reke spreminja v divjino, vodne izvire v žejna tla,  
[107:34] rodovitno deželo v neplodno zemljo, slano pustinjo, zaradi zlobnosti tistih, ki v njej prebivajo.  
[107:35] On divjino spreminja v vodni bazen in suha tla v vodne izvire;  
[107:36] in tam On stori lačnim, da prebivajo, da bi lahko pripravili mesto za prebivanje, 
[107:37] in sejali polja ter zasajali vinograde, ki prinašajo sadove rasti. 
[107:38] On jih prav tako blagoslavlja, tako da so silno pomnoženi in ne dopusti, da bi se njihova živina zmanjšala. 
[107:39] Ko so zaradi zatiranja, stiske in bolesti zmanjšani in upognjeni, 
[107:40] On izlije prezir na prince in jim povzroči, da odtavajo v puste kraje, kjer ni poti. 
[107:41] Vendarle On vzdiguje ubogega in pomoči potrebnega iz trpljenja in dela njihove družine kakor čredo. 
[107:42] Iskreni bodo to videli in bodo zadovoljni, toda vsa krivičnost bo zaprla svoja usta. 
[107:43] Kdorkoli je moder, [če je kdo resnično moder], bo izpolnjeval in pazil na te stvari; in oni bodo prizadevno preudarili usmiljenje in Gospodovo ljubečo-skrbnost. 
[108:1]  O BOG, moje srce je trdno, (neomajno, v zaupnosti vere); pel bom, da, pel bom hvalnice, celo s svojo slavo, [z vsemi sposobnostmi in močmi nekoga ustvarjenega po Tvoji podobi]! 
[108:2] Zbudita se harfa in lira; jaz sam se bom zbudil zelo zgodaj – prebudil bom zoro! 
[108:3] Hvalil bom |Tebe| in se zahvaljeval Tebi, o Gospod, med ljudstvi; in Tebi bom pel hvalnice med narodi. 
[108:4] Kajti Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost sta veličastni in visoki kot podaljšek nebes! Tvoja resnica in zvestoba segata do ozračij!  
[108:5] Bodi povzdigovan, o Bog, nad podaljškom nebes in naj bo Tvoja slava čez vso zemljo. 
[108:6] Da bi Tvoji ljubljeni [sledilci] lahko bili osvobojeni, reši s Svojo desnico in nam [ali meni] odgovori! 
[108:7] Bog je v Svoji svetosti obljubil [glede ustanovitve Davidove rodbine]: "Jaz se bom radostil, Jaz bom razdelil [Kánaan med Svoje ljudstvo], razdeljujoč Sihem in [zahodno območje in deleč vzhodno območje, ki vsebuje] dolino Sukót. 
[108:8] Gileád je Moj, Manáse je Moj; tudi Efrájim je Moje oporišče in obramba Moje glave; Juda je Moje žezlo in postavodajalec.  
[108:9] Moáb je Moj umivalnik; na Edóm, [Svojega sužnja], Jaz mečem Svoj čevelj, [da bo očiščen]; nad Filistejo Jaz kričim [v zmagoslavju]." 
[108:10] Kdo bo mene, [Davida], pripeljal v močno, utrjeno mesto [Petra]? Kdo me bo vodil v Edóm? 
[108:11] Ali nas nisi Ti zavrgel, o Bog? In ali Ti ne boš šel naprej, o Bog, z našimi vojskami? 
[108:12] Daj nam pomoč zoper nasprotnika, kajti ničeva je človeška pomoč. 
[108:13] Zaradi |Boga| in z Bogom bomo ravnali hrabro, kajti On je ta, ki bo poteptal naše nasprotnike.  
[109:1]  O BOG moje hvale! Ne ohranjaj tišine, 
[109:2] kajti zoper mene so odprta usta zlobnih in usta prevare; z lažnivimi jeziki so govorili meni in zoper mene. 
[109:3] Prav tako so me obdali z besedami sovraštva in se brez vzroka borili zoper mene. 
[109:4] V zameno za mojo ljubezen so oni moji nasprotniki, toda jaz se zatekam v molitev. 
[109:5] In nagradili so |me| in mi naprtili hudobijo za dobro in sovraštvo za mojo ljubezen. 
[109:6] Postavi zlobneža nad njim [kakor sodnika] in naj [zlonamerni] obtoževalec stoji na njegovi desnici. 
[109:7] Ko je [zlobni] sojen, naj bo obsojen in naj bo njegova molitev [za prizanesljivost] spremenjena v greh. 
[109:8] Naj bo njegovih dni malo; in naj drug prevzame njegovo službo in zadolžitev.  
[109:9] Naj bodo njegovi otroci brez očeta in njegova žena vdova. 
[109:10] Naj bodo njegovi otroci nenehno potepuhi, [kakor je bil Kajn] in naj beračijo; naj iščejo svoj kruh in naj bodo pognani daleč od njihovih uničenih domov.  
[109:11] Naj upnik in oderuh zasežeta vse kar ima; in naj neznanci (barbari in tujci), plenijo sadove njegovega dela. 
[109:12] Naj ne bo nikogar, ki bi mu naklonil ali nadaljeval usmiljenje in skrbnost, niti naj ne bo nikogar, ki bi imel usmiljenje z njegovimi osirotelimi otroki. 
[109:13] Naj bo njegovo potomstvo odrezano in naj bodo v prihodnjih rodovih njihova imena izbrisana. 
[109:14] Naj se Gospod spominja krivde njegovih očetov; in naj ne bo izbrisan greh njegove matere. 
[109:15] Naj bodo stalno pred Gospodom, da bo On lahko izbrisal spomin nanje iz zemlje! – 
[109:16] ker se človek ni [iskreno] spomnil pokazati usmiljenja, temveč je zasledoval in preganjal ubogega in pomoči potrebnega in [pripravljen je bil] umoriti zlomljenega v srcu. 
[109:17] Da, on je ljubil preklinjanje in le-to se je vrnilo [nazaj] nadenj; ni se razveseljeval v blagoslovu in ta je bil daleč od njega. 
[109:18] Prav tako je sebe oblačil s prekletstvom kakor s svojim oblačilom in le-to je kakor voda pronicalo v njegovo notranje [življenje] in kakor olje v njegove kosti. 
[109:19] Naj bo le-to njemu kakor obleka, s katero se pokriva in kakor pas, s katerim je nenehno opasan. 
[109:20] Naj bo to plačilo mojim nasprotnikom od Gospoda in tistim, ki govorijo hudo proti mojemu življenju. 
[109:21] Toda Ti se zanimaj zame in ukrepaj zame, o Gospod Bog, zaradi Svojega imena; ker Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost sta dobri, o osvobodi me. 
[109:22] Kajti jaz sem ubog in pomoči potreben in moje srce je ranjeno in potrto znotraj mene. 
[109:23] Izginjam kakor senca, ko se podaljša in upada; meče me gor in dol in otresen sem kakor kobilica rojivka. 
[109:24] Moja kolena so šibka in se opotekajo od posta; in moje telo je mršavo in nima nobene mastnosti. 
[109:25] Prav tako sem postal v očitek in zasmeh drugim; ko me vidijo, zmajujejo s svojimi glavami.  
[109:26] Pomagaj mi, o Gospod, moj Bog; o reši me glede na Svoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost! – 
[109:27] da bodo lahko spoznali, da je to Tvoja roka, da si Ti, Gospod, to storil. 
[109:28] Naj preklinjajo, toda Ti blagoslavljaš. Ko se nasprotniki vzdignejo, naj bodo osramočeni, toda Tvoj služabnik naj se radosti. 
[109:29] Naj bodo moji nasprotniki odeti s sramoto in osramočenjem in naj se pokrivajo s svojim lastnim ponižanjem in zmedenostjo kakor z ogrinjalom. 
[109:30] S svojimi usti bom dal veličastno hvalo in zahvalo Gospodu; da in Njega bom hvalil med množico. 
[109:31] Kajti On bo stal na desnici ubogega in pomoči potrebnega, da ga reši pred tistimi, ki obsojajo njegovo življenje. 
[110:1]  GOSPOD (Bog) pravi mojemu Gospodu (Mesiju): "Sedi na Mojo desnico, dokler Jaz ne naredim Tvoje nasprotnike za Tvojo pručko."  
[110:2] Gospod bo poslal s Siona žezlo Tvoje moči; vladaj torej, v sredi Svojih sovražnikov.  
[110:3] Tvoje ljudstvo se bo prostovoljno ponudilo na dan Tvoje oblasti, v lepoti svetosti in v svetem oblačilu iz maternice jutra; Tebi [se bodo pojavili] Tvoji mladi možje, ki so kakor rosa. 
[110:4] Gospod je prisegel in ne bo preklical ali tega spremenil: "Ti si duhovnik za vedno, po načinu in Melkizedekovem redu."  
[110:5] Gospod na Tvoji desnici bo na dan Svojega ogorčenja razkropil kralje. 
[110:6] On bo izvršil sodbo [v preplavljajočem kaznovanju] nad narodi; On bo doline napolnil z mrtvimi telesi, On bo zdrobil [vrhovne] glave nad mnogimi in daleč razprostirajočimi se deželami.  
[110:7] On bo pil iz potoka ob poti; zato bo On [zmagoslavno] vzdignil Svojo glavo. 
[111:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) Hvalil in zahvaljeval se bom Gospodu s svojim celotnim srcem v svetu iskrenih in v zboru. 
[111:2] Gospodova dela so veličastna, iščejo jih vsi tisti, ki se v njih razveseljujejo. 
[111:3] Njegovo delo je častitljivo in slavno in Njegova pravičnost vztraja za vedno. 
[111:4] On je naredil Svoja čudovita dela, da se jih spominjamo; Gospod je milostljiv, usmiljen in poln ljubečega sočutja. 
[111:5] On je dal hrano in preskrbo tistim, ki se Ga častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo; On se bo za vedno spominjal Svoje zaveze in si jo vtisnil [v Svoj um].  
[111:6] On je Svojemu ljudstvu razglasil in pokazal oblast Njegovih del s tem, da jim je dal dediščino [kánaanskih] narodov. 
[111:7] Dela Njegovih rok so [popolna] resnica in [zvesta in pravilna] pravičnost; in vsi Njegovi odloki in predpisi so zanesljivi, (trdni, uveljavljeni in vredni zaupanja). 
[111:8] Trdno stojijo in postavljeni so za vedno in večno in narejeni so v [popolni] resnici in iskrenosti. 
[111:9] On je Svojemu ljudstvu poslal odkupnino; On je Svoji zavezi ukazal, da bo za vedno; sveto je Njegovo ime, navdihuje strahospoštovanje, čaščenje in bogaboječ strah. 
[111:10] Častitljiv strah in oboževanje Gospoda je začetek Modrosti in vrline, [predhodna in prva osnova, prvi pogoj in abeceda]; dobro razumevanje, modrost in smisel imajo vsi tisti, ki izvršujejo [Gospodovo voljo]. Njihovo hvaljenje Njega vztraja za vedno.  
[112:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) Blagoslovljen, (vesel, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je človek, ki se boji, (časti in obožuje) Gospoda, ki se silno razveseljuje v Njegovih zapovedih.  
[112:2] Njegovo [duhovno] potomstvo bo na zemlji veličastno; rod iskrenih bo blagoslovljen. 
[112:3] Uspevanje in blaginja sta v njegovi hiši in njegova pravičnost vztraja za vedno. 
[112:4] Luč se vzdiguje v temi za iskrene, milostljive, sočutne in pravične, [ki so v pravilnem odnosu z Bogom]. 
[112:5] Dobro je s človekom, ki ravna radodarno in posoja, ki svoje zadeve izvaja s pravico.  
[112:6] Za vedno ne bo omajan; [brezkompromisno] pravičen, (iskren, v pravem odnosu z Bogom) bo večno trajajoč spomin.  
[112:7] Ne bo se bal hudih novic; njegovo srce je čvrsto utrjeno, v zaupanju, (zanašanju na |Gospoda| in prepričanosti) v Gospoda. 
[112:8] Njegovo srce je postavljeno in mirno, ne bo se bal, medtem ko čaka, da vidi svojo željo nameščeno na svojih nasprotnikih. 
[112:9] Svobodno je delil, [dal je ubogim in pomoči potrebnim]; njegova pravičnost, (iskrenost in pravilen odnos z Bogom) vztrajajo za vedno; njegov rog bo povzdignjen v časti.  
[112:10] Zlobnež bo to videl in bo užaloščen ter jezen, škripal bo s svojimi zobmi in izginil [v obupu]; želja zlobnih bo izginila in prišla v nič. 
[113:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) Hvalite, o služabniki Gospodovi, hvalite Gospodovo ime! 
[113:2] Blagoslovljeno bodi Gospodovo ime od tega časa naprej in vedno, 
[113:3] od sončnega vzhoda in njegovega zahoda in od vzhoda do zahoda naj bo hvaljeno Gospodovo ime! 
[113:4] Gospod je visoko nad vsemi narodi in Njegova slava nad podaljškom nebes! 
[113:5] Kdo je kakor Gospod, naš Bog, ki ima Svoj sedež na višavi, 
[113:6] ki samega Sebe poniža, da opazuje podaljšek nebes in zemljo!  
[113:7] [Gospod] uboge vzdiguje iz prahu in pomoči potrebne dviguje iz kupa pepela in kupa gnoja, 
[113:8] da bi jih On lahko posedel s princi, celo s princi Svojega ljudstva. 
[113:9] On dela jalovo ženo gospodinjo in radostno mati [duhovnih] otrok. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[114:1] KO JE IZRAEL prišel ven iz Egipta, hiša Jakobova iz ljudstva tujega jezika, 
[114:2] je Juda postal [Božje] svetišče, (sveti kraj Njegovega prebivališča) in Izrael Njegovo gospostvo.  
[114:3] [Rdeče] morje je gledalo in zbežalo; [reka] Jordan je bila obrnjena nazaj.  
[114:4] Gore so poskakovale kakor ovni, majhni griči kakor jagnjeta. 
[114:5] Kaj ti je, o [Rdeče] morje, da bežiš? O Jordan, da se obračaš nazaj? 
[114:6] Ve gore, ki skačete kakor ovni in vi majhni griči kakor jagnjeta? 
[114:7] Trepetaj, o zemlja, ob prisotnosti Gospoda, ob prisotnosti Jakobovega Boga, 
[114:8] ki je skalo spremenil v vodni bazen, kremen v izvir vodá.  
[115:1] NE nam, o Gospod, ne nam temveč Svojemu imenu daj slavo, zaradi Svojega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti in zaradi Svoje resnice in zvestobe! 
[115:2] Zakaj naj bi narodi rekli: "Kje je sedaj njihov Bog?" 
[115:3] Toda naš Bog je v nebesih; On dela karkoli si On želi. 
[115:4] Maliki narodov so srebro in zlato, delo človeških rok. 
[115:5] Imajo usta, toda ne govorijo; imajo oči, toda ne vidijo; 
[115:6] imajo ušesa, toda ne slišijo; imajo nosove, toda ne vonjajo; 
[115:7] imajo roke, toda ne prijemajo; imajo stopala, toda ne hodijo; niti s svojimi grli ne morejo narediti glasu. 
[115:8] Tisti, ki delajo malike, so kakor oni; prav tako so vsi, ki zaupajo vanje in se zanašajo nanje.  
[115:9] O Izrael, zaupaj in se zatekaj v Gospoda! [Naslanjaj se |Nanj|, zanašaj se |Nanj| in bodi prepričan v Njem!] On je njihova pomoč in njihov ščit. 
[115:10] O hiša Arona, [duhovništvo], zaupaj v |Gospoda| in se naslanjaj na Gospoda! On je njihova pomoč in njihov ščit. 
[115:11] Vi, ki se [častitljivo] bojite Gospoda, zaupajte v |Gospoda| in se zanesite na Gospoda. On je njihova pomoč in njihov ščit. 
[115:12] Gospod je bil pozoren na nas, On nas bo blagoslovil: On bo blagoslovil Izraelovo hišo, On bo blagoslovil Aronovo hišo, [duhovništvo], 
[115:13] On bo blagoslovil tiste, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo Gospoda, tako male kakor velike.  
[115:14] Naj vam Gospod bolj in bolj daje rast, vam in vašim otrokom. 
[115:15] Bodite blagoslovljeni od Gospoda, ki je naredil nebo in zemljo! 
[115:16] Podaljšek nebes je Gospodov podaljšek nebes, toda zemljo je On dal človeškim otrokom. 
[115:17] Mrtvi ne hvalijo Gospoda, niti katerikoli, ki gredo dol v tišino. 
[115:18] Toda mi bomo blagoslavljali, (vdano in hvaležno hvalili) Gospoda od tega časa naprej in za vedno. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[116:1] LJUBIM GOSPODA, ker je On slišal [in sedaj sliši] moj glas in moje ponižne prošnje. 
[116:2] Ker je On nagnil k meni Svoje uho, zato bom klical k Njemu dokler živim. 
[116:3] Vrvi in bolesti smrti so bile okrog mene in grozote Šeola, (kraja mrtvih), so me zgrabile; trpel sem tesnobo in žalost, (stisko in bolest). 
[116:4] Potem sem klical h Gospodovemu imenu: "O Gospod, rotim Te, reši moje življenje in me osvobodi!" 
[116:5] Milostljiv je Gospod in [čvrsto] pravičen; da, naš Bog je usmiljen. 
[116:6] Gospod ohranja preprostega; nizko sem bil priveden in On mi je pomagal in me rešil. 
[116:7] Vrni se k svojemu počitku, o moja duša, kajti Gospod je radodarno ravnal s teboj.  
[116:8] Kajti Ti si moje življenje osvobodil pred smrtjo, moje oči pred solzami in moja stopala pred spotikanjem in padanjem. 
[116:9] V deželi živih bom hodil pred Gospodom. 
[116:10] Verjel sem, (zaupal v |Boga|, se zanašal na |Boga| in se oklepal svojega Boga) in zato sem govoril [celo, ko sem rekel]: "Silno sem prizadet."  
[116:11] Prenagljeno sem rekel: "Vsi ljudje so goljufivi in lažnivi." 
[116:12] Kaj bom vrnil Gospodu za vse Njegove ugodnosti do mene? [Kako Mu lahko povrnem za vsa Njegova radodarna dejanja?] 
[116:13] Vzdignil bom čašo rešitve duš in osvobojenja ter klical Gospodovo ime. 
[116:14] Gospodu bom plačal svoje zaobljube, da, v prisotnosti vseh Njegovih ljudi. 
[116:15] Dragocena, (pomembna in tehtna) v Gospodovih očeh je smrt Njegovih svetih, (Njegovih ljubljenih). 
[116:16] O Gospod, resnično sem Tvoj služabnik; Tvoj služabnik sem, sin Tvoje dekle; Ti si razvezal moje vezi. 
[116:17] Nudil Ti bom žrtev zahvaljevanja in klical bom Gospodovo ime. 
[116:18] Svoje zaobljube bom plačal Gospodu, da, v prisotnosti vseh Njegovih ljudi, 
[116:19] v dvorih Gospodove hiše – v tvoji sredi, o Jeruzalem. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[117:1] O HVALITE Gospoda, vsi vi narodi! Hvalite Ga, vsa ve ljudstva!  
[117:2] Kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost sta veličastni do nas in Gospodova resnica ter zvestoba vztrajata za vedno. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[118:1] O DAJTE hvalo Gospodu, kajti On je dober; kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno! 
[118:2] Naj Izrael sedaj reče, da Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[118:3] Naj Aronova hiša, [duhovništvo], sedaj reče, da Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[118:4] Naj sedaj tisti, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo Gospoda, rečejo, da Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[118:5] Iz svoje stiske sem klical h Gospodu; Gospod mi je odgovoril in me osvobodil in me postavil na prostran kraj. 
[118:6] Gospod je na moji strani; ne bom se bal. Kaj mi more storiti človek?  
[118:7] Gospod je na moji strani in se zavzema zame, On je med tistimi, ki mi pomagajo; zato bom svojo željo videl postavljeno na tistih, ki me sovražijo. 
[118:8] Bolje je zaupati in zatekati se v Gospoda, kakor zaupanje položiti v človeka. 
[118:9] Bolje je zaupati in zatekati se v Gospoda, kakor zaupanje položiti v prince. 
[118:10] Vsi narodi, (okoliška plemena) so me obdala naokrog, toda v Gospodovem imenu jih bom uničil! 
[118:11] Obdali so me naokrog, da, obkolili so me na vsaki strani; toda v Gospodovem imenu jih bom uničil! 
[118:12] Okrog mene so rojili kakor čebele, vzplamenijo in so pokončani kakor ogenj v trnju; v Gospodovem imenu jih bom uničil!  
[118:13] Ti, [moj nasprotnik], si boleče udarjal ob mene, da bi jaz lahko padel, toda Gospod mi je pomagal. 
[118:14] Gospod je moja moč in pesem; in On je postal rešitelj moje duše. 
[118:15] Glas radosti in rešitve duš je v šotorih in zasebnih prebivališčih [brezkompromisno] pravičnih; Gospodova desnica dela junaško in dosega moč! 
[118:16] Gospodova desnica je vzdignjena; Gospodova desnica dela junaško in dosega moč! 
[118:17] Ne bom umrl, temveč bom živel in bom razglašal |Gospodova| dela in našteval sijajna Gospodova dela. 
[118:18] Gospod me je boleče kaznoval, toda On me ni predal smrti.  
[118:19] Odprite mi [tempeljske] duri pravičnosti; vstopil bom skoznje in priznal bom ter hvalil Gospoda. 
[118:20] To so Gospodova vrata; [brezkompromisno] pravični bo vstopil skoznje.  
[118:21] Jaz bom priznal, hvalil in se Ti zahvaljeval, kajti Ti si me slišal in mi odgovoril; in Ti si postal rešitelj moje duše in osvoboditelj. 
[118:22] Kamen, ki so ga zidarji zavrnili, je postal glavni vogalni kamen. 
[118:23] To je od Gospoda in je Njegovo delo; to je čudovito v naših očeh.  
[118:24] To je dan, ki ga je Gospod privedel naokrog; radostili se bomo in bili veseli v njem. 
[118:25] Reši sedaj, rotimo Te, o Gospod; pošlji blaginjo sedaj, o Gospod, rotimo Te in daj nam uspeh! 
[118:26] Blagoslovljen je kdor prihaja v Gospodovem imenu; blagoslavljamo vas iz Gospodove hiše, [vas, ki prihajate v Njegovo svetišče pod Njegovim varstvom].  
[118:27] Gospod je Bog, ki nam je pokazal in nam dal svetlobo, [On nas je razsvetlil z milostjo, svobodo in radostjo]. Okrasite praznovanje z ozelenelimi vejami in zvežite žrtve, da bodo darovane z debelimi vezmi [po vsem duhovniškem dvorišču, prav do] oltarnih rogov. 
[118:28] Ti si moj Bog in priznal bom |Tebe|, hvalil |Tebe| in se zahvaljeval Tebi; Ti si moj Bog; jaz Te bom povzdigoval. 
[118:29] O zahvaljujte se Gospodu, kajti On je dober; kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[119:1] BLAGOSLOVLJENI, (VESELI, srečni, zavidanja vredni) so neomadeževani, (pokončni, resnično iskreni in brez krivde) na poti [razodete Božje volje], ki hodijo, (usmerjajo svoja dejanja in pogovore) v Gospodovi postavi, (celotni Božji razodeti volji). 
[119:2] Blagoslovljeni, (veseli, srečni, zavidanja vredni) so tisti, ki ohranjajo Njegova pričevanja in ki iščejo, povprašujejo po |Njem| in o Njem in Ga z vsem srcem nujno potrebujejo. 
[119:3] Da, nobene nepravičnosti ne storijo, [nobenega namernega oddaljevanja od Njegovih predpisov]; hodijo po Njegovih poteh.  
[119:4] Ti si nam ukazal, da ohranjamo Tvoje predpise, da naj bi jih prizadevno izpolnjevali. 
[119:5] Oh, da bi bile moje poti vodene in postavljene, da bi izpolnjeval Tvoje zakone [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]! 
[119:6] Potem ne bi bil osramočen [s tem, da ne bi uspel podedovati Tvojih obljub], ko imam spoštovanje do vseh Tvojih zapovedi. 
[119:7] Hvalil |Te| bom in se Ti zahvaljeval z iskrenostjo srca, ko se [s posvečenimi izkušnjami] naučim Tvojih pravičnih sodb, [Tvojih odločitev proti in kaznimi za določene načine misli in dejanj]. 
[119:8] Ohranjal bom Tvoje zakone; o ne zapusti me popolnoma. 
[119:9] Kako naj mladi mož očisti svojo pot? S previdnostjo in straženjem [sebe] glede na Tvojo besedo, [prilagajanjem svojega življenja njej]. 
[119:10] S svojim celotnim srcem sem Te iskal, povpraševal po |Tebi| in o Tebi in hrepenel po Tebi; oh, naj ne tavam ali stopim vstran, [ali v nevednosti ali hote], od Tvojih zapovedi.  
[119:11] Tvojo besedo sem položil v svoje srce, da ne bi grešil proti Tebi. 
[119:12] Blagoslovljen si Ti, o Gospod; uči me Svojih zakonov. 
[119:13] S svojimi ustnicami sem razglašal in pripovedoval vse odloke Tvojih ust. 
[119:14] Radostil sem se na poteh Tvojih pričevanj, toliko kot v vseh bogastvih. 
[119:15] Premišljeval bom o Tvojih predpisih in imel spoštovanje do Tvojih poti, [stezah življenja zaznamovanih s Tvojo postavo].  
[119:16] Razveseljeval se bom v Tvojih zakonih; ne bom pozabil Tvoje besede. 
[119:17] Radodarno ravnaj s Svojim služabnikom, da bom lahko živel; in bom izpolnjeval Tvojo besedo [z njenim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem].  
[119:18] Odpri mi oči, da bom lahko zagledal čudovite stvari iz Tvoje postave. 
[119:19] Jaz sem tujec in začasen prebivalec na zemlji; Svojih zapovedi ne skrij pred menoj.  
[119:20] Moje srce se lomi od hrepenenja, ki ga ima po Tvojih odlokih in sodbah ob vseh časih. 
[119:21] Ti grajaš ponosne in domišljave, preklete, ki se motijo in zaidejo od Tvojih zapovedi. 
[119:22] Vzemi od mene očitke in prezir, kajti ohranjam Tvoja pričevanja. 
[119:23] Princi so prav tako sedeli in govorili zoper mene, toda Tvoj služabnik je razmišljal o Tvojih zakonih. 
[119:24] Prav tako so tvoja pričevanja moje zadovoljstvo in moji svetovalci. 
[119:25] Moje zemeljsko življenje se lepi na prah; oživi in spodbudi me glede na Svojo besedo!  
[119:26] Navedel sem svoje poti in Ti razkril svoje bolečine in Ti si me poslušal; uči me Svojih zakonov. 
[119:27] Daj mi, da razumem pot Tvojih jasnih navodil; tako bom razmišljal o |Tvojih čudežnih delih| in govoril o Tvojih čudežnih delih.  
[119:28] Moje življenje se raztaplja in neprenehoma joka zaradi bremena; vzdigni me in me okrepi glede na [obljube iz] Tvoje besede. 
[119:29] Od mene odstrani pot hinavstva in nezvestobe [Tebi] in mi milostljivo podeli Svojo postavo. 
[119:30] Izbral sem pot resnice in zvestobe; Tvoje odloke sem postavil predse. 
[119:31] Trdno se držim Tvojih pričevanj; o Gospod, ne osramoti me! 
[119:32] [Ne zgolj hodil, temveč] tekel bom po poti Tvojih zapovedi, ko mi Ti daš voljno srce. 
[119:33] Uči me, o Gospod, pot Tvojih zakonov in [neomajno] jo bom ohranil do konca. 
[119:34] Daj mi razumevanje, da lahko ohranim Tvojo postavo; da, izpolnjeval jo bom z vsem svojim srcem.  
[119:35] Primoraj me iti po stezah Tvojih zapovedi, kajti v njih se razveseljujem. 
[119:36] Nagni moje srce k Tvojim pričevanjem in ne k pohlepnosti, (tatvinam, čutnosti, brezvrednim bogastvom).  
[119:37] Moje oči obrni stran od gledanja ničnosti, (malikov in malikovanja); in obnovi me h krepkemu življenju in zdravju na Tvojih poteh. 
[119:38] Postavi Svojo besedo in potrdi Svojo obljubo Svojemu služabniku, ki je za tiste, ki se Te častitljivo bojijo in predano obožujejo.  
[119:39] Odvrni mojo grajo, ki se jo bojim in strahujem, kajti Tvoji odloki so dobri. 
[119:40] Poglej, hrepenim po Tvojih jasnih navodilih; v Svoji pravičnosti mi daj prerojeno življenje. 
[119:41] Naj Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost prav tako prideta k meni, o Gospod, celo Tvoja rešitev duše, glede na Tvojo obljubo; 
[119:42] potem bom imel odgovor za tiste, ki se mi rogajo in mi očitajo, kajti naslanjam se na |Tvojo besedo|, zanašam na |Tvojo besedo| in zaupam v Tvojo besedo. 
[119:43] In iz mojih ust ne vzemi popolnoma besede resnice, kajti jaz upam v Tvoje odloke. 
[119:44] Neprenehoma bom ohranjal Tvojo postavo, za vedno in večno, [z njenim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:45] Hodil bom svobodno in sproščeno, kajti iskal sem in povpraševal po |Tvojih jasnih navodilih| [in obupno zahteval] Tvoja jasna navodila. 
[119:46] Prav tako bom pred kralji govoril o Tvojih pričevanjih in ne bom osramočen.  
[119:47] Kajti jaz se bom razveseljeval v Tvojih zapovedih, katere ljubim. 
[119:48] Prav tako bom svoje roke dvigal [v goreči ponižni prošnji] k Tvojim zapovedim, katere ljubim in premišljeval bom o Tvojih zakonih. 
[119:49] [Strastno] se spominjaj besede in obljube Svojemu služabniku, v katero si me Ti primoral upati. 
[119:50] To je moja tolažba in opora v mojem trpljenju: da me je Tvoja beseda oživila in mi dala življenje.  
[119:51] Ponosni me je silno zasmehoval, pa vendar nisem pojemal v svojem zanimanju za |Tvojo postavo| ali se obrnil vstran od Tvoje postave. 
[119:52] Ko sem se [iskreno] spominjal Tvojih odlokov od davno, o Gospod, sem se potolažil. 
[119:53] Goreče ogorčenje, groza in žalost me grabijo zaradi zlobnih, ki zapuščajo Tvojo postavo. 
[119:54] Tvoji zakoni so bili moje pesmi v hiši mojega popotovanja. 
[119:55] [Iskreno] sem se spominjal Tvojega imena, o Gospod, ponoči in izpolnjeval sem Tvojo postavo. 
[119:56] To sem imel [kot dar Tvoje milosti in kot svojo nagrado]: da sem ohranil Tvoja jasna navodila [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:57] Ti si moj delež, o Gospod; obljubil sem, da bom ohranjal Tvoje besede. 
[119:58] Z vsem svojim srcem sem milo prosil Tvoje naklonjenosti; bodi mi usmiljen in milostljiv glede na Svojo obljubo. 
[119:59] Pretehtal sem svoje poti; obrnil sem svoja stopala, da bi [ubogal] Tvoja pričevanja. 
[119:60] Pohitel sem in nisem odlašal, da bi ohranjal Tvoje zapovedi. 
[119:61] Čeprav so me obdale vrvi zlobnih in me ujele v zanko, nisem pozabil Tvoje postave. 
[119:62] Opolnoči se bom dvignil, da Ti dam zahvalo zaradi Tvojih pravičnih odlokov. 
[119:63] Jaz sem družabnik vseh tistih, ki se bojijo, častijo in Te obožujejo in tistih, ki pazijo in dajejo prednost Tvojim jasnim navodilom. 
[119:64] Zemlja, o Gospod, je polna Tvojega usmiljenja in ljubeče-skrbnosti; uči me Svojih zakonov. 
[119:65] Ti si dobro ravnal s Svojim služabnikom, o Gospod, glede na Svojo obljubo. 
[119:66] Uči me dobrega presojanja, modre in pravilne razsodnosti in spoznanja, kajti jaz sem verjel, (zaupal, se zanašal na |Tvoje zapovedi| in se oklepal) Tvojih zapovedi. 
[119:67] Preden sem bil prizadet, sem zgrešil pot, toda sedaj ohranjam Tvojo besedo [z njenim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:68] Ti si dober in prijazen in delaš dobro; uči me Svojih zakonov. 
[119:69] Domišljavi in brezbožni sta zoper mene skupaj postavila laž, toda jaz bom z vsem svojim srcem ohranjal Tvoja jasna navodila. 
[119:70] Njihova srca so zamaščena kakor loj, [njihovi umi so otopeli in surovi], toda jaz se razveseljujem v Tvoji postavi. 
[119:71] Dobro je zame, da sem bil prizadet, da bi se mogoče naučil Tvojih zakonov. 
[119:72] Postava iz Tvojih ust je zame boljša kakor na tisoče zlatnikov in srebrnikov. 
[119:73] Tvoje roke so me naredile, me vešče oblikovale in postavile; dajejo mi razumevanje, da se lahko učim Tvojih zapovedi. 
[119:74] Tisti, ki se Te s čaščenjem in oboževanjem bojijo, me bodo videli in bili veseli, kajti upal sem v Tvojo besedo in čakal nanjo. 
[119:75] Vem, o Gospod, da so Tvoje sodbe pravilne in pravične in da si me v zvestobi Ti prizadel.  
[119:76] Prosim Te, naj bo Tvoja usmiljena ljubeznivost in neomajna ljubezen za mojo tolažbo, glede na Tvojo obljubo Svojemu služabniku. 
[119:77] Naj Tvoje nežno usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost prideta k meni, da bom lahko živel, kajti Tvoja postava je moje veselje! 
[119:78] Naj bodo ponosni osramočeni, kajti z menoj so izprijeno ravnali brez razloga; toda jaz bom premišljeval o Tvojih jasnih navodilih. 
[119:79] Naj se tisti, ki se Te častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo, obrnejo k meni in tisti, ki so spoznali Tvoja pričevanja. 
[119:80] Naj bo moje srce krepko, (iskreno in celostno ter neoporečno) v Tvojih zakonih, da jaz ne bi bil osramočen. 
[119:81] Moja duša medli in slabi za Tvojo rešitvijo duše, toda jaz upam v Tvojo besedo. 
[119:82] Moje oči odpovedujejo, ko gledajo za [izpolnitvijo] Tvoje obljube. Jaz pravim: "Kdaj me boš Ti potolažil?" 
[119:83] Kajti postal sem kakor steklenica, (počrnel in zguban ter posušen vinski meh) v dimu, [v katerem le-ta visi] in vendar ne pozabim Tvojih zakonov. 
[119:84] Kako številni so dnevi Tvojega služabnika, [ki jih mora vzdržati]? Kdaj boš Ti sodil tiste, ki me zasledujejo in preganjajo?  
[119:85] Brezbožneži in domišljavci so zame izkopali jame, ljudje, ki ne soglašajo s Tvojo postavo. 
[119:86] Vse Tvoje zapovedi so zveste in zanesljive. [Brezbožneži] me zasledujejo in preganjajo s hinavščino; pomagaj mi [Gospod]! 
[119:87] Na zemlji so me skoraj použili, toda jaz nisem zapustil Tvojih navodil. 
[119:88] Glede na Svojo neomajno ljubezen mi daj življenje; potem bom ohranil pričevanje Tvojih ust [z njegovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:89] Za vedno, o Gospod, je Tvoja beseda postavljena v nebesih, [stoji trdno kakor podaljšek nebes].  
[119:90] Tvoja zvestoba je od roda do roda; Ti si postavil zemljo in le-ta trdno stoji. 
[119:91] Vsi, [celotno vesolje], so Tvoji služabniki; zato ta dan obstajajo glede na Tvoje odloke.  
[119:92] Razen če ne bi bila Tvoja postava moje zadovoljstvo, bi izginil v svojem trpljenju. 
[119:93] Nikoli ne bom pozabil Tvojih navodil, [kako bi jih lahko?], kajti po njih si me Ti pohitril, (mi zagotovil življenje). 
[119:94] Jaz sem Tvoj, zatorej me reši [Svojega lastnega]; kajti iskal sem, (povpraševal o |Tvojih navodilih| in po) Tvojih navodilih in jih zahteval [kakor svojo nujno potrebo].  
[119:95] Zlobni čakajo name, da me uničijo, toda jaz bom preudarjal Tvoja pričevanja. 
[119:96] Videl sem, da ima vse [človeško] svoje meje in konec, [ni pomembno kako daleč segajoče, plemenito in odlično]; toda Tvoja zapoved je izredno široka in se razširja brez omejitev [v večnost].  
[119:97] Oh, kako ljubim Tvojo postavo! Ona je ves dan moje premišljevanje.  
[119:98] Zaradi Svojih zapovedi me Ti naredi modrejšega od mojih sovražnikov, kajti [Tvoje besede] so vedno pred menoj. 
[119:99] Imam boljše razumevanje in globlji uvid, kakor vsi moji učitelji, ker so Tvoja pričevanja moje premišljevanje.  
[119:100] Razumem več kakor ostareli, ker ohranjam Tvoja navodila [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:101] Svoja stopala sem zadržal pred vsako hudobno potjo, da lahko ohranjam Tvojo besedo [z njenim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem].  
[119:102] Nisem se obrnil stran od Tvojih odlokov, kajti Ti sam si me učil. 
[119:103] Kako sladke so Tvoje besede mojemu okusu, slajše od medu mojim ustom!  
[119:104] Zaradi Tvojih navodil prejemam razumevanje; zato sovražim vsako lažno pot. 
[119:105] Tvoja beseda je svetlka mojim stopalom in svetloba moji stezi.  
[119:106] Zatrjeval sem [s prisego] in to potrdil, da bom ohranjal Tvoje pravične odloke [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem].  
[119:107] Sem boleče prizadet; prenovi in pohitri me, [daj mi življenje], o Gospod, glede na Svojo besedo! 
[119:108] Rotim Te, sprejmi prostovoljne daritve mojih ust, o Gospod in uči me Svojih odlokov.  
[119:109] Moje življenje je nenehno v moji roki, pa vendar ne pozabljam Tvoje postave. 
[119:110] Zlobni so zame položili zanko in vendar ne zaidem od Tvojih navodil. 
[119:111] Tvoja pričevanja sem vzel kot dediščino za vedno, kajti le-ta so radost mojega srca.  
[119:112] Nagnil sem svoje srce, da bi Tvoje zakone izvajal za vedno, celo do konca. 
[119:113] Sovražim misli oklevajočih [v veri], neodločnih ljudi, toda ljubim Tvojo postavo. 
[119:114] Ti si moje skrivališče in moj ščit; upam v Tvojo besedo.  
[119:115] Ločite se od mene, vi hudobneži, da lahko ohranim zapovedi svojega Boga [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem].  
[119:116] Podpiraj me glede na Svojo obljubo, da bom lahko živel; in naj v svojem upanju ne bom osramočen!  
[119:117] Drži me pokonci, da bom lahko varen in |bom| imel nenehno spoštovanje do Tvojih zakonov! 
[119:118] Ti preziraš in daješ v nič vse tiste, ki zaidejo od Tvojih zakonov, kajti njihovo lastno laganje jih zavaja in njihove prevare so zaman. 
[119:119] Ti odstranjaš in smatraš kot žlindro vse zlobne na zemlji, [kajti v njih ni resnične kovine]; zato ljubim Tvoja pričevanja. 
[119:120] Moje meso trepeta in drhti zaradi strahu in častitljivega, obožujočega strahospoštovanja do Tebe in bojim se |Tvojih sodb| in groza me je Tvojih sodb. 
[119:121] Izvajal sem pravico in pravičnost; ne prepusti me tistim, ki bi me zatirali. 
[119:122] Bodi porok za Svojega služabnika v dobro, [kakor je bil Juda gotovost za varnost Benjamina]; ne pusti, da me ponosni zatirajo.  
[119:123] Moje oči odpovedujejo, ko oprezam za Tvojo odločitvijo in izpolnitvijo Tvoje pravične obljube. 
[119:124] S Svojim služabnikom ravnaj glede na Svoje usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost in me uči Svojih zakonov. 
[119:125] Jaz sem Tvoj služabnik; daj mi razumevanje, (razsodnost in doumevanje), da bom lahko spoznal, (razločeval in bil seznanjen z naravo) Tvojih pričevanj. 
[119:126] Čas je za Gospoda, da ukrepa; onemogočili so Tvojo postavo. 
[119:127] Zato ljubim Tvoje zapovedi bolj kakor [sijajno] zlato, da, bolj kakor [popolnoma] prečiščeno zlato. 
[119:128] Zato ocenjujem kot pravilna vsa, da, vsa Tvoja navodila; sovražim vsako lažno pot. 
[119:129] Tvoja pričevanja so čudovita, [daleč presegajo karkoli spočetega po človeku]; zato jih moj [spokorniški] jaz ohranja [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:130] Vstop in razkrivanje Tvojih besed daje luč; njihovo razkrivanje daje preprostemu razumevanje, (razločevanje in doumevanje). 
[119:131] Odprl sem svoja usta in [z vneto željo] koprnel, kajti hrepenel sem po Tvojih zapovedih. 
[119:132] Poglej name, bodi mi usmiljen in mi pokaži naklonjenost, kakor je Tvoja pot tistim, ki ljubijo Tvoje ime. 
[119:133] Postavi moje stopinje in jih vodi [s sredstvi] Svoje besede; naj kakršnakoli krivičnost ne vlada nad menoj. 
[119:134] Osvobodi me pred človeškim zatiranjem; tako bom ohranil Tvoja navodila [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem].  
[119:135] Naj Tvoj obraz sije [z zadovoljstvom] nad Tvojim služabnikom in uči me Svojih zakonov.  
[119:136] Potoki vodá tečejo vzdolž mojih oči, ker možje ne ohranjajo Tvoje postave, [je ne slišijo, je ne sprejmejo, ne ljubijo, oziroma je ne ubogajo]. 
[119:137] [Neupogljivo] pravičen si Ti, o Gospod in iskrene so Tvoje sodbe in vsa izražanja Tvoje volje. 
[119:138] Ti si zapovedal in določil Tvoja pričevanja v pravičnosti in veliki zvestobi. 
[119:139] Moja gorečnost me je použila in me odrezala, ker so moji nasprotniki pozabili Tvoje besede. 
[119:140] Tvoja beseda je zelo čista, (preizkušena in dobro prečiščena); zato jo Tvoj služabnik ljubi. 
[119:141] Majhen sem, (nepomemben) in preziran, toda ne pozabljam Tvojih navodil. 
[119:142] Tvoja pravičnost je večna pravičnost in Tvoja postava je resnica.  
[119:143] Stiska in tesnoba sta me našli ter me prevzeli, pa vendar so Tvoje zapovedi moje veselje. 
[119:144] Tvoja pravična pričevanja so večna in Tvoji odloki so zavezujoči za večno; daj mi razumevanje in bom živel, [daj mi razločevanje in doumevanje in ne bom umrl]. 
[119:145] Klical sem z vsem svojim srcem; sliši me, o Gospod; ohranjal bom Tvoje zakone, [slišal, sprejel, ljubil in ubogal jih bom]. 
[119:146] Klical sem k Tebi; reši me, da lahko ohranjam Tvoja pričevanja [z njihovim poslušanjem, sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]. 
[119:147] Slutil sem svitanje jutra in klical [v molitvi podobni otroški]; upal sem v Tvojo besedo. 
[119:148] Moje oči so slutile nočne straže in jaz sem buden pred klicem stražarja, da lahko premišljujem o Tvoji besedi. 
[119:149] Usliši moj glas glede na Svojo neomajno ljubezen; o Gospod, pohitri me in mi daj življenje glede na Svoje [pravične] odloke. 
[119:150] Blizu so prišli tisti, ki sledijo napačnemu mišljenju in me preganjajo z zlobnostjo; daleč so od Tvoje postave. 
[119:151] Ti si blizu, o Gospod, [bliže meni kakor moji sovražniki] in vse Tvoje zapovedi so resnica. 
[119:152] Od davnine sem poznal Tvoja pričevanja in za dolgo časa, [zato je temeljito osnovano prepričanje], da si jih Ti ustanovil za vedno.  
[119:153] Preudari moje trpljenje in me osvobodi, kajti ne pozabljam Tvoje postave. 
[119:154] Zagovarjaj mojo stvar in me odkupi; oživi me in mi daj življenje glede na Svojo besedo. 
[119:155] Rešitev duš je daleč od zlobnih, kajti ne iščejo, niti niso lačni Tvojih zakonov. 
[119:156] Veliki sta Tvoje nežno usmiljenje in Tvoja ljubeča-skrbnost, o Gospod; daj mi življenje glede na Svoje odloke. 
[119:157] Številni so moji preganjalci in moji nasprotniki, vendar ne odstopim od Tvojih pričevanj. 
[119:158] Gledam izdajalce in sem užaloščen in gnusijo se mi, ker ne spoštujejo Tvoje postave, [niti je ne poslušajo, ne sprejemajo, ne ljubijo, niti je ne ubogajo]. 
[119:159] Pretehtaj kako ljubim Tvoja navodila; oživi me in mi daj življenje, o Gospod, glede na Svojo ljubečo-skrbnost! 
[119:160] Skupek Tvoje besede je resnica, [celota popolnega pomena vseh Tvojih posamičnih navodil]; in vsak izmed Tvojih pravičnih odlokov vzdrži za vedno. 
[119:161] Princi me zasledujejo in preganjajo brez vzroka, toda moje srce stoji v strahospoštovanju do Tvojih besed, [strašno me je groza njihove kršitve, veliko bolj kot sile princa ali oblastnika].  
[119:162] Radostim se ob Tvoji besedi, kakor nekdo, ki je našel velik plen. 
[119:163] Sovražim in zaničujem hinavstvo, toda ljubim Tvojo postavo. 
[119:164] Sedemkrat na dan in skozi ves dan Te hvalim zaradi Tvojih pravičnih odlokov. 
[119:165] Velik mir imajo tisti, ki ljubijo Tvojo postavo; nič jih ne bo prizadelo ali jim povzročilo, da se spotaknejo.  
[119:166] Upam in [željno] čakam na Tvojo rešitev duše, o Gospod in Tvoje zapovedi izpolnjujem.  
[119:167] Tvoja pričevanja sem ohranil [z njihovim poslušanjem, s sprejemanjem, ljubeznijo in uboganjem]; izredno jih ljubim! 
[119:168] Izpolnjeval sem Tvoja navodila in Tvoja pričevanja, kajti vse moje poti so [popolnoma znane] pred Teboj. 
[119:169] Naj moj žalosten jok in ponižna prošnja prideta [blizu] pred Tebe, o Gospod; daj mi razumevanje, (razločevanje in doumevanje), glede na Svojo besedo [jamstva in obljube]. 
[119:170] Naj moja ponižna prošnja pride pred Tebe; osvobodi me po Svoji besedi! 
[119:171] Moje ustnice bodo izlivale hvalo [z zahvaljevanjem in obnovljenim zaupanjem], ko me Ti učiš Svojih zakonov. 
[119:172] Moj jezik bo pel, [hvalil zaradi izpolnitve] Tvoje besede, kajti vse Tvoje zapovedi so pravične. 
[119:173] Naj bo Tvoja roka pripravljena, da mi pomaga, kajti izbral sem Tvoja navodila. 
[119:174] Hrepenel sem po Tvoji rešitvi duše, o Gospod in Tvoja postava je moje zadovoljstvo. 
[119:175] Naj živim, da Te bom lahko hvalil in naj mi pomagajo Tvoji odloki. 
[119:176] Zablodil sem kakor izgubljena ovca; išči, povprašuj po |Svojem služabniku| in zahtevaj Svojega služabnika, kajti Tvojih zapovedi ne pozabljam.  
[120:1]  V SVOJI stiski sem klical h Gospodu in On mi je odgovoril. 
[120:2] Osvobodi me, o Gospod, pred lažnivimi ustnicami in varljivimi jeziki. 
[120:3] Kaj naj bi ti bilo dano? Ali kaj več naj bi bilo storjeno zate, ti varljiv jezik? – 
[120:4] Ostre puščice [mogočnega] bojevnika, z [žarečim] ogljem brinovega drevesa! 
[120:5] Gorje meni, da začasno bivam z Mešehom, da prebivam poleg kedárskih šotorov, [kakor če bi bil med razvpitim divjim ljudstvom]!  
[120:6] Moje življenje je predolgo imelo svoje prebivanje s tistim, ki sovraži mir. 
[120:7] Jaz sem za mir; toda ko spregovorim, so oni za vojno. 
[121:1]  SVOJE oči bom dvigal h gričem [okrog Jeruzalema, k sveti gori Sion in gori Moríja] – odkod bo prišla moja pomoč?  
[121:2] Moja pomoč prihaja od Gospoda, ki je naredil nebesa in zemljo. 
[121:3] On ne bo dopustil, da bi tvoje stopalo zdrsnilo ali bilo premaknjeno; On, ki te ohranja, ne bo dremal.  
[121:4] Poglej, On, ki ohranja Izraela, ne bo ne dremal ne spal. 
[121:5] Gospod je Tvoj varuh; Gospod je tvoja senca na tvoji desni roki, [na strani, ki ne nosi ščita].  
[121:6] Sonce te ne bo udarilo podnevi, niti luna ponoči.  
[121:7] Gospod te bo varoval pred vsem hudim; On bo ohranjal tvoje življenje. 
[121:8] Gospod bo varoval tvoje izhode in tvoje prihode od tega časa naprej in na veke vekov.  
[122:1]  BIL SEM vesel, ko so mi rekli: "Pojdimo v hišo Gospodovo."  
[122:2] Naša stopala stojijo pred tvojimi duri, o Jeruzalem! – 
[122:3] Jeruzalem, ki je zgrajen kakor mesto, ki je strnjeno skupaj – 
[122:4] kamor gredo rodovi, celo Gospodovi rodovi, kot je bilo odrejeno in kot pričevanje za Izrael, da bi dali zahvalo Gospodovemu imenu. 
[122:5] Kajti tam so bili postavljeni prestoli sodbe, prestoli Davidove hiše. 
[122:6] Molite za mir Jeruzalema! Naj uspevajo tisti, ki te ljubijo, [sveto mesto]! 
[122:7] Naj bo mir znotraj tvojih zidov in blaginja znotraj tvojih palač! 
[122:8] Zaradi mojih bratov in služabnikov bom sedaj rekel: "V tebi naj bo Mir!" 
[122:9] Zaradi hiše Gospoda, našega Boga, bom iskal, povpraševal po |tvojem dobru| in zahteval tvoje dobro. 
[123:1]  K TEBI vzdigujem svoje oči, o Ti, ki prestoluješ v nebesih. 
[123:2] Poglej, kakor oči služabnikov gledajo roko svojega gospodarja in kakor oči dekle k roki svoje gospodarice, tako naše oči gledajo h Gospodu, našemu Bogu, dokler ima On za nas usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost. 
[123:3] Usmili se nas, o Gospod, za nas imej usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost, kajti mi smo pretirano prenasičeni z zaničevanjem. 
[123:4] Naše življenje je pretirano napolnjeno z zaničevanjem in posmehovanjem tistih, ki so brezskrbni in z zaničevanjem ponosnih (neodgovornih tiranov, ki ne spoštujejo Božje postave). 
[124:1]  ČE ne bi bilo Gospoda, ki je bil na naši strani – sedaj lahko reče Izrael – 
[124:2] če ne bi bilo Gospoda, ki je bil na naši strani, ko so se ljudje vzdignili zoper nas, 
[124:3] potem bi nas hitro pogoltnili žive, ko je bil njihov bes razvnet zoper nas; 
[124:4] potem bi nas vode preplavile in nas odnesle, hudournik bi šel preko nas; 
[124:5] potem bi ponosne vode šle preko nas. 
[124:6] Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod, ki nas ni dal kot plen v njihove zobe! 
[124:7] Mi smo kakor ptica, ki je zbežala iz zanke ptičarjev; zanka je pretrgana in mi smo ušli! 
[124:8] Naša pomoč je v imenu Gospoda, ki je naredil nebesa in zemljo. 
[125:1]  TISTI, KI zaupajo v |Gospoda|, se zanašajo na |Gospoda| in prepričano upajo v Gospoda, so kakor gora Sion, ki ne more biti omajana, temveč ostaja in stoji trdna za vedno. 
[125:2] Kakor gore obdajajo Jeruzalem, tako Gospod obdaja Svoje ljudstvo od tega časa dalje in za vedno. 
[125:3] Kajti žezlo zlobnosti ne bo počivalo na zemlji [brezkompromisno] pravičnih, da ne bi pravični (Božje ljudstvo), iztegnili svojih rok h krivičnosti in odpadništvu. 
[125:4] Delaj dobro, o Gospod, tistim, ki so dobri in tistim, ki so v svojih srcih pravi [s Teboj in vsemi ljudmi]. 
[125:5] Glede takih, ki se obračajo vstran, k njihovim sprijenim potem [brezbrižnosti do Boga], jih bo Gospod vodil naprej z delavci krivičnosti. Mir naj bo nad Izraelom! 
[126:1]  KO je Gospod privedel nazaj ujetnike, [ki so se vrnili] na Sion, smo bili kakor tisti, ki sanjajo, [videti je bilo tako neresnično].  
[126:2] Takrat so bila naša usta napolnjena s smehom in naši jeziki s petjem. Takrat so med narodi govorili: "Gospod je zanje storil velike stvari." 
[126:3] Gospod je za nas storil velike stvari! Veseli smo! 
[126:4] Obrni naše ujetništvo v svobodo in obnovi naše usode, o Gospod, kakor so izviri na Jugu (Negeba) [obnovljeni s hudourniki]. 
[126:5] Tisti, ki sejejo v solzah, bodo želi v radosti in petju. 
[126:6] Kdor nosi naprej seme in joka [nad tem, da potrebuje svojo dragoceno zalogo žita za setev], bo brez dvoma ponovno prišel z radostjo, nesoč svoje snope s seboj. 
[127:1]  RAZEN, če Gospod ne zida hiše, zaman delajo tisti, ki jo gradijo; razen če Gospod ne varuje mesta, stražar bedi le brez koristi.  
[127:2] Brez koristi zate je, da vstajaš zgodaj, da greš počivat pozno, da ješ kruh [napornega] dela – kajti On daje [blagoslove] Svojim ljubljenim v spanju. 
[127:3] Poglej, otroci so dediščina od Gospoda, sad maternice nagrada.  
[127:4] Kakor so puščice v roki bojevnika, tako so otroci tvoje mladosti. 
[127:5] Vesel, blagoslovljen in srečen je človek, čigar tul je napolnjen z njimi! Oni ne bodo osramočeni, ko bodo govorili s svojimi nasprotniki [v zborih] pri [mestnih] durih. 
[128:1]  BLAGOSLOVLJEN, (VESEL, srečen, zavidanja vreden) je vsak, ki se boji, časti in obožuje Gospoda, ki hodi po Njegovih poteh in živi v skladu z Njegovimi zapovedmi.  
[128:2] Kajti ti boš jedel [sad] dela svojih rok; vesel, (blagoslovljen, srečen, zavidljiv) boš in dobro bo s teboj. 
[128:3] Tvoja žena bo kakor rodovitna trta v najnotranjejših delih tvoje hiše; tvoji otroci bodo kakor oljčne sadike okrog tvoje mize. 
[128:4] Poglej, tako bo blagoslovljen človek, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče boji Gospoda. 
[128:5] Naj te Gospod blagoslovi s Siona, [Njegovega svetišča] in naj vse dni svojega življenja vidiš razcvet Jeruzalema; 
[128:6] da, naj vidiš svojih otrok otroke. Mir naj bo nad Izraelom! 
[129:1]  POGOSTO in zelo so me žalostili od moje mladosti – naj Izrael sedaj reče – 
[129:2] pogosto in zelo so me žalostili od moje mladosti, pa vendar proti meni niso prevladali. 
[129:3] Orači so orali na mojem hrbtu; svoje brazde so naredili dolge. 
[129:4] Gospod je [brezkompromisno] pravičen; On je presekal debele vrvi, s katerimi so [nas] zlobni [usužnjili]. 
[129:5] Naj bodo vsi osramočeni in zavrnjeni tisti, ki sovražijo Sion. 
[129:6] Naj bodo kakor trava na strehi, ki ovene preden zraste, 
[129:7] s katero si kosec ne napolni svoje roke, niti vezalec snopov svojega naročja – 
[129:8] dokler tisti, ki gredo mimo, ne rečejo: "Gospodov blagoslov naj bo nad vami! Blagoslavljamo vas v Gospodovem imenu!" 
[130:1]  VEN IZ globin sem klical k Tebi, o Gospod. 
[130:2] Gospod, sliši moj glas; naj bodo Tvoja ušesa pozorna na glas mojih ponižnih prošenj. 
[130:3] Če bi ti, Gospod, vodil račun o |grehih| in ravnal [z nami glede na naše] grehe, o Gospod, kdo bi lahko obstal?  
[130:4] Toda s Teboj je odpuščanje, [prav to, kar človek potrebuje], da bi se Te lahko častitljivo bali in Te oboževali.  
[130:5] Čakam na Gospoda, pričakujoče čakam in v Njegovo besedo upam. 
[130:6] Iščem in čakam na Gospoda, bolj kakor stražar na jutro, pravim, bolj kakor stražar na jutro. 
[130:7] O Izrael, upaj v Gospoda! Kajti z Gospodom je usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost in z Njim je obilje odkupnine. 
[130:8] In On bo odkupil Izraela iz vseh njihovih krivd. 
[131:1]  GOSPOD, MOJE srce ni ošabno, niti moje oči niso vzvišene; niti se ne ukvarjam s stvarmi, ki so prevelike ali s stvarmi, ki so zame prečudovite. 
[131:2] Zagotovo sem umiril in utišal svojo dušo; kakor odstavljen otrok s svojo materjo, kakor odstavljen otrok je moja duša znotraj mene, [prenehala je skrbeti]. 
[131:3] O Izrael, upaj v Gospoda od tega časa dalje in za vedno. 
[132:1]  GOSPOD, [iskreno] se spominjaj Davidovih zaslug, vseh njegovih ponižanj in nadlog in vzdržljivosti – 
[132:2] kako je prisegel Gospodu in se zavezal Mogočnemu Jakobovemu: 
[132:3] "Zagotovo ne bom vstopil v svojo hišo bivanja ali šel v svojo posteljo – 
[132:4] svojim očem ne bom dopustil, da bi spale ali mojim vekam, da bi dremale, 
[132:5] dokler nisem našel kraja za Gospoda, prebivališča za Mogočnega Jakobovega."  
[132:6] Poglej, ob Efráti smo [najprej] slišali o [najdeni skrinji]; našli smo jo na gozdnih poljih [pri Kirját Jearímu].  
[132:7] Naj gremo v Njegovo svetišče; naj obožujemo ob Njegovi pručki. 
[132:8] Vzdigni se, o Gospod, k Svojemu počivališču, Ti in skrinja, [znamenje] Tvoje moči. 
[132:9] Naj bodo Tvoji duhovniki oblečeni s pravičnostjo, (pravilnim življenjem in pravilnim odnosom z Bogom); in naj Tvoji sveti vzklikajo od radosti! 
[132:10] Zaradi Svojega služabnika Davida, ne obrni proč obraza Svojega maziljenca in ne zavrni Svojega lastnega kralja. 
[132:11] Gospod je prisegel Davidu v resnici; On se od njega ne bo odvrnil: "Enega izmed sadov tvojega telesa bom postavil na tvoj prestol.  
[132:12] Če bodo tvoji otroci ohranili Mojo zavezo in Moje pričevanje, katerega jih bom Jaz učil, bodo tudi njihovi otroci za vedno sedeli na tvojem prestolu." 
[132:13] Kajti Gospod je izbral Sion, On si ga je zaželel za Svoje prebivališče: 
[132:14] "To je Moj kraj počitka za vedno," [govori Gospod], "tukaj bom Jaz prebival, kajti Jaz sem si ga zaželel. 
[132:15] Jaz bom zagotovo in obilno blagoslovil njeno preskrbo; Jaz bom njene uboge zadovoljil s kruhom. 
[132:16] Prav tako bom njene duhovnike Jaz oblekel z rešitvijo duš in njeni sveti bodo od radosti glasno vzklikali. 
[132:17] Tam bom Jaz storil, da bo Davidu pognal rog in brstič; Jaz sem namestil in pripravil svetilko za Svojega maziljenca, [izpolnjujoč obljube iz davnine].  
[132:18] Njegove sovražnike bom Jaz oblekel s sramoto, toda na njem bo uspevala njegova krona." 
[133:1]  POGLEJ, KAKO dobro in kako prijetno je za brate, da prebivajo skupaj v enotnosti! 
[133:2] To je kakor dragoceno maziljenje, izlito na glavo, ki teče na brado, celo na brado Arona, [prvega visokega duhovnika], ki je priteklo na ovratnik in krila njegovih oblačil, [posvečujoč celotno telo].  
[133:3] To je kakor rosa [vzvišene] gore Hermon in rosa, ki prihaja na griče Siona; kajti tam je Gospod ukazal blagoslov, celo življenje na veke vekov, [na visoke in nizke]. 
[134:1]  POGLEJTE, BLAGOSLAVLJAJTE, (obožujoče in hvaležno hvalite) Gospoda, vsi vi Gospodovi služabniki, [pevci], ki ponoči stojite v Gospodovi hiši.  
[134:2] Svoje roke vzdigujte v svetosti in k svetišču ter blagoslavljajte Gospoda, [obožujoče in hvaležno Ga hvalite]! 
[134:3] Gospod naj vas blagoslovi s Siona, celo On, ki je naredil nebesa in zemljo. 
[135:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) Hvalite Gospodovo ime; hvalite Ga, o vi Gospodovi služabniki! 
[135:2] Vi, ki stojite v Gospodovi hiši, v dvorih hiše našega Boga, 
[135:3] hvalite Gospoda! Kajti Gospod je dober; pojte hvalnice Njegovemu imenu, kajti On je milostljiv in čudovit! 
[135:4] Kajti Gospod je Zase izbral Jakobove [potomce], Izraela za Svojo posebno lastnino in zaklad.  
[135:5] Kajti vem, da je Gospod veličasten in da je naš Gospod nad vsemi bogovi. 
[135:6] Karkoli Gospodu ugaja, to je On storil v podaljšku nebes in na zemlji, v morjih in vseh globinah – 
[135:7] ki povzroča, da se hlapi vzdigujejo od koncev zemlje, ki dela bliske za dež, ki iz Svojih shramb pripelje veter; 
[135:8] ki je udaril egiptovskega prvorojenca, od obeh, od človeka in od živali;  
[135:9] ki je poslal znamenja in čudeže v tvojo sredo, o Egipt, na faraona in vse njegove služabnike; 
[135:10] ki je udaril številne in velike narode in ubil mogočne kralje – 
[135:11] Sihóna, amoréjskega kralja, Oga, bašanskega kralja in vsa kánaanska kraljestva. 
[135:12] [Gospod] je dal njihovo zemljo kot dediščino, dediščino Izraelu, Svojemu ljudstvu. 
[135:13] Tvoje ime, o Gospod, vztraja za vedno, Tvoja slava, o Gospod, skozi vse veke. 
[135:14] Kajti Gospod bo sodil in zagovarjal Svoje ljudstvo in On bo odložil Svoje sodbe, [prikazujoč Svojo pravičnost in usmiljenje] in v naklonjenosti |bo| sprejel Svoje služabnike, [tiste, ki sprejmejo Njegove pogoje oddvojitve Zanj].  
[135:15] Maliki narodov so srebro in zlato, delo človeških rok. 
[135:16] [Maliki] imajo usta, toda ne govorijo; imajo oči, toda ne vidijo; 
[135:17] imajo ušesa, toda ne slišijo, niti v njihovih ustih ni nikakršnega diha. 
[135:18] Tisti, ki izdelujejo [malike], so jim podobni; takšen je vsakdo, ki zaupa |vanje| in se zanaša nanje.  
[135:19] Blagoslavljaj, (obožujoče in hvaležno hvali) Gospoda, o Izraelova hiša; blagoslavljaj Gospoda, o Aronova hiša [Božjih služabnikov]. 
[135:20] Blagoslavljaj Gospoda, o Levijeva hiša [posvečenega rodu]; vi, ki se častitljivo in obožujoče bojite Gospoda, blagoslavljajte Gospoda, [Ga ljubeče in hvaležno hvalite]!  
[135:21] Blagoslovljen s Siona bodi Gospod, ki prebivaš [z nami] v Jeruzalemu. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[136:1] O DAJAJTE zahvalo Gospodu, kajti On je dober; kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[136:2] O dajajte zahvalo Bogu bogov, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno. 
[136:3] O dajajte zahvalo Gospodu gospodov, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno – 
[136:4] Njemu, ki sam dela veličastne čudeže, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:5] Njemu, ki je po modrosti in razumevanju naredil podaljšek nebes, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:6] Njemu, ki je zemljo razprostrl na vodah, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:7] Njemu, ki je naredil veličastne luči, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno – 
[136:8] sonce, da vlada nad dnevom, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:9] luno in zvezde, da vladajo ponoči, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:10] Njemu, ki je udaril Egipt v njihovih prvorojencih, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:11] in izpeljal Izraela izmed njih, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:12] z močno roko in z iztegnjenim laktom, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:13] Njemu, ki je Rdeče morje razdelil na dela, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:14] in je primoral Izraela, da je šel skozi njegovo sredo, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:15] toda otresel in porazil je faraona in njegovo vojsko v Rdeče morje, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:16] Njemu, ki je Svoje ljudstvo vodil skozi divjino, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:17] Njemu, ki je udaril velike kralje, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:18] in umoril slavne kralje, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno – 
[136:19] Sihóna, amoréjskega kralja, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:20] in Oga, bašánskega kralja, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:21] in je njihovo deželo dal kot dediščino, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:22] celo dediščino Izraelu, Svojemu služabniku, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno;  
[136:23] Njemu, ki se nas je [iskreno] spomnil v našem nizkem stanju in si nas vtisnil [na Svoje srce], kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:24] in nas rešil pred našimi sovražniki, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:25] Njemu, ki daje hrano vsemu mesu, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno; 
[136:26] O dajajte zahvalo Bogu nebes, kajti Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost vztrajata za vedno! 
[137:1] OB babilonskih rekah, tam smo sedeli [ujetniki], da, jokali smo, ko smo se [iskreno] spominjali Siona, [mesta našega Boga, vtisnjenega na naša srca]. 
[137:2] Na vrbe v sredi [Babilona] smo obesili naše harfe. 
[137:3] Kajti tam so tisti, ki so nas peljali v ujetništvo, od nas zahtevali pesem z besedami in naši mučitelji ter tisti, ki so nas izčrpavali, so od nas zahtevali veselje, govoreč: "Pojte nam eno izmed sionskih pesmi." 
[137:4] Kako naj bi v tuji deželi peli Gospodovo pesem? 
[137:5] Če pozabim tebe, o Jeruzalem, naj moja desnica pozabi svojo spretnost [s harfo]. 
[137:6] Naj se moj jezik lepi na nebo mojih ust, če se te ne spominjam, če ne cenim Jeruzalema nad svojo glavno radost!  
[137:7] Spominjaj se, o Gospod, zoper Edómce, da so na dan jeruzalemskega padca rekli: "Dol, dol k tlom z njim!" 
[137:8] O hči babilonska, [ti uničevalka, ti!], ki [bi morala biti in] boš uničena, vesel in blagoslovljen bo tisti, ki ti povrne, kakor si ti stregla nam.  
[137:9] Vesel in blagoslovljen bo tisti, ki vzame in trešči tvoje malčke ob skalo! 
[138:1]  PRIZNAVAL BOM in hvalil Tebe, [O Bog], z vsem svojim srcem; pred bogovi Ti bom prepeval hvalnice. 
[138:2] Oboževal bom k Tvojemu svetemu templju in hvalil Tvoje ime zaradi Tvoje ljubeče-skrbnosti in zaradi Tvoje resnice in zvestobe; kajti Ti si Svoje ime in Svojo besedo povzdignil nad vse drugo in Ti si poveličal Svojo besedo nad vse Svoje ime! 
[138:3] Na dan, ko sem klical, si mi Ti odgovoril; in Ti si me okrepil z močjo, (mogočnostjo in neupogljivostjo za skušnjave), v mojem notranjem jazu. 
[138:4] Vsi kralji dežele Ti bodo dajali zaslugo in Te hvalili, o Gospod, kajti slišali so o obljubah Tvojih ust, [ki so bile izpolnjene]. 
[138:5] Da, peli bodo o Gospodovih poteh in radostno praznovali Njegova mogočna dela, kajti Gospodova slava je veličastna. 
[138:6] Kajti čeprav je Gospod visoko, ima On vendar spoštovanje do ponižnih, [vodi jih v skupnost z Njim]; toda ponosne in ošabne On pozna in prepozna [samo] iz daljave.  
[138:7] Čeprav hodim v sredi stiske, me boš Ti oživil; Ti boš Svojo roko iztegnil proti besu mojih sovražnikov in Tvoja desnica me bo rešila.  
[138:8] Gospod bo izpopolnil to, kar se nanaša name; Tvoje usmiljenje in ljubeča-skrbnost, o Gospod, vztrajata za vedno – ne zapusti del Svojih lastnih rok.  
[139:1]  O GOSPOD, [temeljito] si me preiskal in me spoznal. 
[139:2] Poznaš moje sédanje in moje vstajanje; Ti mojo misel razumeš že od daleč.  
[139:3] Ti odbiraš in preiskuješ mojo pot in moj počitek in Ti si seznanjen z vsemi mojimi potmi. 
[139:4] Kajti ni še besede na mojem jeziku, [še neizrečene], toda glej, o Gospod, Ti jo že v celoti poznaš.  
[139:5] Ti si me obdal in me zaprl – zadaj in spredaj; in Ti si name položil Svojo roko. 
[139:6] Tvoje [neskončno] znanje je prečudovito zame; visoko nad menoj je, ne morem ga doseči. 
[139:7] Kam bi lahko šel pred Tvojim Duhom? Ali kam bi lahko zbežal pred Tvojo prisotnostjo? 
[139:8] Če se povzpnem v nebesa, si Ti tam; če si posteljem posteljo v Šeolu, (kraju mrtvih), glej, si Ti tam.  
[139:9] Če vzamem peruti jutra ali prebivam v najbolj oddaljenih delih morja, 
[139:10] celo tam bi me Tvoja roka vodila in Tvoja desnica bi me držala. 
[139:11] Če rečem: "Zagotovo naj me pokrije tema in noč naj bo [edina] luč nad menoj," 
[139:12] celo tema ne skriva ničesar pred Teboj, temveč noč sveti kakor dan; kajti tema in svetloba sta Tebi obe podobni.  
[139:13] Kajti Ti si oblikoval moje notranje dele; Ti si me stkal v trebuhu moje matere. 
[139:14] Priznal in hvalil Te bom, kajti Ti si strašen in čudovit in za silen čudež mojega rojstva! Čudovita so Tvoja dela in to moj notranji jaz dobro ve. 
[139:15] Moj sestav ni bil skrit pred Teboj, ko sem bil oblikovan na skrivnem in zapleteno in nenavadno izdelan, [kakor če bi bil izvezen z različnimi barvami], v globinah zemlje, [območju teme in skrivnosti]. 
[139:16] Tvoje oči so videle mojo neoblikovano substanco in v Tvojo knjigo so bili zapisani vsi dnevi [mojega življenja], še preden so bili sploh oblikovani, ko ni bilo nobenega izmed njih. 
[139:17] Kako dragocene in tehtne so tudi Tvoje misli o meni, o Bog! Kako ogromna je njihova vsota!  
[139:18] Če bi jih lahko preštel, bi jih bilo po številu več kakor peska. Ko bi se zbudil, [če bi lahko preštel do konca], bi bil še vedno s Teboj. 
[139:19] Če bi Ti [samo] pobil zlobneže, o Bog, in krvoločneži, ločite se od mene – 
[139:20] tisti, ki govorijo proti Tebi zlobno, Tvoji sovražniki, ki zaman jemljejo Tvoje ime!  
[139:21] Mar jih ne sovražim, o Gospod, tiste, ki sovražijo Tebe? In ali nisem užaloščen in se mi ne studijo tisti, ki se vzdigujejo zoper Tebe? 
[139:22] Sovražim jih s popolnim sovraštvom; postali so moji sovražniki. 
[139:23] [Temeljito] me preišči, o Bog in spoznaj moje srce! Preizkusi me in spoznaj moje misli! 
[139:24] In poglej, če je kaka zlobna ali škodljiva pot v meni in vodi me po poti večnosti. 
[140:1]  OSVOBODI ME, o Gospod, pred hudobnimi ljudmi; obvaruj me pred nasilnimi ljudmi; 
[140:2] v svojem srcu si izmišljajo vragolije; nenehno se zbirajo skupaj in izzivajo vojne. 
[140:3] Svoje jezike ostrijo kakor kačje; gadji strup je pod njihovimi ustnicami. 
[140:4]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Obvaruj me, o Gospod, pred rokami zlobnih; obvaruj me pred nasilnimi ljudmi, ki so se namenili potisniti moje korake vstran. 
[140:5] Ponosni so zame skrili zanko; razpeli so vrvi kakor mrežo ob poti, zame so postavili pasti.
[140:6]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Rekel sem Gospodu: "Ti si moj Bog; prisluhni glasu mojih ponižnih prošenj, o Gospod. 
[140:7] O Bog, Gospod, moč rešitve moje duše, Ti si na dan bitke zaščitil mojo glavo. 
[140:8] Ne izpolni, o Gospod, želja zlobnih; ne pospešuj njihovih zlobnih spletk in zvijač, da se ne bi povzdigovali."
[140:9]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Tisti, ki me ograjujejo, dvigajo svoje glave; naj nadnje pade vragolija njihovih lastnih ustnic in prav tiste stvari, ki jih želijo zame. 
[140:10] Naj nanje pada goreče oglje; naj bodo vrženi v ogenj, v poplave vodá ali v globoke vodne jame, iz katerih ne bodo vstali. 
[140:11] Naj človek obrekljivega jezika ne bo utrjen na zemlji; naj hudobni lovi nasilneža, da bi ga strmoglavil, [naj nesreča spremlja njegova hudobna dela]. 
[140:12] Vem in v zaupanju počivam nad tem, da bo Gospod ohranil zadevo trpečega in bo varoval pravico za ubogega in pomoči potrebnega, [od Njegovih vernih otrok]. 
[140:13] Zagotovo bo [brezkompromisno] pravični dajal zahvalo Tvojemu imenu; iskreni bo prebival v Tvoji prisotnosti, (prav pred Tvojim obrazom). 
[141:1]  GOSPOD, kličem k Tebi; hiti k meni. Prisluhni mojemu glasu, ko kličem k Tebi. 
[141:2] Naj bo moja molitev postavljena pred Teboj kakor dišava, dvigovanje mojih rok kakor večerna žrtev.  
[141:3] Postavi stražarja, o Gospod, pred moja usta; varuj vrata mojih ustnic. 
[141:4] Nagni moje srce, da se ne bo podredilo ali privolilo v katerokoli hudo stvar ali da bi bilo prevzeto v dejanjih zlobnosti z ljudmi, ki delajo krivičnost; in ne pusti mi, da jem od njihovih poslastic. 
[141:5] Naj me pravični človek udarja in popravlja – to je ljubeznivost. Olje, tako izbrano, naj moja glava ne zavrne ali prepreči; celo v njihovih hudobijah ali nesrečah se bo nadaljevala moja molitev.  
[141:6] Kadar so njihovi vladarji zrušeni v kamnita mesta, bodo [njihovi sledilci] slišali moje besede, da so sladke, (prijetne, mile in pravične). 
[141:7] Nepokopane kosti [zaklanih vladarjev] bodo ležale raztresene pri ustih Šeola, [tako neupoštevane] kakor grude zemlje za oračem, ko razpira zemljo.  
[141:8] Toda moje oči so obrnjene k Tebi, o Bog, Gospod; Vate zaupam in se zatekam; ne izlij mojega življenja niti ga ne pusti zapuščenega in golega. 
[141:9] Varuj me pred pastjo, ki so jo položili zame in pred zankami hudobnežev. 
[141:10] Naj zlobni skupaj padejo v svoje lastne mreže, medtem ko grem mimo in pobegnem. 
[142:1]  S svojim glasom kličem h Gospodu; s svojim glasom delam ponižno prošnjo h Gospodu. 
[142:2] Pred Njim izlivam svojo pritožbo; pred Njim povem svojo težavo. 
[142:3] Ko je bil moj duh preplavljen in je na meni medlel [in je vrgel vso svojo težo] name, takrat si Ti poznal mojo pot. Na poti, po kateri hodim, so zame skrili zanko. 
[142:4] Poglej na desnico, [mesto napada] in vidi; kajti tam ni človeka, ki me pozna, [da bi se pojavil zame]. Zatočišče me je izdalo in nimam kam zbežati; nikomur ni mar za moje življenje ali za mojo dobrobit. 
[142:5] Klical sem k Tebi, o Gospod; rekel sem: "Ti si moje zatočišče, moj delež v deželi živih." 
[142:6] Posveti se mojemu glasnemu klicu, kajti priveden sem zelo nizko; osvobodi me pred mojimi preganjalci, kajti močnejši so od mene. 
[142:7] Moje življenje privedi iz ječe, da bom lahko priznal, hvalil in se zahvaljeval Tvojemu imenu; pravični me bodo obkrožali in se venčali zaradi mene, kajti Ti boš radodarno ravnal z menoj. 
[143:1]  USLIŠI MOJO molitev, o Gospod, prisluhni mojim ponižnim prošnjam! V Svoji zvestobi mi odgovori in v Svoji pravičnosti. 
[143:2] In ne vstopi v sodbo s Svojim služabnikom, kajti v Tvojem pogledu noben živeč človek ni [v sebi] pravičen ali opravičen.  
[143:3] Kajti sovražnik je zasledoval in preganjal mojo dušo, moje življenje je strl navzdol do tal; storil mi je, da prebivam v temnih prostorih, kakor tisti, ki so že dolgo mrtvi. 
[143:4] Zato je moj duh preplavljen in znotraj mene medli [ovit v žalost]; moje srce znotraj mojega naročja postaja otopelo. 
[143:5] Spominjam se dni davnine; premišljujem o vseh Tvojih dejanjih; razglabljam o delu Tvojih rok. 
[143:6] Svoje roke iztegujem k Tebi; mojo dušo žeja po Tebi kakor žejno deželo [po vodi].
[143:7]  Sela, [ustavi se in mirno razmisli o tem]! Hitro mi odgovori, o Gospod, kajti moj duh pojema; Svojega obraza ne skrij pred menoj, sicer bom postal takšen kakor tisti, ki gredo navzdol v jamo, (grob). 
[143:8] Pripravi me do tega, da zjutraj slišim Tvojo ljubečo-skrbnost, kajti Nate se zanašam in Vate zaupam. Pripravi me do tega, da spoznam pot, po kateri naj bi hodil, kajti k Tebi dvigujem svoj notranji jaz. 
[143:9] Osvobodi me, o Gospod, pred mojimi sovražniki; k Tebi bežim, da me skriješ. 
[143:10] Uči me izpolnjevati Svojo voljo, kajti Ti si moj Bog; naj me Tvoj dobri Duh vodi v ravno deželo in v zemljo iskrenosti. 
[143:11] Reši moje življenje, o Gospod, zaradi Svojega imena; v Svoji pravičnosti izpelji moje življenje iz stiske in me osvobodi nadloge. 
[143:12] In v Svojem usmiljenju in ljubeči-skrbnosti odreži moje sovražnike in uniči vse tiste, ki žalostijo moj notranji jaz, kajti jaz sem Tvoj služabnik. 
[144:1]  BLAGOSLOVLJEN NAJ bo Gospod, moja skala in moja prodorna in trdna moč, ki moje roke uči vojskovanja in moje prste borbe – 
[144:2] moja trdna Ljubezen in moja trdnjava, moj visoki stolp in moj osvoboditelj, moj ščit in Tisti v katerega zaupam in se zatekam, ki pod mene podjarmlja moje ljudi. 
[144:3] Gospod, kaj je človek, da se Ti oziraš nanj? Ali [tisti] sin človekov, da ga Ti upoštevaš?  
[144:4] Človek je kakor ničnost in dih; njegovi dnevi so kakor senca, ki mineva. 
[144:5] Upogni Svoj podaljšek nebes, o Gospod in pridi dol; dotakni se gora in se bodo kadile. 
[144:6] Vrzi blisk in razženi [moje sovražnike]; odpošlji Svoje puščice in jih zbegaj ter onemogoči. 
[144:7] Iztegni Svojo roko od zgoraj; reši me in me osvobodi iz velikih voda, iz rok sovražnih tujcev, (plemen okoli nas). 
[144:8] Katerih usta govorijo prevare in katerih desne roke so desne roke [vzgojene v jemanju] sleparskih priseg. 
[144:9] Novo pesem Ti bom pel, o Bog; na harfo, na instrument desetih strun Ti bom nudil hvalnice. 
[144:10] Ti si Ta, ki daje kraljem rešitev duš, ki rešuje Davida, Svojega služabnika, od škodljivega meča [hudobije]. 
[144:11] Reši me in me osvobodi ven iz oblasti [sovražnih] tujih [plemen], katerih usta govorijo prevaro in katerih desne roke so desne roke [vzgojene v jemanju] sleparskih priseg. 
[144:12] Ko bodo naši sinovi kakor sadike, |ki so| zrasle velike v svoji mladosti in bodo naše hčere izklesane tako kakor vogalni stebri, kakor tisti v palači; 
[144:13] ko so naše kašče, nudeč vse načine skladiščenja, polne in naše ovce skotijo tisoče in deset tisoče na naših pašnikih; 
[144:14] ko so naši voli dobro natovorjeni; ko ni vdora [sovražnih vojska] in nobenega napredka [proti oblegovalcem – ko ni umora ali uboja] in na naših ulicah ni kričanja; 
[144:15] veseli in blagoslovljeni so ljudje, ki so v takem primeru; da, veseli, (blagoslovljeni, srečni, uspešni, zavidanja vredni) so ljudje, katerih Bog je Gospod! 
[145:1]  POVZDIGOVAL Te bom, moj Bog, o Kralj; in Tvoje ime bom blagoslavljal za vedno in večno, [s hvaležnim, vdanim hvaljenjem]. 
[145:2] Vsak dan [z njegovimi novimi razlogi] Te bom blagoslavljal, [vdano in hvaležno Te bom hvalil]; da, Tvoje ime bom hvalil za vedno in večno. 
[145:3] Silen je Gospod in zelo naj bo hvaljen; in Njegova veličina je [tako obsežna in globoka, kot bi bila] neraziskavna.  
[145:4] En rod bo glasno hvalil Tvoja dela drugemu in bo razglašal Tvoja mogočna dejanja. 
[145:5] O slavnem blišču Tvojega veličastva in o Tvojih čudežnih delih bom premišljeval. 
[145:6] Ljudje bodo govorili o moči Tvojih strahovitih in strašnih dejanj in jaz bom razglašal Tvojo veličino. 
[145:7] [Kot studenec] bodo izlivali slavo Tvoje velike in obilne dobrote in na glas bodo peli o Tvoji pravičnosti in pravici. 
[145:8] Gospod je milostljiv in poln sočutja, počasen k jezi in bogat v usmiljenju ter ljubeči-skrbnosti. 
[145:9] Gospod je dober vsem in Njegova nežna usmiljenja so nad vsemi Njegovimi deli, [nad celostnostjo ustvarjenih stvari]. 
[145:10] Vsa Tvoja dela naj Te hvalijo, o Gospod in Tvoji ljubljenci naj Te blagoslavljajo, [Tvoji sveti naj Te obožujoče in hvaležno priznajo ter hvalijo]! 
[145:11] Govorili bodo o slavi Tvojega kraljestva in se pogovarjali o Tvoji oblasti, 
[145:12] da bi človeškim sinovim dali vedeti o Božjih mogočnih delih in slavnem veličastju Njegovega kraljestva. 
[145:13] Tvoje kraljestvo je večno kraljestvo in Tvoje gospostvo traja skozi vse rodove. 
[145:14] Gospod podpira vse tiste, [v Njegovi lasti], ki padajo in dviguje vse tiste, ki so upognjeni. 
[145:15] Oči vseh čakajo na Tebe, [gledajoče, opazujoče in pričakujoče] in Ti jim daješ njihovo hrano ob pravem času. 
[145:16] Odpri Svojo roko in vsako živo stvar zadovolji z naklonjenostjo. 
[145:17] Gospod je [neupogljivo] pravičen na vseh Svojih poteh in milostljiv ter usmiljen v vseh Svojih delih. 
[145:18] Gospod je blizu vsem, ki kličejo k Njemu, vsem tem, ki iskreno in v resnici kličejo k Njemu. 
[145:19] On bo izpolnil želje teh, ki se Ga častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo; On bo tudi uslišal njihov klic in jih bo rešil. 
[145:20] Gospod ohranja vse tiste, ki Ga ljubijo, toda vse zlobne bo On uničil. 
[145:21] Moja usta bodo govorila Gospodovo hvalnico; in vse meso naj blagoslavlja, (obožujoče in hvaležno hvali) Njegovo sveto ime za vedno in večno. 
[146:1] HVALITE Gospoda! (Aleluja!) Hvali Gospoda, o moja duša! 
[146:2] Gospoda bom hvalil medtem ko živim; pel bom hvalnice svojemu Bogu medtem ko imam kakršenkoli obstoj. 
[146:3] Svojega zaupanja ne polagaj v prince, v sina človekovega, v katerem ni pomoči. 
[146:4] Ko ga njegov dih zapusti, se vrne v svojo zemljo; prav v tem dnevu propadejo njegove [prejšnje] misli, plani in nameni.  
[146:5] Vesel, (blagoslovljen, srečen, zavidljiv) je kdor ima [po posebnem razodetju] Boga Jakobovega za svojo pomoč, katerega upanje je v Gospodu, njegovemu Bogu,  
[146:6] ki je naredil nebesa in zemljo, morje in vse kar je v njem, ki ohranja resnico in je zvest za vedno, 
[146:7] ki izvršuje pravico za zatirane, ki daje hrano lačnim. Gospod osvobaja ujetnike, 
[146:8] Gospod slepim odpira oči, Gospod dviga te, ki so sklonjeni, Gospod ljubi [brezkompromisno] pravične, (te iskrene v srcu in v pravem odnosu z Njim).  
[146:9] Gospod ščiti in varuje tujce in začasno prebivajoče, On drži pokonci te, ki so brez očeta in vdove ter jih postavlja pokonci, toda pot zlobnih On dela izkrivljeno, (jo prevrača in jo privede k uničenju). 
[146:10] Gospod bo vladal večno, celo Tvoj Bog, o Sion, od roda do roda. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!)  
[147:1] HVALITE Gospoda! Kajti dobro je peti hvalnice našemu Bogu, kajti On je milostljiv in očarljiv; hvala je spodobna in primerna. 
[147:2] Gospod izgrajuje Jeruzalem; On zbira skupaj Izraelove izgnance. 
[147:3] On ozdravlja zlomljene v srcu in povezuje njihove rane, [ozdravlja njihove bolečine in njihove bolesti].  
[147:4] On določa in šteje število zvezd; On jih vse kliče po njihovih imenih. 
[147:5] Naš Gospod je velik in zelo močan; Njegovo razumevanje je neizčrpno in brezgrajno. 
[147:6] Gospod dviguje ponižne in potrte; On zlobne meče na tla. 
[147:7] Pojte Gospodu z zahvaljevanjem; našemu Bogu pojte hvalnice s harfo ali liro! – 
[147:8] Ki pokriva podaljšek nebes z oblaki, ki pripravlja dež za zemljo, ki daje, da trava raste na gorah. 
[147:9] On daje živali njeno hrano in mladim krokarjem tisto, po čemer vpijejo. 
[147:10] On se ne razveseljuje v moči konja, niti On nima veselja v človekovih nogah. 
[147:11] Gospod se razveseljuje v teh, ki se Ga častitljivo in obožujoče bojijo, v teh, ki upajo v Njegovo usmiljenje in ljubečo-skrbnost.  
[147:12] Hvali Gospoda, o Jeruzalem! Hvali svojega Boga, o Sion! 
[147:13] Kajti On je ojačil zapahe tvojih duri in |jih| naredil močne in On je blagoslovil tvoje otroke v tebi. 
[147:14] On ustvarja mir na tvojih mejah; On te nasičuje z najboljšo pšenico. 
[147:15] Svojo zapoved pošilja na zemljo; Njegova beseda teče zelo naglo. 
[147:16] On daje [zemlji] sneg kakor volneno [odejo]; On siplje slano kakor pepel. 
[147:17] On meče Svoj led kakor drobtine; kdo lahko obstane pred Njegovim mrazom? 
[147:18] On odpošilja ven Svojo besedo in tali [led in sneg]. On povzroča, da Njegov veter piha in da vode teko. 
[147:19] On razglaša Svojo besedo Jakobu, Svoje zakone in Svoje odloke Izraelu.  
[147:20] On ni tako delal z nobenim [drugim] narodom; oni niso spoznali, (razumeli, cenili, dali pozornost k negovanjem) Njegovih predpisov. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!)  
[148:1] HVALITE Gospoda! Hvalite Gospoda iz podaljška nebes, hvalite Ga v višavah! 
[148:2] Hvalite Ga, vsi Njegovi angeli, hvalite Ga, vse Njegove vojske! 
[148:3] Hvalite Ga, sonce in luna, hvalite Ga, vse ve svetle zvezde! 
[148:4] Hvali Ga, najvišji podaljšek nebes in ve vode nad podaljškom nebes! 
[148:5] Naj hvalijo Gospodovo ime, kajti On je ukazal in so bili ustvarjeni. 
[148:6] Prav tako jih je On ustanovil za vedno in večno; On je naredil zakon, ki ne bo izginil, [On je pritrdil njihove vezi, katere ne morejo preiti]. 
[148:7] Hvalite Gospoda iz zemlje, ve morske pošasti in vse globine! 
[148:8] Vi bliski, toča, megla in zmrzal, viharni veter, ki izpolnjujete Njegove ukaze! 
[148:9] Gore in vsi hribi, sadna drevesa in vse cedre! 
[148:10] Zveri in vsa živina, plazeče se stvari in leteče ptice! 
[148:11] Kralji zemlje in vsi ljudje, princi in vsi vladarji in sodniki zemlje! 
[148:12] Oboji, mladeniči in mladenke, starci in otroci! 
[148:13] Naj hvalijo in poveličujejo Gospodovo ime, kajti samo Njegovo ime je poveličano in najvišje! Njegova slava in veličina sta nad zemljo in nebesi! 
[148:14] Svojemu ljudstvu je On vzdignil rog, [nudeč jim moč, napredek, dostojanstvo in vzvišenost], pesem hvaljenja za vse Njegove bogaboječe, za Izraelsko ljudstvo, ki so blizu Njemu. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!)  
[149:1] HVALITE Gospoda! Pojte Gospodu novo pesem, hvalite Ga v zboru Njegovih svetih! 
[149:2] Naj se Izrael radosti v Njem, njihovemu Stvarniku; naj sionski otroci zmagujejo in bodo radostni v svojem Kralju!  
[149:3] Naj hvalijo Njegovo ime v zboru in na koru in s [posamičnim ali skupinskim] plesom; naj Mu pojejo hvalnice s tamburinom in liro! 
[149:4] Kajti Gospod se razveseljuje v Svojem ljudstvu; On bo ponižne okrasil z rešitvijo duš in revne olepšal z zmago. 
[149:5] Naj bodo sveti radostni v slavi in lepoti, [katero Bog podeljuje nanje]; naj zaradi radosti pojejo na svojih posteljah. 
[149:6] Naj bodo v njihovih grlih visoke hvalnice Boga in v njihovih rokah dvorezen meč,  
[149:7] da se maščujejo nad narodi in kaznujejo nad ljudstvi, 
[149:8] da njihove kralje zvežejo z verigami in njihove odličnike z železnimi okovi, 
[149:9] da nad njimi izvršijo napisano sodbo. On, [Gospod], je čast vseh Njegovih svetih. Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!) 
[150:1] HVALITE Gospoda! Hvalite Boga v Njegovem svetišču; hvalite Ga v podaljšku nebes Njegove moči! 
[150:2] Hvalite Ga zaradi Njegovih mogočnih del; hvalite Ga glede na obilje Njegove veličine!  
[150:3] Hvalite Ga z zvokom trobente; hvalite Ga z lutnjo in harfo! 
[150:4] Hvalite Ga s tamburinom in [posamičnim ali skupinskim] plesom; hvalite Ga z godali in pihali ali flavtami! 
[150:5] Hvalite Ga z zvenečimi cimbalami; hvalite Ga z glasno donečimi cimbalami! 
[150:6] Naj vse kar ima dih in vsak dih življenja hvali Gospoda! Hvalite Gospoda! (Aleluja!)

### Galatians

[1:1] PAVEL, apostol – [poseben odposlanec, imenovan in pooblaščen in poslan] ne od [kateregakoli] človeškega [organa], ne po |kateremkoli človeku| ali zaradi kateregakoli človeka, temveč po |Jezusu Kristusu| in zaradi Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija) in Boga Očeta, katerega je On obudil od mrtvih – 
[1:2] in vsi bratje, ki so z menoj, cerkvam v Galatiji: 
[1:3] milost in duhovni blagoslov naj vam bo in [dušni] mir od Boga Očeta in našega Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija), 
[1:4] ki je daroval (izročil) samega Sebe, [ da bi odplačal] za naše grehe [in da bi nas rešil in nas posvetil], tako da bi nas rešil in iztrgal iz sedanje zlobne dobe in svetovne ureditve, v soglasju z voljo in namenom in načrtom našega Boga in Očeta – 
[1:5] Njemu [bodi pripisana vsa] slava skozi vse veke vekov in večnosti večnosti! Amen (tako naj bo). 
[1:6] Presenečen in začuden sem, da se tako hitro obračate kot odpadniki in zapuščate Njega, ki vas je povabil in poklical po milosti, (nezasluženi naklonjenosti) Kristusa (Mesija) [in da svojo zvestobo prenašate] k drugačnemu [celo nasprotnemu] evangeliju. 
[1:7] Ne da je [ali bi lahko bil] katerikoli drug [pristen evangelij] temveč so [očitno] nekateri, ki vas nadlegujejo in vznemirjajo in begajo [ z drugačno vrsto učenja, katerega ponujajo kot evangelij] in hočejo popačiti in izkriviti evangelij Kristusa (Mesija) [v nekaj, kar evangelij nikakor ni]. 
[1:8] Toda celo, če bi vam mi ali angel iz nebes oznanjal evangelij, nasproten in drugačen od tega, katerega smo vam mi oznanili, naj bo preklet, (izobčen, predan uničenju, obsojen na večno kazen)! 
[1:9] Kakor smo že prej povedali, tako sedaj ponovno pravim: "Če vam kdorkoli oznanja evangelij, ki je drugačen ali nasproten od tega, ki ste ga prejeli [od nas], naj bo preklet, (izobčen, predan uničenju, obsojen na večno kazen)!" 
[1:10] Mar skušam sedaj doseči naklonjenost od ljudi ali od Boga? Si mar prizadevam, da bi ugajal ljudem? Če bi še vedno iskal priljubljenost pri ljudeh, ne bi bil zavezan služabnik Kristusa (Mesija). 
[1:11] Kajti želim, da veste, bratje, da evangelij, ki je bil razglašen in oznanjen po meni, ni človeški evangelij, [človeško odkritje, glede na |človeški standard| ali oblikovan po kakršnem koli človeškem standardu]. 
[1:12] Nikakor ga namreč nisem prejel od človeka, niti nisem bil poučen, temveč [je prišel k meni] po [neposrednem] razodetju, [danem] po Jezusu Kristusu, (Mesiji). 
[1:13] Slišali ste o moji prejšnji službi in prejšnjem načinu življenja v judovski veri (judovstvu), kako sem besno in temeljito preganjal in zlorabljal Božjo cerkev in si [s strastno gorečnostjo prizadeval dati vse od sebe], da bi iz nje naredil opustošenje in jo uničil. 
[1:14] In [slišali ste kako] sem med rojaki prekašal mnoge sovrstnike v [svojem napredovanju v študiju in izpolnjevanju zakonov] judovstva, tako izjemno navdušen in goreč sem bil za izročila svojih prednikov. 
[1:15] Ko pa se je Njemu, ki me je izbral in oddvojil [celo] preden sem bil rojen in me je poklical po Svoji milosti, (Njegovi nezasluženi naklonjenosti in blagoslovu), zdelo primerno in mu je ugajalo,  
[1:16] da v meni razodene, (odkrije, sname zagrinjalo) Svojega Sina, da bi smel Sina oznanjati med pogani, (ne-judovskemu svetu), kot veselo oznanilo (evangelij), se nisem takoj zatekel k mesu in krvi, [nisem se posvetoval ali si dal svetovati kateremu koli slabotnemu človeškemu bitju ali komuniciral s komerkoli]. 
[1:17] [Celo] niti nisem šel gor v Jeruzalem k tistim, ki so bili apostoli, (posebni Kristusovi odposlanci), preden sem bil jaz, ampak sem šel proč in se umaknil v Arabijo in kasneje ponovno prišel nazaj v Damask. 
[1:18] Potem sem tri leta kasneje šel gor v Jeruzalem, da bi se [osebno] seznanil s Kefom (Petrom) in ostal z njim petnajst dni. 
[1:19] Toda nobenega drugega apostola, (posebnega Kristusovega odposlanca), nisem videl razen Jakoba, brata našega Gospoda. 
[1:20] In sedaj [skrbno upoštevajte kar vam pravim, kajti to je resnica], to pišem kot bi stal pred Božjo palico; ne lažem. 
[1:21] Nato sem šel v okraje, (pokrajine, območja) Sirije in Kilikije. 
[1:22] In zaenkrat sem bil še vedno osebno nepoznan Kristusovim cerkvam v Judeji, (pokrajini, ki obdaja Jeruzalem). 
[1:23] Le slišali so govoriti: "Tisti, ki nas je nekoč preganjal, sedaj razglaša prav tisto vero, katero je nekoč sramotil in ki jo je nameraval uničiti in jo skušal z vso svojo močjo zatreti." 
[1:24] In slavili so Boga, [kot avtorja in vir tega, kar se je zgodilo] v meni. 
[2:1] POTEM sem po [obdobju] štirinajstih let ponovno šel gor v Jeruzalem. [Tokrat sem šel] z Barnabom, s [seboj] sem vzel tudi Tita. 
[2:2] Šel sem, ker mi je bilo posebno in božansko razodeto naj grem in jim predstavim evangelij, [jim razglasim tisto], kar pridigam med pogani. Vendar [sem stvar predstavil] osebno pred tistimi z ugledom, [kajti hotel sem se prepričati in tako najprej omejiti moj pogovor na to osebno srečanje], da nisem tekel ali da nisem tekel zaman, [varovajoč se pred tem, da bi bil osramočen glede tega, kar sem nameraval storiti ali kar sem že storil]. 
[2:3] Toda [vse je šlo v redu!], celo Tit, ki je bil z menoj, ni bil prisiljen, [kakor so nekateri pričakovali], dati se obrezati, čeprav je bil Grk. 
[2:4] [Moja previdnost je bila] zaradi lažnih bratov, ki so se na skrivnem vtihotapili [v bratstvo kristjanov]; vrinili so se, da bi vohunili za našo svobodo in prostost, ki jo imamo v Kristusu Jezusu, da bi nas lahko ponovno pripeljali v suženjstvo, [pod Mojzesovo postavo]. 
[2:5] Njim se nismo dovolili podrediti niti za trenutek, da bi resnica evangelija lahko še naprej obstala [ohranjena] za vas [v svoji čistosti]. 
[2:6] Poleg tega [ni bilo nobenih novih zahtev] od tistih, ki so imeli ugled, da nekaj so – čeprav kakšen je bil njihov osebni položaj in ali so bili resnično pomembni ali ne, mene ne zanima; na Boga ne naredijo vtisa položaji, ki jih ljudje zasedajo in On ni pristranski in ne priznava zunanjih odlik – tisti, [pravim], ki so veljali za ugledne, mi niso naložili nobenih dodatnih zahtev, [niso imeli ničesar dodati mojemu evangeliju in od njih nisem prejel nobenih novih predlogov].  
[2:7] Nasprotno, ko so [resnično] videli, da mi je bilo zaupano, [da ponesem] evangelij neobrezanim [poganom enako odločno], kot je bilo Petru zaupano, [da razglasi] evangelij obrezanim [Judom, so bili soglasni]; 
[2:8] kajti Tisti, ki je navdihoval in opremljal Petra in po njem učinkovito deloval zaradi poslanstva obrezanim, je navdihoval in opremljal mene in po meni tudi deloval zaradi [poslanstva] poganom. 
[2:9] In ko so spoznali, (sprejeli, prepoznali, razumeli in priznali) milost, (Božjo nezasluženo naklonjenost in duhovni blagoslov), ki mi je bila dana, so Jakob in Kefa (Peter) in Janez, ki so sloveli kot stebri jeruzalemske cerkve, meni in Barnabu podali desnico prijateljstva, z razumevanjem, da naj bi midva šla med pogane, oni pa med obrezane (Jude). 
[2:10] [Dali] so nama samo [eno določilo], da bi se spominjala revežev, prav to, kar sem bil tudi sam željan storiti. 
[2:11] Ko pa je Kefa (Peter) prišel v Antiohijo, sem mu v njegov obraz ugovarjal in nasprotoval [v zvezi z njegovim tamkajšnjim obnašanjem], kajti bil je vreden obsojanja in stal obsojen. 
[2:12] Kajti preden so namreč od Jakoba prišle nekatere osebe, je svoje obroke jedel s pogani [spreobrnjenci]; toda ko pa so prispeli ljudje [iz Jeruzalema], se je umaknil in se držal proč od poganov in [jedel] ločeno iz strahu pred temi iz [skupine] obrezancev. 
[2:13] Tudi drugi Judje so skupaj z njim zatajili svoja resnična prepričanja in se obnašali neiskreno, z rezultatom, da je bil celo Barnaba zaveden z njihovo hinavščino, (njihovim zgledom neiskrenosti in pretvarjanja). 
[2:14] Toda takoj, ko sem videl, da niso bili iskreni in ne živijo v skladu z resnico evangelija, sem pred vsemi prisotnimi Kefu (Petru) rekel: "Če ti, ki si rojen Jud, lahko živiš [tako kakor si živel] kot pogan in ne kot Jud; kako si sedaj drzneš siliti in praktično prisiliti pogane, da se [podredijo običajem Judovstva in] živijo podobno kakor Judje?" 
[2:15] [Nadaljeval sem]: "Čeprav sva midva, (ti in jaz), po rojstvu Juda in ne poganska (brezbožna) grešnika, 
[2:16] veva, da človek ni opravičen ali štet za pravičnega in v pravem odnosu z Bogom, po delih postave, ampak [le] po veri in [popolnem] zanašanju na |Jezusa Kristusa| in oprijemanju k |Jezusu Kristusu| in zaupanju v Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija, Maziljenca). [Zato] smo celo mi [sami] verovali v Jezusa Kristusa, da bi bili opravičeni po veri v Kristusa in ne po delih postave, [kajti ne moremo biti opravičeni po nikakršnem izpolnjevanju obredov postave, danih po Mojzesu]; ker s tem, da se držimo veljavnih obredov in po delih nobeno človeško bitje nikoli ne more biti opravičeno, (razglašeno za pravično in se postaviti v pravi odnos z Bogom).  
[2:17] Toda če se v naši želji in prizadevanju, da bi bili opravičeni v Kristusu, [da bi bili razglašeni za pravične in postavljeni v pravi odnos z Bogom v celoti in samo skozi Kristusa], tudi mi sami izkažemo za grešnike in obsojene greha, ali to dela Kristusa posrednika, (soudeleženca in sodelavca) našemu grehu? Opustite to misel! [Seveda ne!] 
[2:18] Kajti če jaz [ali katerikoli drugi, ki imajo misel, da izpolnjevanje Mojzesove postave ni bistveno, da bi bili opravičeni pri Bogu, naj torej z besedo ali praktičnim učenjem ali sporočilom, ki je bistveno, da] ponovno zgradim, kar sem porušil, samega sebe potrjujem za prestopnika. 
[2:19] Kajti po postavi sem [pod delovanjem prekletstva postave] [v Kristusovi smrti zame] sam odmrl postavi in vsem zahtevam postave nad menoj, tako da smem [odslej] živeti Bogu in za Boga. 
[2:20] Križan sem bil s Kristusom, [v Njem sem z njim delil Njegovo križanje]; nisem več jaz tisti, ki živi, temveč Kristus (Mesija) živi v meni; in življenje, ki ga sedaj živim v telesu, živim po veri v (zvestobi do |Božjega Sina| in zanašanju na |Božjega Sina| in popolnem zaupanju v) Božjega Sina, ki me je ljubil in samega Sebe daroval zame. 
[2:21] [Zato z Božjim milostnim darom ne ravnam kakor z nečem, kar je manj pomembno in tako zametujem njegov pravi namen]; ne postavljam ob stran in razveljavljam in onemogočam in izničujem milosti, (nezaslužene naklonjenosti) od Boga. Kajti če opravičenje, (pravičnost, oproščenje od krivde) pride zaradi [izpolnjevanja obredov] postave, potem je Kristus (Mesija) umrl brez razloga in brez namena in zaman. [Njegova smrt je bila potemtakem v celoti nepotrebna.] 
[3:1] O VI ubogi in neumni in nepremišljeni in neodzivni in brezčutni Galačani! Kdo vas je očaral ali začaral ali uročil, katerim je bil – prav pred vašimi očmi – javno in nazorno predstavljen Jezus Kristus (Mesija) in naslikan kot križan? 
[3:2] Naj vas vprašam samo eno vprašanje: ali ste [Svetega] Duha prejeli kot rezultat uboganja postave in izpolnjevanja njenih del, ali zaradi tega, ker ste slišali [sporočilo evangelija] in [vanj] verjeli? [Ali je bilo iz spoštovanja postavnih obredov ali iz sporočila vere?] 
[3:3] Ali ste tako nespametni in tako brezčutni in tako neumni? [Svoje novo duhovno življenje] ste začeli s [Svetim] Duhom, ali sedaj dosegate popolnost [z odvisnostjo] mesu? 
[3:4] Ali ste tako veliko stvari trpeli in izkusili toliko vsega zastonj, (zaman) – če bi res bilo zaman in brez uspeha? 
[3:5] Potem ali Ta, ki vas oskrbuje s Svojim čudovitim [Svetim] Duhom ter močno in čudežno deluje med vami, dela to na [temelju vašega izpolnjevanja] tega kar zahteva postava, ali zaradi vašega verovanja v |sporočilo| in zvestobo in zaupanje v |sporočilo| in zanašanje na sporočilo katerega ste slišali? 
[3:6] Tako je Abraham veroval v |Boga| in bil zvest |Bogu| in zaupal v |Boga| in se zanašal na Boga in mu je bilo to všteto in položeno na njegov račun in priznano kot pravičnost, (kot soglasnost Božji volji in namenu, misli in delovanju).  
[3:7] Spoznajte in razumite, da so [dejansko] ljudje, [ki živijo]) po veri, tisti, ki so [pravi] Abrahamovi sinovi. 
[3:8] In ker je Pismo predvidelo, da bo Bog pogane opravičil zaradi vere, (razglasil za pravične, postavil v pravi odnos s Seboj), je napovedal evangelij, [dolgo vnaprej je prerokoval veselo oznanilo o Odrešeniku] Abrahamu v obljubi, rekoč: "V tebi bodo blagoslovljeni vsi narodi [zemlje]."  
[3:9] Torej tisti, ki so ljudje vere, so blagoslovljeni in narejeni vesele in privilegirani pri Bogu, [kot udeleženci v bratstvu], skupaj z verujočim in zaupajočim Abrahamom. 
[3:10] In vsi, ki se zanašajo na postavo, [ki iščejo opravičenje z ubogljivostjo postavi obredov] so pod prekletstvom in obsojeni na razočaranje in uničenje, saj je pisano v Pismih: "Preklet, (zaklet, predan uničenju, obsojen na večno kazen), bodi vsak, ki ne vztraja, (živi in ostaja) pri vseh navodilih in ukazih, zapisanih v knjigi postave, da bi jih izpolnjeval."  
[3:11] Torej je razvidno, da se nihče ne more opravičiti, (razglasiti za pravičnega in privesti v pravi odnos z Bogom) preko postave, saj Pismo pravi: "Človek v pravem odnosu z Bogom, [pravičen, opravičen], bo živel po |veri| in iz vere in kdor je preko |vere| in po veri razglašen za pravičnega in v pravem odnosu z Bogom, bo živel.  
[3:12] Toda postava ne sloni na veri, [ne zahteva vere, nima nič z vero], saj sama pravi: "Kdor to izpolnjuje, [stvari predpisane s postavo], bo živel od tega, [ne pa po veri]."  
[3:13] Kristus pa je kupil našo svobodo, [nas je odkupil] od prekletstva (obsodbe) postave [in njenega prekletstva] tako, da je [On sam] za nas postal prekletstvo, kajti pisano je namreč [v Pismih]: "Preklet je vsak kdor visi na drevesu, (je križan);  
[3:14] do konca, da bi zaradi [njihovega sprejetja] Kristusa Jezusa blagoslov, [obljubljen] Abrahamu, lahko prišel nad pogane tako, da bi mi [vsi] preko vere lahko prejeli [uresničenje] obljube [Svetega] Duha. 
[3:15] Bratje, če govorim v skladu s človeškimi odnosi: [če] celo človek naredi zadnjo željo in oporoko, (zgolj človeško zavezo), je nihče ne bo dajal na stran ali jo razveljeval ali ji kaj dodajal po tem, ko je bila nekoč sklenjena in podpisana, (priznana, potrjena). 
[3:16] Torej, obljube, (sporazumi, dogovori) so bili izrečeni in narejeni Abrahamu in njegovemu Potomcu, (njegovemu Nasledniku, njegovemu Dediču). On [Bog] ne pravi: "In potomcem (naslednikom, dedičem)", kakor bi šlo za mnogo oseb, temveč: "In tvojemu Potomcu (tvojemu Nasledniku, tvojemu Dediču)," očitno nanašajoč se na enega posameznika, ki je [nihče drug kakor] Kristus (Mesija).  
[3:17] Moja utemeljitev je tale: postava, ki se je pričela štiristo trideset let po zavezi, [se nanaša na prihajajočega Mesija], noče in ne more razveljaviti prej vzpostavljene, od Boga (priznane) zaveze, tako, da bi razveljavila obljubo in jo naredila neučinkovito.  
[3:18] Kajti če je dediščina [obljube odvisna od izpolnjevanja] postave, [kakor bi ti lažni učitelji radi, da verjamete], potem ni več [odvisna] od obljube; toda Bog jo je dal Abrahamu, [kot izključno brezplačno darilo], zaradi Njegove obljube. 
[3:19] Kakšen je bil potem namen postave? Dodana je bila [kasneje, po obljubi, da bi odkrila in ljudem izpostavila njihovo krivdo] zaradi prestopkov in [da bi se človek bolj zavedal grešnosti] greha; namenjena je bila, da bo v veljavi dokler ne bi prišel Potomec (Naslednik, Dedič), h |kateremu| in glede katerega je bila dana obljuba. In [postava] je bila dogovorjena in odrejena in razglašena po posredovanju angelov [in je bila dana] z roko (v osebi) po posredniku [med Bogom in človekom, Mojzesu]. 
[3:20] Torej posrednik (posredovalec) mora imeti opravka s |stranko| in se nanašati na več kot eno stranko, [ne more biti posrednika s samo eno osebo]. Vendar je Bog [samo] ena Oseba [in On je bil edini soudeleženec med dajanjem obljube Abrahamu. Toda zakon je bila pogodba med dvema, Bogom in Izraelom; in veljavnost le-tega je bila odvisna od obeh.] 
[3:21] Ali je potem postava v nasprotju in ugovarja Božjim obljubam? Seveda ne! Kajti če bi bila dana postava, ki bi lahko podelila [duhovno] življenje, potem bi pravičnost in pravi odnos z Bogom zagotovo prišla po postavi. 
[3:22] Toda Pismo [predstavlja vse človeštvo kot grešnike], utišane in zaprte zaradi greha, tako da je [dediščina, blagoslov], ki je bila obljubljena po veri v Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija), lahko dana (sproščena, predana in poverjena) [vsem] tistim, ki verujejo, [ki ostanejo zvesti in zaupajo in se zanašajo Nanj]). 
[3:23] Torej, preden pa je vera prišla, smo bili nepretrgoma zastraženi pod postavo, držani v ujetništvu v pripravi na vero, ki je bila določena, da se razodene, (odkrije, izpove), 
[3:24] tako je postava služila [nam Judom] kot naša vzgojiteljica, [naš varuh, naš vodič h Kristusu, da nas je vodila) do Kristusovega [prihoda], da bi bili lahko opravičeni, (razglašeni za pravične, postavljeni v pravi odnos z Bogom), po |veri| in preko vere. 
[3:25] Toda sedaj, ko je vera prišla, nismo več pod vzgojiteljico, (varuhom našega otroštva). 
[3:26] Kajti v Kristusu Jezusu ste po veri vsi Božji sinovi. 
[3:27] Kajti kolikor [izmed vas] je bilo krščenih v Kristusa, [v duhovno zvezo in skupnost s Kristusom, Maziljencem, Mesijo] ste si nadeli |Kristusa|, (sebe oblekli s) Kristusom. 
[3:28] Tukaj [sedaj ni več nobene različnosti], niti Juda, niti Grka, ne sužnja, ne svobodnega, ne moškega in ne ženske; kajti vsi ste eno v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[3:29] In če pripadate Kristusu, [ste v Njem, ki je Abrahamov Potomec], potem ste Abrahamovi potomci in glede na obljubo [duhovni] dediči. 
[4:1] TOREJ KAR menim je, da vse dokler je dedič (naslednik) še otrok in nedoleten, se ne razlikuje od sužnja, pa čeprav je gospodar vsega posestva; 
[4:2] temveč je pod varuhi in upravitelji ali oskrbniki vse do dne, ki ga je določil njegov oče. 
[4:3] Tako tudi mi, [judovski kristjani], ko smo bili še mladoletni, smo bili držani kot sužnji pod [pravili hebrejskih običajev in bili podrejeni] osnovnim učenjem ustroja zunanjih opazovanj in pravil. 
[4:4] Toda ko je primeren čas v polnosti prispel, je Bog poslal Svojega Sina, rojenega iz žene, rojenega v podrejenosti [predpisom] postave, 
[4:5] da kupi svobodo, (da odkupnino, da odkupi, da odplača za) tiste, ki so bili pod postavo, da bi mi tako lahko bili posvojeni in bi nad nami imeli podeljeno sinovstvo [in bili prepoznani kot Božji sinovi]. 
[4:6] In ker ste vi [resnično] [Njegovi] sinovi, je Bog v naša srca poslal [ Svetega] Duha Svojega Sina, ki kliče: "Abba (Oče)! Oče!" 
[4:7] Zatorej nisi več suženj, (podložen služabnik), temveč sin; in če si sin, potem [sledi, da si] dedič z Božjo pomočjo, preko Kristusa. 
[4:8] Toda ob tem prejšnjem času, ko še niste bili seznanjeni z |resničnim Bogom| in razumeli in poznali resničnega Boga, ste bili [pogani] podložni bogovom, ki po svoji naravi sploh niso mogli biti bogovi, [bogovi, ki v resnici niso obstajali]. 
[4:9] Toda sedaj, ko ste bili seznanjeni s |pravim Bogom| in ste razumeli in spoznali [pravega] Boga ali bolje rečeno, Bog vas je razumel in prepoznal, kako se lahko ponovno obrnete nazaj k šibkim in revnim in ničevim prvinam [ vseh religij, preden je prišel Kristus] in katerih sužnji hočete še enkrat postati? 
[4:10] Vi slavite [posebne] dneve in mesece in letne čase in leta! 
[4:11] Opozorjen sem bil [glede vas], da sem se med vami in nad vami trudil zaman in v prazno. 
[4:12] Bratje, prosim vas, postanite kakor jaz, [svoboden vezi judovskih obredov in navad], kajti tudi sam sem postal kakor ste vi, [ pogan]. Niste mi storili krivice [ v dneh, ko sem prvič prišel k vam; ne storite tega sedaj]. 
[4:13] Nasprotno, vi veste, da je bilo na račun telesne slabosti, da [sem ostal in] vam prvič oznanil evangelij. 
[4:14] In [vendar], čeprav je bilo moje telesno stanje vam [takšna] preizkušnja, je niste motrili z zaničevanjem ali prezirom in gnusom in me niste zavrgli; temveč ste me sprejeli kot Božjega angela, [celo] kot Kristusa Jezusa [samega]! 
[4:15] Kaj je nastalo iz tistega blagoslovljenega veselja in zadovoljstva in samo-odobravanja, ki je bilo nekoč vaše, [v tem, kar sem vas učil in v vašem spoštovanju do mene]? Imam Vas za priče, da bi si izdrli svoje lastne oči in mi jih dali, [da bi nadomestili moje], če bi bilo to mogoče. 
[4:16] Sem potem postal vaš sovražnik s tem, ko sem vam govoril resnico in z vami iskreno ravnal? 
[4:17] Ti ljudje, [učitelji Judovstva], si goreče prizadevajo, da vas preslepijo, [vam dvorijo, vas povzdigujejo], toda njihov namen ni častitljiv ali spoštovanja vreden ali koristen za karkoli. Kar hočejo doseči je, da vas ločijo [od nas, ki jim nasprotujemo], da si vas pridobijo na svojo stran in vas skušajo pripraviti, da bi si pridobili njihovo naklonjenost. 
[4:18] [Seveda] je vedno dobra stvar goreče iskati dober namen, [kakor ste vi, zagotavljam da ste] in delati z razlogom čistosti srca in življenja in ne samo kadar sem med vami prisoten! 
[4:19] Moji mali otroci, za katere ponovno trpim porodne bolečine, dokler se v vas popolnoma in trajno ne upodobi, (oblikuje) Kristus, 
[4:20] želel bi, da bi bil sedaj z vami in bi se vam z glasom dobrikal, kajti bojim se in zaskrbljen sem glede vas! 
[4:21] Vi mi povejte, ki ste upognjeni s tem, ko ste pod postavo, ali boste poslušali to, kar postava [resnično] pravi? 
[4:22] Kajti pisano je, da je Abraham imel dva sinova, enega od dekle in enega od svobodne ženske.  
[4:23] Toda medtem ko je bil otrok sužnje rojen po mesu in je imel običajno rojstvo, je bil sin svobodne rojen kot izpolnitev obljube. 
[4:24] Torej vse to je prispodoba; ti [dve ženski] predstavljata dve zavezi. Ena zaveza je izvirala iz gore Sinaj, [kjer je bila dana postava] in nosi [otroka namenjenega] za suženjstvo: to je Hagara. 
[4:25] Torej je Hagara (podoba) gore Sinaj v Arabiji in se nanaša na |isto kategorijo| in pripada v isto kategorijo s sedanjim Jeruzalemom, ker je v suženjstvu skupaj s svojimi otroki. 
[4:26] Toda Jeruzalem, ki je zgoraj, ( Mesijansko Kristusovo kraljestvo), je svoboden in ta je naša mati. 
[4:27] Zakaj pisano je v Pismu: "Raduj se, o nerodovitna žena, ki nisi rodila otrok, spremeni se v radosten vrisk, ti, ki ne čutiš porodnih bolečin, kajti zapuščena žena ima veliko več otrok kakor tista, ki ima moža."  
[4:28] Toda mi, bratje, smo otroci [ ne po telesnem poreklu, kakor je bil Izmael, temveč] kakor Izak, rojeni po odliki obljube. 
[4:29] Vendar [ravno] kakor je takrat otrok [običajnega rojstva], rojen po mesu, preziral in preganjal tistega, [ki je bil rojen nenavadno], glede na [obljubo in delovanje] [Svetega] Duha, je tako tudi sedaj.  
[4:30] Toda kaj pravi Pismo? Izženi in pošlji stran sužnjo in njenega sina, kajti sin sužnje nikoli ne bo dedič in dediščine ne bo delil s sinom svobodne ženske.  
[4:31] Torej bratje, mi, [ki smo ponovno rojeni], nismo otroci sužnje [ naravne], temveč iz svobodne, [ nadnaravne]. 
[5:1] V [tej] svobodi nas je Kristus rešil [in nas popolnoma osvobodil]; stojte torej trdno in se ne dajte motiti in zapeljati v zanko in se ponovno podvreči jarmu suženjstva, [ki ste ga nekoč že sneli]. 
[5:2] Glejte, jaz sem Pavel, ki vam pravim, da če prejmete obrezo, vam Kristus ne bo nič koristil, (dajal prednost, smisel), [ kajti če ne zaupate Njemu, od Njega nič ne morete pridobiti]. 
[5:3] Še enkrat ugovarjam in pričujem vsakomur, ki prejme obrezo, da je dolžan in zavezan izpolnjevati vso postavo in njene obrede. 
[5:4] Če iščete, da bi bili opravičeni in razglašeni za pravične in bi vam bil skozi postavo dan pravilen odnos z Bogom, niste ničesar pridobili in ste tako (strogo) ločeni od Kristusa. Odpadli ste proč od milosti, (od Božje milostne naklonjenosti in nezasluženega blagoslova). 
[5:5] Kajti mi se [ne zanašamo na postavo, temveč] preko [pomoči] [Svetega] Duha po veri pričakujemo in čakamo blagoslov in dobro, za katero nam naša pravičnost in pravi odnos z Bogom, [naša soglasnost Njegovi volji v namenu, mišljenju in delovanju, povzroča], da upamo. 
[5:6] Kajti [če smo] v Kristusu Jezusu, niti obreza niti neobreza ne štejeta za karkoli, temveč samo vera sprožena in spodbujena in izražena in delujoča skozi ljubezen. 
[5:7] Veličastno ste tekli dirko. Kdo vas je motil, (oviral in ustavljal od) vašega upoštevanja in sledenja resnici? 
[5:8] To [hudobno] prepričanje ni od Tistega, ki vas je poklical, [ki vas je povabil k svobodi v Kristusu]. 
[5:9] Malo kvasa, (majhna nagnjenost k napaki ali nekaj lažnih učiteljev) skvasi vse testo, [popači celotno pojmovanje vere ali zavede celotno cerkev]. 
[5:10] [Kar se mene tiče] imam zaupanje [do vas] v Gospodu, da ne boste sprejeli nobenih nasprotujočih si pogledov o tej zadevi, ampak boste prišli, da razmišljate z menoj. Toda kdor vas bega, kdorkoli je že, bo moral prenašati kazen. 
[5:11] Toda, bratje, če še vedno oznanjam obrezo, [kakor me nekateri obtožujejo, da to počnem kot potrebno za rešitev duše], zakaj še vedno trpim preganjanje? V tem primeru je križ prenehal biti ovira in je izgubil smisel, (je odpravljen). 
[5:12] Želim si, da bi tisti, ki vas vznemirjajo in begajo, [ šli do konca in] sami sebe odrezali! 
[5:13] Kajti vi, bratje, ste bili [resnično] poklicani v svobodo; le [ne dopustite, da bi bila vaša] svoboda spodbuda vašemu mesu in priložnost ali izgovor [za sebičnost], temveč naj bi skozi ljubezen služili drug drugemu. 
[5:14] Kajti vsa postava [v zvezi s človeškimi odnosi] je zajeta v eni zapovedi: "Svojega bližnjega naj bi ljubil kakor [ljubiš] samega sebe."  
[5:15] Če pa se med seboj grizete in obžirate [v strankarskem sporu], bodite previdni, da se vi [in vaša celotna skupnost] med seboj ne uničite. 
[5:16] Toda pravim: hodite in živite [vedno] v [Svetem] Duhu, [odzivni in poslušni in vodeni po Duhu]; potem zagotovo ne boste stregli hrepenenjem in željam mesa, (človeške narave brez Boga). 
[5:17] Kajti želje mesa nasprotujejo [Svetemu] Duhu, [želje] Duha pa nasprotujejo mesu, (brezbožni človeški naravi); kajti ta |dva| si med seboj nasprotujeta, [si nenehno zoperstavljata in sta v sporu drug z drugim] tako, da niste svobodni, temveč vam je preprečeno delati to, kar si želite. 
[5:18] Toda če ste vodeni, (sledite) [Svetemu] Duhu, niste pod postavo. 
[5:19] Sedaj so dela (navade) mesa jasne (očitne): to so nečistovanje, nečistost, nespodobnost, 
[5:20] malikovanje, čarovništvo, sovraštvo, prepir, ljubosumnost, jeza (vzkipljivost), sebičnost, nesloga (razhajanja), duh strankarstva (skupine, ločine z nenavadnimi mnenji, krivoverstva), 
[5:21] nevoščljivost, pijančevanje, veseljačenja in kar je še takega. Vnaprej vas svarim, kakor sem to delal prej, da tisti, ki počenjajo takšne stvari, ne bodo podedovali Božjega kraljestva. 
[5:22] Toda sad [Svetega] Duha, [delo, ki ga Njegova notranja prisotnost doseže], pa je ljubezen, radost (zadovoljnost), mir, potrpežljivost (miren značaj, potrpljenje), prijaznost, dobrota (blagohotnost), zvestoba, 
[5:23] milina (krotkost, ponižnost), samoobvladovanje (samokontrola, vzdržnost). Zoper te stvari ni postave, [ ki bi lahko prinesla obtožbo]. 
[5:24] Tisti pa, ki pripadajo Kristusu Jezusu (Mesiju), so križali meso, (brezbožno človeško naravo), skupaj z njenimi strastmi in poželenji in željami. 
[5:25] Če živimo po [Svetem] Duhu, tudi hodimo po Duhu. [Če imamo po Svetem Duhu svoje življenje v Bogu, pojdimo naprej hodeč v vrsti, naša dela naj bodo vodena po Duhu]. 
[5:26] Ne postanimo naduti in domišljavi, tekmovalni in kljubovalni in izzivalni in dražeči drug do drugega, ne zavidajmo in ne bodimo ljubosumni drug na drugega. 
[6:1] BRATJE, ČE je kdorkoli zasačen v prestopku ali grehu kakršnekoli vrste, naj bi ga vi, ki ste duhovni, [ki ste občutljivi na |Duha| in vodeni po Duhu], pravilno usmerili in obnovili in ponovno postavili, brez občutka večvrednosti in z vso nežnostjo, imajoč pri tem pozorno oko na sebi, da ne bi bili tudi sami skušani. 
[6:2] Nosite, (potrpite, prenašajte), bremena drug drugega in mučne moralne krivde in na ta način izpolnite in se popolnoma držite postave Kristusa (Mesije) in dopolnite, kar še manjka [v vaši ubogljivosti le-tej]. 
[6:3] Če kdorkoli zase misli, da je kaj, [preveč pomemben, da bi se ponižal in si naložil breme drugega], ko ni nič [večvrednega, razen po njegovi lastni oceni], goljufa in zavaja in vara samega sebe. 
[6:4] Toda vsakdo naj pazljivo pregleda in preišče in preizkusi svoje lastno vedenje in svoje lastno delo. Potem ima lahko osebno zadovoljstvo in radost, da je naredil nekaj [ samo po sebi] priporočljivega, ne da bi se [obrnil k] bahavi primerjavi s svojim sosedom. 
[6:5] Kajti vsakdo bo namreč moral nositi ( biti enakovreden v razumevanju in mirno sprejeti) svojo lastno [ majhno] breme [morečih krivd]. 
[6:6] Naj tisti, ki prejema pouk v [Božji] Besedi, vse dobre stvari deli s svojim učiteljem, [prispeva k njegovi podpori]. 
[6:7] Ne dajte se zapeljati in zavesti in zavajati; Bog Sebi ne bo dopustil, da bi bil v posmeh, (zaničevan, preziran ali zasmehovan z zgolj nadutostjo ali izjavami ali z Njegovimi navodili postavljen ob stran.) [On neizogibno zavaja tistega, ki si prizadeva zavesti Boga.] Kajti karkoli človek seje, to in samo to je to, kar bo požel. 
[6:8] Kajti kdor seje v svoje lastno meso, (spodnjo naravo, čutnost), bo od mesa žel propad in rušenje in uničenje, toda kdor seje v Duha, bo od Duha žel večno življenje. 
[6:9] In ne izgubljajmo srca in ne postanimo naveličani in ne popuščajmo v plemenitem delovanju in pravilnem ravnanju, kajti želi bomo pravočasno in ob določenem pravem času, če le ne popustimo in ne izgubimo našega poguma in ne oslabimo. 
[6:10] Torej ko se pokaže prilika in se nam odpre priložnost, delajmo [ moralno] dobro vsem ljudem, [ne samo, da smo jim koristni ali v dobiček, temveč da delamo tudi to, kar je za njihovo duhovno dobro in napredek]. Pazite na to, da boste v blagoslov, še posebej tistim iz družine verujočih, [tistih, ki z vami pripadajo Božji družini, vernikom]. 
[6:11] Glejte s kako velikimi črkami vam pišem s svojo lastno roko. [ Dobro si zapomnite moje zaključne besede.] 
[6:12] Tisti, ki hočejo narediti dober vtis in dobro predstavo v mesu, vas silijo, da prejmeto obrezo, preprosto zato, da oni lahko ubežijo pred preganjanjem zvestobi križa Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija, Maziljenca). 
[6:13] Kajti celo obrezani [Judje] sami se [resnično] ne držijo postave, ampak vas hočejo imeti obrezane zato, da bi lahko slavili v vašem mesu, (vaši podreditvi zunanjim obredom). 
[6:14] Toda daleč naj bo od mene to, da bi slavil [v čimerkoli ali komerkoli], razen v križu našega Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa (Mesija), skozi katerega je bil svet križan zame, jaz pa svetu! 
[6:15] Kajti [zdaj] niti obreza nič ne velja, niti neobreza, temveč [samo] nova stvaritev, [rezultat novega rojstva in novega značaja v Kristusu Jezusu, Mesiju]. 
[6:16] Mir in usmiljenje naj bosta nad vsemi, ki hodijo po tem pravilu, [ki se vzgajajo in svoja življenja uravnavajo po teh načelih], celo nad [resničnim] Božjim Izraelom!  
[6:17] Od sedaj naprej naj mi nihče ne dela težav, [da bi mi bilo potrebno braniti mojo avtoriteto apostola in božansko resničnost mojega evangelija], kajti na svojem telesu nosim [vžgane] znake Gospoda Jezusa, [rane, brazgotine in druge zunanje dokaze preganjanj – ti pričajo o Njegovi lastnini nad menoj]! 
[6:18] Milost, (duhovna naklonjenost, blagoslov) našega Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, (Maziljenca, Mesija) naj bo z vašim Duhom, bratje. Amen (tako naj bo).
