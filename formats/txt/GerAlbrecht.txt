[1:1] Heil dem, der nicht einhergeht nach der Frevler Weise, / Der sich nicht einläßt auf den Weg der Sünder / Noch in der Spötter Kreis sich mischt, 
[1:2] Der vielmehr am Gesetze Jahwes sich ergötzt / Und Tag und Nacht darüber forschend sinnt! 
[1:3] So gleicht er einem Baum, gepflanzt an Wasserbächen, / Der seine Früchte bringt zu rechter Zeit / Und dessen Blätterschmuck nicht welkt: / Sein ganzes Tun gerät ihm wohl. 
[1:4] Ganz anders ist es mit den Frevlern! / Sie werden wie die Spreu vom Wind verweht. 
[1:5] Drum können auch die Frevler im Gericht nicht bestehn / Noch Sünder bleiben unter den Gerechten. 
[1:6] Denn Jahwe kennt der Gerechten Weg, / Der Weg der Frevler aber endet im Verderben! 
[2:1] Warum sind die Heiden so wild erregt? / Warum sinnen die Völker, was nichtig ist? 
[2:2] Der Erde Könige lehnen sich auf, / Und die Würdenträger beraten sich / Wider Jahwe und seinen Gesalbten: 
[2:3] "Auf, laßt uns sprengen ihre Bande / Und von uns werfen ihre Seile!" 
[2:4] Der in den Himmeln thronet, lacht, / Adonái spottet ihrer. 
[2:5] Dann aber redet er sie an im Zorn / Und wird sie schrecken in seinem Grimm: 
[2:6] "Ich habe meinen König eingesetzt / auf Zion, meinem heilgen Berg!" 
[2:7] "Ich will verkünden Jahwes Spruch: / Er hat mir gesagt: 'Mein Sohn bist du, / Ich habe dich heute gezeugt! 
[2:8] Fordre von mir, so geb ich dir Völker zum Erbe / Und die Enden der Erde zum Eigentum. 
[2:9] Du sollst sie zerschmettern mit eisernem Stab, / Wie Töpfergeschirr sie zerschlagen!'" 
[2:10] Nun denn, ihr Könige, seid verständig! / Lasset euch warnen, ihr Richter auf Erden! 
[2:11] Dienet Jahwe mit Ehrfurcht / Und jubelt ihm zu mit Zittern! 
[2:12] Küsset den Sohn, damit er nicht zürne / Und ihr umkommet auf euerm Weg! / Denn bald wird sein Zorn entbrennen. / Heil allen, die bei ihm Zuflucht suchen! 
[3:1] Ein Psalm Davids, als er vor seinem Sohne Absalom floh. 
[3:2] Jahwe, wie sind meiner Dränger so viel! / Viele erheben sich wider mich. 
[3:3] Gar manche sagen von mir: / "Er findet keine Hilfe bei Gott." Sela. 
[3:4] Du aber, Jahwe, bist mir ein Schild, / Du, mein Ruhm, du erhebst mein Haupt. 
[3:5] Zu Jahwe rufe ich laut, / Und er erhöret mich von seinem heiligen Berge. Sela. 
[3:6] Ich legte mich nieder und schlummerte ein; / Nun bin ich erwacht, weil Jahwe mich stützt. 
[3:7] Vor viel Scharen Kriegsvolk fürcht ich mich nicht, / Die sich ringsum wider mich lagern. 
[3:8] Auf, Jahwe! Hilf mir, mein Gott! / Du hast ja stets all meine Feinde ins Antlitz geschlagen, / Du hast der Frevler Zähne zerschmettert. Bei Jahwe ist Hilfe. / Dein Segen komme über dein Volk! Sela. 
[4:1] Dem Sangmeister, mit Saitenspielbegleitung. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[4:2] Wenn ich rufe, erhöre mich, Gott meines Heils! / Du hast mich ja schon aus Drangsal errettet; / So sei mir nun gnädig und hör mein Gebet! 
[4:3] Ihr Männer von Ansehn, wie lange wollt ihr meine Ehre schänden, / Indem ihr das Nichtige liebt und auf Lügen sinnt? Sela. 
[4:4] Wisset, daß Jahwe mich reich begnadet: Jahwe hört, wenn ich zu ihm rufe. 
[4:5] Wollt ihr zürnen, so sündigt doch nicht! / Prüft euer Herz im stillen und schweigt! Sela. 
[4:6] Bringt rechte Opfer und traut auf Jahwe! 
[4:7] Viele sagen: "Wer läßt uns Gutes schaun?" / O, erheb über uns das Licht deines Angesichts, Jahwe! 
[4:8] Du hast mir Freude ins Herz gegeben; / Das ist ein besserer Schatz als all ihr Korn und Most. Nun will ich in Frieden mich niederlegen zum Schlaf; / Denn du, o Jahwe, lässest mich ungestört und sicher wohnen. 
[5:1] Dem Sangmeister, auf Flöten(?). Ein Psalm Davids. 
[5:2] Höre, Jahwe, meine Worte, / Merke auf mein Seufzen! 
[5:3] Horch auf mein Hilferufen, / Mein König und mein Gott, / Denn ich will zu dir beten! 
[5:4] Am Morgen höre, Jahwe, meine Stimme! / Am Morgen richt ich (mein Gebet) zu dir / Und schaue (nach Erhörung) aus. 
[5:5] Denn nicht ein Gott, dem Böses wohlgefällt, bist du; / Der Frevler darf nicht bei dir weilen. 
[5:6] Nicht dürfen Prahler vor dein Auge treten, / Du hassest alle Übeltäter. 
[5:7] Du bringst die Lügenredner um; / Wer mit Mord und Tücke umgeht, den verabscheut Jahwe. 
[5:8] Ich aber darf ob deiner reichen Gnade in dein Haus eingehn, / Ich darf vor deinem heilgen Tempel niederknien in deiner Frucht. 
[5:9] Jahwe, leite mich in deiner Gerechtigkeit um meiner Feinde willen; / Ebne deinen Weg vor mir! 
[5:10] Denn in ihrem Munde ist keine Wahrheit, / Ihr Herz ist voller Frevel. / Ein offenes Grab ist ihre Kehle, / Mit ihrer Zunge schmeicheln sie. 
[5:11] Laß sie büßen, Elohim, / Daß sie in ihren Plänen scheitern! / Ob ihrer Sünden Menge stoße sie hinweg, / Denn sie sind widerspenstig gegen dich! 
[5:12] Doch freuen laß sich alle, die bei dir Zuflucht suchen; / Auf ewig laß sie jauchzen, da du sie beschirmst! / Frohlocken werden in dir alle, / Die deinen Namen lieben. Denn du, o Jahwe, segnest den Gerechten. / Gleich einem Schild umgibst du ihn mit Huld. 
[6:1] Dem Sangmeister mit Saitenspielbegleitung, in der achten Tonart(?). / Ein Psalm Davids. 
[6:2] Jahwe, nicht in deinem Zorne strafe mich, / Und nicht in deinem Grimme züchtige mich! 
[6:3] Sei mir, o Jahwe, gnädig; denn ich bin verschmachtet! / Heile mich, o Jahwe, denn meine Glieder beben! 
[6:4] Ja, meine Seele ist gar sehr erschrocken; / Du aber, Jahwe, — wie so lange!? 
[6:5] Wende dich doch wieder zu mir, Jahwe, rette meine Seele, / Hilf mir um deiner Gnade willen! 
[6:6] Denn im Totenreich gedenket man dein nicht, / Wer könnte in der Unterwelt dich preisen? 
[6:7] Erschöpft bin ich von meinem Seufzen, / Ich schwemme jede Nacht mein Bett (mit Tränen), / Mit meinen Zähren netze ich mein Lager. 
[6:8] Verdunkelt ist vor Gram mein Auge, / Gealtert wegen aller meiner Dränger. 
[6:9] Hinweg von mir, ihr Übeltäter alle! / Denn Jahwe hat gehört mein lautes Weinen. 
[6:10] Hören wird Jahwe auf mein Flehn, / Jahwe wird mein Gebet annehmen. Zuschanden werden und gar sehr erschrecken müssen alle meine Feinde, / Sie weichen vor Scham gar plötzlich. 
[7:1] Ein Gedicht(?) Davids, das er Jahwe sang wegen der Reden des Benjaminiten Kusch. 
[7:2] Jahwe, mein Gott, bei dir such ich Schutz, / Hilf mir von all meinen Drängern und rette mich, 
[7:3] Daß sie mich nicht wie Löwen zerfleischen, / Mich nicht zermalmen, weil niemand mich rettet! 
[7:4] Jahwe, mein Gott, hab ich solches verübt, / Findet sich Unrecht an meinen Händen; 
[7:5] Hab ich meinem Freunde Böses getan, / Und meinen Gegner grundlos geplündert: 
[7:6] So verfolge der Feind mich und hole mich ein, / Er trete mein Leben zu Boden / Und leg in den Staub meine Ehre! Sela. 
[7:7] Jahwe steh auf in deinem Zorn, / Steh auf wider meiner Dränger Grimm, / Wach auf, mir zur Hilfe, du hast ja Gericht verordnet! 
[7:8] Die Schar der Völker laß dich umringen, / Und über ihr kehre zur Höhe zurück! 
[7:9] Jahwe richtet die Völker: / Schaffe mir Recht, o Jahwe, / Nach meiner Gerechtigkeit und Unschuld! 
[7:10] Laß doch enden der Frevler Bosheit / Und stärke die Frommen! / Du prüfest ja Herzen und Nieren, / Gerechter Gott! 
[7:11] Meinen Schild hält Gott, / Der den redlichen Herzen hilft. 
[7:12] Ein gerechter Richter ist Elohim / Und ein Gott, der täglich zürnt. 
[7:13] Bekehrt sich der Sünder nicht, so schärft er sein Schwert, / Hält seinen Bogen gespannt und zielt; 
[7:14] Er richtet gegen ihn Todesgeschosse, / Seine Pfeile macht er zu Feuerbränden. 
[7:15] Sieh, Frevel empfängt der Böse: / Dann geht er schwanger mit Unheil und wird Trug gebären. 
[7:16] Er hat eine Grube gegraben und ausgehöhlt / Und sinkt in den Abgrund, den er gemacht. 
[7:17] Das Unheil, das er geplant, fällt auf sein Haupt zurück, / Und auf seinen Scheitel stürzt sein Frevel. Danken will ich Jahwe für sein gerechtes Walten / Und lobsingen dem Namen Jahwes, des Höchsten. 
[8:1] Dem Sangmeister, auf der Gittit. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[8:2] Jahwe, unser Herrscher, / Wie herrlich ist dein Name auf der ganzen Erde! / Deine Hoheit zeigst du droben im Himmel. 
[8:3] Aus Kinder- und Säuglingsmund hast du ein Bollwerk gegründet / Deinen Widersachern zum Trutz, / Um Feind und Empörer zum Schweigen zu bringen. 
[8:4] So oft ich die Himmel betrachte, deiner Hände Werk, / Den Mond und die Sterne, die du bereitet: 
[8:5] Was ist da der Mensch, daß du sein gedenkst, / Und der Menschensohn, daß du für ihn so liebreich sorgst? 
[8:6] Du hast ihn nur wenig geringer gemacht als die himmlischen Wesen, / Mit Ehre und Würde hast du ihn gekrönt. 
[8:7] Du hast ihn zum Herrscher gemacht über deiner Hände Werke, / Alles hast du ihm unter die Füße gelegt: 
[8:8] Schafe und Rinder insgesamt, / Dazu auch die Tiere der Felder, 
[8:9] Die Vögel des Himmels und die Fische im Meer. / Auch durchzieht er die Bahnen der Meere. Jahwe, unser Herrscher, / Wie herrlich ist dein Name auf der ganzen Erde! 
[9:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Melodie des Liedes:) "Stirb für den Sohn" (?). Ein Psalm Davids. 
[9:2] Anbetend preisen will ich Jahwe von ganzem Herzen, / All deine Wunder will ich erzählen; 
[9:3] Auch will ich mich freuen und jauchzen in dir; / Aufspielen deinem Namen, du Höchster! 
[9:4] Bedenk ich doch: meine Feinde sind rückwärts gewichen, / Sie sind gestrauchelt und umgekommen vor dir. 
[9:5] Denn du hast mein Recht geführt und meine Sache, / Du sitzest auf dem Thron als ein gerechter Richter. 
[9:6] Grimmig schaltest du Völker, verderbtest den Frevler, / Ihren Namen hast du vertilgt auf immer und ewig. 
[9:7] Ha die Feinde! Dahin sind sie, vernichtet für immer; / Ihre Städte hast du zerstört, vertilgt ihr Gedächtnis: 
[9:8] Während Jahwe auf ewig thront; / Er hat zum Gericht seinen Stuhl gestellt. 
[9:9] Er richtet den Erdkreis recht, / Er spricht den Völkern ein gerades Urteil. 
[9:10] Werden wird Jahwe ein Hort dem Bedrückten, / Ein Hort in Zeiten der Not. 
[9:11] Drum trauen dir, die deinen Namen kennen; / Denn du verlässest nicht, die dich, o Jahwe, suchen. 
[9:12] Singt Jahwe, der auf Zion wohnt, / Verkündet inmitten der Völker sein Tun! 
[9:13] Denn als Rächer des Bluts hat er ihrer gedacht, / Nicht vergessen des Schreiens der Dulder. 
[9:14] Gnädig sei mir, o Jahwe! Sieh an das Leid, / Das mir meine Hasser bereiten, — / Du, der mich erhebt aus des Todes Toren! 
[9:15] Dann will ich erzählen all deinen Ruhm; / In den Toren der Tochter Zion / Will ich ob deiner Hilfe jubeln. 
[9:16] Tief sind versunken die Völker / In der Grube, die sie gegraben; / In dem Netz, das sie heimlich gelegt, / Hat sich ihr Fuß gefangen. 
[9:17] Kund geworden ist Jahwe: er hat Gericht geübt; / In seiner Hände Werk / Hat sich der Böse verstrickt. (Higgajôn, Sela.) 
[9:18] Ja, müssen die Frevler zur Hölle fahren, / Alle Heiden, die Gottes vergessen. 
[9:19] Kann denn des Armen auf immer vergessen werden? / Ist's mit der Elenden Hoffnung aus für ewig? 
[9:20] Komm, Jahwe, daß der Mensch nicht trotze, / Laß die Heiden vor dir gerichtet werden! Schick ihnen, Jahwe, Schreckenswarnung! / Dann erkennen die Heiden, daß sie nur sterbliche Menschen sind. Sela. 
[10:1] Lang schon, Jahwe, stehst du fern! / Warum verbirgst du dich zur Zeit der Not? 
[10:2] Beim Übermut der Frevler muß sich der Dulder ängsten: / Möchten sie gefangen werden in den Ränken, die sie ausgedacht! 
[10:3] Denn der Frevler rühmt sich des, was sein Herz begehrt, / Der Ungerechte schmäht und höhnet Jahwe. 
[10:4] Der Böse denkt in seinem Stolz: "Er strafet nicht; / Es ist kein Gott!" Dahin geht all sein Denken. 
[10:5] Was er sich vornimmt, das gelingt ihm stets; / Es bleiben deine Strafgerichte himmelweit entfernt von ihm. / All seine Widersacher schnaubt er zornig an. 
[10:6] Er denkt: "Ich wanke nimmer, / Für alle Zukunft komm ich nicht in Not." 
[10:7] Sein Mund ist voll Verwünschung, Lug und Trug; / An seiner Zunge kleben Unheil und Verderben. 
[10:8] Er liegt im Hinterhalt in den Gehöften, / Er mordet insgeheim Unschuldige; / Es spähen seine Augen nach den Schwachen. 
[10:9] Er lauert im Versteck gleich einem Löwen, der im Dickicht liegt, / Er lauert, um den Armen zu erhaschen, / Er hascht den Armen, schleift ihn weg in seinem Netz. 
[10:10] Er duckt sich, kauert nieder, / In seine Klauen fallen die Wehrlosen. 
[10:11] Er denkt in seinem Herzen: "Gott vergißt es, / Verbirgt sein Antlitz, sieht es nimmer." 
[10:12] Komm, stehe auf, o Jahwe El!, erhebe deine Hand! / Vergiß nicht der Gebeugten! 
[10:13] Warum darf denn der Frevler lästern Elohim, / In seinem Herzen denken: "Nun, du strafst doch nicht?" 
[10:14] Richtend aber siehst du es, du schauest Müh und Herzeleid, / Um sie (den Frevlern) zu vergelten! / Auf dich verlässet sich der Schwache, / Und dem Verwaisten zeigst du dich als Helfer. 
[10:15] Schmettre doch des Frevlers Arm zu Boden! / Des Bösen Unrecht strafe, daß er vor dir schwinde! 
[10:16] Jahwe ist König auf immer und ewig, / Die Heiden verschwinden aus seinem Land. 
[10:17] Treulich hörst du, o Jahwe, den Wunsch der Dulder, / Du stärkest ihr Herz, du neigest ihnen dein Ohr. 
[10:18] Schaffst du den Waisen, den Bedrückten Recht, / So wird der Mensch, der Erdenwurm, nicht länger trotzen. 
[11:1] Dem Sangmeister. Von David. / Auf Jahwe trau ich! / wie könnt ihr mir da raten: / Flieh wie ein Vogel ins Gebirge! 
[11:2] Denn sieh, die Frevler spannen den Bogen, / sie haben den Pfeil auf die Sehne gelegt, / Im Dunkeln zu schießen auf solche, die redlichen Herzens sind. 
[11:3] Wenn die Grundpfeiler niederstürzen, / Was vermöchte da der Gerechte?" 
[11:4] Jahwe wohnt in seinem heiligen Tempel, / Jahwes Thron ist im Himmel: / Seine Augen schauen, / Seine Blicke prüfen die Menschenkinder. 
[11:5] Jahwe prüft den Gerechten; / Die Frevler und alle, die Unrecht lieben, die hasset er. 
[11:6] Er läßt auf die Frevler Feuerkohlen und Schwefel regnen, / Versengender Glutwind ist ihr Teil. 
[11:7] Denn Jahwe ist gerecht, er liebt Gerechtigkeit. / Die Frommen schauen sein Angesicht! 
[12:1] Dem Sangmeister, in der achten Tonart (?). Ein Psalm Davids. 
[12:2] Hilf, Jahwe, denn die Frommen sind dahin! / Die Treue schwindet bei den Menschenkindern. 
[12:3] Sie reden miteinander Lüge, / Doppelzüngig reden sie mit schmeichlerischen Lippen. 
[12:4] Es rotte Jahwe alle Schmeichellippen aus / Und jede prahlerische Zunge. 
[12:5] Sie sprechen: "Wir sind stark durch unsre Zunge; / Wenn unsre Lippen mit uns sind, wer ist dann unser Herr?" 
[12:6] "Weil die Dulder leiden müssen, weil die Armen seufzen, / Will ich mich nun erheben", so spricht Jahwe, / "Will Hilfe senden dem, der danach schmachtet." 
[12:7] Jahwes Worte sind lautre Worte: / Silber, das in der Werkstatt gereinigt zur Erde fließt, / Geläutert siebenfach. 
[12:8] Du, Jahwe, wirst sie schirmen, / Wirst sie vor diesen Menschen für immer bewahren. Es schreiten ringsum Frevler stolz einher, / Weil niedrige Gemeinheit hochkommt bei den Menschenkindern. 
[13:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[13:2] Wie lange, Jahwe, willst du mein so ganz vergessen, / Wie lange noch dein Angesicht vor mir verbergen? 
[13:3] Wie lange soll ich mich mit Sorgen quälen / Und Kummer in mir nähren Tag für Tag? / Wie lange soll mein Feind sich noch erheben über mich? 
[13:4] Schau her, erhöre mich, Jahwe, mein Gott! / Mach meine Augen hell, damit ich nicht in Todesschlaf versinke! 
[13:5] Sonst könnte ja mein Feind sich rühmen: / "Ich hab ihn bezwungen", / Und meine Dränger könnten jubeln, daß ich wanke. 
[13:6] Doch ich vertrau auf deine Gnade; / Jauchzen soll mein Herz ob deines Heils. / Preisen will ich Jahwe: er hat mir wohlgetan! 
[14:1] Dem Sangmeister. Von David. / Die Toren denken bei sich: "Es ist kein Gott." / Verderbt, abscheulich handeln sie; / Da ist keiner, der Gutes tut. 
[14:2] Jahwe schaut vom Himmel herab auf die Menschenkinder, / Daß er sehe, ob jemand Einsicht habe / Und frage nach Gott. 
[14:3] Aber sie alle sind abgefallen, alle entartet; / Da ist keiner, der Gutes tut, / Auch nicht ein einziger. 
[14:4] "Sind denn so unvernünftig alle Übeltäter, / Die mein Volk verzehren, wie man Brot verzehrt, / Die nicht zu Jahwe beten?" 
[14:5] Dann beben sie schaudernd, / Denn Gott weilt bei dem gerechten Volk. 
[14:6] Mögt ihr auch vereiteln der Dulder Wunsch — / Jahwe bleibt doch ihre Zuflucht. 
[14:7] Ach, käme aus Zion für Israel Heil! / Wendet Jahwe das Los seines Volks, / So wird Jakob sich freun und Israel jauchzen. 
[15:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Wer darf in deinem Zelte weilen, Jahwe, / Wer darf auf deinem heilgen Berge wohnen? 
[15:2] Er, der unsträflich wandelt und das Rechte tut, / Der Wahres denkt in seinem Herzen. 
[15:3] Er verleumdet nicht mit seiner Zunge, / Fügt einem andern nichts Böses zu / Und bringt nicht Schimpf auf seinen Nächsten. 
[15:4] Gering ist er in seinen eignen Augen und verachtet; / Doch ehrt er die, die Jahwe fürchten. / Wenn er auch schwört zu seinem eignen Schaden — / Er ändert es doch nicht. 
[15:5] Sein Geld leiht er nicht aus auf Zins, / Er läßt sich nicht bestechen zum Schaden von Unschuldigen. / Wer so handelt, der wird in Ewigkeit nicht wanken. 
[16:1] Ein Gedicht (?) von David. / Behüte mich, Gott, denn ich fliehe zu dir! 
[16:2] Ich spreche zu Jahwe: "Mein Herr bist du, / Du bist mein höchstes Gut." 
[16:3] Und zu den Heiligen, die im Lande sind, (sag ich): / "Das sind die Herrlichen, an ihnen hab ich meine Lust." 
[16:4] Viel Qualen warten derer, die andern Göttern dienen. / Nicht will ich ihre Blut-Trankopfer spenden / Noch ihre Namen auf meine Lippen nehmen. 
[16:5] Jahwe ist mein Erbteil und mein Becher, / Du bewahrst mein Los. 
[16:6] Ich empfing mein Teil in lieblichem Lande, / Ein solches Erbe gefällt mir wohl. 
[16:7] Ich preise Jahwe, der mich beraten, / Auch des Nachts mahnt mich dazu mein Gewissen. 
[16:8] Ich halte mir Jahwe beständig vor Augen. / Ist er mir zur Rechten, so wanke ich nicht. 
[16:9] Drum freut sich mein Herz und frohlockt meine Seele, / Auch mein Leib ist sicher geborgen. 
[16:10] Denn du gibst meine Seele dem Tode nicht preis. / Du läßt deinen Frommen das Grab nicht schaun. 
[16:11] Du wirst mir zeigen den Lebenspfad: / Vor deinem Antlitz ist Fülle an Freuden, / In deiner rechten sind ewige Wonnen. 
[17:1] Ein Gebet Davids. / Höre, Jahwe, meine gerechte Bitte, vernimm mein Flehen! / Merk auf mein Gebet, das nicht von falschen Lippen kommt! 
[17:2] Von deinem Antlitz geh mein Urteil aus, / Denn deine Augen sehen recht! 
[17:3] Prüfst du mein Herz, durchforschest du mich des Nachts / Und läuterst mich — so findest du nichts Böses: / Denk ich Arges — es kommt nicht über meinen Mund. 
[17:4] Seh ich der Menschen Tun und Treiben, so hüt ich mich, treu deinem Wort, / Vor der Schadenstifter Pfaden. 
[17:5] Meine Schritte wandeln fest in deinen Wegen, / Meine Tritte wanken nicht. 
[17:6] So ruf ich zu dir, denn du erhörest mich, Gott. / Neig mir dein Ohr, vernimm mein Wort! 
[17:7] Erzeig mir deine wunderbare Gnade, du Retter derer, / Die sich vor ihren Widersachern / Bei deiner starken Hand zu bergen suchen. 
[17:8] Bewahre du mich wie den Augenstern! / Birg mich im Schatten deiner Flügel 
[17:9] Vor den Frevlern, die mich vergewaltigen, / Vor meinen grimmen Feinden, die sich um mich scharen! 
[17:10] Ihr stolzes Herz verschließen sie, / Mit ihrem Munde reden sie voll Übermut. 
[17:11] Auf Schritt und Tritt umringen sie uns jetzt, / Es spähen ihre Augen, wie sie uns zu Boden werfen. 
[17:12] Sie gleichen einem Löwen, der nach Beute giert, / Und einem jungen Leu, der im Verstecke lauert. 
[17:13] Auf, Jahwe! Tritt ihnen entgegen, strecke sie nieder! / Vor den Frevlern rette mich durch dein Schwert! 
[17:14] Rette mich von den Menschen durch deine Hand, o Jahwe, / Rette mich von den Leuten dieser Welt! / Sie haben ihr Teil in diesem Leben, / Und du füllst ihren Bauch mit deinen Schätzen. / Sie haben Söhne die Menge / Und lassen ihren Kindern großen Reichtum. 
[17:15] Ich aber will dein Antlitz schauen in Gerechtigkeit, / Ich werde mich sättigen, wenn ich erwache, an deinem Anblick. 
[18:1] Dem Sangmeister. Vom Knechte Jahwes, von David, der vor Jahwe die Worte dieses Liedes redete, als ihn Jahwe errettet hatte aus der Hand aller seiner Feinde, auch aus der Hand Sauls. 
[18:2] Er sprach: Von Herzen lieb ich dich, Jahwe, meine Stärke! 
[18:3] Jahwe, mein Fels, meine Burg, mein Retter bist du! / Mein Gott ist mein Hort, zu dem ich fliehe. / Mein Schild, das Horn meines Heils, meine Feste ist er. 
[18:4] Preiswürdig, ruf ich, ist Jahwe, / Ich ward errettet von meinen Feinden! 
[18:5] Des Todes Stricke umfingen mich, / Verderbliche Bäche schreckten mich; 
[18:6] Der Unterwelt Bande umringten mich, / Es ergriffen mich Schlingen des Todes. 
[18:7] In meiner Angst rief ich Jahwe an / Und schrie zu meinem Gott. / Da vernahm er mein Beten aus seinem Palast, / Mein Schreien drang in seine Ohren. 
[18:8] Es wankte und schwankte die Erde, / Der Berge Grundfesten bebten / Und zitterten, weil er zornig war. 
[18:9] In seiner Nase stieg Rauch empor, / Aus seinem Munde fraß Feuer, / Glühende Kohlen flammten aus ihm. 
[18:10] Er neigte den Himmel und fuhr herab, / Unter seinen Füßen war Wolkennacht. 
[18:11] Er fuhr auf dem Kerub und flog einher, / Schwebte auf den Schwingen des Windes. 
[18:12] Er machte Dunkel zu seiner Hülle, / Zu seinem Gezelte ringsumher; / Es umgab ihn Wasserflut und dickes Gewölk. 
[18:13] Vom Glanz vor ihm her durchzuckten die Wolken / Hagel und feurige Kohlen. 
[18:14] Es donnerte Jahwe vom Himmel her, / Der Höchste ließ seine Stimme schallen / (Mit Hagel und feurigen Kohlen). 
[18:15] Er schoß seine Pfeile, zerstreute sie. 
[18:16] Da wurden sichtbar die Betten des Meeres, / Bloßgelegt des Erdrunds Gründe / Vor deinem Schelten, Jahwe, / Vor deines Zornhauchs Schnauben. 
[18:17] Er griff aus der Höhe, erfaßte mich / Und zog mich aus tiefen Wassern. 
[18:18] Von meinem Todfeind befreite er mich, / Von meinen Hassern, die mir zu mächtig waren. 
[18:19] An meinem Unglückstag überfielen sie mich, / Aber Jahwe ward meine Stütze. 
[18:20] Er führte mich ins Freie hinaus; / Er rettete mich, weil er mich liebte. 
[18:21] Jahwe vergalt mir nach meiner Gerechtigkeit, / Nach meiner Hände Reinheit lohnte er mir. 
[18:22] Denn Jahwes Wege bin ich gewandelt, / Nicht abgefallen von meinem Gott. 
[18:23] Nein, all seine Rechte befolgte ich treu, / Von seinen Satzungen wich ich nicht. 
[18:24] Ich war ohne Tadel vor ihm / Und hütete mich vor Missetat. 
[18:25] Drum vergalt mir Jahwe nach meiner Gerechtigkeit, / Nach meiner Lauterkeit, die ihm bekannt. 
[18:26] Dem Guten erzeigst du dich gütig, / Mit dem redlichen Manne verfährst du redlich; 
[18:27] Dem Reinen zeigst du dich rein, / Dem Falschen vergiltst du nach seinem Verhalten. 
[18:28] Denn du hilfst den bedrückten Leuten, / Doch stolze Augen erniedrigst du. 
[18:29] Du machst meine Leuchte licht; / Jahwe, mein Gott, erhellet mein Dunkel. 
[18:30] Denn im Vertrauen auf dich greif ich Heerhaufen an, / Und mit meinem Gott überspringe ich Mauern. 
[18:31] Gottes Wege sind makellos, / Jahwes Wort ist bewährt; / Ein Schild ist er allen, die zu ihm fliehn. 
[18:32] Denn wer ist Eloah als Jahwe allein? / Und wer ist ein Hort außer unserem Gott? 
[18:33] Gott ist's, der mich mit Kraft gegürtet, / Der meinen Weg ohn Anstoß machte. 
[18:34] Er gab mir der Hindin Schnelligkeit / Und stellte mich auf die Höhen. 
[18:35] Er übte meine Hände zum Kampf, / Daß meine Arme den ehernen Bogen spannten. 
[18:36] Du gabst mir den Schild deines Heils, / Deine Rechte stützte mich, / Und deine Milde machte mich groß. 
[18:37] Du ließest mich frei meines Weges gehn, / Und meine Knöchel wankten nicht. 
[18:38] Ich verfolgte die Feinde und holte sie ein; / Ich kehrte nicht um, bis ich sie vernichtet. 
[18:39] Ich zerschellte sie, daß sie nimmer aufstanden, / Zu meinen Füßen sanken sie hin. 
[18:40] Du gürtetest mich mit Kraft zum Streit, / Du beugtest meine Gegner unter mich. 
[18:41] Meine Feinde ließest du vor mir fliehn, / Und meine Hasser zerschellte ich. 
[18:42] Sie schrien, aber kein Helfer war da; / Sie schrien zu Jahwe — er hörte sie nicht. 
[18:43] Ich zerrieb sie wie Staub vor dem Winde, / Wie Gassenkot zertrat ich sie. 
[18:44] Du halfst mir aus Volkesfehden, / Setztest mich ein zum Herrscher der Heiden: / Leute, mir unbekannt, wurden mir dienstbar. 
[18:45] Schon als sie hörten (von meinen Siegen), gehorchten sie mir, / Des Auslands Bewohner schmeichelten mir. 
[18:46] Des Auslands Bewohner welkten dahin / Und kamen zitternd aus ihren Burgen. 
[18:47] Jahwe lebt, mein Hort sei gepriesen, / Erhoben der Gott meines Heils, 
[18:48] Der Gott, der mir Rache verliehn / Und Völker mir unterworfen, 
[18:49] Der mich gerettet von meinen Feinden! / Über meine Gegner erhebst du mich. / Entreißt mich dem Mann der Gewalttat. 
[18:50] Drum preis ich dich, Jahwe, unter den Völkern, / Deinem Namen will ich lobsingen. Denn Jahwe schenkt seinem Könige Heil / Und erweiset Gnade seinem Gesalbten: / David und seinem Samen auf ewig! 
[19:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[19:2] Die Himmel erzählen Gottes Herrlichkeit. / Und seiner Hände Werk verkündiget die Feste. 
[19:3] Ein Tag meldet dem andern das Wort, / Eine Nacht bringt der andern die Kunde. 
[19:4] Dies ist keine Sprache, dies ist keine Rede, / Deren Stimme man nicht verstünde. 
[19:5] In alle Lande geht aus ihr Klang, / Ihr Ruf bis ans Ende der Erde. / Dort hat er der Sonne ein Zelt gesetzt. 
[19:6] Sie ist dem Bräutigam gleich, der hervortritt aus seinem Gemach, / Freut sich, wie ein Held zu laufen die Bahn. 
[19:7] Vom Ende des Himmels geht sie aus / Und läuft bis ans andere Ende. / Nichts bleibt verborgen vor ihrer Glut. 
[19:8] Jahwes Gesetz ist makellos, / Es erquicket die Seele. / Jahwes Zeugnis ist zuverlässig, / Es macht den Toren weise. 
[19:9] Jahwes Befehle sind richtig, / Sie erfreuen das Herz. / Jahwes Gebot ist lauter, / Es erleuchtet die Augen. 
[19:10] Jahwes Verehrung ist rein, / Sie bestehet für immer. / Jahwes Sprüche sind wahr, / Rechtschaffen zumal. 
[19:11] Köstlicher sind sie als Gold / Und viel gediegenes Gold. / Ja süßer sind sie als Honig / Und aus den Waben fließender Seim. 
[19:12] Auch wird dein Knecht durch sie belehrt; / Wer sie hält, hat großen Gewinn. 
[19:13] Wer ist sich aller Vergehen bewußt? / Von verborgenen Sünden sprich mich los! 
[19:14] Auch vor Frechen beschirme deinen Knecht, / Daß sie mich nicht beherrschen! / Dann bin ich unsträflich / Und frei von schwerer Schuld. So nimm denn gnädig auf die Worte meines Mundes / Und meines Herzens Sinnen, / Jahwe, / Mein Fels und mein Erlöser! 
[20:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[20:2] (Der levitische Sängerchor:) / Es erhöre dich Jahwe am Tage der Not, / Der Name des Gottes Jakobs schütze dich! 
[20:3] Er sende dir Hilfe vom Heiligtum / Und stütze dich von Zion her! 
[20:4] Er gedenke all deiner Speisopfer, / Und dein Brandopfer sei ihm wert! Sela. 
[20:5] Er gebe dir, was dein Herz begehrt, / Und all deine Wünsche erfülle er! 
[20:6] Dann wollen wir jauchzen ob deiner Hilfe / Und im Namen unsers Gottes das Banner schwingen. / Jahwe gewähre dir all dein Bitten! 
[20:7] (Eine Einzelstimme:) / Nun weiß ich, daß Jahwe seinem Gesalbten hilft, / Aus seinem heiligen Himmel erhört er ihn / Durch gewaltige Taten seiner Rechten. 
[20:8] Diese vertrauen auf Wagen und jene auf Rosse, / Wir aber rufen an den Namen Jahwes, unsers Gottes. 
[20:9] Sie sinken nieder und fallen, / Wir aber stehen und halten uns aufrecht. (Schlußruf des ganzen Sängerchors:) / Jahwe, rette den König! / Erhör uns heut, da wir zu dir flehn! 
[21:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[21:2] (Der levitische Sängerchor:) / Ob deiner Macht, o Jahwe, freut sich der König / Und ob deiner Hilfe — wie jauchzt er so sehr! 
[21:3] Seines Herzens Verlangen hast du ihm erfüllt, / Seiner Lippen Begehren ihm nicht versagt. Sela. 
[21:4] Ja, reichsten Segen hast du ihm geschenkt, / Ihm aufs Haupt gesetzt eine Krone von Gold. 
[21:5] Um Leben bat er — du gabst es ihm, / Langes Leben für immer und ewig. 
[21:6] Durch deine Hilfe ist groß sein Ruhm, / Glanz und Hoheit legst du auf ihn. 
[21:7] Ja, du machst ihn zum Segen auf ewig, / Erfüllest ihn mit Freude vor dir. 
[21:8] (Eine Einzelstimme:) / Denn der König vertrauet auf Jahwe, / Durch des Höchsten Gnade wanket er nicht. 
[21:9] Deine Hand wird treffen all deine Feinde, / Deine Rechte erreichen, die dich hassen. 
[21:10] Du machst sie gleich einem Feuerofen, wenn du erscheinst. / Jahwe verderbt sie in seinem Zorn, / Und Feuer wird sie verzehren. 
[21:11] Ihre Kinder wirst du von der Erde vertilgen, / Ihr Geschlecht von den Menschen ausrotten. 
[21:12] Sinnen sie Böses wider dich, / Erdenken sie Tücke — es ist umsonst! 
[21:13] Denn du schlägst sie in die Flucht, / Deine Pfeile richtest du gegen sie. (Schlußruf des ganzen Sängerchors:) / Erheb dich, Jahwe, in deiner Macht! / Dann preisen wir singend deine Kraft. 
[22:1]    Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Melodie von:) "Hindin der Morgenröte" (?). / Ein Psalm Davids. 
[22:2] Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen?! / Ohne Hilfe zu finden, muß ich zu dir schrein. 
[22:3] Mein Gott, ich rufe am Tage, doch du hörest mich nicht; / Auch (ruf ich) des Nachts, / Aber mein Klagen wird nicht gestillt. 
[22:4] Und dennoch bist du der Heilige, / Über Israels Lobliedern thronend. 
[22:5] Dir haben unsre Väter vertraut, / sie haben vertraut: du hast sie errettet. 
[22:6] Sie schrien zu dir und wurden frei, / Sie vertrauten dir und sind nicht zuschanden geworden. 
[22:7] Ich aber bin ein Wurm und kein Mensch, / Von den Leuten verhöhnt und verachtet vom Volk. 
[22:8] Alle, die mich sehen, spotten mein, / Verziehen die Lippen, schütteln den Kopf: 
[22:9] "Befiehl dich Jahwe — der rette ihn, / Er reiß ihn heraus, hat er Freude an ihm!" 
[22:10] Ja, du hast mich gezogen aus Mutterschoß, / Mit Vertrauen mich erfüllt an der Mutter Brust. 
[22:11] Auf dich bin ich gewiesen von Anfang an, / Seit meiner Geburt bist du mein Gott. 
[22:12] Sei nicht fern von mir, denn Not ist nah — / Ich habe ja sonst keinen Helfer! 
[22:13] Viele Stiere haben mich umringt, / Die Starken Basans umgeben mich. 
[22:14] Ihren Rachen öffnen sie wider mich / Wie ein reißender, brüllender Löwe. 
[22:15] Wie Wasser bin ich hingegossen, / All meine Gebeine sind auseinandergereckt. / Es ist mein Herz wie Wachs, / Zerschmolzen in meinem Innern. 
[22:16] Vertrocknet wie eine Scherbe ist meine Kraft, / Die Zunge klebt mir am Gaumen, / Und du lagerst mich in den Todesstaub. 
[22:17] Ja, es haben mich Hunde umringt, / Eine Bösewichterrotte hat mich umkreist, / Sie durchbohren mir Hände und Füße. 
[22:18] Zählen könnt ich all meine Gebeine; / Sie aber freuen sich meiner Qual. 
[22:19] Sie teilen meine Kleider unter sich / Und werfen das Los über mein Gewand. 
[22:20] Du aber, Jahwe, bleib nicht fern! / Meine Stärke, eil mir zu Hilfe! 
[22:21] Rette mein Leben vom Schwert, / Aus der Hunde Gewalt reiß meine Seele. 
[22:22] Hilf mir doch aus des Löwen Rachen, / Aus der Büffel Hörnern mache mich frei! 
[22:23] Dann will ich meinen Brüdern deinen Namen künden, / Inmitten der Gemeinde dir lobsingen: 
[22:24] "Die ihr Jahwe fürchtet, preist ihn, / Alle Nachkommen Jakobs, ehret ihn / Und scheut euch vor ihm, alle Israelsöhne! 
[22:25] Denn nicht verachtet, nicht verschmäht er des Armen Qual, / Nicht hat er sein Antlitz vor ihm verborgen, / Und als er schrie, hat er ihn erhört." 
[22:26] Dir gilt mein Lobpreis in großer Gemeinde. / Meine Gelübde bezahl ich vor allen Frommen. 
[22:27] Essen sollen Demütige und satt werden; / Preisen werden Jahwe, die ihn suchen: / "Euer Herz soll sich laben auf ewig!" 
[22:28] Des gedenkend werden sich wenden zu Jahwe / Alle Enden der Erde; / Und niederfallen werden vor dir / Alle Geschlechter der Heiden. 
[22:29] Denn Jahwes ist das Königtum, / Er ist aller Völker Herrscher. 
[22:30] Niederfallen werden vor ihm alle Großen der Erde, / Wenn sie gegessen haben. / Vor ihm werden auch alle knien. / Die hinabfahren in des Grabes Staub / Und die ihr Leben nicht fristen können. 
[22:31] Die Nachwelt soll ihm dienen, / Man wird vom Herrn erzählen dem künftigen Geschlecht. Sie werden kommen und seine Treue verkünden / Dem spätern Volk, daß er es vollbracht! 
[23:1] Ein Psalm Davids. 
[23:2] Jahwe ist mein Hirt: mir mangelt nichts. / Auf grünen Auen läßt er mich ruhn, / Zu stillen Wassern führt er mich. 
[23:3] Er labet meine Seele, / Er leitet mich auf rechten Pfaden / Um seines Namens willen. 
[23:4] Auch wenn ich wandre durch ein Tal des Todesschattens, / Fürcht ich kein Leid. / Denn du bist bei mir; dein Hirtenstab und Stecken, / Die trösten mich. 
[23:5] Du deckest mir den Tisch / Vor meiner Dränger Augen. / Du salbst mein Haupt mit Öl, / Mein Becher fließt über. 
[23:6] Nur Glück und Gnade folgen mir / Mein Leben lang, / Und wieder weilen werde ich in Jahwes Haus / Bis an das Ende meiner Tage. 
[24:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / (Der Festchor, während er mit der Bundeslade den Berg Zion hinaufsteigt:) / Jahwe ist die Erde und was sie erfüllt, / Der Erdkreis mit seinen Bewohnern. 
[24:2] Denn er hat sie auf Meere gegründet / Und über Ströme sie aufgerichtet. 
[24:3] (Eine Einzelstimme:) / Wer darf Jahwes Berg besteigen, / Wer darf treten an seine heilige Stätte? 
[24:4] (Der Festchor:) / Wer schuldlose Hände hat und reines Herzens ist, / Wer nicht auf Lüge sinnt / Und nicht betrügerisch schwört — 
[24:5] Der wird Segen empfangen von Jahwe / Und Hilfe vom Gott seines Heils. 
[24:6] So sind, die nach ihm fragen: / Die dein Antlitz suchen, sind Jakob. Sela. 
[24:7] (Der Festchor oben vor den Toren der Zionsburg:) / Erhebt, ihr Tore, eure Häupter, / Ja, reckt euch empor, uralte Pforten, / Damit der König der Ehren einziehe! 
[24:8] (Eine Einzelstimme drinnen, die gleichsam eine Antwort der Tore ist:) / Wer ist denn der König der Ehren? / (Der Festchor:) / Jahwe ist's, ein Starker, ein Held, / Jahwe, ein Held im Streit! 
[24:9] Erhebt, ihr Tore, eure Häupter, / Ja reckt euch empor, uralte Pforten, / Damit der König der Ehren einziehe! 
[24:10] (Wieder die Einzelstimme drinnen:) / Wer ist denn der König der Ehren? / (Der Festchor draußen:) / Jahwe (der Herr) der Heerscharen, er ist der König der Ehren. / Sela. 
[25:1] Von David. / Auf dich, o Jahwe, ist mein Herz gerichtet. 
[25:2] Bei dir, mein Gott, fühl ich mich sicher; / Laß mich nicht zuschanden werden! / Laß meine Feinde nicht über mich frohlocken! 
[25:3] Gar niemand, der dein harret, wird zuschanden. / Zuschanden werden, die ohn Ursach treulos sind. 
[25:4] Deine Wege, Jahwe, tu mir kund, / Deine Steige lehre mich! 
[25:5] Halt mich auf dem Pfade deiner Wahrheit, lehre mich! / Denn der Gott, der mir hilft, bist du. / Dein harr ich allezeit. 
[25:6] Sei eingedenk, o Jahwe, deiner Huld und Gnade, / Denn sie sind von Ewigkeit. 
[25:7] Gedenke nicht der Sünden meiner Jugend / noch meiner Missetaten! / Gedenk du mein nach deiner Gnade / Um deiner Güte willen, Jahwe! 
[25:8] Treugesinnt ist Jahwe und voll Güte; / Drum zeigt er Sündern auch den rechten Weg. 
[25:9] Im Rechte leitet er Demütige / Und lehret die Elenden seinen Weg. 
[25:10] Kann's anders sein, als daß die Wege Jahwes / alle Gnade sind und Wahrheit / Für die, die da bewahren seinen Bund und seine Zeugnisse? 
[25:11] Laß, Jahwe, doch um deines Namens willen / Vergebung werden meiner Schuld, denn sie ist groß. 
[25:12] Mit Jahwes Furcht erfülltem Mann / Zeigt Gott den Weg, den er erwählen soll. 
[25:13] Nicht nur ihm selber wird es wohl ergehn, / Nein, auch sein Same wird das Land besitzen. 
[25:14] Sein Wohlgefallen schenkt Jahwe denen, die ihn fürchten, / Und seinen Bund läßt er sie wissen. 
[25:15] Auf Jahwe richten sich beständig meine Augen; / Denn er wird aus dem Netze ziehen meinen Fuß. 
[25:16] Prüfend wende dich zu mir und sei mir gnädig! / Denn einsam bin ich und elend. 
[25:17] Zermalmend trifft die Angst mein Herz; / Aus meinen Nöten rette mich! 
[25:18] Ruhn laß dein Aug auf meinem Leid und Ungemach, / Vergib mir alle meine Sünden! 
[25:19] Richte deinen Blick auf meine Feinde, wie sie zahlreich sind / Und wie sie ohne Grund mich hassen. 
[25:20] Schütze meine Seele und errette mich! / Laß mich nicht zuschanden werden, denn dir vertraue ich. 
[25:21] Treue und Aufrichtigkeit mögen mich behüten, / Denn ich harre dein! 
[25:22] Elohim, erlöse Israel aus allen seinen Nöten! 
[26:1] Von David. / Hilf mir zu meinem Recht, o Jahwe; / denn in Unschuld bin ich gewandelt, / Und auf Jahwe hab ich vertrauet, ohne zu wanken. 
[26:2] Prüfe mich, Jahwe, erprobe mich, / Erforsche meine Nieren und mein Herz! 
[26:3] Denn deine Gnade ist mir stets vor Augen, / Und in deiner Wahrheit wandle ich. 
[26:4] Ich sitze nicht bei falschen Leuten, / Mit Hinterlistigen verkehre ich nicht. 
[26:5] Ich hasse der Bösen Versammlung, / Und bei den Gottlosen sitze ich nicht. 
[26:6] Ich will meine Hände in Unschuld waschen / Und möchte wandeln, o Jahwe, um deinen Altar, 
[26:7] Laut anzustimmen den Lobgesang / Und zu erzählen all deine Wunder. 
[26:8] Lieb hab ich, Jahwe, deines Hauses Stätte / Und den Ort, da deine Herrlichkeit wohnt. 
[26:9] Raffe meine Seele nicht hin mit Sündern / Noch mit Blutmenschen mein Leben: 
[26:10] An ihren Händen klebt Schandtat, / Ihre Rechte ist voll Bestechung. 
[26:11] Ich aber will in meiner Unschuld wandeln; / Errette mich und sei mir gnädig! 
[26:12] Mein Fuß steht auf ebenem Weg; / In der Gemeinde will ich Jahwe preisen. 
[27:1] Von David. / Jahwe ist mein Licht und mein Heil! / Vor wem sollt ich mich fürchten? / Jahwe ist meines Lebens Schutz! / Vor wem sollt ich zagen? 
[27:2] Dringen Frevler auf mich ein, / Mein Fleisch zu fressen; / Kommen meine Dränger und Feinde heran: / Sie müssen straucheln und fallen. 
[27:3] Lagert sich auch ein Heer wider mich — / Mein Herz ist ohne Furcht. / Erhebt sich Krieg gegen mich — / Auch dann bin ich getrost. 
[27:4] Eins nur erbitt ich von Jahwe, / Dies wäre mein Wunsch: / Daß ich in Jahwes Hause bleiben darf / Mein Leben lang, / Um Jahwes Huld zu schauen / Und immer seinen Tempel zu besuchen. 
[27:5] Denn er bringt mich in seine Hütte / Am Unglückstage, / Schirmt mich in seines Zeltes Schirm, / Auf einen Fels erhöht er mich. 
[27:6] So erhebt sich mein Haupt über meine Feinde ringsum. / Opfer des Jubels will ich opfern in seinem Zelt, / Will Jahwe singen und spielen. 
[27:7] Höre, Jahwe, ich rufe laut! / Sei mir denn gnädig, erhöre mich! 
[27:8] Zu dir spricht mein Herz: (da du geboten:) 'Suchet mein Antlitz!' / "Dein Antlitz, Jahwe, such ich auch." 
[27:9] Verbirg dein Antlitz nicht vor mir! / Weise nicht ab im Zorn deinen Knecht! / Meine Hilfe bist du. So verwirf mich nicht / Und verlaß mich nicht, Gott meines Heils! 
[27:10] Wenn mich Vater und Mutter verlassen, / Nimmt Jahwe mich auf. 
[27:11] Zeige mir, Jahwe, deinen Weg, / Leit mich auf ebner Bahn / Um meiner Feinde willen. 
[27:12] Gib mich nicht preis meiner Dränger Wut; / Denn es erheben sich gegen mich falsche Zeugen, / Leute, die Frevel schnauben. 
[27:13] Glaubte ich nicht, noch Jahwes Güte zu schauen / In der Lebendigen Land — (ich wäre vergangen in meinem Elend.) 
[27:14] Hoff auf Jahwe! Sei getrost und unverzagt! / Ja, hoff auf Jahwe! 
[28:1] Von David. / Zu dir, o Jahwe, rufe ich, / Mein Fels, gib mir doch Antwort! / Denn hörst du mich nicht, / So gleiche ich denen, die in die Grube fahren. 
[28:2] Höre mein lautes Flehn, wenn ich zu dir schreie, / Wenn ich meine Hände erhebe / Zu deinem Allerheiligsten. 
[28:3] Raff mich nicht weg mit Frevlern und Übeltätern, / Die freundlich reden mit ihren Nächsten, / Während sie Böses im Sinne haben. 
[28:4] Vergilt du ihnen nach ihrem Tun und ihren bösen Werken! / Nach ihrer Hände Tat gib ihnen, / Vergilt du ihnen, was sie verdient! 
[28:5] Wenn sie nicht achten auf Jahwes Tun und seiner Hände Werk, / So reiß er sie nieder und baue sie nicht! 
[28:6] Gelobt sei Jahwe! / Denn er hat mein lautes Flehen gehört. 
[28:7] Jahwe ist mein Schutz und mein Schild. / Auf ihn hat mein Herz vertraut, / Und ich hab Hilfe gefunden! / Drum jubelt mein Herz, / Und mit meinem Liede will ich ihm danken. 
[28:8] Jahwe schütze sein Volk! / Ein Heilsort ist er seinem Gesalbten. 
[28:9] O hilf deinem Volk und segne dein Erbe, / Weide und trage sie ewiglich! 
[29:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Bringet Jahwe, ihr Gottessöhne, / Bringet Jahwe Ehre und Preis! 
[29:2] Bringt Jahwe seines Namens Ehre! / Huldigt Jahwe in heiligem Schmuck! 
[29:3] Jahwes Stimme schallt über den Wassern: / Der Gott der Ehre donnert, / Jahwe thront über mächtigen Wassern. 
[29:4] Jahwes Stimme erschallt mit Macht, / Jahwes Stimme erschallt mit Pracht. 
[29:5] Jahwes Stimme zerschmettert Zedern, / Jahwe zerschmettert des Libanons Zedern. 
[29:6] Er läßt hüpfen wie Kälber, / Libanon und Sirjon wie junge Büffel. 
[29:7] Jahwes Stimme sprüht Feuerflammen. 
[29:8] Jahwes Stimme läßt beben die Wüste, / Beben läßt Jahwe die Wüste von Kades. 
[29:9] Jahwes Stimme läßt Hinden gebären, / Entblättert die Wälder. / In seinem Tempel ruft alles: "Ehre!" 
[29:10] Jahwe thronte einst über der Sintflut, / Jahwe wird thronen als König auf ewig. 
[29:11] Jahwe verleiht seinem Volke Macht, / Jahwe segnet sein Volk mit Frieden! 
[30:1] Ein Psalm. Nach dem Liede der Hausweihe (?). Von David. 
[30:2] Ich erhebe dich, Jahwe: Du hast mich errettet, / Daß meine Feinde nicht über mich jauchzten. 
[30:3] Jahwe, mein Gott, ich schrie zu dir: / Du hast mich geheilt. 
[30:4] Jahwe, du hast mich dem Tode entrissen, / Mich neubelebt, daß ich nicht in die Grube sank. 
[30:5] Lobsinget Jahwe, ihr, seine Frommen, / Und dankt seinem heiligen Namen! 
[30:6] Denn nur einen Augenblick währet sein Zorn, / Doch lebenslang seine Huld. / Am Abend kehret Weinen ein, / Des Morgens aber ist Jubel. 
[30:7] Ich dachte in meinem Glück: / "Ich werde nimmermehr wanken!" 
[30:8] Jahwe, in deiner Huld / Hattest du meinem Berge Macht verliehn. / Dann aber verbargst du dein Antlitz — / Da war ich bestürzt. 
[30:9] Zu dir, o Jahwe, rief ich, / Zu Jahwe hab ich gefleht: 
[30:10] "Was nützt dir's, daß du mein Blut vergießt, / Daß ich niederfahre zur Grube? / Kann denn der Staub dich preisen? / Kann er deine Treue verkünden? 
[30:11] O höre, Jahwe, sei mir doch gnädig! / Jahwe, sei mir ein Helfer!" 
[30:12] Du hast mir ja stets schon mein Klagen in Reigen verwandelt, / Meinen Sack gelöst, mich mit Freude gegürtet, Damit ich dir singe und nimmer verstumme. / Jahwe, mein Gott, immerdar will ich dich preisen! 
[31:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[31:2] Bei dir, o Jahwe, suche ich Zuflucht: / Mög ich nimmer zuschanden werden! / Nach deiner Treue errette mich! 
[31:3] Neige dein Ohr zu mir, befreie mich eilends! / Sei mir ein schützender Fels, / Eine feste Burg, mir zu helfen! 
[31:4] Ja, mein Fels, meine Burg bist du, / Ob deines Namens wirst du mich führen und leiten. 
[31:5] Herausziehn wirst du mich aus dem Netz, / Das man mir heimlich gelegt; / Denn du bist mein Schutz. 
[31:6] In deine Hand befehl ich meinen Geist! / Du erlösest mich, Jahwe, du treuer Gott. 
[31:7] Verhaßt sind mir, die nichtigen Götzen dienen; / Ich traue auf Jahwe. 
[31:8] Jubeln will ich und fröhlich sein ob deiner Gnade; / Denn du siehest mein Elend an, / Du merkst auf die Not meiner Seele. 
[31:9] Du gibst mich nicht in des Feindes Hand, / Du stellst meine Füße auf freien Raum. 
[31:10] Sei mir gnädig, Jahwe, denn mir ist angst! / Mir schwindet in Gram Aug, Seele und Leib. 
[31:11] In Kummer vergehet mein Leben, / Meine Jahre entrinnen in Seufzen. / Ob meiner Sünde wankt meine Kraft, / Und meine Gebeine verfallen. 
[31:12] Durch all meine Dränger bin ich ein Schimpf geworden, / Eine Last meinen Nachbarn, meinen Freunden ein Schreck; / Die mich draußen erblicken, fliehen vor mir. 
[31:13] Wie ein Toter bin ich vergessen, entschwunden dem Sinn, / Ich bin wie ein zerbrochen Gefäß. 
[31:14] Ja ich höre vieler Verleumdung, / Grauen umgibt mich ringsum. / Beraten sie zusammen wider mich, / So sinnen sie drauf, mir das Leben zu rauben. 
[31:15] Ich aber, Jahwe, traue auf dich, / Ich spreche: "Du bist mein Gott." 
[31:16] In deiner Hand liegt mein Geschick. / Meiner Feinde Gewalt und meinen Verfolgern entreiße mich! 
[31:17] Laß deinem Knechte dein Antlitz leuchten, / Hilf mir durch deine Gnade! 
[31:18] Jahwe, nicht werd ich beschämt, denn ich rufe dich an. / Zuschanden mögen die Frevler werden, / Mögen sie fahren zur Unterwelt! 
[31:19] Verstummen sollen die Lügenlippen, / Die frech den Gerechten schmähn / In Übermut und Hohn! 
[31:20] Wie groß ist deine Güte, / Die du denen bereit hältst, die dich fürchten, / Erweisest denen, die dir vertraun, / Vor allen Menschenkindern. 
[31:21] Du schirmst sie im Schirm deines Angesichts / Vor den Rotten der Menschen, / Birgst sie in einer Hütte / Vor dem Hader der Zungen. 
[31:22] Gepriesen sei Jahwe! / Er hat seine Gnade mir wunderbar / Erzeigt in einer festen Stadt. 
[31:23] Ich aber dachte in meiner Angst, / Ich wäre von dir verstoßen. / Doch du vernahmest mein lautes Flehn, / Als ich zu dir schrie. 
[31:24] Liebt Jahwe, all seine Frommen! / Die Treuen behütet Jahwe, / Aber die Stolzen straft er streng. Seid stark und mutigen Herzens / Alle, die ihr auf Jahwe harrt! 
[32:1] Von David. Eine Betrachtung (?). / Heil dem, des Missetat vergeben, des Sünde erlassen ist! 
[32:2] Heil dem Menschen, dem Jahwe die Schuld nicht anrechnet, / Und in des Geist kein Trug ist. 
[32:3] Als ich schwieg, schwand mein Gebein dahin, / Weil ich unaufhörlich seufzen mußte. 
[32:4] Denn deine Hand lag schwer auf mir bei Tag und Nacht, / Mein Lebenssaft vertrocknete wie in der Sommerglut. Sela. 
[32:5] Da tat ich dir meine Sünde kund, / und meine Schuld verdeckte ich nicht. / Ich sprach: "Bekennen will ich Jahwe meine Missetat." / Da hast du meine Sündenschuld weggenommen. Sela. 
[32:6] Drum bete jeder Fromme zu dir, solange du noch zu finden bist. / Fluten auch mächtige Wasser einher, / ihn werden sie sicher nicht treffen. 
[32:7] Du bist mein Schirm, vor Drangsal bewahrest du mich, / Umringst mich mit Rettungsjubeln. Sela. 
[32:8] Ich will dich belehren, dir zeigen den Weg, den du gehen mußt; / Fest will ich auf dich mein Auge richten. 
[32:9] Seid nicht wie das Roß, wie das unverständige Maultier! / Mit Zaum und Halfter, ihrem Geschirr, muß man sie zügeln; / Sonst nahen sie nicht zu dir. 
[32:10] Der Gottlose hat viel Schmerzen. / Wer aber auf Jahwe traut, den umgibt er mit Gnade. 
[32:11] Freut euch in Jahwe, frohlockt, ihr Gerechten, / Und jauchzet, ihr Redlichen alle! 
[33:1] Jubelt, Gerechte, in Jahwe! / Den Redlichen ziemet Lobgesang. 
[33:2] Dankt Jahwe auf der Zither, / Auf zehnsaitiger Harfe spielet ihm! 
[33:3] Singt ihm ein neues Lied, / Spielt schön und kräftig mit Jubelgetön! 
[33:4] Denn Jahwes Wort ist wahrhaftig, / Und all sein Tun vollzieht sich in Treue. 
[33:5] Er liebet Gerechtigkeit und Recht, / Jahwes Güte erfüllt die Erde. 
[33:6] Durch Jahwes Wort sind die Himmel gemacht, / Durch den Hauch seines Mundes ihr ganzes Heer. 
[33:7] Er sammelt als Haufen des Meeres Wasser, / Er legt die Fluten in Vorratskammern. 
[33:8] Vor Jahwe fürchte sich alle Welt, / Alle Erdbewohner erbeben vor ihm! 
[33:9] Denn er hat gesprochen — da ward es; / Er hat geboten — und es stand da. 
[33:10] Jahwe vernichtet der Heiden Plan, / Vereitelt der Völker Gedanken. 
[33:11] Jahwes Plan bleibt ewig bestehn, / Seines Herzens Gedanken für alle Geschlechter. 
[33:12] Heil dem Volke, des Gott ist Jahwe, / Dem Volk, das er sich zum Erbe erwählt! 
[33:13] Vom Himmel blicket Jahwe herab, / Er sieht alle Menschenkinder. 
[33:14] Von seiner Wohnstatt schauet er / Auf alle Bewohner der Erde. 
[33:15] Er bildet allen ihr Herz, / Er achtet auf all ihr Tun. 
[33:16] Nicht siegt ein König durch große Macht, / Nicht rettet ein Held sich durch große Kraft. 
[33:17] Nichts nützen Rosse zum Siege, / Ihre große Stärke hilft nicht entrinnen. 
[33:18] Auf die, die ihn fürchten, blickt Jahwes Auge, / Auf die, die harren auf seine Huld, 
[33:19] Daß er ihr Leben vom Tode errette / Und sie erhalte in Hungersnot. 
[33:20] Unsre Seele wartet auf Jahwe, / Er ist uns Hilfe und Schild. 
[33:21] Ja, in ihm freuet sich unser Herz. / Seinem heiligen Namen vertrauen wir. 
[33:22] Deine Gnade, Jahwe, sei über uns, / Gleichwie wir auf dich harren! 
[34:1] Von David, als er sich vor Abimelech wahnsinnig stellte, / so daß dieser ihn von sich trieb und er wegging. 
[34:2] Allzeit will ich Jahwe preisen, / Sein Lob sei stets in meinem Mund. 
[34:3] Bei Jahwe soll mein Herz sich rühmen, / Daß Dulder es hören und sich freun. 
[34:4] Groß achtet mit mir Jahwe, / Laßt uns zusammen seinen Namen erhöhn! 
[34:5] Dringend suchte ich Jahwe, er gab mir Antwort: / Aus all meinen Ängsten befreite er mich. 
[34:6] Hell leuchtet das Aug, wenn man auf ihn blickt, / Und das Antlitz wird nicht erblassen. 
[34:7] Solch ein Dulder ist hier: der rief — / da erhörte ihn Jahwe / Und half ihm aus all seinen Nöten. 
[34:8] Ganz nah ist Jahwes Engel den Frommen allen / Und reißt sie aus jeder Gefahr. 
[34:9] Tastet und seht: wie gütig ist Jahwe! / Heil dem Manne, der zu ihm flieht! 
[34:10] Jahwe fürchtet, ihr Heiligen sein! / Denn die ihn fürchten, die trifft kein Mangel. 
[34:11] Karg leben und hungern wohl junge Leun; / Die aber Jahwe suchen, entbehren kein Gut. 
[34:12] Liebe Kinder, kommet, höret mir zu! / Jahwe zu fürchten, will ich euch lehren. 
[34:13] Möchtest du haben langdauerndes Leben, / Zahlreiche Tage, um Glück zu schaun? 
[34:14] Nun, dann bewahr deine Zunge vor Bösem / Und deine Lippen vor falschem Wort. 
[34:15] Sei fern vom Bösen und tue das Gute, / Suche Frieden und jage ihm nach! 
[34:16] Auf Gerechte schauen die Augen Jahwes, / Und seine Ohren hören ihr Schrein. 
[34:17] Pein bringt den Frevlern der Zornblick Jahwes: / Von der Erde vertilget er ihr Gedächtnis. 
[34:18] Zagend schreien die Frommen, und Jahwe hört: / Aus all ihren Leiden rettet er sie. 
[34:19] Kommt Jahwe denen nicht nah, / die zerbrochenen Herzens sind? / Und allen hilft er, deren Geist zerschlagen ist. 
[34:20] Reichlich muß der Gerechte leiden, / Aber aus allem befreit ihn Jahwe. 
[34:21] Schützend bewahrt er all seine Gebeine, / Daß ihrer nicht eins zerbrochen wird. 
[34:22] Töten wird den Frevler das Unheil, / Büßen müssen die Hasser des Frommen. Jahwe erlöst seiner Knechte Seele, / Und schuldlos bleiben, die zu ihm flehn. 
[35:1] Von David. / Bestreite, Jahwe, meine Bestreiter, / Bekriege, die mich bekriegen! 
[35:2] Ergreife Schild und Tartsche, / Steh auf, um mir zu helfen! 
[35:3] Zücke den Speer und die Axt wider meine Verfolger, / Sprich zu meiner Seele: "Ich helfe dir!" 
[35:4] Schande und Schmach mögen ernten, / Die mir nach dem Leben trachten; / Zurückweichen und erröten müssen, / Die auf mein Unglück sinnen! 
[35:5] Sie seien wie Spreu vor dem Winde, / Und Jahwes Engel stoße sie weg! 
[35:6] Ihr Weg sei finster und schlüpfrig, / Und Jahwes Engel verfolge sie! 
[35:7] Denn sie haben ihr Netz mir ohn Ursach gelegt, / Ohn Ursach mir eine Grube gegraben. 
[35:8] Verderben treffe ihn, eh er's meint, / Ihn fange das Netz, das er heimlich gestellt! / Er falle hinein und verderbe! 
[35:9] Dann wird meine Seele in Jahwe sich freun, / Ob seiner Hilfe frohlocken. 
[35:10] Es sagen all meine Gebeine: "Wer gleicht dir, o Jahwe? / Du rettest den Armen aus des Stärkern Hand, / Den Armen und Dürftigen von seinem Räuber." 
[35:11] Falsche Zeugen erheben sich, / Sie fragen nach Dingen, die ich nicht weiß; 
[35:12] Sie vergelten mir Böses für Gutes. / Wie bin ich allein und verlassen! 
[35:13] Ich aber, waren sie krank, trug Trauerkleider, / Machte mich müde mit Fasten / Und betete gesenkten Haupts. 
[35:14] Als wär er mein Freund, mein Bruder, so (leidvoll) ging ich einher; / Wie um meine Mutter trauernd, so war ich gebeugt von Schmerz. 
[35:15] Nun aber bei meinem Sturze freuen sie sich und treten zusammen, / Es rotten sich wider mich Wichte, die ich nicht kannte; / Sie lästern und hören damit nicht auf. 
[35:16] Wie Ruchlose Possenreißer / Fletschen sie wider mich ihre Zähne. 
[35:17] O Herr, wie lange noch willst du es ansehn? / Schütze mein Leben vor ihrem Verderben, / Entreiß meine Seele den jungen Löwen! 
[35:18] Ich will dich preisen in großer Gemeinde, / Unter zahlreichem Volke dich rühmen. 
[35:19] Laß sich nicht über mich freun, die mir grundlos feind sind, / Laß nicht, die mich ohn Ursach hassen, mein hämisch spotten! 
[35:20] Denn sie reden nicht, was zum Frieden dient, / Nein, gegen die Stillen im Lande ersinnen sie Trug. 
[35:21] Sie reißen den Mund weit auf wider mich, / Sie rufen: "Ei, ei, nun sehen wir's ja!" 
[35:22] Du siehst es, Jahwe, drum schweige nicht! / O Herr, sei nicht ferne von mir! 
[35:23] Wach auf, wach auf und schaffe mir Recht! / Mein Gott, mein Herr, tritt du für mich ein! 
[35:24] Schaff Recht mir nach deiner Gerechtigkeit, o Jahwe, mein Gott! / Sie sollen ja nicht über mich frohlocken. 
[35:25] Sie sollen nicht denken: "Ei, nun ist's erreicht!" / Nicht glauben: "Jetzt haben wir ihn vernichtet." 
[35:26] Beschämt und enttäuscht müssen alle werden, / Die sich meines Unglücks freun. / Es müssen sich hüllen in Schande und Schmach, / Die sich stolz wider mich erheben. 
[35:27] Laß jubeln und jauchzen, die mir gönnen mein Recht! / Laß sie allzeit sprechen: "Jahwe ist groß, / Der das Heil seines Knechtes begehret!" 
[35:28] Meine Zunge soll deine Gerechtigkeit preisen, / Fort und fort deinen Ruhm verkünden. 
[36:1] Dem Sangmeister. Von dem Knechte Jahwes, von David. 
[36:2] Wie die Sünde zum Frevler redet, / daran muß ich denken in meinem Herzen. / Es fehlt ihm ja alle Scheu vor Gott. 
[36:3] Denn sie umgarnt ihn mit Schmeichelreden, / Damit sie erreiche, daß er sich verschulde und hasse. 
[36:4] Was er spricht, ist Unheil und Tücke; / Er steht davon ab, verständig zu handeln und gut. 
[36:5] Unheil sinnt er auf seinem Lager, / Betritt einen bösen Weg, / Schlechtes verwirft er nicht. 
[36:6] Jahwe, bis an den Himmel reicht deine Gnade, / Deine Treue bis zu den Wolken. 
[36:7] Deine Gerechtigkeit gleicht Gottes Bergen, / Deine Gerichte der Meerestiefe; / Menschen und Tieren hilfst du, o Jahwe. 
[36:8] Wie köstlich, Elohim, ist deine Gnade! / Die Menschen dürfen sich bergen in deiner Fittiche Schatten. 
[36:9] Sie laben sich an deines Hauses Fülle, / Und mit dem Strom deiner Wonne tränkest du sie. 
[36:10] Denn bei dir ist die Quelle des Lebens, / In deinem Lichte schauen wir das Licht. 
[36:11] Erhalt deine Gnade denen, die dich erkennen, / Und deine Gerechtigkeit den redlichen Herzen! 
[36:12] Nicht treffe mich der Hoffart Fuß, / Und der Frevler Hand verscheuche mich nicht! Dann fallen die Übeltäter, / Sie stürzen und kommen nicht wieder empor. 
[37:1] Von David. / Arge laß nicht zum Eifer dich reizen, / Alle die Frevler beneide nicht! 
[37:2] Denn wie Gras verschwinden sie eilend / Und verwelken wie grünes Kraut. 
[37:3] Baue auf Jahwe und handle gut, / Bleibe im Lande und pflege Treue! 
[37:4] So wirst du Wonne an Jahwe haben, / Der dir gewährt deines Herzens Wunsch. 
[37:5] Gründe auf Jahwe dein Lebenslos, / Traue auf ihn, denn er macht's wohl! 
[37:6] Er läßt deine Unschuld wie Morgenlicht leuchten / Und dein Recht wie die Mittagshelle. 
[37:7] Duldergleich sei stille zu Jahwe und harre sein! / Entrüste dich nicht über den, der Glück hat, / Über den Mann, der Ränke verübt! 
[37:8] Halt dich vom Zorne zurück, laß fahren den Grimm! / Erhitze dich nicht, es führt nur zum Bösen! 
[37:9] Denn Frevler werden ausgerottet; / Die aber Jahwes harren, die erben das Land. 
[37:10] Wartest du nur ein Weilchen, so ist der Frevler nicht mehr. / Nach seiner Stätte siehst du dich um: er ist dahin! 
[37:11] Die Dulder werden das Land ererben / Und sich erfreuen der Fülle des Heils. 
[37:12] Saat des Unheils sinnet der Böse, / Fletscht seine Zähne gegen den Frommen. 
[37:13] Doch Adonái lachet sein, / Denn er siehet: es kommt sein Tag. 
[37:14] Gottlose zücken das Schwert und spannen den Bogen, / Um den Armen und Dürftigen zu fällen, / Um hinzumorden, die redlich wandeln. 
[37:15] Doch ihnen ins Herz wird dringen ihr Schwert, / Und ihre Bogen werden zerbrochen. 
[37:16] Trägt der Gerechte auch wenig davon, / Besser ist's immer als vieler Frevler Güterfülle. 
[37:17] Denn der Frevler Arm wird zerbrochen, / Aber die Frommen stützt Jahwe. 
[37:18] Jahwe kennt der Redlichen Tage, / Und ihr Besitz wird ewig bestehn. 
[37:19] Nicht leiden sie Mangel in böser Zeit, / In den Tagen des Hungers werden sie satt. 
[37:20] Kläglich kommen die Frevler um; / Wie der Auen Pracht sind Jahwes Feinde: / Sie schwinden dahin wie der Rauch, sie schwinden. 
[37:21] Lehnt der Frevler, so zahlt er nicht, / Der Gerechte aber tut wohl und gibt. 
[37:22] Denn seine Gesegneten erben das Land, / Doch seine Verfluchten werden zunichte. 
[37:23] Menschen tun feste Schritte mit Jahwes Hilfe, / Wenn ihr Wandel ihm wohlgefällt. 
[37:24] Mögen sie wanken — sie stürzen nicht, / Denn Jahwe stützt ihre Hände. 
[37:25] Nie hab ich als Knabe noch später im Alter / Den Frommen verlassen gesehn / Und seine Kinder betteln um Brot. 
[37:26] Allezeit tut er wohl und leihet, / Und seine Nachkommen werden zum Segen. 
[37:27] Sei fern vom Bösen und tue das Gute, / So wirst du immerdar wohnen bleiben. 
[37:28] Jahwe liebt ja das Recht / Und verläßt seine Frommen nicht; er schützt sie auf immer. / Doch der Frevler Geschlecht wird ausgerottet. 
[37:29] Die Gerechten erben das Land / Und wohnen darin auf ewig. 
[37:30] Preis der Weisheit verkündet der Fromme, / Und seine Zunge redet, was recht. 
[37:31] Seines Gottes Gesetz ruht ihm im Herzen, / Und seine Schritte wanken nicht. 
[37:32] Zu verderben den Frommen, lauert der Frevler: / Er sucht ihn zu töten. 
[37:33] Doch Jahwe gibt ihn seiner Hand nicht preis, / Er spricht ihn nicht schuldig, wenn Menschen ihn richten. 
[37:34] Klammre dich an Jahwe, halt ein seinen Weg: / Er wird dich erhöhn, daß du erbest das Land. / Der Frevler Vernichtung siehst du mit an. 
[37:35] Reckenhaft kühn sah ich einen Frevler; / Er spreizte sich stolz wie ein grünender Baum. 
[37:36] Man ging vorüber: er war nicht mehr. / Als ich ihn suchte — er fand sich nicht. 
[37:37] Schau auf den Frommen, sieh den Redlichen an: / Nachkommen empfängt der Friedensmann. 
[37:38] Die Frevler jedoch werden alle vertilgt, / Der Bösen Geschlecht wird ausgerottet. 
[37:39] Treu schirmt Jahwe die Gerechten; / Er ist ihre Schutzwehr zur Zeit der Not. 
[37:40] Es hilft ihnen Jahwe und rettet sie; / Er rettet sie von den Frevlern und steht ihnen bei; / Denn sie trauen auf ihn. 
[38:1] Ein Psalm Davids. Zum Bekennen (der Sünde) (?). 
[38:2] Jahwe, strafe mich nicht in deinem Zorn / Und züchtige mich nicht in deinem Grimm! 
[38:3] Denn deine Pfeile haben mich getroffen, / Und deine Hand liegt schwer auf mir. 
[38:4] Nichts Gesundes ist an meinem Leib ob deines Grolls, / Nichts Heiles in meinem Gebein ob meiner Sünde. 
[38:5] Denn meine Schuld geht über mein Haupt, / Wie schwere Last ist sie mir zu schwer. 
[38:6] Es stinken, es eitern meine Wunden / Um meiner Torheit willen. 
[38:7] Ich bin gekrümmt, bin sehr gebeugt, / Den ganzen Tag geh ich traurig einher. 
[38:8] Denn meine Lenden sind voll Brand, / Nichts Heiles ist an meinem Leib. 
[38:9] Ohnmächtig bin ich, ganz zerschlagen, / Ich schrei vor dem Schmerz, der in mir tobt. 
[38:10] O Herr, du kennst all mein Verlangen, / Mein Seufzen ist dir nicht verborgen. 
[38:11] Mein Herz pocht laut, meine Kraft ist weg, / Und das Licht meiner Augen, auch das ist dahin! 
[38:12] Meine Lieben und Freunde stehn fern meiner Pein, / Weit weg treten meine Verwandten. 
[38:13] Es legen Schlingen, die mir nach dem Leben trachten; / Die mein Unglück wünschen, beschließen Verderben / Und haben allzeit Tücke im Sinn. 
[38:14] Ich aber höre es nicht, als wäre ich taub, / Ich bin wie ein Stummer, der seinen Mund nicht öffnet. 
[38:15] Ich bin wie ein Mann, der nicht hören kann, / In dessen Mund keine Widerrede. 
[38:16] Denn auf dich, o Jahwe, harr ich, / Du wirst mich erhören, o Herr, mein Gott. 
[38:17] Denn ich spreche: "Laß sie mein sich nicht freun, / Wenn mein Fuß wankt, nicht wider mich großtun." 
[38:18] Ich bin ja nahe dem Fallen, / Und mein Kummer verläßt mich nie. 
[38:19] Denn meine Missetat mache ich kund, / Ich härme mich ob meiner Sünde. 
[38:20] Meine Feinde aber strotzen von Lebenskraft, / Und zahlreich sind, die mich grundlos hassen. 
[38:21] Sie vergelten mir Gutes mit Bösem, / Sie feinden mich an, weil ich Gutes erstrebe. 
[38:22] Verlaß mich nicht, o Jahwe! / Mein Gott, sei nicht ferne von mir! Eile, mir beizustehn, / Herr, meine Hilfe! 
[39:1] Dem Sangmeister, nämlich Jedutun. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[39:2] Ich sprach: "Ich will meinen Wandel hüten, / Daß ich nicht sündige mit meiner Zunge. / Ich will meinem Mund einen Zaum anlegen, / Solange der Frevler vor mir ist." 
[39:3] Ich verstummte in stiller Ergebung; / Ich schwieg, obwohl alles Glückes bar. / Doch es wühlte mein Schmerz in mir. 
[39:4] Es glühte mein Herz in meiner Brust, / Ein inneres Feuer verzehrte mich, / Da mußte ich reden mit meiner Zunge: 
[39:5] "Tu mir, Jahwe, mein Ende kund, / Und wie lang meine Tage währen, / Daß ich seh, wie vergänglich ich bin. 
[39:6] Nur handbreit machtest du meine Tage, / Meine Lebenszeit ist wie nichts vor dir. / Ein Hauch nur ist jeder Mensch, wie fest er auch steht! / Sela. 
[39:7] Als Schattenbild nur wandelt der Mensch. / Um ein Nichts erregt er sich wild: / Er sammelt und weiß nicht, wer es errafft." 
[39:8] Nun, Herr, wes soll ich denn harren? / Ich hoffe allein auf dich! 
[39:9] Von meinen Sünden errette mich, / Zum Spott des Gottlosen mache mich nicht! 
[39:10] Ich schweige, tue den Mund nicht auf; / Denn du, du hast es getan. 
[39:11] Nimm deine Plage weg von mir! / Deiner mächtigen Hand erliege ich. 
[39:12] Du züchtigst den Menschen, du strafst ihn ob seiner Schuld, / Daß seine Schönheit zergeht wie ein mottenfräßiges Kleid. Ein Hauch nur ist jeder Mensch! Sela. 
[39:13] Höre, o Jahwe, mein Gebet, vernimm mein Flehn! / Zu meinen Tränen schweige nicht! / Denn ein Gast nur bin ich bei dir, / Ein Pilgrim wie all meine Väter. Schau weg von mir, daß ich fröhlich werde, / Eh ich hinfahre und nicht mehr bin. 
[40:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[40:2] Voll Sehnsucht hab ich auf Jahwe geharrt: / Er neigte sich zu mir und hörte mein Schrein. 
[40:3] Er zog mich aus der verderblichen Grube, / Aus tiefem Schlamm / Und stellte meine Füße auf einen Fels, / Machte meine Schritte sicher. 
[40:4] Er legte mir ein neues Lied in den Mund, / Einen Lobgesang für unsern Gott. / Viele schauen's und schauern / Und trauen auf Jahwe. 
[40:5] "Heil dem, der sein Vertrauen auf Jahwe setzt / Und sich nicht wendet zu Stolzen und Lügenhaften!" 
[40:6] Viel hast du getan, o Jahwe, mein Gott, / An Wundern und Plänen zu unserm Heil / Dir ist nichts gleich! / Ich möchte sie kundtun, davon reden, / Aber sie sind unzählbar. 
[40:7] Schlachtopfer und Speisopfer willst du nicht, / Doch Ohren hast du mir gegraben. / Brandopfer und Sündopfer forderst du nicht. 
[40:8] Da sprach ich: "Sieh, ich komme / Mit der Rolle des Buchs, mir zur Weisung geschrieben. 
[40:9] Deinen Willen zu tun, mein Gott, begehr ich, / In meinem Herzen ist dein Gesetz." 
[40:10] Die Freudenbotschaft deines Heils verkünd ich in großer Gemeinde. / Sieh, meine Lippen verschließ ich nicht: / Jahwe, du weißt es. 
[40:11] Deine Gerechtigkeit verberg ich nicht in meinem Herzen, / Von deiner Wahrhaftigkeit und Hilfe rede ich, / Deine Huld und Treue verhehl ich nicht in der großen Gemeinde. 
[40:12] Du, Jahwe, wirst dein Erbarmen mir nicht entziehn, / Deine Huld und Treue werden mich allzeit schirmen. 
[40:13] Denn es umringen mich Leiden ohne Zahl, / Meine Sünden erfassen mich unübersehbar, / Zahlreicher als meines Hauptes Haar, / Und mein Mut entfällt mir. 
[40:14] Willige, Jahwe, mich zu retten, / Eile mir, Jahwe, zu Hilfe! 
[40:15] Beschämt und enttäuscht laß alle werden, / Die mir nach dem Leben trachten, es wegzuraffen! / Mit Schimpf laß alle entweichen, / Die da mein Unglück wollen! 
[40:16] Erstarren mögen ob ihrer Schande, / Die (schadenfroh) über mich rufen: "Ha, ha!" 
[40:17] Frohlocken laß aber und dein sich freun / Alle, die nach dir fragen. / Laß immerdar rufen: "Groß ist Jahwe!" / Alle, die dein Heil lieben! Bin ich auch elend und arm: / Adonái sorget für mich. / Mein Beistand und Retter bist du. / Mein Gott, verzieh deine Hilfe nicht! 
[41:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[41:2] Heil dem, der des Armen sich annimmt, / Am Tage des Unglücks wird Jahwe ihn retten. 
[41:3] Jahwe schirmt ihn, erhält ihn am Leben, / Daß man im Lande ihn glücklich preist. / Nicht gibst du ihn hin seiner Feinde Wut. 
[41:4] Jahwe wird ihn auf dem Siechbett stützen; / Seine Krankheit wandelst du zur Genesung. 
[41:5] Ich spreche: "Jahwe, sei mir gnädig, / Heile mich: ich habe gesündigt an dir!" 
[41:6] Meine Feinde wünschen mir Böses an: / "Wann stirbt er? Wann wird sein Name vergehn?" 
[41:7] Besucht mich einer, so redet er Lüge. / Sein Herz sammelt Bosheit an; / Dann geht er hinaus und macht es kund. 
[41:8] All meine Hasser zischeln gemeinsam wider mich, / Sie sinnen Unheil gegen mich aus: 
[41:9] "Verderben ist über ihn ausgegossen; / Er hat sich gelegt, steht nicht wieder auf." 
[41:10] Selbst mein Freund, auf den ich vertraute, mein Tischgenosse / Hebt nun seine Ferse gegen mich. 
[41:11] Du aber, Jahwe, sei mir gnädig und richte mich auf, / Damit ich es ihnen vergelte! 
[41:12] So erkenne ich dann, daß du mich liebst, / Wenn mein Feind nicht über mich jubeln darf. 
[41:13] Mich aber hältst du aufrecht ob meiner Unschuld / Und stellst mich vor dein Antlitz auf ewig. Gepriesen sei Jahwe, Israels Gott, / Von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit! / Amen, Amen. 
[42:1] Dem Sangmeister. Eine Betrachtung(?) der Söhne Korahs. 
[42:2] Wie eine Hindin lechzt nach Wasserbächen, / So lechzt meine Seele, Elohim, nach dir. 
[42:3] Meine Seele dürstet nach Elohim, dem lebendigen Gott. / Wann werd ich kommen und vor Elohim erscheinen? 
[42:4] Meine Tränen sind meine Speise Tag und Nacht, / Weil man mich immer höhnisch fragt: / "Wo ist denn nun dein Gott?" 
[42:5] Voll Wehmut denk ich jetzt daran, / Wie ich einst wallte mit des Volkes Menge, / Wie ich sie leitete zum Hause Elohims: / Die Festversammlung, die laut jubelte und dankte. 
[42:6] Was bist du, meine Seele, denn so tief betrübt? / Was bist du so erregt in mir? / Harr nur auf Elohim! denn noch werd ich ihm danken: / Er ist ja meine Hilfe. 
[42:7] Mein Gott, in mir ist meine Seele tief betrübt. / Drum denk ich dein im Land des Jordans / und der Hermongipfel bei dem Mizarberge. 
[42:8] Eine Flut ruft der andern zu beim Rauschen der Wasserfälle. / All deine Wellen und Wogen fahren über mich! 
[42:9] Es schenkte mir Jahwe tagsüber seine Gnade, / Und in der Nachtzeit sang ich ihm mein Lied, / Ich betete zum Gott meines Lebens. 
[42:10] So sprech ich nun zu Gott, der mir ein Fels: / Warum hast du denn mein vergessen? / Warum soll ich betrübt einhergehen, / Wenn der Feind mich drängt?" 
[42:11] Es trifft mich wie ein Mordstoß, / wenn mich meine Dränger schmähen, / Wenn sie mich täglich höhnisch fragen: / "Wo ist nun dein Gott?" Was bist du, meine Seele, denn so tief betrübt? / Was bist du so erregt in mir? / Harr nur auf Elohim; denn noch werd ich ihm danken: / Er ist ja meine Hilfe und mein Gott. 
[43:1] Schaffe mir Recht, Elohim, und führe meine Sache gegen ein lieblos Volk, / Von falschen, frevelhaften Leuten rette mich! 
[43:2] Du bist ja Gott, mein Hort. Warum verwirfst du mich? / Warum soll ich betrübt einhergehn, / Wenn der Feind mich drängt? 
[43:3] O sende dein Licht und deine Wahrheit! Die sollen mich leiten / Und mich bringen zu deinem heilgen Berge und deinem Zelt. 
[43:4] Dann will ich eingehn zum Altar Elohims, zum Gott meiner Jubelfreude / Und auf der Zither dich preisen, Elohim, mein Gott. 
[43:5] Was bist du, meine Seele, denn so tief betrübt? / Was bist du so erregt in mir? / Harr nur auf Elohim; denn noch werd ich ihm danken: / Er ist ja meine Hilfe und mein Gott. 
[44:1] Dem Sangmeister. Eine Betrachtung (?) der Söhne Korahs. 
[44:2] Elohim, mit unsern Ohren haben wir gehört, / Unsre Väter haben uns erzählt, / Was du in ihren Tagen getan, / In den Tagen der Vorzeit: 
[44:3] Du hast mit deiner Hand die Heiden vertrieben und sie gepflanzt; / Du hast Völker zerschlagen, sie ausgebreitet. 
[44:4] Denn nicht durch ihr Schwert ward ihnen das Land, / Und nicht ihr Arm half ihnen zum Sieg, / Nein, deine Rechte, dein Arm, das Licht deines Angesichts. / Denn du hattest sie lieb. 
[44:5] Du, Elohim, du bist mein König, / Entbiete Hilfe für Jakob. 
[44:6] Mit dir zerstoßen wir unsre Dränger, / Zertreten die Feinde in deinem Namen. 
[44:7] Denn nicht vertrau ich auf meinen Bogen, / Mein Schwert verschafft mir nicht Hilfe. 
[44:8] Nein, du hilfst uns von unsern Drängern, / Und unsre Hasser verstörest du. 
[44:9] Allzeit rühmen wir uns Elohims, / Deinen Namen preisen wir ewig. Sela. 
[44:10] Und doch verwirfst du uns, bringst uns in Schmach, / Ziehst nicht mehr aus mit unsern Heeren. 
[44:11] Du lässest uns fliehn vor unserm Feind, / Und unsre Hasser plündern uns aus. 
[44:12] Du lässest uns wie Schafe verschlingen, / Und unter die Heiden zerstreuest du uns. 
[44:13] Um ein Spottgeld verkaufst du dein Volk / Und forderst für sie nicht hohen Preis. 
[44:14] Unsern Nachbarn machest du uns zur Schmach, / Zum Hohn und Gelächter ringsumher. 
[44:15] Du machst uns zum Spottlied unter den Heiden, / Und die Völker schütteln den Kopf über uns. 
[44:16] Allzeit denk ich an meine Schmach, / Und Scham bedeckt mein Angesicht, 
[44:17] Weil ich die Schmäher und Lästerer hören, / Die Feinde und Rachgierigen sehen muß. 
[44:18] All dies hat uns getroffen, obwohl wir dein nicht vergessen / Noch deinen Bund gebrochen haben. 
[44:19] Es ist unser Herz nicht abgefallen, / Unser Schritt nicht gewichen von deinem Pfad, 
[44:20] Daß du uns (nun zur Strafe) zerschlägst an der Schakalstätte / Und uns umhüllest mit Todesschatten. 
[44:21] Hätten wir des Namens unsers Gottes vergessen, / Unsre Hände gebreitet zum fremden Gott: 
[44:22] Würde Elohim das nicht durchschaun? / Er kennt ja des Herzens Geheimnis. 
[44:23] Nein, deinetwegen werden wir täglich gemordet, / Wie Schafe der Schlachtbank achtet man uns. 
[44:24] Wach auf! Warum schläfst du, Herr? / Erwache, verwirf nicht auf immer! 
[44:25] Warum verbirgst du dein Angesicht, / Denkst nicht unsers Elends und Druckes? 
[44:26] Denn in den Staub gebeugt ist unsre Seele, / Es klebt unser Leib am Boden. Auf! Hilf uns! / Errett uns um deiner Gnade willen! 
[45:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise von:) "Lilien". Von den Söhnen Korahs. Eine Betrachtung(?). Ein liebliches Lied. 
[45:2] Es wallet mein Herz von lieblicher Rede. / Ich spreche: "Einem Könige gilt mein Lied!" / Meine Zunge gleicht eines Schnellschreibers Griffel. 
[45:3] Du bist der Schönste der Menschensöhne, / Anmut wohnet auf deinen Lippen. / Drum hat Elohim dich auf ewig gesegnet. 
[45:4] Gürte dein Schwert um die Hüfte, du Held, / Dazu deinen Glanz und Schmuck! 
[45:5] Ja, deinen Schmuck! Fahr siegreich einher / Zum Schutze der Wahrheit und leidenden Unschuld: / So läßt deine Rechte dich Wunder schaun. 
[45:6] Deine Pfeile sind scharf — Völker fallen vor dir zu Boden —, / Sie dringen den Feinden des Königs ins Herz. 
[45:7] Dein Thron, Elohim, währt immer und ewig, / Dein Königszepter, es ist gerecht. 
[45:8] Du liebest das Recht und hassest den Frevel; / Drum hat Elohim, dein Gott, dich gesalbt / Mit Freudenöl vor deinen Genossen. 
[45:9] Myrrhe, Aloe und Kassia sind alle deine Kleider; / Aus Elfenbeinpalästen erfreut dich Saitenspiel. 
[45:10] In deinem Prachtzug sind Königstöchter. / Die Gattin steht dir zur Rechten in Ofirgold. 
[45:11] Höre, Tochter, sieh her und neige dein Ohr! / Vergiß dein Volk und dein Vaterhaus! 
[45:12] Und begehrt deiner Schönheit der König / — Er ist ja der Herr —, so huldige ihm! 
[45:13] Du Tochter aus Tyrus, die Reichsten im Volk / Werden dir schmeicheln mit ihren Geschenken. 
[45:14] Ganz Pracht ist die Königstochter in ihrem Gemach, / Mit Gold durchwirkt ist ihr Gewand. 
[45:15] In bunten Kleidern wird sie zum König geleitet. / Ihr folgen Jungfraun, die ihr befreundet — / Sie werden dir zugebracht. 
[45:16] Man führt sie herbei mit Jubel und Jauchzen, / Sie ziehen ein in des Königs Palast. 
[45:17] An deiner Väter Statt werden deine Söhne treten; / Die wirst du zu Fürsten setzen im ganzen Land. Deines Namens will ich gedenken in jedem Geschlecht. / Drum werden dich Völker preisen immer und ewig. 
[46:1]    Dem Sangmeister. Von den Söhnen Korahs. Ein Lied von Alamot. 
[46:2] Elohim ist uns Zuflucht und Schutz, / Ein Beistand in Nöten, reichlich bewährt. 
[46:3] Drum fürchten wir nichts, ob auch wanket die Erde, / Ob Berge stürzen mitten ins Meer, 
[46:4] Ob seine Wasser tosen und schäumen, / Von seinem Brausen die Berge erbeben. Sela. 
[46:5] Ein Strom ist da: seine Bäche erfreun die Stadt Elohims, / Des Höchsten heilige Wohnung. 
[46:6] Elohim weilt dort, sie wanket nicht / Elohim hilft ihr, wenn der Morgen naht. 
[46:7] Es toben Völker, es wanken Reiche. / Erschallt sein Donner, so zittert die Erde. 
[46:8] Jahwe der Heerscharen ist mit uns, / Unsre Burg ist der Gott Jakobs. Sela. 
[46:9] Kommt, schauet die Taten Jahwes: / Er flößt der Erde Entsetzen ein. 
[46:10] Er steuert dem Krieg bis ans Ende der Welt, / Zerbricht den Bogen, zerschlägt den Spieß, / Verbrennt die Wagen mit Feuer. 
[46:11] "Laßt ab und erkennt: ich bin Elohim, / Groß unter den Völkern und groß auf Erden." Jahwe der Heerscharen ist mit uns, / Unsre Burg ist der Gott Jakobs. Sela. 
[47:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. 
[47:2] Ihr Völker alle, klatscht in die Hände, / Jauchzt Elohim mit Jubelschall! 
[47:3] Denn Jahwe ist hoch, ist furchtbar, / Ein großer König in aller Welt. 
[47:4] Er beugte Völker unter uns / Und legte uns Leute zu Füßen. 
[47:5] Er wählte uns unser Erbe aus, / Die Herrlichkeit Jakobs, den er liebt. Sela. 
[47:6] Elohim steigt unter Jauchzen empor, / Jahwe beim Klange des Widderhorns. 
[47:7] Lobsingt Elohim, lobsinget! / Lobsingt unserm König, lobsinget! 
[47:8] Denn aller Welt König ist Elohim. / Singt ihm ein Huldigungslied! 
[47:9] Königlich herrscht Elohim über Völker, / Elohim sitzt auf seinem heiligen Thron. Der Völker Fürsten versammeln sich / Als Volk des Gottes Abrahams. / Denn der Erde Schilde sind Elohims. / Er ist gewaltig erhaben! 
[48:1] Ein Lied. Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. 
[48:2] Groß ist Jahwe und hoch zu preisen / In unsers Gottes Stadt, auf seinem heiligen Berge. 
[48:3] Lieblich erhebt sich der Zionsberg, die Wonne der ganzen Erde. / Ein Gottessitz ist da des großen Königs Stadt. 
[48:4] An ihren Palästen hat Elohim / Als sichre Schutzwehr sich kundgetan. 
[48:5] Denn sieh, die Könige fanden sich ein, / Sie zogen verbündet heran. 
[48:6] Doch als sie schauten, da staunten sie. / Sie wurden bestürzt und flohen voll Angst. 
[48:7] Beben ergriff sie daselbst, / Zittern gleich einer Gebärerin. 
[48:8] Wie Tarsisschiffe der Oststurm zerschellt, / (So wurden die Feinde vernichtet). 
[48:9] Was wir gehört, wir haben's nun selbst / In Jahwes Heerscharen Stadt erlebt, / In unsers Gottes Stadt: / Elohim erhält sie auf ewig! Sela. 
[48:10] Wir haben, Elohim, deiner Gnade geharrt / Inmitten deines Tempels. 
[48:11] Wie dein Name, Elohim, so reicht auch dein Ruhm / Bis an die Enden der Erde. / Deine Rechte ist voller Gerechtigkeit. 
[48:12] So freuet sich denn der Zionsberg, / Laut jubeln die Töchter Judas / Um deiner Gerichte willen. 
[48:13] Geht rings um Zion, umwandelt es, / Zählt seine Türme! 
[48:14] Gebt acht auf seine Mauer, / Durchschreitet seine Paläste, / Damit ihr dem künftigen Geschlecht erzählt: "Dieser Gott ist unser Gott auf immer und ewig! / Er führt uns auch über den Tod hinaus." 
[49:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. 
[49:2] Höret dies, all ihr Völker, / Merket auf, all ihr Bewohner der Welt, 
[49:3] Leutesöhne wie Herrensöhne, / Reich und arm miteinander! 
[49:4] Mein Mund soll Weisheit reden, / Meines Herzens Sinnen ist Einsicht. 
[49:5] Ich will mein Ohr einem Lehrspruch neigen, / Mein Rätsel erschließen bei Zitherklang. 
[49:6] Was soll ich mich fürchten in schlimmen Tagen, / Wenn mich meiner Feinde Frevel umringt? 
[49:7] Sie vertrauen auf ihr Vermögen, / Ihres großen Reichtums rühmen sie sich. 
[49:8] Und doch kann keiner den andern erlösen / Noch Gott ein Sühngeld für ihn zahlen. 
[49:9] Der Seele Sühngeld ist nicht zu erschwingen; / Es zu erlegen, bleibt ewig unmöglich. 
[49:10] So wird denn niemand für immer leben / noch dem Schicksal entgehn, die Gruft zu schaun. 
[49:11] Nein, der Reiche muß sehn: selbst Weise sterben, / Nicht minder als Toren und Narren vergehn. / Ihre Schätze müssen sie andern lassen. 
[49:12] Die Reichen, sie denken: ihre Häuser sind ewig, / Ihre Wohnungen währen für und für; / Drum nennen sie Länder mit ihrem Namen. 
[49:13] Doch wer in Reichtum prangt, bleibt nicht; / Er gleicht den Tieren, die man vertilgt. 
[49:14] So geht es den Leuten voll Selbstvertraun / Und allen, die ihnen Beifall zollen. Sela. 
[49:15] Wie Schafe sinken sie in die Gruft: sie weidet der Tod. / Doch ein Morgen kommt, wo die Frommen über sie herrschen. / Ihr Fels zerreißt ja das Totenreich: / Es bleibt ihre Wohnstatt nicht. 
[49:16] Fürwahr, Elohim wird meine Seele erlösen / Aus der Macht der Scheôl; denn er entrückt mich. Sela. 
[49:17] Fürchte dich nicht, wenn einer reich wird, / Wenn seines Hauses Glanz sich mehrt. 
[49:18] Denn beim Sterben nimmt er das alles nicht mit, / Nicht fährt ihm nach seine Herrlichkeit. 
[49:19] Wenn er sich im Leben auch glücklich preist, / Wenn man dich ob guter Tage auch rühmt — 
[49:20] Du gehest doch ein in der Väter Haus, / Die nimmer das Licht erblicken. Wer in Reichtum prangt und ist ohne Verstand, / Der gleicht den Tieren, die man vertilgt. 
[50:1]  Ein Psalm Asafs. / El Elohim Jahwe: Er redet / Und ruft der Erde d vom Aufgang der Sonne bis zum Niedergang. 
[50:2] Aus Zion, der Schönheit Krone, / Strahlt Elohim hervor. 
[50:3] Unser Gott, er kommt und schweiget nicht. / Verzehrend Feuer geht vor ihm her, / Rings um ihn stürmt es gewaltig. 
[50:4] Er ruft die Himmel droben herbei. / Und die Erde, sein Volk zu richten: 
[50:5] "Versammelt mir die Frommen, / Die den Bund mit mir im Opfer geschlossen!" 
[50:6] Die Himmel künden seine Gerechtigkeit; / Denn Elohim — er ist's, der richtet! Sela. 
[50:7] "Höre, mein Volk, o laß mich reden! / Israel, laß mich dich warnen! / Elohim, dein Gott, bin ich. 
[50:8] Nicht deiner Schlachtopfer wegen rüge ich dich — / Sind doch deine Brandopfer immer vor mir. 
[50:9] Nicht brauche ich Stiere aus deinem Hause / Noch Böcke aus deinen Hürden. 
[50:10] Denn mein ist alles Wild des Waldes, / Das viele Getier auf den Bergen. 
[50:11] Ich kenne jeden Vogel der Berge, / Und was auf den Feldern sich regt, ist mein. 
[50:12] Sollte mich hungern, dir sagte ich's nicht. / Denn mein ist der Erdkreis und was ihn erfüllt. 
[50:13] Esse ich etwa der Stiere Fleisch / Und trink ich der Böcke Blut? 
[50:14] Opfere Elohim Dank / Und bezahle dem Höchsten deine Gelübde! 
[50:15] "Rufe mich an am Tage der Not: / Dann will ich dich retten, daß du mich ehrest." 
[50:16] Aber zum Frevler spricht Elohim: / Wie? du zählst meine Satzungen auf / Und redest von meinem Bund? 
[50:17] Das wagst du und hasset doch Zucht / Und wirfst meine Worte hinter dich? 
[50:18] Siehst du einen Dieb, so gesellst du dich ihm, / Und mit Ehebrechern gehest du um. 
[50:19] Du lässest deinen Mund zum Bösen los, / Und deine Zunge spinnet Trug. 
[50:20] Mit andern verleumdest du deinen Bruder, / Deiner Mutter Sohn hängst du Schande an. 
[50:21] Das hast du getan, und ich schwieg dazu. / Da dachtest du denn: ich wäre wie du. / Aber ich will dich zur Rechenschaft ziehn, / Dir's unter die Augen stellen." 
[50:22] Merkt das wohl, die ihr Gottes vergeßt; / Sonst werd ich zerreißen, und niemand rettet. 
[50:23] Wer Dank opfert, der ehret mich recht, / Und er bahnet den Weg, / Auf dem ich ihm zeige das Heil Elohims. 
[51:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[51:2] Als der Prophet Nathan zu ihm kam, / nachdem er zu Batseba eingegangen war. 
[51:3] Sei mir gnädig, Elohim, nach deiner Huld, / In großer Erbarmung tilg meine Frevel! 
[51:4] Wasche mich völlig von meiner Schuld / Und von meiner Sünde mache mich rein! 
[51:5] Denn meine Frevel sind mir bewußt, / Und meine Sünde ist stets vor mir. 
[51:6] An dir allein habe ich gesündigt, / Und was dir mißfällt, hab ich verübt. / Denn du sollst recht behalten mit deinem Spruch, / Rein erscheinen mit deinem Urteil. 
[51:7] Ich bin ja in Schuld geboren, / In Sünde hat mich meine Mutter empfangen. 
[51:8] Doch da du Wahrheit im Herzen liebst, / So mach mir im Innern Weisheit kund! 
[51:9] Entsündige mich mit Ysop, so werd ich rein, / Wasche mich, so werd ich weißer als Schnee. 
[51:10] Sprich mir Wonne und Freude zu, / Daß deine Gebeine frohlocken, die du zerschlagen. 
[51:11] Verbirg dein Antlitz vor meinen Sünden, / Und all meine Frevel tilge aus! 
[51:12] Ein reines Herz schaff mir, Elohim, / Einen festen Geist erneure in mir! 
[51:13] Wirf mich nicht weg von deinem Antlitz, / Deinen Heiligen Geist nimm nicht von mir! 
[51:14] Erfreue mich wieder mit deinem Heil, / Mit willigem Geiste stütze mich! 
[51:15] Dann lehre ich Frevler deine Wege, / Und Sünder sollen sich zu dir kehren. 
[51:16] Von Blutschuld rette mich, Elohim, du Gott meines Heils! / So jauchzt meine Zunge ob deiner Gnade. 
[51:17] Adonái, tu mir die Lippen auf; / Dann wird mein Mund deinen Ruhm verkünden. 
[51:18] Schlachtopfer begehrst du ja nicht — sonst gäbe ich sie —; / Brandopfer gefallen dir nicht. 
[51:19] Elohims Schlachtopfer sind ein zerbrochener Geist. / Ein zerbrochen, zerschlagen Herz, Elohim, verschmähest du nicht! Tu wohl an Zion in deiner Gnade, / Baue die Mauern Jerusalems! Dann werden dir rechte Opfer gefallen: / Brandopfer, Ganzopfer, / Dann wird man Stiere opfern auf deinem Altar. 
[52:1] Dem Sangmeister. Eine Betrachtung (?) Davids. 
[52:2] Als der Edomiter Doeg kam und Saul meldete: "David hat sich ins Haus Ahimelechs begeben." 
[52:3] Was rühmst du dich der Bosheit, du Held?! / Gottes Gnade währt für und für. 
[52:4] Verderben sinnt seine Zunge / Gleich scharfem Messer, du Unheilstifter! 
[52:5] Böses liebst du mehr als Gutes, / Lüge redest du lieber als Wahrheit. Sela. 
[52:6] Du liebst nur verderbliche Reden, / Du Zunge voll Trug! 
[52:7] So wird denn auch Gott dich zertrümmern auf immer, / Er wird dich ergreifen, wegreißen aus deinem Gezelt, / Aus der Lebenden Land dich entwurzeln. Sela. 
[52:8] Die Gerechten werden das schauen und schauern, / Sie werden sein lachen und sprechen: 
[52:9] "Seht doch den Mann! Er wählte sich nicht Elohim zum Schutz; / Auf des Reichtums Fülle verließ er sich, / Dünkte sich sicher in seinem Frevel." Ich aber bin wie ein grünender Ölbaum (gepflanzt) in Elohims Haus. / Ich traue der Gnade Elohims auf immer und ewig. Preisen will ich dich immerdar, weil du es vollbracht. / Harren will ich auf deinen Namen, / Denn er ist köstlich vor deinen Frommen. 
[53:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach Machalát. Eine Betrachtung (?) Davids. 
[53:2] Die Toren denken bei sich: "Es ist kein Gott." / Verderbt und abscheulich treiben sie Frevel; / Da ist keiner, der Gutes tut. 
[53:3] Elohim schaut vom Himmel herab auf die Menschenkinder, / Daß er sehe, ob jemand Einsicht habe / Und frage nach Gott. 
[53:4] Aber allesamt sind sie abgewichen, alle entartet; / Da ist keiner, der Gutes tut, / Auch nicht ein einziger. 
[53:5] "Sind denn so unvernünftig die Übeltäter, / Die mein Volk verzehren, wie man Brot verzehrt, / Die nicht zu Elohim beten?" 
[53:6] Dann beben sie schaudernd, obwohl kein Grund zum Schaudern vorhanden ist. / Denn Elohim zerstreut deiner Feinde Gebeine. / Du machst sie zuschanden, denn Elohim hat sie verworfen. Ach, käme aus Zion für Israel Heil! / Wendet Elohim seines Volkes Los, / So wird Jakob sich freun und Israel jauchzen. 
[54:1] Dem Sangmeister, mit Saitenspielbegleitung. Eine Betrachtung (?) Davids. 
[54:2] Als die Sifiter gekommen waren und Saul gemeldet hatten: "David hält sich bei uns verborgen." 
[54:3] Elohim, hilf mir durch deinen Namen, / Durch seine Stärke schaffe mir Recht! 
[54:4] Elohim, höre doch mein Gebet, / Horch auf die Worte meines Mundes! 
[54:5] Denn Fremde erheben sich wider mich, / Und Grausame trachten mir nach dem Leben, / Sie haben Gott nicht vor Augen. Sela. 
[54:6] Wahrlich, mein Helfer ist Elohim, / Adonái ist meines Lebens Halt. 
[54:7] Das Böse muß fallen auf meine Feinde — / Nach deiner Treue vernichte sie! Dann bring ich dir freiwillige Opfer, / Deinem Namen, o Jahwe, dank ich, daß er so hold. Denn er hat mich errettet aus aller Not, / Und an meinen Feinden erfreut sich mein Auge. 
[55:1] Dem Sangmeister, mit Saitenspielbegleitung. Eine Betrachtung (?) Davids. 
[55:2] Vernimm, Elohim, mein Gebet, / Entzieh dich nicht meinem Flehn! 
[55:3] Horch auf mich und erhöre mich, / Ich sinne ruhlos und seufze. 
[55:4] Denn ich muß hören des Feindes Stimme und empfinde des Frevlers Druck. / Sie wälzen Unheil auf mich und stellen mir grimmig nach. 
[55:5] Mein Herz bebt mir in der Brust, / Und Schrecken des Todes fallen auf mich. 
[55:6] Furcht und Zittern dringt auf mich ein, / Entsetzen hat mich bedeckt. 
[55:7] Drum sag ich: "O, hätt ich doch Schwingen wie Tauben! / Weg wollt ich fliegen, einen Ruhplatz suchen. 
[55:8] Ja, weithin möcht ich flüchten / Und in der Wüste rasten. Sela. 
[55:9] Eine Freistatt würd ich mir suchen / Vor dem Toben des Sturms, vor dem Wetter. 
[55:10] Verwirr ihre Zungen, Adonái, zerteile sie! / Denn ich schaue Gewalttat und Streit in der Stadt. 
[55:11] Tag und Nacht gehn sie auf den Mauern umher, / Unheil und Elend ist drinnen. 
[55:12] Ja, Verderben ist drinnen; / Von ihrem Markte weicht nicht Bedrückung und Trug. 
[55:13] Denn nicht ein Feind schmäht mich: / Das würd ich ertragen; / Auch nicht mein Hasser tut groß wider mich: / Dann würd ich mich vor ihm verbergen. 
[55:14] Nein, du bist's, den ich mir gleichgeschätzt, / Mein Freund und mein Vertrauter. 
[55:15] Wie pflegten wir traute Gemeinschaft, / Gingen einträchtig ins Haus Elohims! 
[55:16] Der Tod überrasche sie, / Mögen sie lebend zur Unterwelt fahren! / Denn in ihrer Wohnstatt, in ihrem Herzen ist Bosheit. 
[55:17] Ich aber rufe zu Elohim, / Und Jahwe wird mich erretten. 
[55:18] Des Abends, Morgens und Mittags klag ich und seufze: / So hört er mein Flehn. 
[55:19] Er wird mich erretten, in Frieden mich leiten, daß keiner mir beikommt; / Denn ihrer sind viele wider mich. 
[55:20] Gott wird hören und Antwort geben — / Er, der da thronet seit Urbeginn. Sela. / Denn sie besinnen sich nicht eines Bessern, / Elohim fürchten sie nicht. 
[55:21] Er legt seine Hand an seine Freunde, / Entweiht seinen Bund. 
[55:22] Glatt wie Butter sind seine Worte, / Aber in seinem Herzen ist Krieg. / Seine Reden sind linder als Öl, / Und doch sind's gezückte Schwerter. 
[55:23] Wirf deine Bürde auf Jahwe! / Er wird dich versorgen; / Nimmer läßt er den Gerechten wanken. Doch du, Elohim, wirst sie in die unterste Grube stürzen. / Die da mit Mord und Trug umgehn, / Sollen nicht ihres Lebens Hälfte erreichen. / Ich aber traue auf dich! 
[56:1] Dem Sangmeister. Nach (der Melodie des Liedes:) "O stumme Taube in der Ferne"(?). Ein Gedicht(?) Davids. / Als ihn die Philister in Gat ergriffen. 
[56:2] Sei mir gnädig, Elohim, denn Menschen treten mich nieder; / Allzeit befehden und drängen sie mich. 
[56:3] Meine Laurer quälen mich fort und fort, / Denn in Stolz befehden mich viele. 
[56:4] Will Furcht mich befallen, / So trau ich auf dich. 
[56:5] Elohim stärkt mich, sein Wort zu rühmen. / Elohim vertrau ich, ich fürchte mich nicht. / Was kann mir ein Sterblicher tun? 
[56:6] Meine Worte verdrehen sie immerfort, / Nur Böses denken sie wider mich. 
[56:7] Sie rotten sich, senden Laurer aus: / Die spüren mir nach auf Schritt und Tritt; / Denn sie trachten mir nach dem Leben. 
[56:8] Doch umsonst! Ich entrinne —. / Im Zorn, Elohim, wirf Leute danieder! 
[56:9] Meine Flüchtlingstage hast du gezählt. / Sammle meine Tränen in deinen Schlauch! / Stehen sie nicht in deinem Buch? 
[56:10] Einst weichen meine Feinde zurück; / Denn es kommt ein Tag, da ich rufe. / Dies weiß ich, daß Elohim hilft. 
[56:11] Elohim stärkt mich, das Wort zu rühmen, / Jahwe stärkt mich, das Wort zu rühmen. 
[56:12] Elohim vertrau ich, ich fürchte mich nicht. / Was können mir Menschen tun? 
[56:13] Dir, Elohim, erfüll ich meine Gelübde, / Dankopfer will ich dir bringen. Denn du hast mein Leben vom Tode errettet, / Ja, meine Füße vom Gleiten, / Damit ich wandeln kann vor Elohim / Im Lichte der Lebendigen. 
[57:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Melodie des Liedes:) "Verderbe nicht!" / Ein Gedicht (?) Davids. Als er vor Saul in die Höhle floh. 
[57:2] Sei mir gnädig, Elohim, sei mir gnädig! / Denn meine Seele sucht Zuflucht bei dir. / In deiner Flügel Schatten bin ich geborgen, / Bis das Verderben vorüber ist. 
[57:3] Ich rufe zu Elohim, dem Höchsten, / Zu El, der's für mich hinausführt. 
[57:4] Er sendet vom Himmel (sein Heil) und hilft mir. / Wenn mich mein Verfolger zum Kampf reizt, — Sela — / Dann sendet Elohim seine Huld und Treu. 
[57:5] Ich muß unter Löwen weilen, / Unter Leuten ruhn, die Flammen sprühn, / Ihre Zähne sind Spieß und Pfeile, / Ihre Zungen ein scharfes Schwert. 
[57:6] Elohim, erheb dich über die Himmel, / Deine Herrlichkeit über alle Welt! 
[57:7] Sie hatten meinen Füßen ein Netz gestellt, / So daß meine Seele in Angst sich wand. / Sie höhlten vor mir eine Grube aus — / Und fallen nun selbst hinein. Sela. 
[57:8] Mein Herz ist getrost, Elohim, mein Herz ist getrost; / Ich will singen und spielen. 
[57:9] Wach auf, mein Herz! / Wach auf, du Harfe und Zither! / Wecken will ich das Morgenrot. 
[57:10] Unter Völkern, Adonái, will ich dich preisen, / Dir singen unter den Leuten. 
[57:11] Denn groß bis zum Himmel ist deine Gnade, / Bis zu den Wolken reicht deine Treu. Elohim, erheb dich über die Himmel, / Deine Herrlichkeit über alle Welt! 
[58:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Melodie des Liedes:) "Verderbe nicht!" (?). / Ein Gedicht (?) Davids. 
[58:2] Redet ihr wirklich Gerechtigkeit, / Richtet ihr redlich, ihr Menschenkinder? 
[58:3] Nein, im Herzen sinnet ihr Frevel, / Für eurer Hände Gewalttat macht ihr im Lande Bahn. 
[58:4] Von Geburt an weichen die Frevler ab, / Die Lügenredner irren von Kindheit an? 
[58:5] Gift haben sie wie Schlangengift, / Wie eine taube Natter, die ihr Ohr verstopft, 
[58:6] Die nicht hört auf der Zauberer Stimme, / Auf die Stimme der klugen Beschwörer. 
[58:7] Elohim, zerbrich ihre Zähne in ihrem Mund, / Reiß aus, o Jahwe, der Löwen Gebiß! 
[58:8] Sie sollen zerfließen, wie Wasser verläuft. / Schießt er seine Pfeile, so seien sie stumpf. 
[58:9] Sie sollen der Schnecke gleichen, die kriechend zerfließt, / Eines Weibes Fehlgeburt, die die Sonne nicht sieht. 
[58:10] Eh eure Töpfe die Dornen merken — / Sei roh oder gar das Fleisch: der Sturm treibt's weg. 
[58:11] Der Gerechte frohlockt, wenn er Rache geschaut, / Er badet den Fuß in der Frevler Blut. Dann sagt man: "Ja wahrlich, der Fromme hat Frucht; / Ja, es gibt einen Gott, der da richtet auf Erden!" 
[59:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise des Liedes:) "Verderbe nicht!" (?). / Ein Gedicht (?) Davids, als Saul hinsandte und sie das Haus bewachten, um ihn zu töten. 
[59:2] Errette mich, mein Gott, von meinen Feinden, / Vor meinen Widersachern schütze mich! 
[59:3] Rette mich von den Übeltätern / Und hilf mir gegen die Mörder! 
[59:4] Denn fürwahr, sie lauern mir auf. / Es rotten sich Grausame wider mich, / doch bin ich, o Jahwe, schuldlos daran. 
[59:5] Aber trotz meiner Unschuld stürmen sie an und rüsten sich. / Auf, hilf mir, sieh drein! 
[59:6] Du, Jahwe Elohim der Heerscharen (Herr), Gott Israels, / Wach auf, alle Heiden zu strafen! / Verschone keinen der freveln Verräter! Sela. 
[59:7] Jeden Abend kehren sie wieder, knurren wie Hunde, / Durchstreifen die Stadt. 
[59:8] Fürwahr, sie geifern mit ihrem Munde, / Auf ihren Lippen sind Schwerter. / Denn (sie denken:) "Wer hört es?" 
[59:9] Du aber, Jahwe, lachest ihrer, / Du spottest aller Heiden. 
[59:10] Mein Hort, dein will ich harren; / Denn Elohim ist mein Schutz. 
[59:11] Mein Gott kommt mir mit seiner Gnade entgegen, / An meinen Laurern läßt Elohim meine Lust mich sehn. 
[59:12] Töte sie nicht, damit es mein Volk nicht vergesse; / Treib sie umher durch deine Macht und stürze sie nieder, / Du, unser Schild, Adonái! 
[59:13] Es sündigt ihr Mund in jedem Wort ihrer Lippen / — Sie sollen sich fangen in ihrem Hochmut! —, / Ihr Reden ist nichts als Fluchen und Lügen. 
[59:14] Vertilg sie im Grimm, vertilge sie, daß sie nicht mehr seien! / Dann wird man erkennen, daß Elohim in Jakob herrscht / Bis an die Enden der Erde. Sela. 
[59:15] Jeden Abend kehren sie wieder, knurren wie Hunde, / Durchstreifen die Stadt. 
[59:16] Sie irren umher und suchen nach Speise. / Wenn sie nicht satt werden, murren sie. 
[59:17] Ich aber will singen von deiner Macht / Und jauchzen am Morgen ob deiner Huld. / Denn du bist mein Schutz, / Eine Zuflucht am Tage der Not. Mein Hort, dir will ich singen. / Denn Elohim ist mein Schutz, mein gnädiger Gott. 
[60:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise des Liedes:) "Eine Lilie ist das Zeugnis", ein Gedicht (?) Davids, zum Lehren. 
[60:2] Als er mit den Syrern Mesopothamiens und den Syrern von Zoba stritt, / und als Joab zurückkehrte und 12000 Edomiter im Salztal schlug. 
[60:3] Elohim, du hast uns verworfen, zersprengt; / Du hast uns gezürnt: erheb uns nun wieder! 
[60:4] Erschüttert hast du das Land, es zerrissen; / Heile seine Brüche, denn es wankt! 
[60:5] Du ließest dein Volk gar Schweres erleben, / Du hast uns getränkt mit Taumelwein. 
[60:6] Nun hast du deinen Frommen ein Panier geschenkt, / Um das sie sich scharen sollen / Für die gerechte Sache. Sela. 
[60:7] Damit deine Lieben gerettet werden, / So hilf denn mit deiner Rechten und hör uns! 
[60:8] Elohim hat mir verheißen bei seinem heiligen Namen: / Frohlocken soll ich, austeilen Sichem / Und vermessen das Tal Sukkot. 
[60:9] Mein ist Gilead und mein Manasse, / Efraim schützt mein Haupt als Helm, / Juda ist mein Herrscherstab. 
[60:10] Moab ist mein Waschbecken, / Auf Edom werf ich meinen Schuh. / Schrei laut über mich o Philisterstadt!" 
[60:11] Wer bringt mich hinein in die feste Stadt? / Wer führt mich hin nach Edom? 
[60:12] Du, Elohim, du hast uns verworfen; / Du zogst nicht aus, Elohim, mit unsern Heeren. O schaff uns Beistand gegen den Feind! / Denn nichtig ist Menschenhilfe. Mit Elohim verrichten wir Heldentaten. / Er wird unsre Feinde zertreten. 
[61:1] Dem Sangmeister, auf Saitenspiel. Von David. 
[61:2] Hör, Elohim, mein lautes Flehn, / Merke auf mein Gebet! 
[61:3] Vom Ende des Landes ruf ich zu dir in meines Herzens Schmachten. / Auf einen Fels, der mir zu hoch ist, leite mich! 
[61:4] Du bist ja stets meine Zuflucht gewesen, / Ein starker Turm vor dem Feinde. 
[61:5] Laß mich ewig weilen in deinem Gezelt, / Im Schutz deiner Flügel Bergung finden! Sela. 
[61:6] Denn du, Elohim, hast meine Gelübde gehört, / Du hast den Frommen ihr Erbe gegeben. 
[61:7] Den König laß lange leben, / Laß seine Jahre für immer währen! 
[61:8] Er throne ewig vor Elohim! / Deine Huld und Treue laß ihn behüten! Dann will ich stets deinen Namen preisen, / Dir meine Gelübde täglich bezahlen. 
[62:1] Dem Sangmeister Jedutun zum Vortrag übergeben. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[62:2] Ja, Elohims harrt still meine Seele, / Von ihm kommt mein Heil. 
[62:3] Ja, er ist mein Fels und mein Heil, / Meine Burg — ich werde nicht wanken! 
[62:4] Wie lange stürmt ihr noch ein auf einen einzelnen Mann, / Sucht alle ihn niederzuwerfen? Aber ihr seid / Wie eine sinkende Wand, eine stürzende Mauer! 
[62:5] Ja, von seiner Höhe beschließen sie ihn zu stürzen. / Drum haben sie Lust an der Lüge. / Sie segnen mit ihrem Munde, / Aber im Herzen fluchen sie. Sela. 
[62:6] Ja, Elohims harr ich still, meine Seele, / Denn meine Hoffnung kommt von ihm. 
[62:7] Ja, er ist mein Fels und mein Heil, / Meine Burg — ich werde nicht wanken! 
[62:8] Auf Elohim ruhn meine Hilfe und Ehre; / Mein starker Fels, meine Zuflucht ist in Elohim. 
[62:9] Traut ihm, ihr Leute, zu aller Zeit! / Schüttet vor ihm eure Herzen aus! / Elohim ist unsre Zuflucht. Sela. 
[62:10] Nur ein Hauch sind Leutesöhne. / Lüge sind Herrensöhne; / Auf der Waage schnellten sie sicher empor. / Allzumal sind sie ein Hauch. 
[62:11] Vertraut nicht auf erpreßtes Gut, / Laßt euch nicht blenden durch Raub! / Wächst das Vermögen, so achtet nicht drauf! 
[62:12] Einmal, zweimal hat Elohim geredet, was ich gehört: / Elohims ist die Macht. "Aber bei dir, Adonái, ist auch die Gnade." / Denn du vergiltst einem jeden nach seinem Tun. 
[63:1] Ein Psalm Davids, als er in der Wüste Juda war. 
[63:2] Elohim, mein Gott bist du; dich suche ich. / Es dürstet nach dir meine Seele; / es schmachtet nach dir mein Leib / Im dürren Lande — da ist er ermattet aus Wassermangel. 
[63:3] So hab ich einst nach dir im Heiligtum geschaut, / Um deine Macht und Herrlichkeit zu sehn. 
[63:4] Denn deine Gnade ist besser als Leben; / Meine Lippen sollen dich loben. 
[63:5] So will ich dich preisen mein Leben lang, / In deinem Namen die Hände erheben. 
[63:6] Dann bin ich satt wie von Mark und Fett. / Und mit jubelnden Lippen lobsingt mein Mund, 
[63:7] Wenn ich dein gedenke auf meinem Lager, / In den Nachtwachen über dich sinne. 
[63:8] Denn du bist mein Beistand gewesen, / Im Schatten deiner Flügel juble ich. 
[63:9] Meine Seel bleibt treu bei dir, / Mich hält deine Rechte fest. 
[63:10] Doch sie, die mein Leben mir rauben wollen — / In die Tiefen der Erde sollen sie fahren! 
[63:11] Man wird sie dem Schwert übergeben, / Sie müssen der Schakale Beute sein. Doch der König wird in Elohim sich freun. / Es rühmt sich jeder, der bei ihm schwört. / Denn der Lügner Mund muß verstummen. 
[64:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[64:2] Hör, Elohim, mein klagendes Rufen, / Vor dem schrecklichen Feinde bewahre mein Leben! 
[64:3] Schütze mich vor der Frevler Rotte, / Vor dem lärmenden Haufen der Übeltäter! 
[64:4] Sie schärfen ihre Zunge wie Schwerter, / Spannen als Pfeile verwundende Reden. 
[64:5] Sie schießen heimlich den Frommen, / Treffen ihn plötzlich ohne Scheu. 
[64:6] Sie nehmen sich fest das Böse vor; / Sie beschließen, Schlingen zu legen, / Und fragen: "Wer wird sie sehn?" 
[64:7] Sie erdenken Frevel: "Wir haben's vollendet, der Plan ist ersonnen!" / Eines jeden Herz ist ein Abgrund. 
[64:8] Aber da trifft sie Gott mit dem Pfeil: / Plötzlich sind ihre Wunden da! 
[64:9] Ihre eigne Zunge bringt sie zu Fall. / Die auf sie sehen, schütteln den Kopf. 
[64:10] Da fürchten sich alle, / Verkünden das Tun Elohims / Und betrachten sein Werk. Der Gerechte freut sich in Jahwe und fliehet zu ihm. / Sein rühmen sich alle redlichen Herzen. 
[65:1] Dem Sangmeister, ein Psalm Davids. Ein Lied. 
[65:2] Dir gebührt, Elohim, in Zion ein Lobgesang, / Dir soll man Gelübde bezahlen. 
[65:3] Du erhörest Gebete; / Drum kommen alle Menschen zu dir. 
[65:4] Sind meine Sünden mir unerträglich — / Du wirst unsre Frevel vergeben. 
[65:5] Heil dem, den du erwählst und nahen lässest, / Daß er weile in deinen Höfen! / Laß uns deines Hauses Segen genießen, / Deines heiligen Tempels Segen! 
[65:6] In Huld erhörst du uns furchtbar, Gott unsers Heils. / Dir vertraun alle Enden der Erde und fernen Meere. 
[65:7] Er festigt die Berge durch seine Kraft, / Er ist umgürtet mit Stärke. 
[65:8] Er stillet das Brausen des Meeres, seiner Wellen Gedröhn / Und das Tosen der Völker. 
[65:9] Drum zittern die fernsten Erdbewohner vor deinen Zeichen. / Ost und West erfüllst du mit Jubel. 
[65:10] Du hast des Landes gedacht, ihm Fülle verliehn, / Es mit Reichtum begabt. / Der Bach Elohims war mit Wasser gefüllt. / Du hast den Menschen Getreide geschenkt, / Hast das Land so fruchtbar gemacht. 
[65:11] Des Erdreichs Furchen hast du getränkt, seine Schollen erweicht, / Es durch Regen gelockert / Und sein Gewächs gesegnet. 
[65:12] Du hast das Jahr deiner Güte gekrönt, / Und deine Geleise triefen von Fett. 
[65:13] Es triefen die Auen der Steppe, / Mit Jubel die Hügel sich gürten. Es sind die Fluren mit Herden bedeckt, / Die Täler mit Korn gehüllt — / Alles jauchzet und singt! 
[66:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Lied. Ein Psalm. / Jauchzt Elohim, alle Lande, 
[66:2] Besingt seines Namens Ehre, / Preiset ihn herrlich! 
[66:3] Sprecht zu Elohim: "Wie hehr sind deine Werke! / Ob deiner großen Macht schmeicheln dir deine Feinde. 
[66:4] Alle Welt muß dir sich beugen und lobsingen, / Lobsingen deinem Namen!" Sela. 
[66:5] Kommt, schauet die Taten Elohims! / Hehr waltet er unter den Menschenkindern. 
[66:6] Er wandelte Meer in trocknes Land, / Daß man den Strom zu Fuß durchzog. / Drum wollen wir uns sein freun. 
[66:7] Ewig herrscht er in seiner Macht. / Seine Augen schauen die Völker an: / Die Empörer dürfen sich nicht erheben. Sela. 
[66:8] Preiset, ihr Völker, unsern Gott, / Laßt laut sein Lob erschallen! 
[66:9] Er hat uns am Leben erhalten / Und unsern Fuß nicht wanken lassen. 
[66:10] Denn du hast uns geprüft, Elohim, / Hast uns wie Silber geläutert: 
[66:11] Du hast uns ins Gefängnis geführt, / Auf unsre Lenden Last gelegt. 
[66:12] Du hast uns Menschen zu Herren gesetzt; / Wir sind in Feuer und Wasser geraten — / Aber du hast uns hinausgeführt, / Daß wir reiche Fülle genießen. 
[66:13] Drum komm ich mit Brandopfern in dein Haus, / Will dir meine Gelübde bezahlen, 
[66:14] Die meine Lippen kundgetan, / Die mein Mund geredet in meiner Not. 
[66:15] Als Brandopfer bring ich dir feiste Schafe / Zugleich mit der Widder Opferrauch, / Ich opfre Rinder samt Böcken. Sela. 
[66:16] Kommt her, hört zu, ihr Gottesfürchtigen alle! / Erzählen will ich, was er mir getan. 
[66:17] Zu ihm rief ich mit meinem Munde — / Und Lobpreis war auf meiner Zunge. 
[66:18] Hegte ich Böses in meinem Herzen, / Adonái würde nicht hören. 
[66:19] Aber Elohim hat mich erhört, / Er hat gemerkt auf mein lautes Flehn. 
[66:20] Gepriesen sei Elohim! Er hat mein Gebet nicht abgewiesen, / Seine Gnade mir nicht entzogen. 
[67:1] Dem Sangmeister, mit Saitenspielbegleitung. Ein Psalm, ein Lied. 
[67:2] Elohim sei uns gnädig und segne uns, / Lasse bei uns sein Antlitz leuchten! Sela. 
[67:3] So erkennt man auf Erden deinen Weg, / Dein Heil unter allen Völkern. 
[67:4] Völker sollen dich preisen, Elohim, / Es sollen dich preisen die Völker alle. 
[67:5] Die Leute freun sich und frohlocken, / Daß du die Völker recht regierst / Und die Leute auf Erden leitest. Sela. 
[67:6] Völker sollen dich preisen, Elohim, / Es sollen dich preisen die Völker alle. 
[67:7] Das Land hat seinen Ertrag geschenkt, / Elohim, unser Gott — er hat uns gesegnet. Elohim wird uns auch ferner segnen, / Und fürchten werden ihn alle Enden der Erde. 
[68:1] Dem Sangmeister. Von David. Ein Psalm. Ein Lied. 
[68:2] Elohim steht auf: seine Feinde zerstieben, / Und seine Hasser fliehen vor ihm. 
[68:3] Wie Rauch verweht, verwehest du sie. / Wie Wachs vor Feuer zerschmilzt, / So müssen die Frevler vor Gott vergehn. 
[68:4] Doch die Gerechten sollen sich freun, sie sollen frohlocken vor Elohim / Und sich ergötzen in Wonne. 
[68:5] Singt Elohim, spielt seinem Namen, / Preist ihn, der auf Wolken einherfährt! / Jah ist sein Name: jauchzet vor ihm! 
[68:6] Ein Vater der Waisen und Anwalt der Witwen / Ist Elohim in seiner heiligen Wohnstatt. 
[68:7] Verlassen gibt Elohim ein Heim, / Er führt Gefangene aus zum Glück. / Doch die Abtrünnigen bleiben im dürren Land. 
[68:8] Elohim, als du vor deinem Volk herzogst, / Als du durch die Wüste schrittst, — Sela. — 
[68:9] Da bebte die Erde, / Auch die Himmel troffen vor Elohim; / Der Sinai da — (er bebte) vor Elohim, / Israels Gott. 
[68:10] Mit reichlichem Segen besprengst du, Elohim, dein Erbe; / Und war es ermattet, hast du es erquickt. 
[68:11] Deine Schar fand Wohnung darin. / Gütig hast du den Armen versorgt, Elohim. 
[68:12] Adonái ließ mächtigen Ruf erschallen. / Siegkünderinnen gab es in großer Zahl. 
[68:13] Mit ihren Scharen flohen die Könige, flohen, / Und die Hausfrau verteilte die Beute. 
[68:14] Wenn ihr zwischen den Hürden lagt, / Waren der Taube Flügel mit Silber bezogen / Und ihre Schwingen mit gelblichem Gold. 
[68:15] Als der Allmächtige Könige dort zerstreute, / Fiel Schnee auf Zalmon. 
[68:16] Ein Berg Elohims ist Basans Gebirge, / Reich an Gipfeln ist Basans Gebirge. 
[68:17] Was blickt ihr so scheel, ihr Berge, ihr Gipfel, / Auf jenen Berg, den sich Elohim zum Wohnsitz erkoren? / Ja, Jahwe wird ewig dort thronen. 
[68:18] Der Wagen Elohims sind Zehntausende, tausend und abertausend, / Adonái weilt unter ihnen, / Der Sinai ist im Heiligtum. 
[68:19] Du bist zur Höhe emporgestiegen, du hast Gefangne weggeführt, / Hast Gaben an Menschen empfangen, / Auch Widerspenstige sollen wohnen bei Jah Elohim. 
[68:20] Gepriesen sei Adonái! / Er trägt uns Tag für Tag; / Er, Gott, ist unsre Hilfe. Sela. 
[68:21] Er, Gott, ist uns ein Gott, der rettet: / Jahwe Adonái hat Ausgangswege auch für den Tod. 
[68:22] Ja, Elohim zerschellt seiner Feinde Haupt. / Den Haarscheitel des, der stolz einhergeht in seiner Sündenschuld. 
[68:23] Gesprochen hat Adonái: "Aus Basan bring ich (dich) heim, / Bring (dich) heim aus Meerestiefen, 
[68:24] Damit dein Fuß sich bade in Blut, / Deiner Hunde Zunge ihr Teil an den Feinden habe." 
[68:25] Man wird deinen Prachtzug sehn, Elohim, / Meines Gottes, meines Königs Zug ins Heiligtum hinein: 
[68:26] Sänger schreiten voran, dann folgen Saitenspieler / Inmitten Pauken schlagender Jungfraun: 
[68:27] "In Chören preist Elohim, / Preist Adonái, ihr aus Israels Born!" 
[68:28] Da ist Benjamin der Kleine mit ihrem Herrscher: / Den Fürsten Judas in ihrem Purpur. / Da sind Sebulons Fürsten, Naftalis Fürsten. 
[68:29] Verordnet hat dein Gott, daß du so mächtig seist. / Stärke drum, Elohim, was du uns bereitet! 
[68:30] Von deinem Tempel aus (walte du) über Jerusalem: / Dir sollen Könige Gaben bringen. 
[68:31] Bedrohe das Tier des Schilfs, der Stiere Schar mit den Völkerkälbern, / Damit sie sich niederwerfen mit Silberstücken! / Zerstreue die Völker, die Kriege lieben! 
[68:32] Aus Ägypten werden Gesandte kommen, / Kusch eilt her und bringt Elohim seine Gaben. 
[68:33] Ihr Reiche der Erde, singt Elohim, / Preist Adonái mit Saitenspiel! Sela. 
[68:34] Preist ihn, der da fährt durch die Himmel, die Himmel der Urzeit! / Er läßt seine Stimme erschallen, seine mächtige Stimme. 
[68:35] Gebt Elohim die Ehre! / Über Israel thront seine Hoheit, / In den Wolken ist seine Macht! Hehr bist du, Elohim, von deinen Heiligtümern aus. / Israels Gott — er gibt seinem Volke Macht und Kraft. / Gepriesen sei Elohim! 
[69:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise von:) "Lilien". Von David. 
[69:2] Hilf mir, Elohim, / Denn die Wasser bedrohen mein Leben! 
[69:3] Versunken bin ich in tiefen Morast und kann nicht stehn; / Ich bin geraten in Wasserstrudel, es hat mich die Flut überströmt. 
[69:4] Ich bin müde vom Schrein, meine Kehle ist heiser; / Erloschen sind meine Augen, während ich harre auf meinen Gott. 
[69:5] Zahlreicher als meines Hauptes Haare sind, die mich grundlos hassen. / Mächtig sind, die mich zu vernichten suchen, / Die mich mit Unrecht befeinden. / Was ich nicht geraubt, das soll ich erstatten! 
[69:6] Elohim, du kennst meine Torheit, / Und mein Verschulden ist dir nicht verborgen. 
[69:7] Laß nicht in mir zuschanden werden, die auf dich harren, / Adonái Jahwe der Heerscharen (Herr)! / Laß nicht um meinetwillen in Schimpf geraten, / Die dich, Gott Israels, suchen! 
[69:8] Denn meinetwegen habe ich Schmach ertragen, / Hat Schande mein Antlitz bedeckt. 
[69:9] Fremd bin ich meinen Brüdern geworden / Und unbekannt meiner Mutter Söhnen. 
[69:10] Denn der Eifer um dein Haus hat mich verzehrt, / Und die Lästerungen derer, die dich schmähen, sind auf mich gefallen. 
[69:11] Wenn ich weinte bei meinem Fasten, / So ward ich deshalb verhöhnt. 
[69:12] Und zog ich an ein härenes Kleid, / So trieben sie ihren Spott mit mir. 
[69:13] Die im Tore sitzen, schwatzen von mir, / Die Lieder der Zecher verhöhnen mich. 
[69:14] Ich aber, Jahwe, bete zu dir; nimm du es gnädig auf! / Antworte mir, Elohim, nach deiner großen Güte, / Nach deiner Treue, die Hilfe schenkt! 
[69:15] Entreiß mich dem Schlamm, daß ich nicht versinke! / Von meinen Feinden errette mich, / Zieh mich aus den Wassertiefen! 
[69:16] Laß mich die Fluten nicht überströmen, / Laß den Strudel mich nicht verschlingen, / Nicht schließe der Brunnen sich über mir! 
[69:17] Erhöre mich, Jahwe; denn deine Huld ist köstlich; / Nach deinem großen Erbarmen kehr dich zu mir! 
[69:18] Verbirg dein Antlitz nicht vor deinem Knechte! / Denn mir ist angst; antworte mir eilends! 
[69:19] O nahe du meiner Seele, erlöse sie, / Um meiner Feinde willen mache mich frei! 
[69:20] Du weißt ja, daß Schmach und Schande und Schimpf mein Teil gewesen; / All meine Dränger sind dir bekannt. 
[69:21] Die Schmach hat mein Herz gebrochen: ich sieche dahin. / Ich dachte, Mitleid zu finden, doch nein! / Ich hoffte auf Tröster und fand sie nicht. 
[69:22] Vielmehr ward mir Gift in die Speise gemischt, / Mit Essig tränkte man mich in meinem Durst. 
[69:23] Ihr Tisch soll ihnen zur Schlinge werden, / Zum Fallstrick, während sie sorglos sind. 
[69:24] Ihre Augen sollen finster werden und nicht mehr sehn. / Ihre Hüften laß immerdar wanken! 
[69:25] Gieß deinen Grimm auf sie aus, / Und deine Zornglut treffe sie! 
[69:26] Ihr Lager soll wüste werden, / In ihren Zelten sei kein Bewohner! 
[69:27] Denn den du geschlagen, verfolgen sie / Und erzählen von deiner Durchbohrten Schmerz. 
[69:28] Mehre du ihre Sündenschuld / Und laß sie dein Heil nicht erlangen! 
[69:29] Tilge sie aus dem Lebensbuch / Und mit den Frommen schreib sie nicht auf! 
[69:30] Doch ich bin gebeugt und schmerzbeladen, / Deine Hilfe, Elohim, sie wird mich schützen. 
[69:31] Dann will ich den Namen Gottes im Liede rühmen / Und ihn mit Danken erheben. 
[69:32] Das wird Jahwe besser gefallen als Rinder, / Als Stiere mit Hörnern und Klauen. 
[69:33] Sehen das Dulder, so freuen sie sich. / Die ihr Gott sucht, euer Herz lebe auf! 
[69:34] Denn Jahwe merkt auf die Armen, / Seine Gefangnen verachtet er nicht. 
[69:35] Es sollen ihn loben Himmel und Erde, / Die Meere und alles, was drinnen sich regt. 
[69:36] Denn Elohim wird Zion helfen / Und bauen die Städte Judas, / Daß man dort wohne und sie besitze. Seiner Knechte Nachkommen werden sie erben; / Und die seinen Namen lieben, / Sollen darin ihre Wohnung haben. 
[70:1] Dem Sangmeister, von David. Zum Bekennen (?). 
[70:2] Eile, Elohim, mich zu retten, / Eile mir, Jahwe, zu Hilfe! 
[70:3] Beschämt und enttäuscht laß alle werden, / Die mir nach dem Leben trachten. / Mit Schimpf laß alle entweichen, / Die da mein Unglück wollen. 
[70:4] Zurückwenden sollen sich ob ihrer Schande, / Die (schadenfroh) über mich rufen: "Ha, ha!" 
[70:5] Frohlocken laß aber und dein sich freun / Alle, die nach dir fragen. / Laß immerdar rufen: "Groß ist Elohim!" / Alle, die dein Heil lieben! Bin ich auch elend und arm — / Elohim, eile zu mir! / Mein Helfer und Retter bist du. / Jahwe, verzieh deine Hilfe nicht! 
[71:1] Bei dir, o Jahwe, hab ich Zuflucht gesucht, / Laß mich nimmer zuschanden werden! 
[71:2] In deiner Treue rette mich und mache mich frei, / Neige dein Ohr zu mir und schaffe mir Heil! 
[71:3] Sei mir ein schützender Fels, zu dem ich beständig fliehen kann! / Du hast ja beschlossen, mir Heil zu erweisen; / Denn mein Fels, meine Burg bist du. 
[71:4] Mein Gott, errette mich aus des Frevlers Hand, / Aus der Faust des Schurken und Drängers! 
[71:5] Du bist ja meine Hoffnung, Adonái Jahwe, / Auf den ich vertraue von Kindheit an. 
[71:6] Du bist meine Stütze seit meiner Geburt, / Aus dem Mutterschoß hast du mich gelöst. / Dir gilt mein Loblied beständig. 
[71:7] Ein Wunder bin ich für viele, / Meine starke Zuflucht aber bist du. 
[71:8] Mein Mund soll sich füllen mit deinem Lob, / Dich soll er immerdar rühmen. 
[71:9] Verwirf mich nicht, wenn das Alter kommt; / Schwindet die Kraft mir, verlaß mich nicht! 
[71:10] Schon reden ja meine Feinde von mir, / Und die mein Leben belauern beraten zusammen. 
[71:11] Sie sprechen: "Gott hat ihn verlassen, / Verfolgt und greift ihn! Es rettet ihn keiner." 
[71:12] Elohim, sei du nicht ferne von mir; / Mein Gott, eile mir zu Hilfe! 
[71:13] Zuschanden werden, hinschwinden laß meine Widersacher! / In Schimpf und Schande laß alle sich hüllen, / Die da mein Unglück suchen! 
[71:14] Ich aber will (dein) beständig harren / Und all dein Lob vermehren. 
[71:15] Mein Mund soll deine Gerechtigkeit künden, / Allzeit dein Heil; denn ich kann sie nicht zählen. 
[71:16] Kundmachen will ich die mächtigen Taten Adonái Jahwes, / Will preisen deine Gerechtigkeit allein. 
[71:17] Elohim, du hast mich gelehrt von Jugend auf, / Und deine Wunder verkünd ich bis jetzt. 
[71:18] So verlaß mich auch nicht, Elohim, wenn das Alter kommt mit dem Silberhaar, / Bis ich deinen Namen der Nachwelt verkünde / Und allen Kommenden die Kraft! 
[71:19] Deine Gerechtigkeit, Elohim, reicht bis zur Wolkenhöhe, / Der du so Großes getan. / Elohim, wer ist dir gleich? 
[71:20] Du hast uns erleben lassen viel Not und Leid, / Aber du wirst uns auch wieder erfreuen mit Lebensglück / Und aus der Erde Tiefen uns wieder erheben. 
[71:21] Du wirst meine Hoheit mehren / Und mich wiederum trösten. 
[71:22] Auch ich will dich preisen mit Harfenklang / Für deine Treue, mein Gott; / Auf der Zither will ich dir spielen, / Du Heiliger Israels. 
[71:23] Meine Lippen jauchzen, wenn ich dir spiele, / Und meine Seele, die du erlöst. 
[71:24] Auch meine Zunge soll allzeit künden deine Gerechtigkeit; / Denn beschämt, enttäuscht sind sie, die mein Unglück suchen. 
[72:1] Von Salomo. / Elohim, gib dem Könige Macht zu richten / Und laß den Königssohn sie üben in deiner Gerechtigkeit! 
[72:2] Mög er dein Volk gerecht regieren / Und deine Armen, wie sich's gebührt! 
[72:3] Laß Frieden tragen die Berge dem Volk, / Und Gerechtigkeit kleide deine Hügel! 
[72:4] Er schaffe Recht den Armen im Volk, / Er helfe den dürftigen Leuten / Und zermalme alle Bedrücker! 
[72:5] Er bleibe, solange die Sonne scheint, / Solange der Mond zu sehn, von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht. 
[72:6] Er sei wie Regen, der Wiesen benetzt, / Wie reiche Güsse, die Felder befeuchten. 
[72:7] In seinen Tagen soll blühen das Recht / Und Friede in Fülle, bis nimmer der Mond. 
[72:8] Er herrsche von Meer zu Meer, / Vom Strom bis ans Ende der Erde. 
[72:9] Die Wüstenbewohner knien vor ihm, / Seine Feinde werden den Boden küssen. 
[72:10] Von Tarsis und von den Inseln entrichten die Könige Gaben, / Von Scheba und Seba bringen die Könige Zins herbei. 
[72:11] Huldigen sollen ihm alle Könige, / Alle Völker ihm dienen. 
[72:12] Denn er rettet den Armen, der Hilfe erfleht, / Den Dürftigen, der keinen Beistand hat. 
[72:13] Er erbarmt sich des Schwachen und Armen, / Und der Elenden Leben errettet er. 
[72:14] Von Druck und Gewalttat macht er sie frei, / Ihr Blut ist teuer in seinen Augen. 
[72:15] So leben sie denn; ja, er wird sie mit Gold aus Scheba beschenken. / Drum werden sie stetig auch für ihn beten / Und allzeit ihm Segen wünschen. 
[72:16] Getreide in Fülle sei im Land, sogar auf den Gipfeln der Berge; / Wie der Libanon woge und rausche die Frucht. / Wie der Erde Kräuter so zahlreich / Mögen die Städtebewohner erblühn. 
[72:17] Sein Name bleibe auf ewig! / Solange die Sonne scheint, möge sein Name bestehn! / Es mögen sich alle segnen mit ihm, / Alle Völker ihn glücklich preisen! 
[72:18] Gepriesen sei Jahwe Elohim, Israels Gott, / Der Wunder vollbringt allein! 
[72:19] Und gepriesen sei ewig sein herrlicher Name! / Sein Ruhm erfülle die ganze Erde! / Amen. Amen. 
[72:20] 
[73:1] Ein Psalm Asafs. / Ja, gütig ist Gott gegen Israel, / Gegen die, die reines Herzens sind. 
[73:2] Doch meine Füße wären beinah gestrauchelt, / Meine Tritte fast ausgeglitten. 
[73:3] Denn ich ward neidisch auf die Prahler, / Als ich das Glück der Frevler sah. 
[73:4] Sie kennen ja keine Schmerzen, / Und von Gesundheit strotzt ihr Leib. 
[73:5] Nicht sind sie in Unglück wie Sterbliche sonst, / Sie leiden nicht Plage wie andre Leute. 
[73:6] Drum ist auch Hoffart ihr Halsschmuck, / Unrecht umhüllt sie als ihr Gewand. 
[73:7] Ihr Auge tritt mühsam hervor aus dem Fett, / Ihr Herz ist voll stolzer Gedanken. 
[73:8] Sie höhnen und sprechen boshaft von Gewalt, / Sie reden von oben herab. 
[73:9] In den Himmel setzen sie ihren Mund, / Ihre Zunge ergeht sich auf Erden. 
[73:10] Drum fallen ihnen die Leute zu, / Die schlürfen Wasser in Fülle ein. 
[73:11] Sie sprechen: "Wie sollte Gott etwas wissen? / Wohnt denn bei dem Höchsten Kenntnis? 
[73:12] Diese Leute leben zwar ohne Gott, / Doch haben sie, ewig ungestört, / Reichtum und Macht erlangt. 
[73:13] Umsonst ist's, daß ich mein Herz hab reingehalten / Und meine Hände in Unschuld gewaschen. 
[73:14] Ich war doch geplagt den ganzen Tag / Und ward alle Morgen aufs neue gestraft." 
[73:15] Hätt ich gedacht: So will ich auch reden, / Ich hätte verleugnet deiner Kinder Geschlecht. 
[73:16] So sann ich denn nach, dies Rätsel zu lösen; / Doch allzu schwierig war es für mich; 
[73:17] Bis ich in Gottes Heiligtum ging / Und auf ihr (trauriges) Ende merkte. 
[73:18] Ja, auf schlüpfrigen Boden stellst du sie, / Du stürzest sie ins Verderben. 
[73:19] Wie sind sie im Nu zunichte geworden, / Geschwunden, vergangen durch Schreckensgerichte! 
[73:20] Wie ein Traum verfliegt, sobald man erwacht: / So wirst du, Adonái, ihr Bild verschmähn, / Wenn du dich aufmachst (zu richten). 
[73:21] Würde (nun wieder) mein Herz erbittert, / Und fühlt ich es stechen in meinen Nieren: 
[73:22] Dann wär ich ein Narr und wüßte nichts, / Ich wäre sogar wie ein Tier vor dir. 
[73:23] Aber ich bleibe nun stets bei dir, / Du hast ja erfaßt meine rechte Hand. 
[73:24] Nach deinem Ratschluß wirst du mich leiten / Und nimmst mich endlich mit Ehren auf. 
[73:25] Wen hätt ich im Himmel (ohne dich)? / Und bist du mein, so begehr ich nichts weiter auf Erden. 
[73:26] Ist auch mein Leib geschwunden, und schlägt mein Herz nicht mehr: / Meines Herzens Hort und mein Besitz / Bleibt doch Elohim auf ewig! 
[73:27] Denn die von dir weichen, die kommen um; / Du vertilgst, die dich treulos verlassen. 
[73:28] Mir aber ist köstlich die Nähe Elohims. / Auf Adonái Jahwe ruht mein Vertraun: / So will ich verkündigen all dein Tun. 
[74:1] Eine Betrachtung (?) Asafs. / Warum, Elohim, hast du uns für immer verworfen? / Warum raucht denn dein Zorn / Gegen die Schafe, die du weidest? 
[74:2] Gedenke doch deiner Gemeinde, die du vor alters erworben, / Die du dir erlöst zum Besitzesstamm! / Des Zionsberges gedenke, auf dem du wohnst! 
[74:3] Tritt heran zu den ewigen Trümmern! / Der Feind hat alles zerstört im Heiligtum. 
[74:4] Deine Gegner haben gebrüllt an deiner Versammlungsstätte; / Sie stellten ihre Zeichen als Zeichen auf. 
[74:5] Es war, als schwängen Holzhauer die Äxte / Hoch in dem Dickicht des Waldes. 
[74:6] Und dann: auf sein Schnitzwerk insgesamt / Hieben sie ein mit Beil und Barten. 
[74:7] Sie steckten dein Heiligtum in Brand; / Deines Namens Wohnung entweihten sie / Und machten dem Boden sie gleich. 
[74:8] Sie dachten: "Wir wollen sie alle bezwingen." / Sie verbrannten alle Gottesstätten im Lande. 
[74:9] Unsre Zeichen sehn wir nimmer; es ist kein Prophet mehr da, / Und niemand ist bei uns, der wüßte, / Wie lange dies Elend noch währen wird. 
[74:10] Bis wann, Elohim, soll der Dränger noch höhnen? / Soll der Feind deinen Namen auf immer schmähn? 
[74:11] Warum ziehst du zurück deine Hand, deine Rechte? / Zieh sie aus dem Busen — vertilge! 
[74:12] Gott ist doch mein König von alters her, / Der Rettungstaten auf Erden vollbracht. 
[74:13] Du hast das Meer gespalten durch deine Macht, / Hast der Drachen Köpfe im Wasser zerschellt. 
[74:14] Leviatans Häupter hast du zerschmettert, / Du gabst sie zum Fraße den Wüstentieren. 
[74:15] Du ließest sprudeln Quelle und Bach, / Du ließest versiegen beständige Ströme. 
[74:16] Dein ist der Tag, dein auch die Nacht. / Leuchte und Sonne hast du bereitet. 
[74:17] Du hast alle Grenzen der Erde gesetzt, / Sommer und Winter hast du gebildet. 
[74:18] Gedenke: der Feind hat Jahwe geschmäht, / Ein gottloses Volk deinen Namen gehöhnt. 
[74:19] Gib nicht dem Tiere preis deiner Turteltaube Seele, / Deiner Armen Leben vergiß nicht für immer! 
[74:20] Schau auf den Bund! / Denn des Landes Verstecke sind angefüllt, / Und dort wird Gewalttat getrieben. 
[74:21] Nicht unerhört laß Niedergeschlagene gehn, / Laß deinen Namen Arme und Dürftige preisen! 
[74:22] Auf, Elohim! Ficht aus deinen Streit! / Gedenke des: die Gottlosen höhnen dich fort und fort! 
[74:23] Vergiß der Feinde Schmährufe nicht, / Deiner Gegner Toben, das stetig steigt! 
[75:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise von:) "Verderbe nicht!" / Ein Psalm Asafs; ein Lied. 
[75:2] Wir danken dir, Elohim, wir danken; / Denn deine Hilfe ist nahe, und deine Wunder erzählt man. 
[75:3] Denn "Ich nehme die rechte Stunde wahr / Dann will ich in Gerechtigkeit richten. 
[75:4] Mag auch die Erde vor Furcht erbeben mit allen, die darauf wohnen: / Ich halte doch selbst ihre Säulen fest. Sela. 
[75:5] Den Törichten sag ich: 'Seid nicht töricht!' / Den Frevlern: 'Hebt euer Horn nicht hoch!' 
[75:6] Hebt nicht euer Horn zur Himmelshöhe, / Redet nicht stolz mit gerecktem Haupt!" 
[75:7] Denn nicht von Osten, nicht von Westen, / Nicht von der Wüste her kommt Hilfe — 
[75:8] Nein, nur Elohim schafft Recht: / Diesen erniedrigt, jenen erhöht er. 
[75:9] Ein Becher ist ja in Jahwes Hand: / Er schäumt von Wein, ist reichlich gemischt. / Draus schenkt er ein; ja selbst seine Hefen / Müssen schlürfen und trinken alle Frevler auf Erden. 
[75:10] Ich aber will ewiglich jauchzen, / Dem Gott Jakobs will ich lobsingen. "Alle Hörner der Frevler will ich zerbrechen — / Hoch raget das Horn der Gerechten." 
[76:1] Dem Sangmeister, mit Saitenspielbegleitung. / Ein Psalm Asafs; ein Lied. 
[76:2] Wohlbekannt in Juda ist Elohim, / In Israel ist sein Name groß. 
[76:3] Ist doch in Salem sein Zelt / Und seine Wohnung in Zion. 
[76:4] Dort zerbrach er des Bogens Blitze, / Schild und Schwert und alle Waffen. Sela. 
[76:5] Von Licht umflossen bist du, herrlich kommst du / Von den Bergen der Beute her: 
[76:6] Entwaffnet wurden die Tapfern, sie sanken in Todesschlaf, / Und allen Helden versagte der Arm. 
[76:7] Vor deinem Drohen, Gott Jakobs, / Wurden Roß und Reiter betäubt. 
[76:8] Du bist furchtbar, ja du! / Wer besteht vor dir, wenn dein Zorn sich erhebt? 
[76:9] Vom Himmel herab hast du Gericht verkündet: / Die Erde erschrak und wurde still, 
[76:10] Als sich Elohim zum Gericht erhob, / Um allen Duldern des Landes zu helfen. Sela. 
[76:11] Die mit Wut Verfolgten werden dich preisen; / Die von der Wut Verschonten werden dir Feste feiern. 
[76:12] Tut Jahwe, eurem Gott, Gelübde und tragt sie ab! / Ihr alle ringsum, bringt dem Erhabnen Geschenke dar! Er bricht der Gewaltigen Trotz, / Flößt der Erde Königen Schrecken ein. 
[77:1] Dem Sangmeister Jedutun zum Vortrag übergeben. Ein Psalm Asafs. 
[77:2] Laut will ich schrein zu Elohim; / Laut ruf ich zu Elohim, daß er mich höre. 
[77:3] Zur Zeit meiner Not sucht ich Adonái. / Meine Hand hat sich zu ihm ausgestreckt / Und ist nicht erschlafft; / Meine Seele will sich nicht trösten lassen. 
[77:4] Gedenk ich Elohims, so muß ich seufzen; / Sinne ich nach, so verzagt mein Geist. Sela. 
[77:5] Du hast meine Augen wach gehalten; / Ich war zerschlagen und konnte nicht reden. 
[77:6] Da gedachte ich denn der alten Zeit, / Der längst entschwundenen Jahre. 
[77:7] Dacht ich des Nachts an mein Saitenspiel, / So klagte ich tief, / Und grübelnd fragte mein Geist: 
[77:8] "Wird denn Adonái auf ewig verstoßen / Und nimmer wieder gnädig sein? 
[77:9] Ist denn seine Huld auf immer dahin, / Ist's mit der Verheißung für allzeit aus? 
[77:10] Hat Gott vergessen, gnädig zu sein, / Oder sein Erbarmen in Zorn verschlossen?" Sela. 
[77:11] Da dacht ich denn: "Mein Leiden ist dies, / Daß die Rechte des Höchsten sich hat geändert." 
[77:12] Ich gedenke der Taten Jahs, / Ja, ich gedenke, wie du / So wunderbar seit der Vorzeit gewaltet. 
[77:13] Ich will sinnen über all dein Tun / Und dein herrliches Wirken erwägen. 
[77:14] Elohim, dein Weg ist erhaben! / Wo ist ein Gott, groß wie Elohim? 
[77:15] Du bist der Gott, der Wunder tut, / Unter den Völkern hast du deine Macht offenbart. 
[77:16] Du hast mit Kraft dein Volk erlöst, / Die Söhne Jakobs und Josefs. Sela. 
[77:17] Die Wasser sahen dich, Elohim, / Die Wasser sahen dich und bebten, / Auch die Tiefen erzitterten. 
[77:18] Die Wolken ergossen Wasser, / Der Donner krachte aus dem Gewölk, / Und deine Pfeile flogen umher. 
[77:19] Dein Donner dröhnte im Wirbelwind; / Blitze erhellten das Erdenrund, / Es wankte und bebte die Erde. 
[77:20] Im Meer ging dein Weg dahin / Und dein Pfad durch mächtige Wasser. / Doch deine Spuren sah man nicht. Wie Schafe hast du dein Volk geleitet / Durch Moses und Aarons Hand. 
[78:1] Eine Betrachtung(?) Asafs. / Vernimm, mein Volk, meine Lehre, / Neigt euer Ohr meines Mundes Reden! 
[78:2] Meinen Mund will ich öffnen zu Sprüchen, / Will aus der Vorzeit Rätsel verkünden. 
[78:3] Was wir gehört und erfahren, / Was uns unsre Väter erzählt: 
[78:4] Wollen wir unsern Kindern nicht verhehlen, / Indem wir der Nachwelt erzählen / Jahwes Ruhmestaten und Macht / Und seine Wunder, die er getan. 
[78:5] Er stellte ein Zeugnis in Jakob auf / Und gab ein Gesetz in Israel. / Unsern Vätern befahl er's an, / Daß sie ihre Kinder es lehrten. 
[78:6] Denn die Nachkommen sollen es kennenlernen: / Kinder, die noch sollen geboren werden, / Die sollen auch selbst auftreten / Und ihren Kindern davon erzählen, 
[78:7] Damit sie auf Gott ihr Vertrauen setzen, / Nicht vergessen der Taten Gottes / Und seine Gebote halten. 
[78:8] Denn sie sollen nicht werden wie ihre Väter, / Ein störrig, widerspenstig Geschlecht, / Ein Geschlecht mit schwankendem Sinn, / Das nicht treu hielt an seinem Gott. 
[78:9] Efraims Söhne, gerüstete Bogenschützen, / Kehrten um am Tage der Schlacht. 
[78:10] Sie hielten nicht den Bund Elohims / Und wollten nicht wandeln nach seinem Gesetz. 
[78:11] Sie vergaßen seiner großen Taten, / Seiner Wunder, die sie geschaut. 
[78:12] Vor ihren Vätern hatte er Wunder getan / In Ägyptenland, in Zoans Gefild. 
[78:13] Er teilte das Meer und führte sie durch / Und türmte die Wasser wie einen Damm. 
[78:14] Er leitete sie durch die Wolke bei Tag / Und die ganze Nacht mit feurigem Licht. 
[78:15] Er spaltete Felsen in der Wüste / Und tränkte sie reich mit Meeresflut. 
[78:16] Er brachte Bäche hervor aus dem Fels, / Ließ Wasser wie Ströme fließen. 
[78:17] Doch sündigten sie weiter gegen ihn, / Widerstrebten dem Höchsten im dürren Lande. 
[78:18] In ihrem Herzen versuchten sie Gott / Und forderten Speise für ihr Gelüst. 
[78:19] Sie redeten so wider Elohim: / Kann Gott einen Tisch in der Wüste decken? 
[78:20] Er hat wohl den Fels geschlagen, daß Wasser floß / Und Bäche ergiebig strömten: / Doch vermag er auch Brot zu geben / Oder Fleisch zu verschaffen seinem Volk?" 
[78:21] Als Jahwe das hörte, ergrimmte er, / Und Feuer entbrannte in Jakob, / Auch Zorn stieg auf wider Israel. 
[78:22] Denn sie glaubten nicht an Elohim, / Auf seine Hilfe vertrauten sie nicht. 
[78:23] Dennoch gebot er den Wolken droben, / Und des Himmels Türen öffnete er: 
[78:24] Er ließ Man auf sie regnen zur Speise / Und gab ihnen Himmelsbrot. 
[78:25] Engelspeise aßen sie alle, / Zehrung sandte er ihnen in Fülle. 
[78:26] Er ließ den Ostwind am Himmel wehn, / Führte durch seine Macht den Südwind herbei. 
[78:27] Er ließ Fleisch auf sie regnen wie Staub / Und beschwingte Vögel wie Sand am Meer. 
[78:28] In ihr Lager ließ er sie fallen, / Rings um ihre Gezelte her. 
[78:29] Da aßen sie, wurden übersatt / Und ihr Gelüst befriedigte er. 
[78:30] Aber noch war ihre Lust nicht gestillt, / Noch war die Speise in ihrem Mund: 
[78:31] Da stieg Elohims Zorn wider sie auf — / Er streckte ihre Starken zu Boden, / Schlug nieder die Jünglinge Israels. 
[78:32] Trotz alledem sündigten sie aber fort / Und glaubten an seine Wunder nicht. 
[78:33] Drum ließ er ihre Tage schwinden in Nichts / Und ihre Jahre in jäher Hast. 
[78:34] Wenn er sie tötete, suchten sie ihn, / Kehrten um und fragten nach Gott, 
[78:35] Gedachten, wie Elohim ihr Fels / Und Gott der Höchste ihr Retter sei. 
[78:36] Doch heuchelten sie ihm mit ihrem Mund, / Mit ihrer Zunge logen sie ihm. 
[78:37] Ihr Herz war ihm nicht treu, / Sie hielten nicht fest an seinem Bund. 
[78:38] Doch er war barmherzig, vergab die Schuld / Und vertilgte sie nicht. / Oft hielt er seinen Zorn zurück, / Ließ nicht seinen ganzen Grimm ergehn, 
[78:39] Sondern dachte daran: sie sind nur Fleisch, / Ein Hauch, der vergeht und nicht wiederkehrt. 
[78:40] Wie oft widerstrebten sie ihm in der Wüste, / Betrübten sie ihn in der Öde! 
[78:41] Immer wieder versuchten sie Gott, / Den Heiligen Israels kränkten sie. 
[78:42] Sie gedachten nicht seiner Hand, / Auch nicht des Tages, da er sie erlöste von ihrem Dränger: 
[78:43] Als er in Ägypten Zeichen tat, / Seine Wunder in Zoans Gefild. 
[78:44] Er wandelte ihre Ströme in Blut, / Daß sie ihr Wasser nicht trinken konnten. 
[78:45] Er sandte ihnen Bremsen, die sie fraßen, / Und Frösche, die sie verderbten. 
[78:46] Er gab ihr Gewächs den Nagern preis, / Den Heuschrecken ihrer Felder Ertrag. 
[78:47] Ihre Weinstöcke schlug er mit Hagel, / Ihre Maulbeerbäume mit Schlossen. 
[78:48] Dem Hagel lieferte er aus ihr Vieh / Und ihre Herden den Blitzen. 
[78:49] Er sandte gegen sie seines Zornes Glut / Mit Ingrimm, Wüten und Angst: / Eine Schar verderbender Engel. 
[78:50] Er ließ seinem Zorne freien Lauf, / Bewahrte sie nicht vor dem Tode, / Sondern gab der Pest ihr Leben preis. 
[78:51] Er schlug alle Erstgeburt in Ägypten, / Die erste Manneskraft in Hams Gezelt. 
[78:52] Sein Volk aber ließ er wie Schafe ziehn / Und leitete sie in der Wüste wie eine Herde. 
[78:53] Er führte sie sicher, daß sie nicht zagten; / Ihre Feinde aber bedeckte das Meer. 
[78:54] Er brachte sie in sein heilig Gebiet, / Auf den Berg, den seine Rechte erworben. 
[78:55] Völker trieb er vor ihnen aus, / Gab ihnen ihr Land zum Erbbesitz, / Und in ihren Zelten ließ er Israels Stämme wohnen. 
[78:56] Doch sie versuchten und reizten Elohim den Höchsten, / Und seine Gebote hielten sie nicht. 
[78:57] Sondern wie ihre Väter wichen sie treulos ab, / Versagten wie ein trüglicher Bogen. 
[78:58] Sie erzürnten ihn durch ihre Höhn, / Durch ihre Bilder reizten sie ihn. 
[78:59] Das hörte Elohim und zürnte: / Er verwarf Israel ganz und gar. 
[78:60] Er verließ die Wohnung in Silo, / Das Zelt, das er unter Menschen errichtet. 
[78:61] Er ließ seine Macht gefangennehmen / Und gab seinen Ruhm in des Feindes Hand. 
[78:62] Er gab sein Volk dem Schwerte preis, / Und über sein Erbe zürnte er. 
[78:63] Ihre Jünglinge fraß das Feuer, / Ihren Jungfraun ward kein Hochzeitslied. 
[78:64] Ihre Priester fielen durchs Schwert, / Und ihre Witwen weinten nicht. 
[78:65] Da erwachte Adonái wie vom Schlaf, / Wie ein Held, dessen Mut der Wein gestärkt. 
[78:66] Er schlug seine Feinde zurück, / Tat ihnen ewige Schande an. 
[78:67] Josefs Zelt verwarf er zwar, / Und Efraims Stamm erwählte er nicht. 
[78:68] Sondern Judas Stamm erkor er, / Den Zionsberg, den er liebgewonnen. 
[78:69] Er baute hochragend sein Heiligtum, / Wie die Erde, die er auf ewig gegründet. 
[78:70] Er erwählte sich David, seinen Knecht, / Nahm ihn von den Hürden der Schafe. 
[78:71] Von den säugenden Schafen holte er ihn, / Daß er weide Jakob, sein Volk, / Und sein Erbteil Israel. 
[78:72] Er weidete sie auch mit lauterm Sinn / Und führte sie klug mit seiner Hand. 
[79:1] Ein Psalm Asafs. / Elohim, es sind Heiden in dein Erbe gedrungen, / Die haben deinen heiligen Tempel entweiht, / In Trümmer verwandelt Jerusalem. 
[79:2] Sie haben deiner Knechte Leichen / Des Himmels Vögeln zum Fraß gegeben. / Deiner Frommen Fleisch des Landes Getier. 
[79:3] Sie haben ihr Blut vergossen wie Wasser / Rings um Jerusalem her, und niemand begrub (die Toten). 
[79:4] Wir sind unsern Nachbarn zur Schmach geworden, / Ein Spott und Gelächter für unsre Umgebung. 
[79:5] Wie lange, Jahwe, wirst du noch zürnen, / Wird dein Eifer wie Feuer brennen? 
[79:6] Gieß deine Zornglut über die Heiden, die dich nicht erkannt, / Über die Reiche, die deinen Namen nicht angerufen. 
[79:7] Denn sie haben Jakob verzehrt / Und seinen Wohnsitz verwüstet. 
[79:8] Rechne uns nicht der Vorfahren Sünden zu! / Eilends komm uns dein Erbarmen entgegen! / Denn wir sind sehr gebeugt. 
[79:9] Hilf uns, Gott, du Quell unsers Heils. / Um deines Namens Ehre willen! / Rett uns, bedeck unsre Missetaten / Um deines Namens willen! 
[79:10] Warum sollen die Heiden sagen: / "Wo ist nun ihr Gott?" / Kund werde an den Heiden vor unsern Augen / Die Rache für deiner Knechte Blut, das sie vergossen! 
[79:11] Der Gefangenen Seufzen komme vor dich! / Mit deinem starken Arm / Erhalte die Kinder des Todes am Leben! 
[79:12] Und vergilt unsern Nachbarn siebenfach in ihren Busen / Ihr Schmähn, womit sie dich, Adonái, geschmäht! 
[79:13] Wir aber, dein Volk, deiner Weide Schafe, / Wir wollen dir ewig danken, / Von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht deinen Ruhm verkünden. 
[80:1] Dem Sangmeister, nach (der Weise von:) "(Wie) Lilien ist das Zeugnis." / Ein Psalm Asafs. 
[80:2] Israels Hirt, horch auf, / Der du Josef führtest wie Schafe! / Der du thronest auf den Keruben, / Erscheine im Lichtglanz! 
[80:3] Efraim, Benjamin und Manasse siegreich führend / Biete auf deine Macht / Und komm uns zu Hilfe! 
[80:4] Elohim, stell uns wieder her! / Laß leuchten dein Antlitz, so wird uns geholfen! 
[80:5] Jahwe Elohim Zebaôt, / Wie lange währet dein Zorn / Trotz des Gebetes deines Volks?! 
[80:6] Du hast es mit Tränenbrot gespeist / Und es mit Tränen reichlich getränkt. 
[80:7] Unsre Nachbarn streiten sich unsertwegen, / Und unsre Feinde verspotten uns. 
[80:8] Elohim Zebaôt, stell uns wieder her! / Laß leuchten dein Antlitz, so wird uns geholfen! 
[80:9] Einen Weinstock hast du aus Ägypten geholt, / Hast Völker vertrieben und ihn gepflanzt. 
[80:10] Du hast vor ihm Raum geschafft: / So schlug er Wurzeln und füllte das Land. 
[80:11] Es deckten sich Berge mit seinem Schatten, / Mit seinen Reben die Zedern Gottes. 
[80:12] Seine Ranken sandte er bis ans Meer / Und seine Zweige bis an den Strom. 
[80:13] Warum hast du denn seinen Zaun zerbrochen, / Daß ihn jeder zerpflückt, der vorübergeht? 
[80:14] Der Eber des Waldes frißt ihn ab, / Das Getier des Feldes macht ihn kahl. 
[80:15] Elohim Zebaôt, o schau doch wieder vom Himmel und sieh — / Sorge für diesen Weinstock: 
[80:16] Für den Sprößling, den deine Rechte gepflanzt, / Für den Sohn, den du dir erzogen! 
[80:17] Wie ist er mit Feuer verbrannt. / Vor deinem Zornblick laß sie vergehn! 
[80:18] Deine Hand sei über dem Mann deiner Rechten, / Dem Menschensohn, den du dir erzogen: 
[80:19] So werden wir nimmer von dir weichen. / Laß uns am Leben, so rufen wir an deinen Namen. Jahwe Elohim Zebaôt, stell uns wieder her! / Laß leuchten dein Antlitz, so wird uns geholfen! 
[81:1] Dem Sangmeister, auf der Gittit. Von Asaf. 
[81:2] (Der levitische Sängerchor:) / Laßt Jubel erschallen Elohim, unserm Hort, / Jauchzet dem Gotte Jakobs! 
[81:3] Stimmt an Gesang, laßt tönen die Pauke, / Die liebliche Zither und Harfe! 
[81:4] Blaset am Neumond das Widderhorn, / Beim Vollmond, für unsern Feiertag! 
[81:5] Denn so ist es Satzung für Israel, / Eine Vorschrift des Gottes Jakobs. 
[81:6] Als Gebot hat er's für Josef bestimmt, / Da er auszog wider Ägyptenland. / (Eine Einzelstimme:) / Eine Sprache, mir fremd, vernehm ich: 
[81:7] "Seinen Nacken hab ich von der Bürde befreit, / Seine Hände wurden des Lastkorbs ledig. 
[81:8] Du riefst in der Not, ich riß dich heraus, / Erhörte dich aus Gewittergewölk, / Prüfte dich an Meribas Wassern. Sela. 
[81:9] Höre, mein Volk, ich will dich warnen! / Israel, möchtest du mir gehorchen! 
[81:10] Nicht sei unter dir ein fremder Gott; / Bete nicht an einen Gott des Auslands! 
[81:11] Ich, Jahwe, bin dein Gott, / Der dich geführt aus Ägyptenland: / Tu deinen Mund weit auf, / Damit ich ihn fülle! 
[81:12] Aber mein Volk gehorchte mir nicht, / Israel war mir nicht zu Willen. 
[81:13] Da stieß ich sie weg, weil ihr Herz so verstockt, / Daß sie folgten den eignen Gedanken. 
[81:14] O daß doch mein Volk mir gehorchte, / Daß Israel ginge auf meinen Wegen! 
[81:15] Wie leicht könnt ich da ihre Feinde beugen, / Meine Hand gegen ihre Dränger kehren. 
[81:16] Ihnen müßten schmeicheln, die Jahwe hassen, / Und ewig würde währen ihr Glück. Mit dem besten Weizen würd ich sie speisen, / Mit Honig aus Felsen dich sättigen." 
[82:1] Ein Psalm Asafs. / Elohim tritt auf in der Gottesgemeinde, / Unter den "Göttern" hält er Gericht: 
[82:2] "Wie lange wollt ihr ungerecht richten / Und Partei für die Frevler nehmen? Sela. 
[82:3] Des Geringen, der Waise nehmt euch an, / Dem Gedrückten und Dürftigen schaffet Recht! 
[82:4] Befreit den Geringen und Armen, / Aus der Frevler Händen errettet ihn! 
[82:5] Doch sie erkennen's nicht, sehen's nicht ein, / Sie gehen verblendet dahin — / Drum wanken auch alle Grundfesten des Landes. 
[82:6] Ich hab zwar gesagt: 'Götter seid ihr / Und Söhne des Höchsten ihr alle.' 
[82:7] Doch wahrlich, wie Menschen werdet ihr sterben, / Fallen wie einer der Fürsten." 
[82:8] Auf, Elohim, richte die Erde! / Denn alle Völker sind dein Besitz. 
[83:1] Ein Lied. Ein Psalm Asafs. 
[83:2] Elohim, schaue nicht ruhig zu, / Schweige doch nicht und raste nicht, Gott! 
[83:3] Denn sieh, deine Feinde toben, / Und deine Hasser erheben das Haupt. 
[83:4] Wider dein Volk ersinnen sie listigen Anschlag, / Beraten sich gegen die, die du bewahrst. 
[83:5] "Auf", sagen sie, "laßt uns als Volk sie vernichten, / Daß Israels Name für immer verschwinde!" 
[83:6] Denn einmütig haben sie sich beraten, / Wider dich einen Bund geschlossen: 
[83:7] Edoms Zelte, die Ismaeliter, / Moab und die Hagriter, 
[83:8] Gebâl und Ammon und Amalek, / Die Philister samt denen zu Tyrus. 
[83:9] Auch Assur hat sich zu ihnen gesellt, / Es leiht seinen Arm den Söhnen Lots. Sela. 
[83:10] Tu ihnen so wie Midian, / Wie Sisera, wie Jabin am Bache Kison! 
[83:11] Sie wurden bei Endor vertilgt, / Wurden Dünger auf Ackerland. 
[83:12] Ihre Edlen mache wie Oreb und Seeb, / wie Sébach und Zalmúnna all ihre Fürsten, 
[83:13] Weil sie gesprochen: "Wir wollen für uns / Einnehmen die Auen Gottes." 
[83:14] Mein Gott, mache sie wie Laub, / Wie Stoppeln, die der Wind wegtreibt, 
[83:15] Wie Feuer, das einen Wald verbrennt, / Wie die Flamme, die Berge entzündet! 
[83:16] Verfolge sie so mit deinem Sturm, / Und mit deiner Windsbraut schrecke sie! 
[83:17] Mach ihr Antlitz voll Schmach, / Damit sie nach deinem Namen fragen, o Jahwe! 
[83:18] Sie sollen zuschanden werden, erschrecken für immer, / Erröten vor Scham und vergehen! Dann laß sie erkennen, daß du, des Name Jahwe heißt, / Allein der Höchste bist auf der ganzen Erde. 
[84:1] Dem Sangmeister, auf der Gittit. Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. 
[84:2] Wie lieblich ist deine Wohnung, / Jahwe, der Heerscharen Herr! 
[84:3] Meine Seele hat sich schon immer gesehnt, ja geschmachtet / Nach den Vorhöfen Jahwes. / Mein Herz und mein Leib / Jubeln entgegen dem lebendigen Gott. 
[84:4] Auch der Sperling findet ein Haus / Und die Schwalbe ein Nest, wo sie ihre Jungen birgt: / Deine Altäre, Jahwe, der Heerscharen Herr, / Mein König und mein Gott. 
[84:5] Heil den Bewohnern deines Hauses: / Sie loben dich immerdar! Sela. 
[84:6] Heil denen, die in dir ihre Stärke finden, / Während sie Pläne im Herzen bewegen! 
[84:7] Wandern sie durch ein dürres Tal: / Sie machen es zum Quell; / Auch hüllt es Frühregen in Segen. 
[84:8] Sie schreiten von Kraft zu Kraft: / So zeigt sich El Elohim, / Der da wohnet in Zion. 
[84:9] Jahwe Elohim Zebaôt, / Erhöre doch mein Gebet, / Merke darauf, Gott Jakobs! Sela. 
[84:10] Du, unser Schild, sieh drein, Elohim, / Schau gnädig an das Antlitz deines Gesalbten! 
[84:11] Denn ein Tag in deinen Vorhöfen ist besser als tausend andre. / Lieber will ich in meines Gottes Haus an der Schwelle stehn / Als in den Zelten des Frevlers wohnen. 
[84:12] Denn Zinne und Schild ist Jahwe Elohim. / Gunst und Ehre wird Jahwe geben; / Nicht läßt er Gutes mangeln / Denen, die schuldlos wandeln. Jahwe, der Heerscharen Herr, / Heil dem Menschen, der dir vertraut! 
[85:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. 
[85:2] Du hast zwar, Jahwe, dein Land begnadigt, / Jakobs Gefangne zurückgeführt; 
[85:3] Du hast deines Volkes Schuld vergeben, / All seine Sünde zugedeckt; Sela. 
[85:4] Hast all deinen Grimm zurückgezogen, / Von deiner Zornglut abgelassen: 
[85:5] So stell uns nun aber auch wieder her, du Gott unsers Heils, / Gib auf deinen Unmut gegen uns! 
[85:6] Willst du denn ewig über uns zürnen, / Deinen Grimm hinziehn von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht? 
[85:7] Willst du uns denn nicht wieder beleben, / Daß sich dein Volk erfreue an dir? 
[85:8] Laß, Jahwe, uns deine Gnade schaun, / Und deine Hilfe schenke uns! 
[85:9] Ich will lauschen auf das, was El Jahwe nun reden wird! — / Wahrlich, Frieden verheißt er seinem Volk und seinen Getreuen / Und warnt sie, nicht wieder in Torheit zu fallen. 
[85:10] Gewiß, nah ist den Frommen sein Heil, / Daß Herrlichkeit wohne in unserm Land, 
[85:11] Daß Huld und Treue einander begegnen, / Gerechtigkeit und Friede sich küssen. 
[85:12] Treue wird aus der Erde sprossen, / Und Gerechtigkeit schaut vom Himmel herab. 
[85:13] Jahwe wird auch das Gute spenden, / Und unser Land gibt seinen Ertrag. Gerechtigkeit wird vor ihm schreiten / Und ihn begleiten auf seinen Tritten. 
[86:1] Ein Gebet Davids. / Neige, Jahwe, dein Ohr, erhöre mich, / Denn ich bin elend und arm! 
[86:2] Behüte mein Leben, denn ich bin fromm. / Hilf du, mein Gott, deinem Knechte, / Der sich auf dich verläßt! 
[86:3] Sei du, Adonái, mir gnädig, / Denn zu dir ruf ich den ganzen Tag! 
[86:4] Deines Knechtes Seele erfreue, / Denn zu dir, Adonái, erheb ich mein Herz. 
[86:5] Denn du, Adonái, bist gütig, verzeihest gern, / Bist reich an Gnade für alle, die zu dir rufen. 
[86:6] Vernimm doch, Jahwe, mein Beten; / Horch auf mein lautes Flehn! 
[86:7] Bin ich in Not, so ruf ich dich an, / Weil du mich erhörst. 
[86:8] Dir, Adonái, gleicht keiner unter den Göttern, / Und deinen Werken kommt nichts gleich, 
[86:9] Alle Völker, die du gemacht, sie müssen kommen, / Vor dir, Adonái, sich bücken / Und deinen Namen ehren. 
[86:10] Denn du bist groß und wundertätig, / du, du allein bist Gott. 
[86:11] Lehre mich, Jahwe, deinen Weg! / Dir treu und ergeben: so möchte ich wandeln. / Richte mein Herz auf das Eine: / Deinen Namen zu fürchten. 
[86:12] Danken will ich dir, Adonái, mein Gott, von ganzem Herzen — / Und deinen Namen für immer ehren. 
[86:13] Denn deine Huld gegen mich war reich: / Aus größter Todesgefahr hast du mich errettet. 
[86:14] Elohim, es haben sich Frevler erhoben wider mich, / Und eine Rotte von Schreckensmännern trachtet mir nach dem Leben; / Sie haben dich nicht vor Augen. 
[86:15] Aber du, Adonái, bist ein barmherziger, gnädiger Gott, / Langmütig und reich an Huld und Treu. 
[86:16] Wende dich zu mir und sei mir gnädig, / Verleih deinen Schutz deinem Knecht / Und hilf doch dem Sohn deiner Magd! 
[86:17] Tu ein Zeichen an mir zum Guten, / Daß meine Hasser voll Scham es sehn, / Weil du mir geholfen, o Jahwe, und mich getröstet. 
[87:1] Ein Psalmlied der Söhne Korahs. / Er hat es gegründet auf heiligen Bergen. 
[87:2] Zions Tore liebt Jahwe mehr / Als alle Wohnungen Jakobs. 
[87:3] Herrliches ist über dich verheißen, / O du Stadt Elohims. Sela. 
[87:4] "Ich nenne Rahab und Babel als meine Bekenner. / Ja, von Philistäa und Tyrus samt Kusch sag ich: / ['Diese sind dort geborn.'" 
[87:5] Aber von Zion wird's heißen: / "Jeder ist da geboren, / Und er selbst, der Höchste, erhält es." 
[87:6] Jahwe wird verzeichnen die Völker: / "Diese sind dort geboren!" Sela. 
[87:7] Und singend und tanzend ruft man laut: / "All meine Quellen sind in dir!" 
[88:1] Ein Psalm der Söhne Korahs. Dem Sangmeister, nach schwermütiger Weise mit gedämpfter Stimme vorzutragen (?): eine Betrachtung (?) Hemans, des Esrahiters. 
[88:2] Jahwe, du Gott meines Heils, / Tagsüber hab ich schon immer geschrien, / Des Nachts liege ich vor dir. 
[88:3] Mein Gebet möge vor dich kommen! / Neige dein Ohr meinem lauten Flehn! 
[88:4] Denn mit Leiden bin ich gesättigt, / Und mein Leben ist nahe dem Totenreich. 
[88:5] Man zählt mich schon denen zu, die in die Grube hinunterfahren; / Ich bin wie ein Mann ohne Lebenskraft. 
[88:6] Unter den Toten ist mein Lager; / Ich gleiche Erschlagnen, die im Grabe ruhn, / Deren du nicht mehr gedenkst — / Sie sind ja getrennt von deiner Hand. 
[88:7] Du hast mich gelegt in die unterste Grube, / In dichte Finsternis und in die Tiefen. 
[88:8] Auf mir lastet dein Grimm; / All deine Wogen drücken mich nieder. Sela. 
[88:9] Meine Freunde hast du von mir entfernt, / Du hast mich ihnen zum Abscheu gemacht. / Ich bin eingeschlossen, kann nicht hinaus. 
[88:10] Mein Auge verschmachtet vor Elend. / Ich rufe dich, Jahwe, tagtäglich an, / Breite zu dir meine Hände aus: 
[88:11] Tust du denn für die Toten Wunder? / Erheben sich Schatten, um dir zu danken? Sela. 
[88:12] Erzählt man im Grabe von deiner Güte, / Von deiner Treue im Totenreich? 
[88:13] Wird in der Finsternis dein Wunderwalten kund / Und deine Gerechtigkeit im Land des Vergessens?" 
[88:14] Ich aber schreie, o Jahwe, zu dir, / Schon morgens begrüßt dich mein Gebet: 
[88:15] "Warum denn, Jahwe, verwirfst du mich, / Verhüllest vor mir dein Angesicht?" 
[88:16] Ich bin ja so elend: hinsterbend von Jugend auf. / Das schreckliche Los, das du mir bestimmt, / Ich hab es ertragen — nun bin ich erschöpft! 
[88:17] Deine Zornesgluten gehn über mich; / Es vernichten mich deine Schrecken. 
[88:18] Wie Wasser umgeben sie mich allezeit, / Umringen mich allzumal. Du hast alle Lieben von mir entfernt, / Mir bleibt als Freund nur — die Finsternis! 
[89:1] Eine Betrachtung (?) Etans, des Esrahiters. 
[89:2] Jahwes Gnaden will ich ewig besingen, / Für und für deine Treue verkünden. 
[89:3] Denn ich sage: Der Gnadenbau währet für immer, / Am Himmel befestigst du deine Treu. 
[89:4] "Ich schloß einen Bund mit meinem Erwählten, / Hab meinem Knechte David geschworen: 
[89:5] Auf ewig laß ich deinen Samen bestehn, / Deinen Thron will ich baun für alle Geschlechter." Sela. 
[89:6] Da priesen die Himmel, o Jahwe, dein Wunder, / Deine Treu in der Heilgen Versammlung. 
[89:7] Denn wer in den Wolken ist Jahwe ähnlich, / Wer gleicht ihm unter den Gottessöhnen? 
[89:8] Man fürchtet Gott sehr in der Heiligen Rat; / Es scheuen ihn alle, die um ihn sind. 
[89:9] Jahwe, der Heerscharen Gott, wer ist wie du? / Jah, du bist stark, / Und deine Treue ist um dich her. 
[89:10] Du bändigst des Meeres Stolz; / Wenn sich seine Wogen türmen — du stillest sie. 
[89:11] Du hast ja Rahab zermalmt wie einen Durchbohrten, / Mit deinem starken Arm hast du deine Feinde zerstreut. 
[89:12] Dein ist der Himmel, dein auch die Erde; / Die Welt und was sie füllet — du hast sie gegründet. 
[89:13] Norden und Süden — du hast sie geschaffen. / Tabor und Hermon jauchzen ob deines Namens. 
[89:14] Dein ist ein Arm mit Heldenkraft. / Mächtig ist deine Hand, deine Rechte erhaben. 
[89:15] Gerechtigkeit und Recht sind deines Thrones Stützen, / Gnade und Treue gehn vor dir her. 
[89:16] Heil dem Volke, das Jubel kennt, / Das im Licht deines Angesichts wandelt, o Jahwe! 
[89:17] Ob deines Namens werden sie allzeit jubeln, / Und durch deine Treue stehen sie aufrecht da. 
[89:18] Denn du gibst die Kraft, die sie schmückt, / Durch deine Huld machst du uns mächtig. 
[89:19] Denn von Jahwe kommt unser Schutz, / Und der Heilige Israels schirmt unsern König. 
[89:20] Damals hast du im Gesicht gesprochen zu deinen Vertrauten: / Ich habe einem Helden Beistand geliehn, / Einen Jüngling erhöht aus dem Volk. 
[89:21] Meinen Knecht David hab ich gefunden, / Mit meinem heilgen Öl ihn gesalbt. 
[89:22] Meine Hand soll ihn stützen, / Auch mein Arm ihn stärken. 
[89:23] Kein Feind darf ihn unversehns überfallen, / Kein Frevler ihn drücken. 
[89:24] Seine Dränger will ich vor ihm zerschmettern, / Und, die ihn hassen, schlagen. 
[89:25] Ihn aber soll meine Treue und Gnade begleiten, / Und durch meinen Namen wird groß seine Macht. 
[89:26] Seine Hand will ich legen aufs Meer / Und auf die Ströme seine Rechte. 
[89:27] Er wird zu mir sprechen: 'Mein Vater bist du, / Mein Gott und der Hort, der mir hilft.' 
[89:28] Und ich will ihn machen zum Erstgebornen, / Zum höchsten der Könige auf Erden. 
[89:29] Auf ewig will ich ihm meine Huld bewahren, / Und es bleibt mein Bund ihm getreu. 
[89:30] Seine Nachkommen will ich für immer erhalten, / Seinen Thron, solange der Himmel währt. 
[89:31] Verlassen seine Söhne mein Gesetz, / Und wandeln sie nicht nach meinen Rechten, 
[89:32] Entweihen sie meine Satzungen, / Und halten sie meine Gebote nicht: 
[89:33] So straf ich zwar mit dem Stab ihre Vergehn / Und ihre Verschuldung mit Schlägen; 
[89:34] Meine Huld aber werd ich ihm nicht entziehn / Und meine Treue nicht brechen. 
[89:35] Ich will meinen Bund nicht entweihn / Und meiner Lippen Versprechen nicht ändern. 
[89:36] Eins hab ich geschworen bei meiner Heiligkeit: / David werd ich wahrlich nicht lügen. 
[89:37] Seine Nachkommen sollen ewig bleiben, / Sein Thron vor mir stehn so lang wie die Sonne, 
[89:38] Wie der Mond, der für immer bleibt / Als ein dauernder Zeuge in dem Gewölk." Sela. 
[89:39] Und dennoch hast du verschmäht und verworfen! / Du hast über deinen Gesalbten gezürnt, 
[89:40] Hast aufgehoben den Bund mit deinem Knecht, / Seine Krone entweiht und zu Boden geworfen. 
[89:41] Du hast all seine Mauern zerrissen, / Seine Festen in Trümmer gelegt. 
[89:42] Alle, die des Weges zogen, haben ihn geplündert, / Er ist seinen Nachbarn zum Hohn geworden. 
[89:43] Seiner Dränger Macht hast du erhöht, / Hast all seine Feinde mit Freude erfüllt. 
[89:44] Auch hast du zurückgedrängt sein scharfes Schwert / Und ihm im Kriege nicht Sieg verliehn. 
[89:45] Du hast seinen Glanz zerstört / Und seinen Thron zu Boden gestürzt. 
[89:46] Du hast die Zeit seiner Jugend verkürzt, / Ihn mit Schande bedeckt. Sela. 
[89:47] Wie lange, Jahwe, willst du dich verbergen? Etwa für immer? / Soll denn dein Grimm wie Feuer brennen? 
[89:48] Gedenke, wie kurz mein Leben ist, / Wie vergänglich du schufst alle Menschenkinder! 
[89:49] Wer bliebe am Leben und stürbe nicht, / Wer könnte entrinnen des Todes Macht? Sela. 
[89:50] Wo sind, Adonái, deine frühern Gnaden, / Die du David geschworen in deiner Treu? 
[89:51] Gedenk, Adonái, deiner Knechte Schmach! / Gedenke, daß ich in meinem Busen / Trage die vielen Völker alle! 
[89:52] Gedenke, Jahwe, wie deine Feinde gelästert haben, / Wie sie gelästert / Deines Gesalbten Fersen! Gepriesen sei Jahwe in Ewigkeit! / Amen. Amen. 
[90:1] Ein Gebet Moses, des Mannes Gottes. / Adonái, du bist uns Zuflucht gewesen in allen Geschlechtern. 
[90:2] Eh Berge entstanden, / Eh Erd und Weltkreis geschaffen wurden, / Warst du schon da, o Gott; / Ja, von Ewigkeit bist du und bleibst in Ewigkeit. 
[90:3] Du wandeltest die Sterblichen in Staub / Und sprachst: "Kehrt wieder, ihr Menschenkinder!" 
[90:4] Denn in deinen Augen sind tausend Jahre / Wie der gestrige Tag, wenn er entschwindet, / Wie eine Wache in der Nacht. 
[90:5] Du hast sie weggeschwemmt wie Morgenschlaf. / Sie glichen dem sprossenden Gras: 
[90:6] Am Morgen blüht es und sprosset neu, / Am Abend schneidet man's, und es verdorrt. 
[90:7] Denn geschwunden sind wir durch deinen Zorn, / Hinweggeschreckt durch deinen Grimm. 
[90:8] Du hast unsre Sünde vor dich gestellt, / Unser heimlich Tun in das helle Licht, / Das von deinem Antlitz strahlet. 
[90:9] So sind all unsre Tage dahingefahren durch deinen Zorn, / Unsre Jahre haben wir zugebracht / Wie einen flüchtigen Gedanken. 
[90:10] Unsre Lebenszeit — bei ihnen währet sie siebzig Jahr, / Und haben sie starke Lebenskraft, so sind es achtzig Jahr. / Und was sie mit Stolz erfüllte, das war nur Mühsal und Unglück. / Denn schnell ist's enteilt — wir flogen! 
[90:11] Doch wer erkennt deines Zornes Gewalt / Und deinen Grimm, indem man dich fürchtet? 
[90:12] So lehr uns denn unsre Tage zählen, / Damit wir gewinnen ein weises Herz! 
[90:13] Wende dich, Jahwe (von deinem Zorn)! / Wie lange noch (soll er währen)? / Erbarme dich deiner Knechte! 
[90:14] Füll uns am Morgen mit deiner Gnade, / So wollen wir all unsre Lebenstage / Jubeln und fröhlich sein! 
[90:15] Erfreu uns so lange, wie du uns gebeugt, / So viel Jahre wir Unglück geschaut! 
[90:16] Deinen Knechten erscheine dein herrliches Tun / Und deine Hoheit ihren Kindern! 
[90:17] Jahwes, unsers Gottes, Huld walte über uns, / Ja, fördre das Werk unsrer Hände! 
[91:1] Erste Stimme: / Unter dem Schutze des Höchsten wohnend, / In des Allmächtigen Schatten weilend — 
[91:2] Sprech ich zu Jahwe: "Meine Zuflucht und Burg, / Mein Gott, auf den ich vertraue!" 
[91:3] Zweite Stimme: / Denn er wird dich erretten von des Voglers Strick, / Von der verderblichen Pest. 
[91:4] Mit seiner Schwinge decket er dich, / Unter seinen Flügeln bist du geborgen. / Schild und Panzer ist seine Treu. 
[91:5] Du hast nicht zu fürchten die Schrecken der Nacht, / Den Pfeil, der am Tage daherfliegt, 
[91:6] Auch nicht die Pest, die im Dunkeln schleicht, / Noch die Seuche, die wütet am Mittag. 
[91:7] Wenn tausend an deiner Seite fallen / Und zehntausend zu deiner Rechten: / Du wirst nicht getroffen. 
[91:8] Nur mit deinen Augen schauest du hin / Und wirst sehn die Vergeltung der Frevler. 
[91:9] Erste Stimme: / Ja, du, o Jahwe, bist meine Zuversicht. / Zweite Stimme: / Den Höchsten hast du zur Zuflucht erwählt. 
[91:10] Nicht wird dir ein Unglück begegnen, / Keine Plage wird deinem Zelte nahn. 
[91:11] Denn seine Engel wird er dir entbieten, / Dich zu behüten auf all deinen Wegen. 
[91:12] Sie werden dich auf den Händen tragen, / Damit sich dein Fuß nicht stoße am Stein. 
[91:13] Über Löwen und Ottern wirst du schreiten, / Zertreten Jungleuen und Schlangen. 
[91:14] Dritte Stimme (die im Namen Gottes redet): / Weil er mich liebt, will ich ihn befrein. / Ich will ihn schützen, weil er meinen Namen kennt. 
[91:15] Er ruft mich an, ich erhör ihn. / Ich werde mit ihm in Drangsal sein; / Ich reiß ihn heraus und bring ihn zu Ehren. 
[91:16] Mit langem Leben sättige ich ihn / Und will ihn schauen lassen mein Heil. 
[92:1] Ein Psalm. Ein Lied für den Sabbattag. 
[92:2] Köstlich ist es, Jahwe zu danken / Und deinem Namen, o Höchster, zu spielen, 
[92:3] Am Morgen deine Huld zu verkünden / Und deine Treu in den Nächten, 
[92:4] Zum Zehnsait und zur Harfe, / Zum rauschenden Spiel auf der Zither. 
[92:5] Denn du, Jahwe, hast mich erfreut durch dein Walten, / Deiner Hände Werke lassen mich jauchzen. 
[92:6] Wie herrlich, Jahwe, sind deine Taten, / Wie tief sind deine Gedanken! 
[92:7] Nur ein geistloser Mensch erkennt das nicht, / Nur ein Törichter sieht es nicht ein. 
[92:8] Sprießen die Frevler auch auf wie Gras, / Blühen auch alle die Übeltäter — / Vernichtet werden sie doch auf immer! 
[92:9] Du aber, Jahwe, bist ewig erhaben! 
[92:10] Denn sieh, deine Feinde, Jahwe, / Sieh, deine Feinde müssen vergehn, / Sich zerstreun alle Übeltäter. 
[92:11] Mir aber hast du die Kraft des Büffels gegeben, / Ich bin übergossen mit frischem Öl. 
[92:12] Mit Lust hat mein Aug meine Laurer geschaut, / Meiner Feinde Vernichtung vernahm mit Freude mein Ohr. 
[92:13] Der Gerechte wird sprossen wie eine Palme, / Wie eine Zeder des Libanons wachsen. 
[92:14] Gepflanzt im Hause Jahwes, / Blühn sie in unsers Gottes Höfen. 
[92:15] Sie tragen noch Frucht im Greisenalter, / Saftvoll werden sie sein und frisch, Um zu verkünden: Gerecht ist Jahwe, / Mein Fels, an dem sich kein Tadel findet. 
[93:1] Jahwe herrscht nun als König, er hat sich mit Hoheit umkleidet, / Jahwe hat sich umkleidet, mit Macht sich gegürtet. / So steht nun der Erdkreis fest und wanket nicht. 
[93:2] Fest steht dein Thron von alters her, / Seit Ewigkeit bist du! 
[93:3] Zwar haben Ströme, Jahwe, erhoben, / Ströme haben erhoben ihr Brausen; / Auch ferner noch werden Ströme ihr Tosen erheben: 
[93:4] Doch größer als vieler mächtiger Wasser Gebraus, / Als des Meeres brandende Wogen / Ist Jahwe droben in Himmelshöhn! 
[93:5] Was du verordnet, ist unverbrüchlich. / Deinem Hause ziemt Heiligkeit, / Jahwe, für ewige Zeiten. 
[94:1] Gott, der du Vergeltung übst, o Jahwe, / Gott, der du Vergeltung übst, erscheine im Lichtglanz! 
[94:2] Erhebe dich, Richter der Erde, / Vergilt den Stolzen nach ihrem Tun! 
[94:3] Wie lange, Jahwe, sollen die Frevler, / Wie lange sollen die Frevler jauchzen? 
[94:4] Sie stoßen trotzige Reden aus, / Alle Übeltäter prahlen. 
[94:5] Dein Volk, o Jahwe, zertreten sie, / Und sie bedrücken dein Erbe. 
[94:6] Witwen und Fremdlinge würgen sie, / Und sie morden die Waisen. 
[94:7] Dabei denken sie noch: "Jah siehet es nicht." / Und: "Der Gott Jakobs beachtet es nicht." 
[94:8] Merkt doch auf, ihr Toren im Volk, / Und ihr Narren — wann werdet ihr klug? 
[94:9] Der das Ohr gepflanzt — er sollte nicht hören? / Oder der das Auge gebildet, sollte nicht sehn? 
[94:10] Der Völker erziehet, sollte nicht strafen — / Er, der die Menschen Erkenntnis lehrt? 
[94:11] Jahwe kennt der Menschen Gedanken, / Er weiß: Sie sind nichts als leerer Wahn. 
[94:12] Heil dem, den du zurechtweist, Jah, / Den du aus deinem Gesetze belehrst, 
[94:13] Daß er ruhig bleibe in Unglückstagen, / Wenn dem Frevler die Grube gegraben wird. 
[94:14] Denn nicht verstoßen wird Jahwe sein Volk / Und sein Erbe nimmer verlassen. 
[94:15] Denn das Recht wird zuletzt doch gerecht gehandhabt, / Und alle Redlichen werden das freudig begrüßen. 
[94:16] Wer wird mir beistehn gegen die Frevler, / Wer tritt für mich ein wider Übeltäter? 
[94:17] Wäre nicht Jahwe mein Helfer gewesen — / Ich läge beinahe in Todesstille. 
[94:18] Wenn ich dachte: "Es wankt mein Fuß", / So sützte mich, Jahwe, deine Hand. 
[94:19] Wenn die Sorgen sich türmten in meinem Herzen, / Hast du mich mit deinem Troste erquickt. 
[94:20] Hat Gemeinschaft mit dir der verderbliche Stuhl, / Der Unheil schmiedet "nach dem Gesetz"? 
[94:21] Sie bedrohten schon oft des Gerechten Leben / Und sprachen Unschuldige schuldig. 
[94:22] Doch Jahwe ward mir zur festen Burg, / Mein Gott zum schützenden Fels. 
[94:23] Ihren Frevel hast du ihnen heimgezahlt. / Ob ihrer Bosheit vernichtet er sie, / Es vernichtet sie Jahwe, unser Gott. 
[95:1] Auf, laßt uns Jahwe frohlocken, / Entgegenjauchzen dem Fels unsers Heils! 
[95:2] Laßt uns mit Dank vor sein Antlitz treten, / In Lobgesängen ihm jubeln! 
[95:3] Denn ein großer Gott ist Jahwe, / Ein großer König über alle Götter. 
[95:4] In seiner Hand sind der Erde Tiefen, / Und sein sind die Gipfel der Berge. 
[95:5] Sein ist das Meer, er hat es geschaffen, / Auch das Festland haben seine Hände gebildet. 
[95:6] Kommt, laßt uns anbeten und niederfallen, / Knien vor Jahwe, der uns erschaffen! 
[95:7] Denn er ist unser Gott, / Und wir sind das Volk, das er weidet, / Die Herde, die er leitet mit seiner Hand, / Wenn ihr heut seiner Stimme gehorcht. 
[95:8] "Verstockt doch nicht euer Herz, wie bei Merîba, / Wie am Tage von Massa in der Wüste, 
[95:9] Wo eure Väter mich versuchten, / Mich prüften, obwohl sie mein Tun gesehn. 
[95:10] Vierzig Jahre war mir dies Geschlecht zuwider. / Ich sprach: 'Ein irrendes Volk sind sie, / Das meine Wege nicht erkannt.' 
[95:11] Drum schwur ich in meinem Zorn: / 'Wahrlich, sie sollen nicht kommen / Zu der Ruhstatt, die ich ihnen verheißen.'" 
[96:1] Singet Jahwe ein neues Lied, / Singt Jahwe, all ihr Erdbewohner! 
[96:2] Singt Jahwe, preist seinen Namen, / Verkündet tagtäglich sein Heil! 
[96:3] Erzählt auch unter den Heiden von seiner Herrlichkeit, / Unter allen Völkern von seinen Wundertaten! 
[96:4] Denn groß ist Jahwe und hoch zu preisen, / Mehr zu fürchten als alle Götter. 
[96:5] Denn alle Götter der Völker sind nichtig, / Aber Jahwe hat die Himmel geschaffen. 
[96:6] Glanz und Pracht gehn vor ihm her, / Macht und Schmuck erfüllen sein Heiligtum. 
[96:7] Bringt Jahwe, ihr Völkergeschlechter, / Bringt Jahwe Ehre und Preis! 
[96:8] Bringt Jahwe dar seines Namens Ruhm, / Nehmt Opfergaben und kommt in seine Vorhöfe! 
[96:9] Werft euch nieder vor Jahwe in heiligem Schmuck, / Erbebt vor ihm, alle Lande! 
[96:10] Ruft unter den Heiden: "Jahwe herrscht nun als König! / Auch wird der Erdkreis feststehn ohne Wanken; / Er wird die Völker gerecht regieren." 
[96:11] Drum mögen sich freuen die Himmel, / Die Erde frohlocke, / Es brause das Meer und was darin wohnt! 
[96:12] Das Gefilde jauchze und was darauf lebt! / Dann sollen auch jubeln alle Bäume im Wald 
[96:13] Vor der Nähe Jahwes, wenn er nun kommt, / Wenn er kommt, um die Erde zu richten. / Richten wird er die Welt gerecht / Und die Völker nach seiner Treue. 
[97:1] Jahwe herrscht nun als König: drob jauchze die Erde, / Es mögen sich auch viele Inseln freun! 
[97:2] Gewölk und Dunkel sind um ihn her, / Recht und Gerechtigkeit sind seines Thrones Stützen. 
[97:3] Feuer geht vor ihm her / Und verzehrt ringsum seine Feinde. 
[97:4] Seine Blitze erhellen den Erdkreis, / Die Erde sieht es und bebt vor Angst. 
[97:5] Wie Wachs sind Berge vor Jahwe zerschmolzen, / Vor dem Herrn der ganzen Erde. 
[97:6] Die Himmel haben sein Recht verkündet, / Seine Herrlichkeit schauen die Völker alle. 
[97:7] Beschämt sollen stehn alle Bilderdiener, / Die sich der nichtigen Götzen rühmen: / Ihm haben ja alle Götter gehuldigt. 
[97:8] Mit Freunden hat es Zion vernommen, / Und Judas Töchter haben frohlockt / Ob deiner Gerichte, o Jahwe. 
[97:9] Denn du, o Jahwe, bist der Höchste in aller Welt, / Bist hoch erhaben über alle Götter. 
[97:10] Die Jahwe lieben, hassen das Böse. / Er, der seiner Frommen Seelen behütet, / Wird sie aus der Frevler Hand erretten. 
[97:11] Licht erstrahlt dem Gerechten / Und Freude den Redlichgesinnten. 
[97:12] Drum freuet euch Jahwes, ihr Gerechten, / Und preiset sein heilig Gedächtnis! 
[98:1] Ein Psalm. / Singet Jahwe ein neues Lied, / Denn Wunderbares hat er vollbracht: / Seine Rechte hat ihm geholfen / Und sein heiliger Arm. 
[98:2] So hat Jahwe gezeigt, daß er rettet, / Vor den Augen der Völker hat er sein Heil enthüllt. 
[98:3] Er hat gedacht seiner Huld und Treu gegen Israels Haus; / Alle Enden der Erde / Haben unsers Gottes Hilfe geschaut. 
[98:4] Jauchzt Jahwe zu, alle Lande, / Freut euch, jubelt und spielt! 
[98:5] Spielt mit der Zither Jahwe zu Ehren, / Mit der Zither und lautem Gesang! 
[98:6] Mit Trompeten und Schofarklang / Jauchzet vor Jahwe, dem König! 
[98:7] Es tose das Meer mit allem, was drinnen, / Der Erdkreis mit seinen Bewohnern! 
[98:8] Die Ströme sollen frohlocken, / Jauchzen sollen die Berge alle 
[98:9] Vor Jahwes Nähe, wenn er nun kommt, / Um die Erde zu richten. / Richten wird er die Welt gerecht / Und die Völker, wie sich's gebührt. 
[99:1] Jahwe herrscht nun als König: da zittern die Völker, / Er thront auf Keruben: da wanket die Welt. 
[99:2] Jahwe ist groß in Zion, / Erhaben ist er über alle Völker. 
[99:3] Preisen soll man deinen Namen: / "Groß und ehrfurchtgebietend, / Ja, heilig ist er!" 
[99:4] Ein König ist stark, wenn er liebt das Recht: / Du hast nun bestimmt, was sich gebührt; / Du hast in Jakob verordnet / Recht und Gerechtigkeit. 
[99:5] Preiset Jahwe, unsern Gott, / Fallt nieder vor seinem Fußschemel: / "Heilig ist er!" 
[99:6] Mose und Aaron zählten zu seinen Priestern, / Und Samuel war unter seinen Betern: / Sie riefen zu Jahwe — er hörte sie. 
[99:7] In der Wolkensäule sprach er zu ihnen; / Seine Gebote bewahrten sie / Und jedes Gesetz, das er ihnen gegeben. 
[99:8] Jahwe, unser Gott, du hast sie erhört. / Ein verzeihender Gott bist du ihnen gewesen, / Doch ihr Vergehen hast du gestraft. 
[99:9] Preiset Jahwe, unsern Gott! / Fallt nieder vor seinem heiligen Berg, / Denn heilig ist Jahwe, unser Gott! 
[100:1] Ein Psalm zum Dankopfer. / (Der Chor der Festgemeinde:) / Jauchzt Jahwe zu, alle Erdbewohner! 
[100:2] Dienet Jahwe mit Freuden, / Erscheint vor ihm mit Jubel! 
[100:3] Erkennet: Jahwe ist Gott! / Er hat uns gemacht, und wir sind sein: / Sein Volk, das er weidet als Herde. 
[100:4] (Der Chor der levitischen Sänger:) / Zieht in seine Tore mit Danken ein, / In seine Vorhöfe mit Lobgesang! / Dankt ihm, preist seinen Namen! 
[100:5] Denn gütig ist Jahwe, ewig währt seine Gnade / Und seine Treu von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht. 
[101:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Von Huld und Recht will ich singen, / Dir, Jahwe, will ich spielen. 
[101:2] Achten will ich auf frommen Wandel — / Wann wirst du zu mir kommen? / Einhergehn will ich in meines Herzens Unschuld / In meinem Hause. 
[101:3] Nicht will ich sinnen / Auf ruchlos Tun. / Der Abtrünnigen Werke hasse ich: / Nicht sollen sie mir ankleben. 
[101:4] Ein falsches Herz soll mir fernbleiben, / Von Frevlern will ich nichts wissen. 
[101:5] Wer seinen Nächsten heimlich verleumdet, / Den will ich zum Schweigen bringen. 
[101:6] Meine Augen suchen die Treuen im Lande: / Die sollen bei mir wohnen. / Wer auf frommem Wege wandelt, / Der soll mein Diener sein. 
[101:7] Nicht soll in meinem Hause einer weilen, / Der Trug verübt. / Wer Lügen redet, / Der kann vor meinen Augen nicht bestehn. 
[101:8] Jeden Morgen will ich unschädlich machen / Alle Frevler des Landes, / Um aus Jahwes Stadt zu vertilgen / Alle Übeltäter. 
[102:1] Das Gebet eines Elenden, wenn er verzagt ist / und seine Klage vor Jahwe ergießt. 
[102:2] Jahwe, höre doch mein Gebet, / Laß meinen Notschrei zu dir dringen! 
[102:3] Verbirg dein Antlitz nicht vor mir, / Wenn ich in Bedrängnis bin! / O neige dein Ohr zu mir, / Wenn ich zu dir rufe. / Erhöre mich eilend! 
[102:4] Denn meine Tage sind wie ein Rauch vergangen, / Mein Gebein ist durchglüht wie ein Herd. 
[102:5] Mein Herz ist wie Gras, vom Glutwind getroffen: es ist verdorrt; / Denn ich habe sogar vergessen, mein Brot zu genießen. 
[102:6] Vor lautem Jammern / Klebt mein Gebein mir am Fleisch. 
[102:7] Ich gleiche dem Pelikan in der Wüste, / Ich bin wie ein Käuzlein in Trümmerstätten. 
[102:8] Nachts bin ich schlaflos wie ein Vogel, / Der einsam sitzt auf dem Dach. 
[102:9] Allzeit schmähen mich meine Feinde; / Die wider mich rasen, schwören bei mir. 
[102:10] Denn Asche hab ich als Brot gegessen / Und mein Getränk mit Tränen gemischt. 
[102:11] Dein Grimm und Zorn hat das bewirkt: / Du hast mich vom Boden gehoben, dann niedergeschleudert. 
[102:12] Meine Tage sind wie ein langer Schatten, / Und ich selbst verdorre wie Gras. 
[102:13] Du aber, Jahwe, wirst ewig thronen, / Dein Gedächtnis währt in allen Geschlechtern. 
[102:14] Du wirst dich erheben, dich Zions erbarmen. / Denn Zeit ist's, ihm Gnade zu schenken: die Stunde ist da. 
[102:15] Denn deine Knechte lieben seine Steine, / Und sein Schutt erfüllt sie mit Jammer. 
[102:16] Dann werden die Heiden Jahwes Namen fürchten / Und alle Könige der Erde deine Herrlichkeit, 
[102:17] Wenn Jahwe Zion hat neugebaut, / In seinem Glanze erschienen ist. 
[102:18] Er hat ja der Heimatlosen Gebet erhört / Und nicht verachtet ihr Flehen. 
[102:19] Dies soll verzeichnet werden für spätre Geschlechter. / Ein Volk, das erst noch ins Dasein tritt, / Soll Jah lobpreisen. 
[102:20] Denn er hat herabgeschaut von seiner heiligen Höhe, / Jahwe hat vom Himmel zur Erde geblickt, 
[102:21] Um der Gefangnen Seufzen zu hören, / Die dem Tode Verfallnen freizumachen, 
[102:22] Damit man in Zion von Jahwes Namen erzähle, / Von seinem Ruhm in Jerusalem, 
[102:23] Wenn die Völker alle zusammenkommen / Und die Königreiche, um Jahwe zu dienen. 
[102:24] Auf dem Wege hat er meine Kraft gebrochen, / Er hat meine Tage verkürzt. 
[102:25] Nun ruf ich: "Mein Gott, raffe mich nicht weg / In der Hälfte meiner Tage!" / Deine Jahre währen ja / Bis in die fernsten Geschlechter. 
[102:26] Vorzeiten hast du die Erde gegründet, / Und die Himmel sind deiner Hände Werk. 
[102:27] Sie werden vergehn, du aber bleibst. / Sie alle veralten wie ein Kleid. / Du wirst sie wechseln wie ein Gewand, / Und sie werden verschwinden. 
[102:28] Du aber bleibst immer derselbe, / Und deine Jahre werden nicht enden. Deiner Knechte Kinder werden in Ruhe wohnen, / Und ihre Nachkommen werden vor dir bestehn. 
[103:1] Von David. / Preise Jahwe, o meine Seele, / Und all mein Innres seinen heiligen Namen! 
[103:2] Preise Jahwe, o meine Seele, / Und vergiß nicht all seiner Segenstaten! 
[103:3] Er vergibt dir all deine Missetat, / Schafft all deiner Krankheit Heilung. 
[103:4] Er erlöset dein Leben vom Tode, / Krönt dich mit Huld und Erbarmen. 
[103:5] Er sättigt dein Alter mit Gutem, / So daß deine Jugend sich wieder erneut / Wie eines Adlers Gefieder. 
[103:6] Heilstaten vollführet Jahwe, / Recht schafft er allen Bedrückten. 
[103:7] Mose tat er seine Wege kund, / Israels Söhnen sein herrliches Tun. 
[103:8] Barmherzig und gnädig ist Jahwe, / Langmütig und reich an Huld. 
[103:9] Er hat nicht für immer gehadert / Und nicht auf ewig gezürnt. 
[103:10] Nicht nach unsern Sünden hat er uns gelohnt, / Uns nicht vergolten nach unsern Vergehn. 
[103:11] Sondern so hoch der Himmel ist über der Erde, / So mächtig war seine Huld bei den Frommen. 
[103:12] So weit der Osten vom Westen ist, / Hat er unsre Frevel von uns entfernt. 
[103:13] Wie sich ein Vater der Kinder erbarmt, / Hat Jahwe sich stets erbarmt seiner Frommen. 
[103:14] Er weiß ja, wie schwach wir sind, / Er gedenket daran: wir sind Staub. 
[103:15] Eines Sterblichen Tage sind wie Gras, / Wie des Feldes Blume, so blüht er. 
[103:16] Fährt über sie ein Windstoß, so ist sie dahin, / Und es kennt sie nicht mehr ihre Stätte. 
[103:17] Doch Jahwes Gnade erzeigt sich auf ewig an seinen Frommen, / Seine Treue erfahren in jedem Geschlecht 
[103:18] Alle, die seinen Bund bewahren / Und seiner Gebote gedenken, sie zu erfüllen. 
[103:19] Jahwe hat seinen Thron im Himmel errichtet, / Sein Königtum herrscht über alles. 
[103:20] Preist Jahwe, ihr seine Engel, / Ihr Helden an Kraft, die ihr sein Gebot vollführt, / Indem ihr dem Ruf seines Wortes gehorcht! 
[103:21] Preist Jahwe, ihr seine Heere alle, / Seine Diener, die ihr seinen Willen vollstreckt! 
[103:22] Preist Jahwe, ihr seine Werke all, / An jedem Ort seines Herrschaftsgebiets! / Preise Jahwe auch meine Seele! 
[104:1] Preise Jahwe, o meine Seele! / Jahwe, mein Gott, du bist sehr groß: / Mit Hoheit und Pracht hast du dich gekleidet, 
[104:2] In Licht dich gehüllt wie in ein Gewand. / Wie ein Zelttuch hat er die Himmel gespannt. 
[104:3] Im Wasser hat er seine Söller gewölbt. / Wolken macht er zu seinem Wagen. / Auf des Windes Flügeln fährt er einher. 
[104:4] Winde macht er zu seinen Boten, / Zu seinen Dienern Feuerflammen. 
[104:5] Die Erde hat er auf Pfeiler gegründet, / So daß sie nicht wanket immer und ewig. 
[104:6] Die Urflut hat er darüber gedeckt wie ein Kleid, / Selbst über den Bergen standen Wasser. 
[104:7] Vor deinem Machtruf entflohen sie, / Vor deinem gewaltigen Donner eilten sie ängstlich hinweg 
[104:8] - Während Berge sich hoben und Täler sich senkten — / An den Ort, den du ihnen bestimmt. 
[104:9] Eine Grenze hast du ihnen gesetzt, die dürfen sie nicht überschreiten. / Sie dürfen nicht wiederkehren, daß sie die Erde bedecken. 
[104:10] Du sendest Quellen in Bäche aus, / Die zwischen den Bergen fließen. 
[104:11] Sie tränken alles Getier des Gefilds; / Auch Wildesel stillen ihren Durst. 
[104:12] An den Bächen wohnen des Himmels Vögel, / Und aus den Zweigen ertönt ihr Lied. 
[104:13] Er tränkt die Berge aus seinen Söllern. / Von dem, was dein Regen wachsen läßt, wird das Erdreich gesättigt. 
[104:14] Gras lässest du sprossen für das Vieh / Und Kraut zum Nutzen des Menschen: / So bringst du Brot aus der Erde hervor. 
[104:15] Und der Wein soll erfreun des Sterblichen Herz, / Sein Antlitz soll glänzen vom Öl, / Und das Brot soll erquicken des Sterblichen Herz. 
[104:16] Jahwes Bäume trinken sich satt: / Libanons Zedern, die er gepflanzt. 
[104:17] Dort nisten Vögel, / Vor allen der Storch, der sein Nest auf Zypressen hat. 
[104:18] Die Berge dagegen, die hohen, sind der Steinböcke Sitz. / In den Felsen finden die Klippdachse Schutz. 
[104:19] Er schuf den Mond, die Zeiten zu messen, / Dazu auch die Sonne, die ihren Untergang kennt. 
[104:20] Läßt du Finsternis kommen, so wird es Nacht. / Da regt sich alles Getier des Waldes: 
[104:21] Die jungen Löwen vor allen, die da brüllen nach Raub / Und von Gott ihre Nahrung fordern. 
[104:22] Die Sonne geht auf: da schleichen sie weg / Und legen sich nieder in ihren Höhlen. 
[104:23] Der Mensch geht an sein Tagewerk, / An seine Arbeit bis auf den Abend. 
[104:24] Jahwe, wie sind deiner Werke so viel! / Sie alle hast du mit Weisheit vollbracht. / Voll ist die Erde von deinen Gütern. 
[104:25] Da ist das Meer — so groß und so weit! / Drin ist ein zahllos Gewimmel: / Kleine Tiere und große. 
[104:26] Dort ziehen auch Schiffe dahin. / Und der Leviatan ist da, den du geschaffen, / Daß er sich tummle in den Fluten. 
[104:27] Sie alle schauen zu dir empor, / Daß du ihnen Speise gebest zu rechter Zeit. 
[104:28] Wenn du ihnen gibst, so sammeln sie ein; / Öffnest du deine Hand, so werden sie satt von Gutem. 
[104:29] Verbirgst du dein Antlitz, so erschrecken sie; / Nimmst du weg ihren Odem: sie müssen verscheiden / Und kehren zurück in ihren Staub. 
[104:30] Deinen Lebensodem sendest du aus, und sie werden geschaffen: / So erneust du das Antlitz der Erde. 
[104:31] Jahwes Herrlichkeit währe auf ewig! / Es freue sich Jahwe seiner Werke! 
[104:32] Blickt er die Erde an, so erzittert sie; / Berührt er die Berge, so rauchen sie. 
[104:33] Ich will Jahwe singen mein Leben lang, / Meinem Gotte spielen, solange ich bin. 
[104:34] Mög ihm auch mein Sinnen gefallen! / Ich will mich Jahwes freun. 
[104:35] Mögen die Sünder vom Erdboden schwinden / Und die Gottlosen nicht mehr sein! / Meine Seele, preise du Jahwe! / Lobet Jah! 
[105:1] Danket Jahwe, ruft seinen Namen an, / Macht seine großen Taten inmitten der Völker kund! 
[105:2] Singt ihm, spielt ihm, / Redet von all seinen Wundern! 
[105:3] Rühmt euch seines heiligen Namens! / Es freue sich deren Herz, die Jahwe suchen. 
[105:4] Fraget nach Jahwe und seiner Macht, / Suchet sein Antlitz beständig! 
[105:5] Gedenkt seiner Wunder, die er getan, / Seiner Zeichen und der Urteile seines Munds, 
[105:6] Ihr Nachkommen Abrahams, seines Knechts, / Ihr Söhne Jakobs, seine Erwählten! 
[105:7] Er, Jahwe, ist unser Gott; / Er waltet gerecht über alle Lande. 
[105:8] Er gedenkt seines Bundes auf ewig, / Des Wortes, das er geboten für tausend Geschlechter, 
[105:9] Des Bundes, den er geschlossen mit Abraham, / Seines Eides an Isaak. 
[105:10] Er hat ihn für Jakob verheißend bestätigt, / Für Israel als ewigen Bund. 
[105:11] Indem er sagte: "Dir will ich geben Kanaans Land / Als euer erblich Besitztum." 
[105:12] Damals waren sie klein an Zahl, / Ein Häuflein nur, und Gäste im Land. 
[105:13] So wanderten sie von Volk zu Volk, / Von einem Reiche zum andern Volk. 
[105:14] Er ließ sie dabei von niemand bedrücken, / Ja, Könige strafte er ihretwegen: 
[105:15] "Tastet meine Gesalbten nicht an, / Und meinen Propheten tut kein Leid!" 
[105:16] Dann rief er Hungersnot gegen das Land, / Nahm jegliche Nahrung hinweg. 
[105:17] Er sandte vor ihnen her einen Mann: / Josef ward als Sklave verkauft. 
[105:18] Seine Füße wurden gefesselt, / In Eisen legte man ihn, 
[105:19] Bis sich sein Wort erfüllte, / Jahwes Spruch ihn geläutert hatte. 
[105:20] Da sandte der König und ließ ihn los, / Der Völkerbeherrscher gab ihn frei. 
[105:21] Er setzte ihn seinem Hause zum Herrn, / Zum Gebieter über all seinen Besitz; 
[105:22] Er sollte seine Fürsten an sich fesseln, / Seine Ältesten sollte er Weisheit lehren. 
[105:23] Dann kam Israel nach Ägypten, / Und Jakob ward Gast im Lande Hams. 
[105:24] Gott ließ sein Volk sehr zahlreich werden / Und machte es stärker als seine Bedränger. 
[105:25] Es wandelte sich nämlich ihr Herz, sein Volk zu hassen, / Arglist zu üben an seinen Knechten. 
[105:26] Da sandte Gott Mose, seinen Knecht, / Und Aaron, den er sich erkoren. 
[105:27] Die taten Zeichen bei ihnen durch seine Macht / Und Wunderdinge im Lande Hams. 
[105:28] Er sandte Finsternis — es ward dunkel; / Denn widerstrebten sie nicht seinen Worten? 
[105:29] Er verwandelte ihre Gewässer in Blut / Und ließ dadurch ihre Fische sterben. 
[105:30] Es wimmelte auch ihr Land von Fröschen: / Die drangen sogar in der Könige Kammern. 
[105:31] Er sprach, da kamen Bremsen, / Stechmücken in all ihr Gebiet. 
[105:32] Er gab ihnen Hagel als Regen, / Ließ Feuer lohen in ihrem Land. 
[105:33] Er schlug ihren Weinstock und Feigenbaum, / Zerbrach alle Bäume ihres Gebiets. 
[105:34] Er sprach, da kamen Heuschrecken / Und Hüpfer ohne Zahl. 
[105:35] Die fraßen alles Kraut in ihrem Land, / Sie verzehrten die Frucht ihrer Felder. 
[105:36] Alle Erstgeburt schlug er in ihrem Land, / Die Erstlinge all ihrer Manneskraft. 
[105:37] Da ließ er sein Volk mit Silber und Gold ausziehn, / Und es strauchelte keiner in seinen Stämmen. 
[105:38] Die Ägypter freuten sich ihres Auszugs, / Denn Graun vor ihnen war auf sie gefallen. 
[105:39] Er spannte Gewölk als Decke aus, / Und Feuer gab ihnen zur Nachtzeit Licht. 
[105:40] Er bat: da ließ Gott Wachteln kommen / Und sättigte sie mit Himmelsbrot. 
[105:41] Einen Fels tat er auf: da floß Wasser heraus; / Es rann wie ein Strom durch die Steppe. 
[105:42] Denn er dachte seines heiligen Worts / Und Abrahams, seines Knechts. 
[105:43] Drum ließ er sein Volk mit Freuden ausziehn, / Seine Auserwählten mit Jubel. 
[105:44] Er gab ihnen Länder der Heiden; / Was Völker erworben, das erbten sie. 
[105:45] Denn sie sollten seine Gesetze befolgen / Und seinen Lehren gehorsam sein. / Lobt Jah! 
[106:1] Lobet Jah! / Danket Jahwe, denn er ist gütig; / Ewig währet ja seine Huld. 
[106:2] Wer kann gebührend von Jahwes Taten reden / Und all seinen Ruhm erschöpfend verkünden? 
[106:3] Heil denen, die das Gesetz befolgen, / Die Gerechtigkeit üben zu jeder Zeit! 
[106:4] Gedenke mein, o Jahwe! / Auch mir schenk die Huld, die dein Volk erfährt! / Auch mich sieh an, wenn du ihm hilfst! 
[106:5] Dann schau ich mit Lust deiner Erwählten Glück, / Dann teil ich die Freude deines Volks / Und darf mich rühmen mit deinem Erbe. 
[106:6] Wir haben gesündigt gleich unsern Vätern, / Haben gottlos gehandelt, gefrevelt. 
[106:7] Unsre Väter in Ägypten achteten nicht deiner Wunder, / Gedachten nicht deiner Gnadenfülle, / Sondern waren widerspenstig am Meer, am Schilfmeer. 
[106:8] Er aber rettete sie um seines Namens willen, / Um seine Macht zu beweisen. 
[106:9] Er schalt das Schilfmeer, da ward es trocken. / In den Fluten ließ er sie ziehn wie auf blachem Feld. 
[106:10] So befreite er sie aus des Hassers Hand / Und erlöste sie aus des Feindes Gewalt. 
[106:11] Die Wasser bedeckten ihre Bedränger: / Nicht einer von ihnen blieb übrig. 
[106:12] Da vertrauten sie auf seine Worte, / Sie sangen seinen Ruhm. 
[106:13] Doch schnell vergaßen sie seine Taten, / Warteten nicht, daß sein Rat sich erfülle. 
[106:14] Sondern lüstern wurden sie in der Wüste / Und versuchten Gott in der Öde. 
[106:15] Da erfüllte er wohl ihr Verlangen, / Aber dann sandte er ihnen Krankheit zu. 
[106:16] Sie waren auch neidisch auf Mose im Lager, / Auf Aaron, Jahwes Geweihten. 
[106:17] Da tat sich die Erde auf: sie verschlang Datan / Und bedeckte die Rotte Abirams. 
[106:18] Feuer ergriff ihre Rotte, / Die Flamme verzehrte die Frevler. 
[106:19] Sie machten ein Kalb am Horeb / Und beteten dann dies Gußbild an. 
[106:20] Ihres Gottes Herrlichkeit gaben sie hin / Für das Bild eines Stieres, der Gras frißt. 
[106:21] Sie hatten Gott, ihren Retter, vergessen, / Der Großes getan in Ägypten, 
[106:22] Wunder im Lande Hams, / Erstaunliche Dinge am Schilfmeer. 
[106:23] Er wollte sie schon vertilgen: / Doch da trat Mose, sein Auserwählter, vor ihm in den Riß, / Um seine Zornglut abzuwenden, / Daß er sie nicht verderbe. 
[106:24] Sie verschmähten das köstliche Land, / Sie trauten seiner Verheißung nicht, 
[106:25] Sondern murrten in ihren Zelten, / Gehorchten nicht Jahwes Stimme. 
[106:26] Da hub er auf seine Hand und schwur, / Sie niederzuschlagen in der Wüste, 
[106:27] Ihre Nachkommen unter die Völker zu werfen, / Sie zu zerstreuen in die Länder. 
[106:28] Sie hängten sich an den Baal Peôr / Und aßen Opfer für Tote. 
[106:29] So reizten sie ihn mit ihrem Tun. / Da riß unter ihnen ein Sterben ein. 
[106:30] Nun aber trat Pinehas auf und hielt Gericht: / Da ward der Plage Einhalt getan. 
[106:31] Das ward ihm gerechnet zur Gerechtigkeit / Für alle Geschlechter, für immer. 
[106:32] Sie erzürnten ihn weiter am Haderwasser, / Und übel ging's Mose um ihretwillen. 
[106:33] Denn sie hatten seinem Geist widerstrebt, / So daß ihm unbedachte Worte entfuhren. 
[106:34] Sie vertilgten auch nicht die Völker, / Wie ihnen Jahwe geboten hatte. 
[106:35] Sondern sie ließen sich ein mit den Heiden / Und nahmen an ihrem Treiben teil: 
[106:36] Sie dienten ihren Götzen, / Die wurden ihnen zum Fallstrick. 
[106:37] Sie opferten ihre Söhne / Und ihre Töchter den bösen Geistern. 
[106:38] So vergossen sie schuldlos Blut, / Das Blut ihrer Söhne und Töchter, / Die sie opferten Kanaans Götzen, / Daß das Land durch Blutschuld entweiht ward. 
[106:39] So wurden sie unrein durch ihr Tun / Und fielen von Gott durch ihr Treiben ab. 
[106:40] Da entbrannte Jahwes Zorn wider sein Volk, / Er fühlte Abscheu gegen sein Erbe. 
[106:41] Drum gab er sie in der Heiden Hand, / Daß ihre Hasser über sie herrschten. 
[106:42] Ihre Feinde bedrängten sie, / Sie mußten sich beugen ihrer Gewalt. 
[106:43] Oftmals zwar befreite er sie, / Doch in Eigensinn lehnten sie sich auf: / Drum gingen sie unter in ihrer Schuld. 
[106:44] Er aber sah gnädig auf ihre Not, / Als er ihr lautes Schrein vernahm. 
[106:45] Da gedachte er ihnen an seinen Bund / Und hatte Mitleid in großer Huld. 
[106:46] Er ließ sie Erbarmen finden / Bei allen, die sie ins Elend geführt. 
[106:47] Hilf uns, Jahwe, unser Gott, / Und sammle uns aus den Heiden! / Dann wollen wir danken deinem heiligen Namen, / Uns glücklich preisen, dich zu loben. 
[106:48] Gepriesen sei Jahwe, Israels Gott, / Von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit! / Und alles Volk spreche: / "Ja wahrlich! Lobt Jah!" 
[107:1] "Danket Jahwe, denn er ist gütig; / Ewig währt ja seine Huld!" 
[107:2] So sollen sprechen Jahwes Erlöste, / Die er erlöst hat aus Feindeshand, 
[107:3] Und die er gesammelt aus vielen Landen: / Von Ost und West, von Nord und Süd. 
[107:4] Sie irrten vom Weg in der Wüste und Öde, / Eine Stadt als Wohnsitz fanden sie nicht. 
[107:5] Sie litten Hunger und Durst: / Ihre Seele verzagte in ihnen. 
[107:6] Da schrien sie zu Jahwe in ihrer Not: / Der riß sie heraus aus ihren Ängsten. 
[107:7] Er führte sie auf ebnem Weg, / Daß sie kamen in eine wohnliche Stadt. 
[107:8] Nun sollen sie Jahwe danken für seine Huld / Und für seine Wunder zum Segen der Menschen. 
[107:9] Er hat ja die lechzende Seele gesättigt / Und die hungrige Seele mit Gutem gefüllt. 
[107:10] Sie wohnten in Dunkel und Todesschatten, / Gefangen in Elend und Eisenbanden. 
[107:11] Denn sie hatten Jahwes Worten getrotzt / Und den Rat des Höchsten verachtet. 
[107:12] Drum beugte er auch durch Mühsal ihr Herz: / Nun sanken sie hin ohne Helfer. 
[107:13] Da schrien sie zu Jahwe in ihrer Not: / Der machte sie frei aus ihren Ängsten. 
[107:14] Er ließ sie aus Dunkel und Todesschatten, / Und ihre Fesseln zersprengte er. 
[107:15] Nun sollen sie Jahwe danken für seine Huld / Und für seine Wunder zum Segen der Menschen. 
[107:16] Denn er hat zerbrochen Türen von Erz / Und eiserne Riegel zerschlagen. 
[107:17] Gottlose mußten ob sündigen Wandels / Und ob Übertretungen leiden: 
[107:18] Jegliche Speise verabscheuten sie, / Und sie waren schon nahe den Pforten des Todes. 
[107:19] Da schrien sie zu Jahwe in ihrer Not / Der machte sie frei aus ihren Ängsten. 
[107:20] Er sandte sein Wort und heilte sie / Und ließ sie entrinnen aus ihren Gruben. 
[107:21] Nun sollen sie Jahwe danken für seine Huld / Und für seine Wunder zum Segen der Menschen. 
[107:22] Sie sollen bringen Opfer des Danks, / Seine Taten erzählen mit Jubel. 
[107:23] Die mit Schiffen das Meer befuhren, / Ihren Handel trieben in großen Gewässern, 
[107:24] Sie haben Jahwes Werk geschaut / Und seine Wunder im Meeresstrudel. 
[107:25] Auf sein Wort brauste ein Sturmwind daher, / Der türmte empor die Wogen des Meers. 
[107:26] Sie stiegen himmelan, bald fuhren sie in die Tiefe: / Ihre Seel verging in Weh. 
[107:27] Sie schwankten und wankten wie Trunkne, / Und all ihre Weisheit war dahin. 
[107:28] Da schrien sie zu Jahwe in ihrer Not, / Der führte sie aus ihren Ängsten. 
[107:29] Er dämpfte den Sturm zum Säuseln, / Und stille schwiegen des Meeres Wogen. 
[107:30] Da wurden sie froh, daß es ruhig geworden; / Er führte sie dann zum ersehnten Hafen. 
[107:31] Nun sollen sie Jahwe danken für seine Huld / Und für seine Wunder zum Segen der Menschen. 
[107:32] Ja sie sollen ihn preisen in der Gemeinde / Und im Ältestenrate ihn loben. 
[107:33] Er machte auch Ströme zur Wüste / Und Wasserquellen zu dürrem Land, 
[107:34] Fruchtbares Feld zur salzigen Steppe / Wegen der Bosheit seiner Bewohner. 
[107:35] Er wandelte Wüsten in Wasserteiche / Und dürres Land in Wasserquellen. 
[107:36] Dort machte er Hungrige seßhaft: / Sie bauten sich eine Wohnstadt. 
[107:37] Sie besäten Äcker, pflanzten Weingärten / Und gewannen Ertrag an Frucht. 
[107:38] Gott segnete sie: sie mehrten sich sehr, / Auch ihr Vieh ließ sich nicht vermindern. 
[107:39] Doch manchmal nahmen sie ab und sanken dahin / Durch den Druck von Unglück und Kummer. 
[107:40] Aber er, "der auf Fürsten Verachtung gießt / Und in wegloser Öde sie irren läßt" — 
[107:41] Er hob die Armen aus Elend hervor / Und mehrte ihre Sippen wie Herden. 
[107:42] Redliche sollen das sehn mit Freuden, / Doch alle Frevler müssen verstummen. 
[107:43] Wer weise ist, der beachte dies / Und verstehe die Gnaden Jahwes! 
[108:1] Ein Psalmlied Davids. 
[108:2] Mein Herz ist getrost, Elohim. / Ich will singen und spielen, / Ja, das soll meine Seele! 
[108:3] Wach auf, du Harfe und Zither! / Wecken will ich das Morgenrot. 
[108:4] Unter Völkern, Adonái, will ich dich preisen, / Dir singen unter den Leuten. 
[108:5] Denn groß bis über die Himmel hinaus ist deine Gnade, / Bis zu den Wolken reicht deine Treu. 
[108:6] Elohim, erheb dich über die Himmel, / Deine Herrlichkeit über alle Welt! 
[108:7] Damit deine Lieben gerettet werden, / So hilf denn mit deiner Rechten und hör uns! 
[108:8] Elohim hat mir verheißen bei seinem heiligen Namen: / Frohlocken soll ich, austeilen Sichem / Und vermessen das Tal Sukkot. 
[108:9] Mein ist Gilead und mein Manasse, / Efraim schützt mein Haupt als Helm, / Juda ist mein Herrscherstab. 
[108:10] Moab ist mein Waschbecken, / Auf Edom werf ich meinen Schuh. / Über Philistäa werd ich (als Sieger) jauchzen." 
[108:11] Wer bringt mich hinein in die feste Stadt? / Wer führt mich hin nach Edom? 
[108:12] Du, Elohim, du hast uns verworfen; / Du zogst nicht aus, Elohim, mit unsern Heeren. 
[108:13] O schaff uns Beistand gegen den Feind! / Denn nichtig ist Menschenhilfe. Mit Elohim verrichten wir Heldentaten. / Er wird unsre Feinde zertreten. 
[109:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. / Gott, dem mein Loblied gilt, schweige doch nicht! 
[109:2] Denn der Frevler und Lügner Mund / Hat sich wider mich aufgetan, / Zu mir geredet mit falscher Zunge. 
[109:3] Mich haben Worte des Hasses umschwirrt / Und grundlos gegen mich Krieg geführt: 
[109:4] Mit Feindschaft lohnten sie meine Liebe — / Doch ich habe stets für sie gebetet. 
[109:5] Sie haben mir Böses für Gutes erwiesen / Und für meine Liebe Haß. 
[109:6] Bestell einen Frevler wider ihn, / Ein Verkläger steh ihm zur Rechten! 
[109:7] Kommt er vor Gericht, so werd er als schuldig verurteilt, / Sein Gebet sogar — es werde zur Sünde! 
[109:8] Seiner Tage sollen nur wenig sein, / Sein Amt soll ein andrer empfangen. 
[109:9] Seine Kinder sollen Waisen werden / Und sein Weib eine Witwe. 
[109:10] Seine Kinder sollen als Bettler unstet wandern, / (Brot) suchen fern von den Trümmern (des Vaterhauses). 
[109:11] Sein Gläubiger lege auf seinen Besitz Beschlag, / Und Fremde sollen ihm seine Habe rauben. 
[109:12] Nicht einer bewahre ihm Liebe, / Niemand erbarme sich seiner Waisen! 
[109:13] Sein Nachwuchs sei zum Vertilgen bestimmt, / Schon im andern Geschlecht erlösche sein Name! 
[109:14] Seiner Väter Schuld möge Jahwe gedenken, / Ungetilgt bleibe seiner Mutter Sünde! 
[109:15] Sondern immer seien sie Jahwe vor Augen; / Der tilg ihr Gedächtnis aus dem Lande, 
[109:16] Weil er nicht gedachte, Erbarmen zu üben, / Sondern den verfolgte, der elend und arm, / Ja den Verzagten zu morden suchte. 
[109:17] So hat er den Fluch geliebt: der treffe ihn nun! / Den Segen begehrte er nicht: der bleibe ihm fern! 
[109:18] Drum zog er den Fluch an wie sein Kleid: / Der dringe nun wie ein Wasser in ihn / Und gehe wie Öl in seine Gebeine! 
[109:19] Wie ein Kleid sei er ihm, in das er sich hüllt, / Wie ein Gurt, mit dem er sich ständig gürtet. 
[109:20] So lohne Jahwe meinen Verklägern / Und denen, die Böses wider mich reden. 
[109:21] Du aber, Jahwe Adonái, / Wirke mit mir um deines Namens willen! / Rette du mich, weil deine Huld so herrlich ist! 
[109:22] Denn ich bin elend und arm, / Und mein Herz ist in mir verwundet. 
[109:23] Wie ein Schatten, wenn er sich dehnt, so bin ich vergangen, / Gleich Heuschrecken bin ich hinweggescheucht. 
[109:24] Meine Knie schlottern vom Fasten, / Mein Fleisch ist verfallen und mager. 
[109:25] Den Leuten bin ich zum Hohn geworden, / Sie schütteln den Kopf, sooft sie mich sehn. 
[109:26] Hilf du mir, Jahwe, mein Gott, / Rette du mich nach deiner Huld! 
[109:27] Dann werden die Leute erkennen, daß dies deine Hand, / Daß du, o Jahwe, es hast getan. 
[109:28] Fluchen sie, so wollest du segnen. / Erheben sie sich, so laß sie zuschanden werden, / Während dein Knecht sich freuen darf. 
[109:29] Laß meine Verkläger sich kleiden in Schmach / Und Schande anziehn wie ein Gewand! 
[109:30] Ich will Jahwe laut danken mit meinem Munde, / Inmitten vieler ihn loben. 
[109:31] Denn er tritt dem Armen zur Rechten, / Um ihn zu retten vor denen, / Die ihn verurteilen wollen. 
[110:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Gesprochen hat Jahwe zu meinem Herrn: / Setz dich zu meiner Rechten, / bis ich deine Feinde gemacht / Zum Schemel für deine Füße. 
[110:2] Den Herrscherstab deiner Macht wird Jahwe drum / Ausstrecken von Zion her: / Herrsche nun unter deinen Feinden!" 
[110:3] Dein Volk wird auch opferwillig dir folgen / An dem Tage, da du dein Heer zum Kampfe rufst. / In heiligem Schmuck / Strömt dir deine junge Mannschaft zu / Wie Tau aus dem Schoße des Frührots. 
[110:4] Geschworen hat Jahwe, nicht wird es ihn reun: / "Du sollst ein Priester auf ewig sein / Nach Melchisedeks Weise." 
[110:5] Adonái, der dir helfend zur Rechten steht, / Wird Könige niederwerfen / Am Tage seines Zorns. 
[110:6] Er richtet einst inmitten der Völker: / Er wird von Leichen umgeben sein, / Zerschmettern wird er das Haupt über weites Land. 
[110:7] Aus dem Bache am Wege wird er trinken. / Drum hebt er (siegreich) das Haupt empor. 
[111:1] Lobet Jah! / Auf! Jahwe will ich preisen mit ganzem Herzen / Beisammen mit Redlichen und der Gemeinde. 
[111:2] Groß sind die Werke Jahwes, / Durchforschenswert für alle, die daran Gefallen finden. 
[111:3] Hoheit und Glanz offenbart sein Tun. / Währt seine Gerechtigkeit nicht ewig? 
[111:4] Seiner Wunder Gedächtnis hat er gestiftet. / Gnädig und voll Erbarmen ist Jahwe. 
[111:5] Treu hat er Speise den Seinen gegeben; / Ja, immer gedachte er seines Bunds. 
[111:6] Kraftvolle Werke tat er seinem Volke kund, / Ließ sie besitzen der Heiden Erbe. 
[111:7] Machttaten seiner Hände sind Treue und Recht, / Nimmer täuschen all seine Befehle. 
[111:8] Sie bleiben fest für immer und ewig, / Auf Treue und Geradheit sind sie gegründet. 
[111:9] Freiheit sandte er seinem Volk; / Zu seinem Bund rief er es für immer. / Kann sein Name wohl anders als heilig sein und ehrfurchtgebietend? 
[111:10] Rechter Weisheit Anfang ist Furcht vor Jahwe. / Sie, die sie üben, zeigen treffliche Einsicht, / Tragen dauerndes Lob davon. 
[112:1] Auf den kommt Heil, der Jahwe fürchtet, / Bei seinen Geboten mit Freuden beharrt. 
[112:2] Gewaltig im Lande wird sein sein Geschlecht: / Die Redlichen sollen gesegnet werden. 
[112:3] Habe in Fülle, ja Reichtum wird bergen sein Haus, / Währt seine Gerechtigkeit nicht ewig? 
[112:4] Stets strahlt den Frommen im Dunkel Licht, / Gnädig, barmherzig, gerecht ist er. 
[112:5] Trefflich der Mann, der spendet und leiht, / Ja, der seine Sache nur stützt auf Recht. 
[112:6] Kann dessen Glück wohl jemals wanken? / Lebt nicht auf immer des Gerechten Gedächtnis? 
[112:7] Mitnichten fürchtet er Unglückskunde; / Nie wankt ja sein Herz, weil er Jahwe vertraut. 
[112:8] Sicher gestützt ist sein Herz, er fürchtet sich nicht: / Auf seine Bedränger sieht er mit Ruhe. 
[112:9] Freudig und reichlich gibt er den Armen; / Zu aller Zeit steht seine Gerechtigkeit fest. / Kraftvoll wird er dastehn und geehrt. 
[112:10] Recht mit Unmut wird das der Frevler sehn, / Scheelsüchtig mit seinen Zähnen knirschend wird er vor Neid vergehn. / Traun, was die Gottlosen wünschen, erfüllt sich nimmer. 
[113:1] Lobet Jah! / Lobet, ihr Knechte Jahwes. / Lobet den Namen Jahwes! 
[113:2] Jahwes Name sei gepriesen / Von nun an bis in Ewigkeit! 
[113:3] Vom Aufgang der Sonne bis zu ihrem Niedergang / Sei Jahwes Name gelobt! 
[113:4] Erhaben über alle Völker ist Jahwe, / Über den Himmeln thront seine Herrlichkeit. 
[113:5] Wer gleicht Jahwe, unserm Gott, / Der sich die Höhe zur Wohnung bereitet, 
[113:6] Aber auch alles tief durchforscht / Im Himmel und auf Erden? 
[113:7] Er richtet den Schwachen empor aus dem Staub, / Aus dem Aschenhaufen erhebt er den Armen. 
[113:8] Dann setzt er ihn neben den Edlen, / Neben die Edlen seines Volks. 
[113:9] Der Unfruchtbaren gibt er im Haus einen festen Platz, / Daß sie sich freut als Mutter inmitten der Kinderschar. / Lobet Jah! 
[114:1] Als Israel aus Ägypten zog, / Jakobs Haus aus fremdem Volk: 
[114:2] Da ward Juda sein Heiligtum, / Israel sein Herrschaftsgebiet. 
[114:3] Das Meer sah es und floh, / Der Jordan wandte sich rückwärts. 
[114:4] Die Berge hüpften wie Widder, / Die Hügel wie junge Schafe. 
[114:5] Was war dir, o Meer, daß du flohest, / Dir, Jordan, daß du dich rückwärts wandtest? 
[114:6] Was war euch, ihr Berge, daß ihr hüpftet wie Widder, / Ihr Hügel, wie junge Schafe? 
[114:7] Vor dem Herrn erbebe, du Erde, / Vor dem Antlitz des Gottes Jakobs! 
[114:8] Er wandelte Felsen in Wasserteich, / Kieselstein in sprudelnde Quellen. 
[115:1] (Der Chor der Tempelsänger:) / Nicht uns, Jahwe, nicht uns, / Nein, deinem Namen schaff Ehre, / Ob deiner Huld, ob deiner Treu! 
[115:2] Warum sollen die Heiden sagen: / "Wo ist denn nun ihr Gott?" 
[115:3] Und doch: Unser Gott, der im Himmel thront, / Hat stets hinausgeführt, woran er Gefallen fand. 
[115:4] Aber ihre Götzen sind Silber und Gold, / Das Gebilde von Menschenhand. 
[115:5] Sie haben einen Mund und können nicht reden. / Sie haben Augen und sehen doch nicht. 
[115:6] Ohren haben sie und hören nicht, / Sie haben eine Nase und riechen nicht. 
[115:7] Ihre Hände — damit tasten sie nicht, / Ihre Füße — damit gehen sie nicht; / Nicht können sie reden mit ihrer Kehle. 
[115:8] Ihnen gleich sind, die sie bilden — / Jeder, der ihnen vertraut. 
[115:9] (Erster Priesterchor:) / Israel, trau auf Jahwe! / (Zweiter Priesterchor:) / Ihr Helfer und Schild ist er. 
[115:10] (Erster Priesterchor:) / Haus Aarons, trau auf Jahwe! / (Zweiter Priesterchor:) / Ihr Helfer und Schild ist er. 
[115:11] (Beide Priesterchöre:) / Die ihr Jahwe fürchtet, traut auch ihr Jahwe! / (Der Chor der Tempelsänger:) / Ihr Helfer und Schild ist er. 
[115:12] (Der opfernde Priester am Altar:) / Jahwe hat unser gedacht: er wird auch segnen. / Er wird segnen Israels Haus, / Er wird segnen Aarons Haus. 
[115:13] Er wird segnen, die Jahwe fürchten / Beide: Kleine und Große. 
[115:14] Jahwe wolle euch mehren, / Euch selbst und eure Kinder! 
[115:15] Gesegnet seid ihr von Jahwe, / Der Himmel und Erde geschaffen! 
[115:16] (Erster Priesterchor:) / Der Himmel ist Jahwes Himmel, / Die Erde aber hat er den Menschenkindern gegeben. 
[115:17] (Zweiter Priesterchor:) / Die Toten, sie werden Jah nicht loben, / Sie alle nicht, die in die Stille hinabgestiegen. 
[115:18] (Alle Chöre zusammen:) / Wir aber, wir preisen Jah / Von nun an bis in Ewigkeit. / Lobt Jah! 
[116:1] Jahwe hab ich lieb, / Denn er hat meine Stimme, mein Flehn erhört. 
[116:2] Ja, er hat mir sein Ohr zugeneigt; / Drum werd ich ihn auch, solang ich lebe, anrufen. 
[116:3] Mich hatten des Todes Bande umringt, / Ich fürchtete schon, ins Grab zu sinken, / Angst und Kummer erfuhr ich. 
[116:4] Da rief ich Jahwes Namen an: / "Ach, Jahwe, rette mein Leben!" 
[116:5] Jahwe war auch gnädig und treu, / Und es erbarmte sich unser Gott. 
[116:6] Schutzlose behütet Jahwe: / Drum half er mir auch, als ich elend war. 
[116:7] "Kehr nun ein, meine Seele, in deine Ruh, / Denn Jahwe hat dir wohlgetan!" 
[116:8] Ja, du hast meine Seele dem Tode entrissen, / Meinen Augen die Tränen getrocknet, / Meinen Fuß vor Gleiten bewahrt. 
[116:9] So darf ich vor Jahwe noch wandeln / In der Lebendigen Landen. 
[116:10] Ich sprach die Wahrheit, als ich sagte: / "Ich bin sehr niedergedrückt." 
[116:11] Ich habe sogar in meiner Angst gesagt: / "Alle Menschen sind Lügner." 
[116:12] Wie soll ich nun aber Jahwe vergelten / All seine Wohltaten, die ich erfahren? 
[116:13] Den Becher des Heils werd ich erheben / Und Jahwes Namen anrufen. 
[116:14] Meine Gelübde werd ich Jahwe erfüllen / Frei und offen vor all seinem Volk. 
[116:15] Selten nur läßt Jahwe / Seine Frommen (frühzeitig) sterben. 
[116:16] Ach Jahwe, (erhalte darum mein Leben auch ferner)! / Ich bin ja dein Knecht. / Ich bin dein Knecht, der Sohn deiner Magd. / Du hat meine Fesseln gelöst. 
[116:17] Dir will ich Dankopfer bringen / Und Jahwes Namen anrufen. 
[116:18] Meine Gelübde will ich Jahwe erfüllen / Frei und offen vor all seinem Volk. 
[116:19] In den Vorhöfen des Hauses Jahwes, / In der Mitte, Jerusalem! / Lobt Jah! 
[117:1] Lobt Jahwe, alle Heiden, / Preist ihn, all ihr Völker! 
[117:2] Denn seine Huld waltet mächtig über uns, / Und Jahwes Treue währt ewig! / Lobt Jah! 
[118:1] (Gesang der Festgemeinde auf dem Wege zum Tempelberg:) / (1. Chor:) / Danket Jahwe, denn er ist gütig, / (2. Chor:) / Ja, ewig währet seine Huld. 
[118:2] (1. Chor:) / Es spreche Israel: / (2. Chor:) / "Ja, ewig währet seine Huld." 
[118:3] (1. Chor:) / Es spreche Aarons Haus: / (2. Chor:) / "Ja, ewig währet seine Huld." 
[118:4] (1. Chor:) / Es mögen alle sprechen, die Jahwe fürchten: / (2. Chor:) / "Ja, ewig währet seine Huld." 
[118:5] (Der Chorführer allein im Namen der ganzen Festgemeinde:) / Als ich aus der Bedrängnis Jahwe anrief, / Da erhörte mich Jah und machte mich frei. 
[118:6] Ist Jahwe mit mir, so fürchte ich nichts: / Was können mir Menschen tun? 
[118:7] Tritt Jahwe für mich als Helfer auf, / So schau ich siegreich auf meine Hasser. 
[118:8] (Eine Einzelstimme des Festchors:) / Es ist besser, bei Jahwe Zuflucht zu suchen / (Der ganze Chor:) / Als zu vertrauen auf Menschen. 
[118:9] (Eine Einzelstimme des Festchors:) / Es ist besser, bei Jahwe Zuflucht zu suchen / (Der ganze Chor:) / Als zu vertrauen auf Fürsten. 
[118:10] (Der siegreiche Feldherr allein:) / Es haben mich alle Heiden umringt, / Doch in Jahwes Namen zerhieb ich sie. 
[118:11] Sie haben mich umringt, ja immer wieder umringt; / Doch in Jahwes Namen zerhieb ich sie. 
[118:12] Sie haben mich sogar wie Bienen umringt, / Doch wie ein Dornenfeuer sind sie erloschen: / In Jahwes Namen zerhieb ich sie. 
[118:13] Man hat mich zwar heftig gestoßen, damit ich käme zu Fall, / Doch Jahwe hat mir geholfen. 
[118:14] Mein Sieg und mein Sang war Jah, / Er ward meine Rettung. 
[118:15] (Eine Einzelstimme des Festchors:) / Ein Jubel- und Siegesruf schallt in den Zelten der Frommen: / (Der ganze Festchor:) / "Jahwes Rechte tut mächtige Taten. 
[118:16] Jahwes Recht ist hoch erhoben, / Jahwes Rechte tut mächtige Taten." 
[118:17] (Eine Einzelstimme des Festchors:) / Ich werde nicht sterben, sondern leben / Und verkünden die Werke Jahs. 
[118:18] (Der siegreiche Feldherr allein nach der Ankunft des Festzuges vor den Tempeltoren:) / Hart zwar hat Jah mich gezüchtigt, / Aber dem Tod mich nicht preisgegeben. 
[118:19] Tut mir die Tore auf, durch die nur Gerechte ziehn; / Eingehn will ich in sie, ich will Jah danken! 
[118:20] Dies ist das Tor, das zu Jahwe führt: / Gerechte dürfen hier eingehn. 
[118:21] (Der siegreiche Feldherr allein:) / Dir dank ich, daß du mich erhört / Und mir Errettung gebracht hast. 
[118:22] (Der Chor der Priester vom Tempel aus:) / Der Stein, den die Bauleute verworfen haben, / Der ist zum Eckstein geworden. 
[118:23] (Der ganze Festchor:) / Von Jahwe ist dies geschehn: / Wunderbar ist es in unsern Augen. 
[118:24] (Der Chor der Priester:) / Dies ist der Tag, den Jahwe gemacht. / Laßt uns jubeln und sein uns freun! 
[118:25] (Der ganze Festchor:) / Ach, Jahwe, gewähre doch Hilfe! / Ach, Jahwe, gib doch Gedeihn! 
[118:26] (Der Chor der Priester antwortet darauf:) / Gesegnet sei er, der da kommt, mit Jahwes Namen! / Wir haben euch gesegnet von Jahwes Tempel aus. 
[118:27] (Der ganze Festchor:) / Ein starker Gott ist Jahwe: er hat uns Licht gespendet. / (Der Chor der Priester:) / Bindet die Opfertiere so zahlreich an mit Stricken, / (Daß sie den Vorhof füllen) / Bis an die Hörner des Altars! 
[118:28] (Der siegreiche Feldherr allein:) / Mein starker Gott bist du: ich will dir danken. / Du bist mein Gott: dich will ich rühmen. 
[118:29] (Der ganze Festchor und der Chor der Priester, also die ganze Festversammlung mit einem Munde:) / Danket Jahwe, denn er ist gütig; / Ja, ewig währet seine Huld! 
[119:1] Alle sind glücklich zu preisen, die da untadelig wandeln, / Die einhergehn nach Jahwes Gesetz. 
[119:2] Alle sind glücklich zu preisen, die seine Zeugnisse halten, / Die ihn suchen von ganzem Herzen. 
[119:3] Auch keine Frevel verüben, / Sondern in seinen Wegen gehn. 
[119:4] Aufgestellt hast du deine Befehle, / Daß man sie treu erfüllen soll. 
[119:5] Ach, stünde doch mein Wandel fest, / Indem ich deine Gesetze hielte! 
[119:6] Alsdann werd ich nicht zuschanden, / Wenn ich auf all deine Gebote blicke. 
[119:7] Aufrichtigen Herzens dank ich dir, / Wenn ich deine gerechten Befehle lerne. 
[119:8] Auf deine Satzungen achte ich: / Verlaß mich nicht völlig! 
[119:9] Bei einem Jüngling bleibt sein Wandel rein, / Wenn er ihn führt nach deinem Wort. 
[119:10] Begehrt hab ich dein Wort von ganzem Herzen, / Laß mich nicht irren von deinen Geboten! 
[119:11] Bewahret hab ich dein Wort in meinem Herzen, / Damit ich nicht sündige wider dich. 
[119:12] Besungen mit Lobpreis seiest du, Jahwe, / Lehre mich deine Satzungen! 
[119:13] Bekundet hab ich mit meinen Lippen / Alle Ordnungen deines Mundes. 
[119:14] Betracht ich den Wandel, den deine Zeugnisse fordern, / So freu ich mich stets wie über allerlei Reichtum. 
[119:15] Bei deinen Befehlen soll mein Sinnen verweilen, / Und blicken will ich auf deine Pfade. 
[119:16] Bei deinen Satzungen will ich mich ergötzen, / Will nicht vergessen deine Worte. 
[119:17] Gewähre deinem Knechte Gutes, daß ich leben bleibe, / So will ich deine Worte halten. 
[119:18] Gib mir offne Augen, / Damit ich erkenne die Wunder in deinem Gesetz. 
[119:19] Gast nur bin ich auf Erden: / Verbirg vor mir nicht deine Gebote! 
[119:20] Ganz verzehrt hat sich meine Seele vor Sehnsucht / Nach deinen Rechten zu jeder Zeit. 
[119:21] Gescholten hast du Frevelhafte. / Fluch treff alle, die deine Gebote verlassen! 
[119:22] Gespött und Schande, die ich erfahre, nimm weg! / Denn deine Zeugnisse halte ich. 
[119:23] Gingen auch Fürsten wider mich an mit feindlicher Rede: / Dein Knecht sinnt doch über deine Satzungen nach. 
[119:24] Gar meine Lust sind deine Zeugnisse, / Sie sind meine Berater. 
[119:25] Dem Staub klebt meine Seele an; / Belebe mich wieder nach deinem Wort! 
[119:26] Dir hab ich mein Los geschildert: da erhörtest du mich. / Lehre mich deine Satzungen! 
[119:27] Den Weg, den deine Befehle gebieten, laß mich verstehn! / Denn über deine Wunder will ich sinnen. 
[119:28] Durch Kummer zerfließt meine Seele: / Richte mich auf nach deinen Verheißungsworten! 
[119:29] Den Weg der Lüge halte mir fern, / Begnade mich aber mit deiner Lehre! 
[119:30] Den Weg der Treue hab ich erwählt, / Deine Rechte mir vorgesetzt. 
[119:31] Deine Zeugnisse, Jahwe, halt ich fest; / Laß mich nicht zuschanden werden! 
[119:32] Den Weg, den deine Gebote weisen, will ich laufen, / Denn du erfüllst mich mit Einsicht. 
[119:33] Helle mir auf, o Jahwe, deiner Satzungen Weg, / Damit ich ihn immer beachte! 
[119:34] Hilf mir zur rechten Erkenntnis, daß ich deine Lehre bewahre / Und sie von ganzem Herzen befolge! 
[119:35] Hinführen wollest du mich auf deiner Gebote Pfad, / Denn ich habe Gefallen daran. 
[119:36] Hinlenken wollest du mein Herz zu deinen Gesetzen / Und nicht zu ungerechtem Gewinn. 
[119:37] Hinweg zieh meine Augen, daß sie nicht nach dem Eitlen schaun, / Auf deinen Wegen belebe mich! 
[119:38] Halt deinem Knechte deine Verheißung, / Damit ich wachse in Ehrfurcht vor dir! 
[119:39] Halt fern von mir die Schmach, vor der mir graut! / Denn deine Urteilssprüche sind gut. 
[119:40] Hat mich nicht stets verlangt nach deinen Befehlen? / Durch deine Gerechtigkeit belebe mich! 
[119:41] Und laß, o Jahwe, deine Huld mich reich erfahren. / Dein Heil nach deiner Verheißung! 
[119:42] Und dann will ich auch Rede stehn dem, der mich lästert; / Denn ich vertraue auf dein Wort. 
[119:43] Und entzieh doch meinem Munde das Wort der Wahrheit nicht, / Denn auf deine Rechte hoffe ich. 
[119:44] Und deine Weisung will ich stets beachten, / Immer und ewiglich. 
[119:45] Und so werd ich dann auch getrost und unbefangen wandeln, / Denn in deinen Geboten hab ich Rat gesucht. 
[119:46] Und von deinen Zeugnissen will ich reden vor Königen / Furchtlos und ohne Scheu. 
[119:47] Und ich erfreue mich an deinen Geboten, / Die ich liebgewonnen habe. 
[119:48] Und ich will meine Hände erheben zu deinen Geboten, (die ich liebgewonnen habe,) / Nachsinnen will ich über deine Satzungen. 
[119:49] Sei eingedenk des Worts, das du zu deinem Knecht geredet, / Weil du (auf einen guten Ausgang) mich hast hoffen lassen. 
[119:50] So fand ich Trost in meinem Elend, (als ich inneward) / Daß dein Verheißungswort mich neubelebte. 
[119:51] Stolze haben mich gar sehr verspottet, / Dennoch bin ich von deinem Gesetz nicht abgewichen. 
[119:52] Sooft ich daran denke, wie du von altersher gerichtet hast, / Werd ich, o Jahwe, auch getröstet. 
[119:53] Starker Zorn hat mich erfaßt den Frevlern gegenüber, / Die dein Gesetz verlassen haben. 
[119:54] Siegeslieder sind mir deine Satzungen / Im Hause meiner Fremdlingschaft. 
[119:55] Sogar des Nachts hab ich gedacht, o Jahwe, deines Namens, / Und darum hab ich deine Weisung auch befolgt. 
[119:56] Solches ist mir zuteil geworden: / Daß ich deine Befehle halte. 
[119:57] Geschenkt — so habe ich gesagt — ist mir, o Jahwe, deine Gnade, / Daß ich deine Worte befolgen darf. 
[119:58] Gesucht hab ich von ganzem Herzen deine Huld: / Sei mir denn gnädig nach deiner Verheißung! 
[119:59] Gedacht hab ich an meine Wege / Und habe meine Füße dann gelenkt zu deinen Zeugnissen. 
[119:60] Geeilt bin ich dabei und habe nicht gezaudert, / Deine Gebote zu halten. 
[119:61] Gottlose haben mich mit Stricken umringt: / Aber dein Gesetz hab ich nicht vergessen. 
[119:62] Gegen Mitternacht steh ich auf, um dir zu danken / Für deine gerechten Gerichtsurteile. 
[119:63] Genosse bin ich allen, die dich fürchten / Und deine Befehle befolgen. 
[119:64] Gefüllt mit deiner Güte, Jahwe, ist die Erde: / Lehre mich nun deine Satzungen! 
[119:65] Tröstliches hast du deinem Knechte erwiesen, / Jahwe, nach deinen Worten. 
[119:66] Treffliche Klugheit und Einsicht lehre mich! / Denn deinen Geboten vertrau ich. 
[119:67] Trugwege bin ich gewandelt, eh ich ins Elend geriet; / Nun aber acht ich auf dein Gebot. 
[119:68] Treusorgend bist du und voller Güte: / Lehre mich deine Satzungen! 
[119:69] Trugvoll haben Frevler mir Lügen angedichtet: / Ich aber halte dennoch mit ganzem Herzen deine Befehle. 
[119:70] Töricht und fühllos ist ihr Herz; / Doch mein Entzücken ist dein Gesetz. 
[119:71] Traun, heilsam war mir des Leidens Schule, / Damit ich deine Satzungen lernte. 
[119:72] Teurer ist mir deines Mundes Gesetz / Als reiche Schätze an Silber und Gold. 
[119:73] Ja, deine Hände haben mich geschaffen und bereitet: / Gib mir nun auch Einsicht, daß ich deine Gebote lerne! 
[119:74] Jeder, der dich fürchtet, wird freudig auf mich blicken; / Denn ich habe darauf geharrt, daß sich dein Verheißungswort erfülle. 
[119:75] Ich weiß, o Jahwe: gerecht sind deine Gerichte, / Und weil du es treu mit mir meinst, hast du mich in Trübsal geführt. 
[119:76] In deiner Gnade laß mich nun aber auch Trost erfahren, / Wie du es deinem Knechte verheißen! 
[119:77] In dein Erbarmen hülle mich ein, damit ich lebe! / Denn dein Gesetz ist meine Lust. 
[119:78] In Schande laß fallen die Frevelhaften, weil sie mich mit Lügen ins Elend gebracht! / Ich aber will über deine Befehle sinnen. 
[119:79] Ja, mögen sich zu mir wenden, die dich fürchten / Und die deine Zeugnisse anerkennen! 
[119:80] In deinen Satzungen soll mein Herz beständig leben, / Damit ich nicht zuschanden werde. 
[119:81] Klagend hat meine Seele nach deiner Hilfe geschmachtet: / Auf dein Wort hab ich geharrt. 
[119:82] Konnten nicht meine Augen vergehn, als ich nach deinem Wort ausschaute / Und (ängstlich) fragte: "Wann wirst du mich trösten?" 
[119:83] Kann man auch von mir sagen: / "Der ist wie ein Schlauch im Rauch" — / Deine Satzungen hab ich doch nimmer vergessen. 
[119:84] Kurz sind die Lebenstage deines Knechts. / Wann wirst du nun das Gericht vollstrecken an meinen Verfolgern? 
[119:85] Kerkergruben haben mir Gottvergeßne gegraben, / Sie, die nicht handeln nach deinem Gesetz. 
[119:86] Können doch all deine Gebote nichts als ein Ausfluß deiner Treue sein! / Sie aber haben mich mit Lügen verfolgt: hilf du mir! 
[119:87] Kümmerlich hätten sie mich beinah in der Grube sterben lassen, / Aber trotzdem hab ich deine Befehle nicht verlassen. 
[119:88] Könnt ich doch wieder aufleben durch deine Güte! / Dann will ich auch das Zeugnis deines Mundes halten. 
[119:89] Lebt, o Jahwe, nicht in Ewigkeit / Dein Wort im Himmel fort? 
[119:90] Lang bis ins fernste Geschlecht währt deine Treu; / Du hast die Erde gegründet, und sie bleibt. 
[119:91] Laut deiner Ordnung stehn sie noch heute; / Denn alles ist dir untertan. 
[119:92] Ließe mich dein Gesetz nicht immer wieder Freude empfinden: / Ich wäre vergangen in meinem Elend. 
[119:93] Lebenslang werd ich deine Befehle nicht vergessen, / Denn durch sie hast du mich im Dasein erhalten. 
[119:94] Liebend bin ich dein: drum rette mich! / Deine Befehle suche ich ja. 
[119:95] Listig haben mir Frevler nachgestellt, um mich zu töten; / Dennoch werd ich auf deine Zeugnisse merken. 
[119:96] Läßt sich auch sehn, daß alles Vollkommne begrenzt ist: / Dein Gebot reicht über die Maßen weit. 
[119:97] Mit ganzer Seele lieb ich dein Gesetz; / Den ganzen Tag sinn ich darüber nach. 
[119:98] Mich werden deine Gebote weiser machen, als meine Feinde sind; / Denn sie sind mein für immer. 
[119:99] Meine Lehrer alle übertreffe ich an Einsicht, / Denn über deine Zeugnisse sinne ich. 
[119:100] Mehr als Alte werd ich mir Verstand erwerben, / Wenn ich deinen Befehlen folge. 
[119:101] Mit allen bösen Pfaden haben meine Füße nichts gemein, / Damit ich deine Gebote mit der Tat erfülle. 
[119:102] Mitnichten bin ich von deinen Rechten gewichen; / Du hast mich ja belehrt. 
[119:103] Meinem Geschmack sind deine Worte lieber / Als Honig meinem Mund. 
[119:104] Mit Einsicht erfüllen mich deine Befehle; / Drum haß ich jeden Lügenpfad. 
[119:105] Nur dein Wort ist eine Leuchte meinem Fuß / Und ein Licht für meinen Weg. 
[119:106] Nimmer werd ich brechen, was ich eidlich gelobt: / "Deine gerechten Vorschriften will ich befolgen." 
[119:107] Niedergebeugt bin ich gar sehr; / Jahwe, belebe mich wieder nach deinem Wort! 
[119:108] Nimm wohlgefällig an, o Jahwe, die willigen Opfer meines Mundes / Und lehre mich deine Gebote! 
[119:109] Nicht einen Augenblick bin ich des Lebens sicher: / Dennoch hab ich dein Gesetz nicht vergessen. 
[119:110] Nichtswürdige haben mir Schlingen gelegt; / Aber von deinen Befehlen bin ich nicht abgeirrt. 
[119:111] Nie werd ich deine Zeugnisse fahren lassen, / Denn sie sind meines Herzens Wonne. 
[119:112] Neigen lassen hab ich mein Herz, deine Satzungen zu erfüllen: / Das bringt ewigen Lohn. 
[119:113] Solche, die sich absondern, hasse ich; / Doch dein Gesetz hab ich lieb. 
[119:114] Sichrer Schutz und Schild bist du für mich; / Auf dein Wort hab ich geharrt. 
[119:115] Sondert euch ab von mir, ihr Übeltäter, / Damit ich meines Gottes Gebote halte! 
[119:116] Sei du meine Stütze nach deiner Verheißung, damit ich am Leben bleibe, / Und laß mich nicht zuschanden werden mit meiner Hoffnung! 
[119:117] Sei du mein sichrer Halt, damit ich gerettet werde! / Dann will ich stets mit Vertraun auf deine Satzungen schaun. 
[119:118] Sie, die von deinen Satzungen irren, hast du immer verworfen; / Denn nichts als Lüge ist ihr verführerisch Tun. 
[119:119] So wie Schlacken hast du alle Frevler des Landes hinweggeräumt; / Drum lieb ich deine Zeugnisse. 
[119:120] Sieh, ich schaudre in Angst vor dir; / Denn vor deinen Gerichten fürcht ich mich. 
[119:121] Ausgeübt hab ich Recht und Gerechtigkeit: / So gib mich denn nicht meinen Drängern preis! 
[119:122] Auf deines Knechtes Wohl sei du bedacht, / Daß Frevler mich nicht vergewaltigen! 
[119:123] Ausgeschaut hab ich voll Sehnsucht, daß mir Hilfe komme / Und deine Verheißung sich erfülle. 
[119:124] An deinem Knechte handle du nach deiner Huld / Und lehre mich deine Satzungen! 
[119:125] Ach, sieh, ich bin dein Knecht: unterweise mich, / Daß ich deine Zeugnisse erkenne! 
[119:126] An der Zeit ist's für Jahwe, zu handeln: / Sie haben ja dein Gesetz gebrochen. 
[119:127] Aus diesem Grunde lieb ich deine Gebote / Mehr als Gold und gediegen Gold. 
[119:128] Aus diesem Grunde hab ich auch stets all deine Befehle aufrechtgehalten / Und jeglichen Lügenpfad gehaßt. 
[119:129] Fürwahr, deine Zeugnisse sind wunderbar; / Darum bewahrt sie auch meine Seele. 
[119:130] Führst du in deine Gebote ein, so wird es licht: / Einfältige werden verständig. 
[119:131] Frei hab ich meinen Mund geöffnet voll Verlangen; / Denn nach deinen Geboten sehnte ich mich. 
[119:132] Führ mir deine Gnade zu: / Das dürfen ja auch erwarten, die deinen Namen lieben. 
[119:133] Fest mach meine Schritte durch dein Wort / Und laß mich nichts Böses beherrschen! 
[119:134] Frei laß mich sein von der Menschen Druck, / Damit ich deine Befehle erfülle! 
[119:135] Für deinen Knecht laß du dein Antlitz leuchten / Und lehre mich deine Satzungen! 
[119:136] Flossen nicht aus meinen Augen Wasserbäche / Über die, die dein Gesetz nicht halten? 
[119:137] Zeigst du nicht, Jahwe, dich gerecht? / Drum ist auch all dein Walten richtig. 
[119:138] Zugeteilt hast du deine Zeugnisse / In Treue und großer Wahrhaftigkeit. 
[119:139] Zehrender Eifer hat mich vernichtet; / Denn meine Feinde haben deine Worte vergessen. 
[119:140] Zerschmolzen gleichsam in Feuer, ganz echt und bewährt ist dein Wort, / Und dein Knecht hat es lieb. 
[119:141] Zwar bin ich jung und verachtet; / Doch deine Befehle hab ich nicht vergessen. 
[119:142] Zuverlässig gerecht bleibt deine Gerechtigkeit auf ewig, / Und dein Gesetz bleibt Wahrheit. 
[119:143] Zwang und Drangsal haben mich getroffen; / Doch deine Gebote sind meine Lust. 
[119:144] Zu aller Zeit sind deine Zeugnisse gerecht: / Laß mich sie verstehn, damit ich lebe! 
[119:145] Kraftvoll hab ich dich angerufen: / "Erhöre mich, Jahwe, deine Satzungen will ich halten!" 
[119:146] Komm mir zu Hilfe, wenn ich dich rufe: / So will ich auf deine Zeugnisse achten. 
[119:147] Kaum graute der Morgen, da flehte ich schon: / "Ich habe geharrt, daß du dein Wort erfüllest." 
[119:148] Konnte doch keine Nachtwache beginnen, ohne daß ich meine Augen schon offen hatte, / Um nachzusinnen über dein Wort. 
[119:149] Klagend ruf ich: hör mich in deiner Huld! / Nach deiner Treue, o Jahwe, belebe mich wieder! 
[119:150] Kommen mir nahe, die Schandtaten verüben wollen, / Menschen, die fern sind von deinem Gesetz: 
[119:151] Kommst du mir auch nahe, o Jahwe — / All deine Gebote aber sind Wahrheit. 
[119:152] Kann ich doch längst schon aus deinen Zeugnissen sehn, / Daß du sie für immer verordnet hast. 
[119:153] Richte den Blick auf mein Elend und reiß mich heraus, / Denn dein Gesetz hab ich nimmer vergessen. 
[119:154] Recht schaffe du mir und erlöse mich, / Nach deiner Verheißung belebe mich wieder! 
[119:155] Rettung bleibt den Frevlern fern, / Denn deine Satzungen haben sie nicht gesucht. 
[119:156] Reich, o Jahwe, ist dein Erbarmen; / Nach deinem Urteil belebe mich wieder! 
[119:157] Reichlich bin ich verfolgt und bedrängt, / Aber doch nicht gewichen von deinen Geboten. 
[119:158] Recht von Ekel ward ich erfaßt, wenn ich Treulose sah, / Weil sie dein Wort nicht hielten. 
[119:159] Rechne mir zu, daß ich deine Befehle liebe; / Jahwe, belebe mich wieder nach deiner Huld! 
[119:160] Richtig ist's: deines Wortes Inhalt ist Wahrheit, / Und ewig währt all dein gerechtes Walten. 
[119:161] Sonder Ursach haben mich Fürsten verfolgt, / Doch nur vor deinem Worte hat mein Herz gezittert. 
[119:162] So froh bin ich ob deiner Verheißung / Wie einer, der viel Beute findet. 
[119:163] Schändliche Lüge hab ich stets gehaßt und verabscheut, / Dein Gesetz aber hab ich lieb. 
[119:164] Siebenmal täglich hab ich dich stets gepriesen / Ob deiner gerechten Gerichtsurteile. 
[119:165] Schönen Frieden genießen alle, die deine Lehre lieben, / Und sie straucheln nimmer. 
[119:166] Sehnend hab ich, Jahwe, deiner Hilfe geharrt, / Und deine Gebote erfülle ich stets. 
[119:167] Scheu befolg ich deine Befehle, / Und ich liebe sie sehr. 
[119:168] Scheu halt ich stets deine Ordnungen und Befehle, / Weil du ja all meine Wege kennst. 
[119:169] Tu auf meinem Ruf den Weg zu dir, o Jahwe, / In deinem Wort mach mich verständig! 
[119:170] Tu auf meinem innigen Flehn den Weg zu dir, / Nach deiner Verheißung rette mich! 
[119:171] Triefen sollen meine Lippen von Lobgesang, / Wenn du mich deine Satzungen lehrst. 
[119:172] Tönen soll von meiner Zunge das Loblied auf deine Verheißung; / Denn deine Gebote sind alle gerecht. 
[119:173] Tritt du mir als Helfer zur Seite! / Denn deine Befehle hab ich zu Führern erkoren. 
[119:174] Tiefes Sehnen nach deinem Heil erfüllt mich, o Jahwe, / Und dein Gesetz ist meine Lust. 
[119:175] Teile mir Leben zu, damit ich dich lobe! / Und deine Rechte mögen mir helfen. 
[119:176] Tret ich auf einen Irrweg wie ein verloren Schaf, / Dann suche du deinen Knecht; denn deine Gebote vergesse ich nicht. 
[120:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Zu Jahwe hab ich gerufen in meiner Not, / Und er hat mich erhört. 
[120:2] Jahwe, so rette mich auch jetzt von der Lügenlippe, / Von arglistiger Zunge! 
[120:3] Was wird er dir geben, was dir zufügen, / Du arglistige Zunge? 
[120:4] Scharfe Pfeile eines Starken / Mit glühenden Kohlen aus Ginstersträuchern. 
[120:5] Weh mir, daß ich ein Fremdling bin in Meschech, / Bei Kedars Zelten wohnen muß! 
[120:6] Zu lange schon hab ich weilen müssen / Bei denen, die Frieden hassen. 
[120:7] Ich will Frieden; doch wenn ich nur rede, / So beginnen sie Krieg. 
[121:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Ich hebe meine Augen zu den Bergen: / Woher wird mir Hilfe kommen? 
[121:2] Meine Hilfe kommt von Jahwe, / Der Himmel und Erde geschaffen hat. 
[121:3] Wird er deinen Fuß wohl wanken lassen? / Wird etwa dein Hüter schlummern? 
[121:4] Sieh, nicht wird schlummern oder gar schlafen / Israels Hüter. 
[121:5] Jahwe ist dein Hüter, / Jahwe ist dein Schatten über deiner rechten Hand. 
[121:6] Tagsüber wird dich die Sonne nicht stechen / Und der Mond nicht des Nachts. 
[121:7] Jahwe wird dich behüten vor allem Übel, / Er wird deine Seele behüten. 
[121:8] Jahwe wird deinen Ausgang und Eingang behüten / Von nun an bis in Ewigkeit. 
[122:1] Ein Stufenlied von David. / Ich hab mich gefreut über die, die zu mir sagten: / "Zu Jahwes Hause wollen wir wallen." 
[122:2] Dann standen endlich unsre Füße / In deinen Toren, Jerusalem. 
[122:3] Jerusalem, du wiedererbaute, / Als eine Stadt, die eng in sich verbunden! 
[122:4] Dorthin zogen die Stämme hinauf, / Die Stämme Jahs — / Wie es Israel vorgeschrieben —, / Um Jahwes Namen zu preisen. 
[122:5] Dort standen einst die Stühle für die Gerichtsverhandlung, / Stühle für Davids Haus. 
[122:6] Erbittet Jerusalem Frieden! / Wohl geh es denen, die dich lieben! 
[122:7] Friede walte in deinen Mauern, / Sicherheit in deinen Palästen! 
[122:8] Um meiner Brüder und Freunde willen / Will ich doch sagen: "Friede walte in dir!" 
[122:9] Aus Liebe zum Hause Jahwes, unsers Gottes, / Will ich dein Bestes suchen. 
[123:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Zu dir hab ich meine Augen erhoben, / Der du im Himmel thronst. 
[123:2] Sieh, wie die Augen der Knechte auf die Hand ihres Herrn, / Wie die Augen der Magd auf ihrer Gebieterin Hand: / So schaun unsre Augen auf Jahwe, unsern Gott, / Bis er sich uns gnädig erzeigt. 
[123:3] Sei uns gnädig, o Jahwe, sei uns gnädig, / Denn wir sind reichlich mit Schmähung gesättigt! 
[123:4] Reichlich hat unsre Seele satt / Den Hohn der Sichern, die Schmähung der Stolzen. 
[124:1] Ein Stufenlied von David. / "Wäre Jahwe nicht für uns gewesen", / So möge Israel sprechen, 
[124:2] "Wäre Jahwe nicht für uns gewesen, / Als Menschen sich wider uns stellten, 
[124:3] Dann hätten sie uns lebendig verschlungen, / Als ihr Zorn gegen uns entflammte; 
[124:4] Dann hätten die Wasser uns überflutet, / Ein Strom wäre über uns hingerauscht; 
[124:5] Dann wären über uns hingerauscht / Die wildbrausenden Wasser." 
[124:6] Gepriesen sei Jahwe, der uns nicht hingegeben / Ihren Zähnen als einen Raub! 
[124:7] Unsre Seele gleicht einem Vöglein, / Das des Voglers Netz entronnen. / Das Netz ist zerrissen, und wir sind frei! 
[124:8] Unsre Hilfe liegt im Namen Jahwes, / Der Himmel und Erde geschaffen hat. 
[125:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Die auf Jahwe vertraun, die gleichen dem Zionsberg, / Der nicht wankt, der in Ewigkeit bleibt. 
[125:2] Rings um Jerusalem her sind Berge. / So ist Jahwe rings um sein Volk / Von nun an bis in Ewigkeit. 
[125:3] Denn des Frevlers Zepter soll nicht bleiben / Auf der Gerechten Erbe, / Damit nicht etwa die Gerechten / Zum Frevel ausstrecken ihre Hände. 
[125:4] Tu wohl, o Jahwe, den Guten / Und denen, die redlichen Herzens sind! 
[125:5] Die aber auf ihre krummen Pfade abbiegen, / Die lasse Jahwe hinfahren samt den Übeltätern! / Friede sei über Israel! 
[126:1] Als Jahwe Zions Wandrer in die Heimat führte, / Waren wir wie Träumende. 
[126:2] Damals war unser Mund voll Lachens / Und unsre Zunge voll Jubels. / Damals sagte man unter den Heiden: / "Großes hat Jahwe an ihnen getan!" 
[126:3] Ja, Großes hat Jahwe an uns getan: / Darüber waren wir fröhlich. 
[126:4] Wende nun, Jahwe, auch unser Geschick / Gleich Regenbächen im Mittagsland. 
[126:5] Die mit Tränen säen, / Werden mit Jubel ernten. 
[126:6] Wohl geht man jetzt mit Weinen dahin, / Indem man den Samen zur Aussaat trägt. / Aber man kommt mit Jubel an, / Indem man trägt seine Garben. 
[127:1] Ein Stufenlied von Salomo. / Wenn Jahwe das Haus nicht baut, / So mühen sich vergeblich ab, die daran bauen. / Wenn Jahwe die Stadt nicht behütet, / So wachen die Wächter vergeblich. 
[127:2] Vergeblich ist's, daß ihr früh aufsteht / Und spät bei der Arbeit sitzt, / Die ihr esset mühsam erworbnes Brot. / Seinen Freunden gibt er genug im Schlaf. 
[127:3] Sieh, Jahwes Gabe sind Kinder, / Lohn ist Leibesfrucht. 
[127:4] Wie Pfeile in eines Helden Hand, / So sind die Kinder der Jugend. 
[127:5] Heil dem Manne, / Des Köcher mit ihnen gefüllt ist! / Sie werden nicht zuschanden, / Wenn sie mit Feinden reden im Tor. 
[128:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Heil dem, der Jahwe fürchtet, / Der da wandelt auf seinen Wegen! 
[128:2] Deiner Hände Erwerb — fürwahr, du wirst ihn genießen: / Heil dir! es wird dir wohl ergehn. 
[128:3] Dein Weib wird sein wie ein fruchtbarer Weinstock / Drinnen in deinem Hause; / Deine Kinder sind wie Ölbaumpflänzchen / Rings um deinen Tisch. 
[128:4] Ja wahrlich, so wird gesegnet der Mann, / Der Jahwe fürchtet. 
[128:5] Es segne dich Jahwe von Zion her, / Daß du schauest Jerusalems Glück / Dein ganzes Leben lang, 
[128:6] Und schauest Kindeskinder! / Friede sei über Israel! 
[129:1] Ein Stufenlied. / "Oft haben sie mich bedrängt von meiner Jugend an", / So möge Israel sprechen, 
[129:2] "Oft haben sie mich bedrängt von meiner Jugend an, / Doch sie haben mich nicht überwältigt. 
[129:3] Auf meinem Rücken haben Pflüger gepflügt / Und ihre Furchen lang gezogen. 
[129:4] Doch Jahwe, der Gerechte, / Er hat zerhaun der Frevler Strick." 
[129:5] Zuschanden werden und rückwärtsweichen / Sollen alle, die Zion hassen. 
[129:6] Sie sollen dem Gras auf den Dächern gleichen: / Das ist schon dürr, noch ehe man's ausrauft. 
[129:7] Damit füllt der Schnitter nicht seine Hand / Noch seinen Arm der Garbenbinder. 
[129:8] Die vorübergehen sagen auch nicht: / "Jahwes Segen sei über euch!" / Wir aber haben euch in Jahwes Namen gesegnet. 
[130:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Aus Tiefen hab ich, Jahwe, zu dir gerufen. 
[130:2] Adonái, hör meine Stimme! / Laß doch deine Ohren merken / Auf mein lautes Flehn! 
[130:3] Wenn du Sünden anrechnest, Jah, / Adonái, wer kann dann bestehn? 
[130:4] Ja, du vergibst, / Damit man dich fürchte. 
[130:5] Jahwes habe ich stets geharrt; / Es hat meine Seele geharrt, / Schon immer hoffte ich auf sein Wort. 
[130:6] Meine Seele harrt Adonáis, / Mehr, als Wächter des Morgens harren, / Ja, Wächter des Morgens. 
[130:7] Israel, harr auf Jahwe! / Denn bei Jahwe ist die Gnade, / Und reichlich ist bei ihm Erlösung. 
[130:8] Ja, er wird Israel erlösen / Von allen seinen Sünden. 
[131:1] Ein Stufenlied von David. / Jahwe, mein Herz ist nicht hochmütig, / Und meine Augen erheben sich nicht stolz. / Auch geh ich nicht um mit Dingen, / Die zu groß und schwer für mich sind. 
[131:2] Ich habe vielmehr meine Seele gestillt und beruhigt. / Wie ein entwöhntes Kind an der Brust seiner Mutter liegt, / So ruht meine Seele entwöhnt in mir. 
[131:3] Israel, harre auf Jahwe / Von nun an bis in Ewigkeit! 
[132:1] Ein Stufenlied. / Gedenke, Jahwe, dem David / All die Opfer, die er gebracht. 
[132:2] Er leistete Jahwe einen Schwur, / Gelobte dem starken Gott Jakobs: 
[132:3] "Wahrlich, nicht geh ich ins Zelt meines Hauses, / Nicht besteig ich das Bett meines Lagers, 
[132:4] Nicht gönne ich Schlaf meinen Augen / Noch meinen Wimpern Schlummer: 
[132:5] Bis ich eine Stätte für Jahwe gefunden, / Eine Wohnung für Jakobs starken Gott." 
[132:6] Sieh, wir hörten, sie sei in Efrâta, / Wir haben sie dann in Jaars Gefilden gefunden. 
[132:7] So laßt uns denn in seine Wohnung gehn, / Uns niederwerfen vor seiner Füße Schemel. 
[132:8] Auf, Jahwe, begib dich zu deiner Ruhstatt, / Du und die Lade, das Bild deiner Macht! 
[132:9] Deine Priester werden dir dienen in Treue, / Und deine Frommen werden sich freun. 
[132:10] Um Davids, deines Knechtes, willen / Versage nicht deines Gesalbten Bitte! 
[132:11] Jahwe hat David geschworen / — Wahr ist's, nicht nimmt er's zurück —: / Von der Frucht deines Leibes / Will ich einen Mann auf den Thron dir setzen. 
[132:12] Halten deine Söhne den Bund mit mir / Und mein Zeugnis, das ich sie lehre: / So sollen auch ihre Söhne für immer / Dir auf dem Throne sitzen." 
[132:13] Denn Jahwe hat Zion erwählt, / Hat es zu seinem Wohnsitz begehrt: 
[132:14] "Dies ist meine Ruhstatt für immer; / Hier will ich bleiben, weil ich es begehrt. 
[132:15] Seine Nahrung will ich reichlich segnen, / Seine Armen sättigen mit Brot. 
[132:16] Seine Priester will ich kleiden in Heil, / Und seine Frommen sollen laut jauchzen. 
[132:17] Dort laß ich ein Horn für David sprossen: / Meinem Gesalbten hab ich eine Leuchte bereitet. 
[132:18] Seine Feinde will ich in Schande kleiden, / Aber auf ihm soll glänzen seine Krone." 
[133:1] Ein Stufenlied von David. / Sieh, wie schön und wie lieblich ist's, / Wenn Brüder auch (friedlich) beisammen wohnen. 
[133:2] Das gleicht dem köstlichen Öl auf dem Haupt, / Das herabfloß auf den Bart, / Auf Aarons Bart, der niederwallte / Auf seiner Gewänder Rand. 
[133:3] Es gleicht auch dem Hermontau, / Der auf Zions Berg niederfällt. / Denn dorthin hat Jahwe den Segen entboten, / Leben für immer. 
[134:1] Ein Stufenlied. / (Ein Ruf der Gemeinde an die Tempelwächter:) / Wohlan, preist Jahwe, all ihr Knechte Jahwes Haus! 
[134:2] Hebt auf eure Hände zum Heiligtum / Und preist Jahwe! 
[134:3] (Die Antwort der Tempelwächter an die Gemeinde:) / Es segne dich Jahwe von Zion her, / Der Schöpfer von Himmel und Erde! 
[135:1] Lobet Jah! / Lobt den Namen Jahwes, / Lobt ihn, ihr Knechte Jahwes, 
[135:2] Die ihr steht in Jahwes Haus, / In den Höfen des Hauses unsers Gottes! 
[135:3] Lobt Jah, denn Jahwe ist gütig, / Spielt seinem Namen, denn lieblich ist er! 
[135:4] Denn Jah hat Jakob erkoren, / Israel sich zum Eigentum erwählt. 
[135:5] Denn ich weiß wohl, daß Jahwe groß ist / Und unser Herr alle Götter überragt. 
[135:6] Alles, was Jahwe gefiel, das hat er gemacht / Im Himmel und auf Erden, / In den Meeren und allen Tiefen. 
[135:7] Er führt Wolken herauf vom Ende der Erde, / Läßt künden durch Blitze Gewitterregen, / Holt Wind aus seinen Speichern hervor. 
[135:8] Er schlug Ägyptens Erstgeburten / Von Menschen bis zum Vieh. 
[135:9] Er sandte Zeichen und Wunder / Wider dich, Ägyptenland, / Wider Pharao und all seine Knechte. 
[135:10] Er schlug viele Völker / Und tötete mächtige Könige. 
[135:11] Sihon, der Amoriter König, / Und Og, den König von Basan, / Ja, machte zunichte alle Reiche Kanaans. 
[135:12] Er gab ihr Land als Erbe, / Als Erbe Israel, seinem Volk. 
[135:13] Jahwe, dein Name währt ewig; / Dein Gedächtnis, Jahwe, bleibt für und für. 
[135:14] Denn Jahwe wird seinem Volk Recht schaffen / Und mit seinen Knechten Erbarmen haben. 
[135:15] Der Heiden Götzen sind Silber und Gold, / Das Gebilde von Menschenhand. 
[135:16] Sie haben einen Mund und können nicht reden, / Sie haben Augen und sehen doch nicht. 
[135:17] Ohren haben sie und hören nicht, / Noch haben sie Odem in ihrem Mund. 
[135:18] Ihnen gleich sind, die sie bilden — / Jeder, der ihnen vertraut. 
[135:19] Ihr von Israels Haus, preist Jahwe! / Ihr von Aarons Haus, preist Jahwe! 
[135:20] Ihr von Levis Haus, preist Jahwe! / Die ihr Jahwe fürchtet, preist Jahwe! 
[135:21] Gepriesen sei Jahwe von Zion aus, / Er, der in Jerusalem wohnt. / Lobt Jah! 
[136:1] (Der Chor der Priester:) / — (Der Chor der Gemeinde:) / Dankt Jahwe, denn er ist gütig. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:2] Dankt dem Gott der Götter. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:3] Dankt dem Herrn der Herren. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:4] (Dankt) dem, der allein große Wunder tut. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:5] (Dankt) dem, der die Himmel mit Weisheit erschaffen. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:6] (Dankt) dem, der die Erde über die Wasser ausgebreitet. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:7] (Dankt) dem, der große Lichter erschaffen: / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:8] Die Sonne, um den Tag zu beherrschen, / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:9] Den Mond und die Sterne, um die Nacht zu beherrschen. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:10] (Dankt) dem, der die Ägypter schlug an ihren Erstgebornen / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:11] Und Israel aus dem Lande führte / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:12] Mit starker Hand und ausgerecktem Arm. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:13] (Dankt) dem, der das Schilfmeer in zwei Teile spaltete / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:14] Und Israel hindurchziehen ließ, / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:15] Doch Pharao und sein Heer ins Schilfmeer trieb. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:16] (Dankt) dem, der sein Volk in der Wüste führte. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:17] (Dankt) dem, der mächtige Könige schlug / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:18] Und stolze Könige tötete: / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:19] Sihon, der Amoriter König, / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:20] Und Og, den König von Basan, / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:21] Und ihr Land zum Erbe gab, / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:22] Zum Erbe Israel, seinem Knecht. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:23] (Dankt dem), der in unsrer Niedrigkeit an uns gedachte / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:24] Und uns von unsern Drängern befreite; / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:25] Der allen Lebewesen Speise gibt. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[136:26] Dankt dem Gott des Himmels. / — Denn ewig währet seine Huld! 
[137:1] An den Flüssen Babels, daß saßen wir und weinten, / Wenn wir an Zion gedachten. 
[137:2] An den Weiden, die dort standen, / Hingen wir unsre Zithern auf. 
[137:3] Denn da wollten unsre Sieger von uns Lieder hören / Und unsre Quäler Freudengesang. / "Singt uns", so riefen sie (höhnisch), / "eins von den Zionsliedern!" 
[137:4] Wie sollten wir Jahwes Lieder singen / In einem fremden Lande? 
[137:5] Vergeß ich dein Jerusalem, / So sterbe mir ab meine rechte Hand! 
[137:6] Meine Zunge klebe an meinem Gaumen, / Wenn ich nicht dein gedenke, / Wenn mir nicht Jerusalem / Meine höchste Freude ist. 
[137:7] Gedenke, o Jahwe, Edoms Söhnen / Den Tag Jerusalems, / Die da riefen: "Nieder, nieder mit ihr / Bis auf den Grund!" 
[137:8] O Tochter Babels, du Zwingherrin, wohl dem, der dir vergelten wird / All das, was du an uns verübt! 
[137:9] Wohl dem, der deine jungen Kinder ergreift / Und sie am Felsen zerschmettert! 
[138:1] Von David. / Ich will dir danken von ganzem Herzen, / Sogar vor "Göttern" will ich dir lobsingen. 
[138:2] Zu deinem heiligen Tempel hin will ich anbeten / Und deinen Namen preisen ob deiner Huld und Treu. / Denn deine Verheißung hast du verherrlicht / Über all deinen Namen hinaus. 
[138:3] Als ich rief, hast du mich erhört / Und mich mit Kraft und Mut erfüllt. 
[138:4] Danken werden dir, Jahwe, alle Könige der Erde / Wenn sie deines Mundes Worte vernommen. 
[138:5] Sie werden Jahwes Walten besingen, / Denn groß ist Jahwes Herrlichkeit. 
[138:6] Ja, erhaben ist Jahwe; aber er sieht den Niedrigen an, / Und den Stolzen kennet er schon von fern. 
[138:7] Käm ich auch mitten in Drangsal hinein, / Du erhieltest mich trotz des Zorns meiner Feinde am Leben; / Du würdest deine Hand ausstrecken, / Und deine Rechte würde mich retten. 
[138:8] Jahwe wird's mir zum Heil vollführen. / Jahwe, ewig währt deine Huld. / Deiner Hände Werk — o, laß es nicht unvollendet! 
[139:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. / Jahwe, du hast mich durchforscht und erkannt: 
[139:2] Du weißt, wann ich sitze und wann ich aufstehe; / Mein Denken und Streben kennst du sogar, / Noch eh es mir klar geworden. 
[139:3] Du siehst, wann ich wandre und wann ich mich niederlege, / Mit all meinen Wegen bist du vertraut. 
[139:4] Denn es ist kein Wort auf meiner Zunge — / Sieh, o Jahwe, du weißt es ganz. 
[139:5] Von allen Seiten hältst du mich umschlossen, / Du hast deine Hand auf mich gelegt. 
[139:6] Dies Wissen ist mir zu wunderbar, / Zu hoch: ich kann mich ihm nicht entziehn. 
[139:7] Wohin soll ich gehn vor deinem Geist, / Wohin vor deinem Antlitz fliehn? 
[139:8] Wenn ich in den Himmel stiege — du wärest da; / Und wollt ich mir im Totenreich ein Lager bereiten — / Dort wärest du auch. 
[139:9] Flög ich auf Flügeln der Morgenröte, / Wollt ich weilen am Ende des Meers: 
[139:10] Auch da würde deine Hand mich leiten / Und deine Rechte mich fassen. 
[139:11] Spräche ich: "Dunkel umhülle mich ganz, / Das Licht um mich her: es werde zur Nacht!" — 
[139:12] Auch Dunkel ist dir nicht zu dunkel; / Die Nacht vielmehr — sie leuchtet sogar wie der Tag, / Das Dunkel ist ebenso wie das Licht. 
[139:13] Denn du hast meine Nieren gebildet, / Du hast mich gewoben im Mutterleib. 
[139:14] Ich danke dir, daß ich so erstaunlich wunderbar entstanden bin: / Wunderbar sind ja auch sonst deine Werke, / Und meine Seele erkennt es wohl. 
[139:15] Nicht war dir mein Wesen unbekannt, / Als ich im Verborgnen bereitet ward, / Gewirkt in den Tiefen der Erde. 
[139:16] Schon meinen Fruchtkeim haben deine Augen gesehn; / Und auf dein Buch wurden alle geschrieben: / Die Tage, die mir bestimmt, / Eh noch einer von ihnen erschienen war. 
[139:17] Wie sind mir so köstlich, Gott, deine Gedanken, / Wie ist ihre Zahl so gewaltig! 
[139:18] Wollt ich sie zählen — sie wären mehr als Sand: / Ich bin erwacht und bin noch bei dir. 
[139:19] Möchtest du doch, Eloah, die Frevler töten! / Und "ihr Blutmenschen, weicht von mir!" 
[139:20] Sie reden in Arglist von dir, / Mißbrauchen zu Lug deinen Namen — sie, die Feinde! 
[139:21] Sollt ich nicht hassen, Jahwe, die dich hassen, / Nicht Abscheu empfinden vor denen, die dir widerstreben? 
[139:22] Ich hasse sie mit dem größten Haß: / Sie gelten mir als Feinde. 
[139:23] Erforsche mich, Gott, und erkenne mein Herz, / Prüf mich, erkenne meine Gedanken! 
[139:24] Sieh, ob ich neige zu unheilvollem Wandel, / Und leite mich auf den Ewigkeitsweg! 
[140:1] Dem Sangmeister. Ein Psalm Davids. 
[140:2] Rette mich, Jahwe, von bösen Menschen, / Bewahre mich vor den Gewalttätigen, 
[140:3] Die im Herzen Böses sinnen, / Die täglich Streit erregen! 
[140:4] Sie schärfen ihre Zunge wie eine Schlange, / Unter ihren Lippen ist Otterngift. Sela. 
[140:5] Behüte mich, Jahwe, vor Frevlerhänden, / Bewahre mich vor den Gewalttätigen, / Die da sinnen auf meinen Sturz! 
[140:6] Stolze haben mir heimlich Schlingen und Seile gelegt, / Ein Netz gebreitet meinen Pfad entlang, / Sie haben mir Fallen gestellt. Sela. 
[140:7] Ich aber habe zu Jahwe gesagt: "Mein Gott bist du, / Vernimm doch, Jahwe, mein lautes Flehn! 
[140:8] Jahwe Adonái, du meine mächtige Hilfe, / Der du mein Haupt am Tage des Kampfes beschirmst, 
[140:9] Erfülle nicht, Jahwe, der Frevler Begehren, / Ihren Anschlag laß nicht gelingen! / Sie würden sich sonst überheben." Sela. 
[140:10] Das Haupt derer, die mich umlauern, / Möge das Unheil bedecken, das sie wider mich geredet! 
[140:11] Mögen glühende Kohlen auf sie fallen! / Ins Feuer stürze er sie, / In Fluten, draus sie nicht wieder auftauchen können! 
[140:12] Ein Verleumder wird nicht im Lande bestehn; / Der Gewaltmensch werde vom Unglück gejagt ins Verderben! 
[140:13] Ich weiß, daß Jahwe des Elenden Sache führen, / Den Armen zum Rechte verhelfen wird. Fürwahr, die Gerechten werden deinem Namen danken, / Die Redlichen bleiben vor deinem Antlitz. 
[141:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Jahwe, ich habe dich angerufen: eile zu mir, / Horch auf mein Flehn, wenn ich zu dir rufe! 
[141:2] Nimm mein Gebet als Rauchopfer an, / Meiner Hände Aufheben als Abendopfer. 
[141:3] Stell eine Wache, Jahwe, vor meinen Mund, / Bewahre die Tür meiner Lippen! 
[141:4] Laß mein Herz sich nicht neigen zum Bösen, / Untat zu üben in Frevlermut / Im Bunde mit Männern, die übeltun; / Und von ihren Leckerbissen laß mich nicht essen! 
[141:5] Rügt mich ein Gerechter in Liebe und tadelt er mich, / So soll mein Haupt dies köstliche Öl nicht verschmähn; / Denn noch begegne ich nur mit Gebet ihren bösen Tücken. 
[141:6] Werden ihre Richter vom Felsen gestürzt, / Dann heißt man meine Worte als lieblich willkommen. 
[141:7] Wie einer das Erdreich mit Furchen durchzieht und lockert, / So sind unsre Gebeine dem Rachen des Grabes hingestreut. 
[141:8] Denn auf dich, Jahwe Adonái, sehn meine Augen, / Bei dir such ich Schutz: gib mich nicht hin in den Tod! 
[141:9] Bewahre mich vor der Schlinge, die man mir gelegt, / Vor den Nachstellungen der Übeltäter! 
[141:10] Laß die Frevler fallen ins eigene Netz! / Zugleich werd ich für immer daran vorübergehn. 
[142:1] Eine Betrachtung (?) Davids, als er in der Höhle war. Ein Gebet. 
[142:2] Laut schrei ich zu Jahwe, / Laut fleh ich zu Jahwe. 
[142:3] Vor ihm ergieß ich meine Klage, / Ihm mach ich meine Bedrängnis kund. 
[142:4] Ist mein Geist in mir verzagt: / Du kennst doch meinen Lebenspfad. / Auf dem Wege, den ich gehen will, / Hat man mir heimlich ein Netz gespannt. 
[142:5] Schau ich zur Rechten und blicke aus: / Niemand ist da, der mich kennen will. / Jede Zuflucht ist mir genommen, / Niemand frage nach mir. 
[142:6] Ich habe zu dir, o Jahwe, geschrien, / Ich habe gesagt: "Meine Zuflucht bist du, / Mein Teil in der Lebendigen Land!" 
[142:7] O merke doch auf mein lautes Flehn, / Denn ich bin elend und matt! / Von meinen Verfolgern errette mich, / Denn sie sind stärker als ich! Führe mich aus dem Kerker, / Daß ich deinen Namen preise! / Glück wünschend werden mich Fromme umringen, / Wenn du mir wohlgetan. 
[143:1] Ein Psalm Davids. / Jahwe, höre mein Gebet, / Vernimm mein Flehn um deiner Treue willen, / Antworte mir um deiner Gerechtigkeit willen! 
[143:2] Und geh nicht ins Gericht mit deinem Knecht, / Denn kein Lebendiger ist gerecht vor dir! 
[143:3] Denn der Feind hat mir nach dem Leben getrachtet, / Er hat mein Leben zu Boden geschlagen, / Mich in tiefes Dunkel versetzt wie die auf ewig Toten. 
[143:4] Nun ist mein Geist verschmachtet in mir, / Mein Herz ist mir in der Brust erstarrt. 
[143:5] Ich habe der Tage der Vorzeit gedacht, / Habe nachgesonnen über all dein Tun, / Das Werk deiner Hände erwogen. 
[143:6] Meine Hände hab ich zu dir gebreitet, / Wie nach Regen lechzendes Land lag meine Seele vor dir. Sela. 
[143:7] Eilends erhöre mich, Jahwe, es schmachtet mein Geist! / Verbirg nicht dein Antlitz vor mir! / Sonst gleich ich ins Grab Gesunknen. 
[143:8] Laß mich deine Huld schon früh am Morgen erfahren, / Denn ich vertraue auf dich! / Tu mir kund den Weg, den ich gehen soll, / Denn zu dir hab ich meine Seele erhoben! 
[143:9] Rette mich, Jahwe, von meinen Feinden! / Bei dir hab ich Zuflucht gesucht. 
[143:10] Lehre mich tun, was dir gefällt; / Du bist ja mein Gott: / Dein guter Geist führ mich auf ebner Bahn! 
[143:11] Um deines Namens willen, Jahwe, erhalt mich am Leben, / In deiner Treue reiß mich aus der Bedrängnis! 
[143:12] In deiner Huld vertilge du meine Feinde, / Vernichte alle, die meine Seele bedrängen! / Ich bin ja dein Knecht. 
[144:1] Von David. / Gepriesen sein Jahwe, mein Fels: / Er hat meine Hände zum Kampf, / Meine Finger zum Kriege geschickt gemacht. 
[144:2] Er schenkt mir Huld, er ist meine Burg, meine Feste, mein Retter, / Mein Schild: in ihm war ich immer geborgen; / Völker hat er mir unterworfen. 
[144:3] Jahwe, was ist doch der Mensch, daß du sein gedenkst, / Des Sterblichen Kind, daß du ihn beachtest? 
[144:4] Der Mensch ist ja nur wie ein Hauch, / Seine Tage sind wie ein schwindender Schatten. 
[144:5] Jahwe, neig deine Himmel, fahre herab, / Rühre die Berge an, daß sie rauchen! 
[144:6] Schleudre Blitze: zerstreue sie, / Schieß deine Pfeile: verstöre sie! 
[144:7] Streck aus deine Hand von der Himmelshöh! / Reiß mich heraus, befrei mich aus großen Wassern: / Aus der Hand der Söhne der Fremde, 
[144:8] Deren Mund Falsches zu reden pflegt, / Deren Rechte eine Rechte der Lüge ist! 
[144:9] Elohim, ich will dir singen ein neues Lied, / Auf zehnsaitiger Harfe dir spielen: 
[144:10] Dir, der den Königen Sieg verleiht, / Der David, seinen Knecht, aus der Not gerissen. 
[144:11] Dem mordenden Schwerte entreiße mich! / Rette mich aus der Hand der Söhne der Fremde, / Deren Mund Falsches zu reden pflegt, / Deren Rechte eine Rechte der Lüge ist! 
[144:12] Dann werden unsre Söhne in ihrer Jugendfrische / Wie kräftig wachsende Pflanzen sein, / Unsre Töchter gleichen Ecksäulen, / Die man meißelt zum Bau von Palästen. 
[144:13] Unsre Speicher sind dann gefüllt / Und spenden allerlei Frucht. / Unsre Schafe gehen tausend-, ja zehntausendweis / Auf unsern Triften. 
[144:14] Unsre Rinder tragen ohn Unfall und Fehlgeburt. / Auf unsern Straßen ist kein Klagegeschrei. 
[144:15] Heil dem Volk, dem es so ergeht, / Heil dem Volk, des Gott ist Jahwe! 
[145:1] Ein Loblied Davids. / Ah, dich will ich rühmen, mein Gott, du König, / Und deinen Namen preisen immer und ewig. 
[145:2] Beharrlich will ich dich preisen / Und deinen Namen loben immer und ewig. 
[145:3] Groß ist Jahwe und sehr preiswürdig, / Seine Größe ist unergründlich. 
[145:4] Das eine Geschlecht rühmt deine Werke dem andern, / Man macht deine großen Taten kund. 
[145:5] Hoheitsvoll ist deine herrliche Pracht, / Deine Wunder will ich besingen. 
[145:6] Wie soll man reden von deinem gewaltig erhabnen Tun! / Von deiner Größe will ich erzählen. 
[145:7] So soll man auch deiner Güte gedenken / Und ob deiner Gerechtigkeit jauchzen. 
[145:8] Gnädig ist Jahwe und barmherzig, / Langmütig und sehr gütig. 
[145:9] Tiefhuldreich erweist sich Jahwe allen / Und erbarmt sich all seiner Werke. 
[145:10] Jauchzen sollen dir, Jahwe, all deine Werke, / Deine Frommen sollen dich preisen. 
[145:11] Kundmachen sollen sie deines Königtums Herrlichkeit / Und reden von deiner Macht. 
[145:12] Loben sollen sie seine großen Taten vor den Menschenkindern / Und seines Königtums rühmliche Pracht. 
[145:13] Mit ewiger Dauer besteht dein Königreich, / Deine Herrschaft währet für und für. 
[145:14] Stützt nicht Jahwe alle, die fallen, / Hilft er nicht allen Gebeugten auf? 
[145:15] Aller Augen schaun empor zu dir: / Du gibst ihnen Nahrung zur rechten Zeit. 
[145:16] Freundlich öffnest du deine Hand / Und sättigst alles Lebendge mit dem, was ihm gefällt. 
[145:17] Zeigt sich nicht Jahwe gerecht in seinem Walten / Und gütig in all seinem Tun? 
[145:18] Kommt Jahwe nicht nahe allen, die ihn anrufen, / Allen, die ihn anrufen in Treue? 
[145:19] Recht erfüllen wird er, was seine Frommen begehren; / Er hört ihr Schrein und wird ihnen helfen. 
[145:20] Schützt Jahwe doch alle, die ihn lieben; / Alle Frevler aber wird er vertilgen. 
[145:21] Tönen soll mein Mund von Jahwes Lob, / Und alles Fleisch preise seinen heiligen Namen immer und ewig! 
[146:1] Lobet Jah! / Lobe Jahwe, o meine Seele! 
[146:2] Loben will ich Jahwe, solang ich lebe, / Meinem Gott will ich spielen, solange ich bin. 
[146:3] Vertraut nicht auf Fürsten, / Nicht auf Menschen, da sie nicht helfen können! 
[146:4] Fährt ihr Odem aus, so kehren sie wieder zum Staube zurück. / Dann hat es ein Ende mit ihren Plänen. 
[146:5] Heil dem, der Jakobs Gott zum Helfer hat, / Der auf Jahwe hofft als seinen Gott! 
[146:6] Er hat ja Himmel und Erde geschaffen, / Das Meer und alles, was weit und breit, / Er hält Treue in Ewigkeit. 
[146:7] Er schafft den Bedrückten Recht; / Er, Jahwe, gibt den Hungernden Brot, / Befreit die Gefangnen aus ihrer Not. 
[146:8] Jahwe öffnet die Augen der Blinden, / Gebeugte läßt Jahwe Erquickung finden, / Jahwe hat die Gerechten lieb. 
[146:9] Jahwe gibt den Fremdlingen Schutz, / Witwen und Waisen hilft er auf, / Aber er hemmt der Frevler Lauf. 
[146:10] Herrschen wird Jahwe in Ewigkeit, / Dein Gott, o Zion, in allen Geschlechtern. / Lobet Jah! 
[147:1] Lobet Jah! / Denn köstlich ist's, unsern Gott zu preisen; / Ja, lieblich ist's, es ziemt sich Lobgesang. 
[147:2] Jahwe bauet Jerusalem, / Die Vertriebnen Israels sammelt er wieder. 
[147:3] Er heilt die zerbrochnen Herzen, / Und ihre Wunden verbindet er. 
[147:4] Er bestimmt den Sternen ihre Zahl, / Sie alle ruft er bei Namen. 
[147:5] Groß ist unser Herr und reich an Kraft, / Seine Einsicht ist unermeßlich. 
[147:6] Den Duldern hilft Jahwe auf, / Aber Frevler erniedrigt er tief zu Boden. 
[147:7] Stimmt für Jahwe ein Danklied an, / Spielt unserm Gott auf der Zither! 
[147:8] Er bedeckt den Himmel mit Wolken, / Er spendet Regen der Erde, / Läßt Gras auf den Bergen sprossen. 
[147:9] Er gibt dem Vieh sein Futter, / Den jungen Raben, wenn sie schrein. 
[147:10] Nicht an des Rosses Stärke hat er Gefallen, / Er hat nicht Lust an des Mannes Beinen. 
[147:11] Lust hat Jahwe an seinen Frommen, / Die da harren auf seine Huld. 
[147:12] Preise, Jerusalem, Jahwe, / Lobe, Zion, deinen Gott! 
[147:13] Denn er hat deiner Tore Riegel gestärkt, / Hat deine Kinder gesegnet in dir. 
[147:14] Er hat deinem Lande Frieden geschenkt, / Dich mit dem besten Weizen gesättigt. 
[147:15] Er sendet sein Machtwort nieder zur Erde, / Eilend läuft sein Gebot. 
[147:16] Er gibt Schnee wie Wolle, / Streut Reif wie Asche aus. 
[147:17] Er wirft seinen Hagel herab in Stücken: / Wer hält vor seiner Kälte stand? 
[147:18] Sendet er aber sein Wort, so zerschmelzt er sie. / Er läßt seinen Tauwind wehn, so rinnen Gewässer. 
[147:19] Er hat für Jakob sein Wort verkündet, / Seine Satzungen und Rechte für Israel. 
[147:20] So hat er sonst keinem Volke getan; / Drum kennen sie auch seine Rechte nicht. / Lobt Jah! 
[148:1] Lobet Jah! / Lobet Jah vom Himmel her, / Lobet ihn in der Höhe! 
[148:2] Lobt ihn, all seine Engel, / Lobet ihn, all sein Heer! 
[148:3] Lobt ihn, Sonne und Mond, / Lobet ihn, all ihr lichten Sterne! 
[148:4] Lobt ihn, ihr höchsten Himmel, / Und ihr Wasser über dem Himmel! 
[148:5] Loben sollen sie Jahwes Namen; / Denn er gebot, und sie wurden geschaffen. 
[148:6] Er stellte sie hin für immer und ewig; / Er gab ein Gesetz, das sie nicht übertreten. 
[148:7] Lobt Jahwe von der Erde her, / Ihr Seeungeheuer und all ihr Meerestiefen, 
[148:8] Ihr, Feuer und Hagel, Schnee und Rauch, / Du Sturmwind, der sein Wort vollstreckt. 
[148:9] Ihr Berge und alle Hügel, / Ihr Fruchtbäume und alle Zedern. 
[148:10] Ihr wilden und zahmen Tiere, / Ihr Gewürm und gefiederten Vögel, 
[148:11] Ihr Erdenkönige und Völker alle, / Ihr Fürsten und alle Richter auf Erden, 
[148:12] Ihr Jünglinge und ihr Jungfraun auch, / Ihr Alten mit den Jungen! 
[148:13] Sie alle sollen Jahwes Namen loben; / Denn sein Name allein ist erhaben, / Seine Hoheit geht über Erde und Himmel. 
[148:14] Er hat seinem Volk wieder Macht verliehn: / Das ist ein Ruhm für all seine Frommen, / Für Israels Söhne — das Volk, das ihm am nächsten steht. / Lobt Jah! 
[149:1] Lobet Jah! / Singet Jahwe ein neues Lied, / Singt sein Lob in der Frommen Versammlung! 
[149:2] Israel freue sich seines Schöpfers, / Zions Söhne mögen über ihren König jubeln! 
[149:3] Sie mögen seinen Namen preisen im Reigentanz, / Mit Pauke und Zither ihm spielen! 
[149:4] Denn Gefallen hat Jahwe an seinem Volk, / Er schmückt die Dulder mit Heil. 
[149:5] Frohlocken mögen die Frommen in ihrer Seele, / Jubeln auf ihren Lagern! 
[149:6] Ihr Mund sei voll von Gottes Lobpreis, / Ihre Hand aber führe ein zweischneidig Schwert! 
[149:7] So sollen sie Rache üben an den Heiden, / Strafe an den Völkern. 
[149:8] Deren Könige sollen sie binden mit Ketten, / Ihre Edlen mit eisernen Fesseln, 
[149:9] Und so an ihnen vollziehn das geschriebne Recht: / Das ist ein Ruhm für all seine Frommen. / Lobt Jah! 
[150:1] Lobet Jah! / Lobt El in seinem Heiligtum, / Lobt ihn an seiner mächtigen Feste! 
[150:2] Lobt ihn ob seiner gewaltigen Taten, / Lobt ihn, wie es seiner überschwenglichen Größe geziemt! 
[150:3] Lobt ihn mit dem Blasen des Widderhorns, / Lobt ihn mit Harfe und Zither! 
[150:4] Lobt ihn mit Pauke und Reigen, / Lobt ihn mit Saitenspiel und Flöte! 
[150:5] Lobt ihn mit klingenden Zimbeln, / Lobt ihn mit schallenden Zimbeln! 
[150:6] Alles, was Oden hat, lobe Jah! / Lobet Jah!

### Matthew

[1:1] Dies ist das Buch der Geschichte Jesu Christi, des Sohnes Davids, des Sohnes Abrahams. 
[1:2] Abraham war der Vater Isaaks. Isaak war der Vater Jakobs. Jakob war der Vater Judas und seiner Brüder. 
[1:3] Juda war — durch Thamar — der Vater des Perez und Serah. Perez war der Vater Hezrons. Hezron war der Vater Rams. 
[1:4] Ram war der Vater Aminadabs. Aminadab war der Vater Nahessons. Nahesson war der Vater Salmas. 
[1:5] Salma war — durch Rahab — der Vater des Boas. Boas war — durch Ruth — der Vater Obeds. Obed war der Vater Isais. 
[1:6] Isai war der Vater des Königs David. David war — durch Urias Witwe — der Vater Salomos. 
[1:7] Salomo war der Vater Rehabeams. Rehabeam war der Vater Abias. Abia war der Vater Asas. 
[1:8] Asa war der Vater Josafats. Josafat war der Vater Jorams. Joram war der Vater Usias. 
[1:9] Usia war der Vater Jotams. Jotam war der Vater des Ahas. Ahas war der Vater Hiskias. 
[1:10] Hiskia war der Vater Manasses. Manasse war der Vater Amons. Amon war der Vater Josias. 
[1:11] Josia wurde der Vater Jechonjas und seiner Brüder zur Zeit der Wegführung nach Babylon. 
[1:12] Nach der Wegführung nach Babylon wurde Jechonja der Vater Sealthiels. Sealthiel war der Vater Serubabels. 
[1:13] Serubabel war der Vater Abiuds. Abiud war der Vater Eljakims. Eljakim war der Vater Asors. 
[1:14] Asor war der Vater Zadoks. Zadoks war der Vater Achims. Achim war der Vater Eliuds. 
[1:15] Eliud war der Vater Eleasars. Eleasar war der Vater Matthans. Matthan war der Vater Jakobs. 
[1:16] Jakob war der Vater Josefs, des Mannes der Maria. Maria aber ist die Mutter jenes Jesus, der den Namen Christus trägt. 
[1:17] Alle Geschlechter von Abraham bis David betragen vierzehn. Auch von David bis zu der Wegfnhrung nach Babylon sind vierzehn Geschlechter. Ebenso sind vierzehn Geschlechter von der Wegfnhrung nach Babylon bis auf den Messias. 
[1:18] Mit Christi Geburt verhielt es sich so: Als seine Mutter Maria mit Josef verlobt war, da zeigte sich's, noch ehe sie zusammenzogen, daß sie vom Heiligen Geist empfangen hatte. 
[1:19] Josef aber, ihr Verlobter, der ein frommer Mann war und sie nicht bloßstellen wollte, ging schon damit um, sich in aller Stille von ihr zu trennen. 
[1:20] Als er dies erwog, da erschien ihm im Traume ein Engel des Herrn und sprach zu ihm: "Josef, du Sohn Davids, scheue dich nicht, Maria, deine Verlobte, zu deiner Ehefrau zu machen! Denn was in ihr erzeugt ist, das stammt von dem Heiligen Geiste. 
[1:21] Und sie wird einen Sohn gebären, dem sollst du den Namen Jesus geben; denn er wird sein Volk erretten von ihren Sünden." 
[1:22] Dies alles ist geschehen, damit sich jenes Wort erfülle, das der Herr durch den Mund des Propheten gesprochen hat: 
[1:23] Siehe, die Jungfrau wird empfangen und einen Sohn gebären, und seinen Namen wird man nennen Immanuel, das heißt: mit uns ist Gott. 
[1:24] Als Josef von seinem Schlaf erwachte, tat er, wie ihm der Engel des Herrn befohlen hatte, und führte seine Verlobte als Eheweib heim. 
[1:25] Aber er verkehrte nicht mit ihr, bis sie einen Sohn geboren hatte. Dem gab er den Namen Jesus. 
[2:1] Als Jesus in den Tagen des Königs Herodes zu Bethlehem in Judäa geboren war, da trafen Sterndeuter aus dem Morgenlande in Jerusalem ein und fragten: 
[2:2] "Wo ist der König der Juden? Er ist geboren; denn wir haben in den Strahlen der Morgendämmerung seinen Stern erscheinen sehn und sind hierher gekommen, um ihm zu huldigen." 
[2:3] Als dies dem König Herodes zu Ohren kam, erschrak er, und mit ihm entsetzte sich auch ganz Jerusalem. 
[2:4] Da berief er alle Hohenpriester und Schriftgelehrten des Volkes und legte ihnen die Frage vor: "Wo soll der Messias geboren werden?" 
[2:5] Sie antworteten ihm: "Zu Bethlehem in Judäa. Denn so steht geschrieben in den Worten des Propheten: 
[2:6] Und du, Bethlehem im Lande Juda, du bist durchaus nicht die geringste unter den Führerstädten. Denn aus dir soll mir ein Herrscher kommen, der wird als Hirte weiden mein Volk Israel." 
[2:7] Hierauf ließ Herodes die Sterndeuter in aller Stille zu sich rufen und sich von ihnen genau die Zeit angeben, wann der Stern zuerst erschienen sei. 
[2:8] Dann wies er sie nach Bethlehem und sprach: "Zieht hin und forscht mit Sorgfalt nach dem Kinde; und habt ihr es gefunden, so gebt mir Nachricht, damit ich auch komme und ihm huldige." 
[2:9] Als sie dies von dem Könige vernommen hatten, machten sie sich auf den Weg. Und sieh, der Stern, den sie im Frühaufgang gesehn, zog vor ihnen her, bis er stillstand über dem Hause, wo das Kindlein war. 
[2:10] Bei dem Anblick des Sternes wurden sie mit großer Freude erfüllt. 
[2:11] Sie traten in das Haus und sahen das Kind bei Maria, seiner Mutter. Da fielen sie vor ihm nieder und huldigten ihm. Dann öffneten sie ihre Schatzbehälter und brachten ihm Gold, Weihrauch und Myrrhen als Geschenke dar. 
[2:12] Im Traum erhielten sie die Weisung, nicht wieder zu Herodes zu gehn. Deshalb zogen sie auf einem andern Wege in ihr Heimatland zurück. 
[2:13] Als sie weggezogen waren, da erschien ein Engel des Herrn dem Josef im Träume und sprach zu ihm: "Auf, nimm das Kind und seine Mutter, flieh nach Ägypten und bleibe dort so lange, bis ich dir Nachricht gebe! Denn Herodes will das Kind in seine Gewalt bekommen, um es zu töten." 
[2:14] Da stand er auf und nahm noch in derselben Nacht das Kind und seine Mutter und machte sich auf den Weg nach Ägypten. 
[2:15] Dort blieb er bis zum Tode des Herodes. So erfüllte sich das Wort des Herrn durch den Propheten: Aus Ägypten hat ich meinen Sohn gerufen. 
[2:16] Als nun Herodes sah, daß ihn die Sterndeuter getäuscht hatten, ward er sehr zornig: er sandte Henker aus und ließ in Bethlehem und dem ganzen Umkreis dieses Ortes alle Knaben in dem Alter von zwei Jahren und darunter töten, nach dem Zeitpunkt, den er von den Sterndeutern genau erforscht hatte. 
[2:17] Damals erfüllte sich das Wort des Propheten Jeremia: 
[2:18] In Rama hat man ein Geschrei gehört, lautes Weinen und Klagen: Rahel weint um ihre Kinder und will sich nicht trösten lassen; denn sie sind dahin. 
[2:19] Als aber Herodes gestorben war, da erschien in Ägypten ein Engel des Herrn dem Josef im Traum 
[2:20] und sprach zu ihm: "Auf, nimm das Kind und seine Mutter und ziehe ins Land Israel! Denn die dem Kinde nach dem Leben trachteten, die sind nun tot." 
[2:21] Da stand er auf und nahm das Kind und seine Mutter und kam in das Land Israel. 
[2:22] Als er aber hörte, daß Archelaus an Stelle seines Vaters Herodes in Judäa herrschte, trug er Bedenken, sich dort niederzulassen; und nach einer göttlichen Weisung, die er im Träume empfing, zog er sich in die Landschaft Galiläa zurück. 
[2:23] Dort nahm er Wohnung in einer Stadt, mit Namen Nazaret, damit die Worte der Propheten in Erfüllung gingen. Denn er sollte ja den Namen Nazaräer tragen. 
[3:1] In jenen Tagen trat Johannes der Täufer auf und ließ in der Wüste Judäas den Ruf erschallen: 
[3:2] "Ändert euern Sinn, denn das Königreich der Himmel ist nahe herbeigekommen!" 
[3:3] Er ist der Mann, vom dem der Prophet Jesaja gesprochen hat: In der Wüste ruft eine Stimme: "Bereitet dem Herrn den Weg, ebnet ihm die Pfade!" 
[3:4] Johannes aber trug ein Kleid von Kamelhaaren und um seine Hüften einen Ledergurt; und seine Nahrung waren Heuschrecken und wilder Honig. 
[3:5] Da gingen die Leute aus Jerusalem, aus ganz Judäa und aus der ganzen Gegend um den Jordan zu ihm hinaus, 
[3:6] ließen sich im Jordanflusse taufen und bekannten ihre Sünden. 
[3:7] Als er nun auch viele Pharisäer und Sadduzäer zu seiner Taufe kommen sah, sprach er zu ihnen: "Ihr Schlangenbrut! Wer hat euch denn gesagt, daß ihr dem kommenden Zorngericht entrinnen könnt? 
[3:8] So bringt den Frucht, wie sie der Sinnesänderung entspricht! 
[3:9] Und laßt euch nur nicht beikommen, zu denken: 'Wir haben ja Abraham zum Vater.' Denn ich sage euch: Gott kann aus diesen Steinen hier dem Abraham Kinder entstehen lassen. 
[3:10] Schon liegt die Axt den Bäumen an der Wurzel; und jeder Baum, der nicht gute Frucht bringt, wird abgehauen und ins Feuer geworfen. 
[3:11] Ich taufe euch mit Wasser, damit ihr euern Sinn ändert. Der aber nach mir kommt, hat größere Gewalt als ich, und ich bin nicht wert, ihm seine Schuhe nachzutragen: der wird euch mit Heiligem Geiste und mit Feuer taufen. 
[3:12] Er hat schon die Wurfschaufel in der Hand und wird seine Tenne reinigen: seinen Weizen wird er in den Speicher sammeln; aber die Spreu wird er verbrennen mit einem Feuer, das niemand löschen kann." 
[3:13] Damals kam auch Jesus aus Galiläa an den Jordan zu Johannes, um sich von ihm taufen zu lassen. 
[3:14] Der aber suchte ihn davon abzubringen, indem er sprach: "Ich hätte es nötig, mich von dir taufen zu lassen, und du kommst zu mir?" 
[3:15] Doch Jesus antwortete ihm: "Laß mich nur! Denn so ziemt es uns, jede Vorschrift zu erfüllen." Da gab Johannes ihm nach. 
[3:16] In dem Augenblick aber, als Jesus nach seiner Taufe aus dem Wasser emporstieg, tat sich der Himmel über ihm auf, und er sah den Geist Gottes wie eine Taube niederschweben und auf sich kommen. 
[3:17] Und eine Stimme aus dem Himmel sprach: "Dies ist mein geliebter Sohn, den ich erkoren habe." 
[4:1] Dann ward Jesus vom Geist in die Wüste geführt, um von dem Teufel versucht zu werden. 
[4:2] Und als er vierzig Tage und vierzig Nächte gefastet hatte, empfand er zuletzt Hunger. 
[4:3] Da trat der Versucher zu ihm und sprach: "Bist du Gottes Sohn, so befiehl, daß sich diese Steine hier in Brot verwandeln." 
[4:4] Doch er antwortete: "Es steht geschrieben: Der Mensch wird nicht durch Brot allein am Leben erhalten, sondern durch alles, was ihm durch Gottes Allmachtswort bereitet wird." 
[4:5] Dann nahm ihn der Teufel mit sich in die heilige Stadt, stellte ihn auf das flachte Dach der Tempelhalle 
[4:6] und sprach zu ihm: "Bist du Gottes Sohn, so stürze dich hinab, denn es steht geschrieben: Er wird seinen Engeln deinetwegen Auftrag geben, und sie sollen dich auf den Händen tragen, daß du nicht mit deinem Fuß an einen Stein stoßest." 
[4:7] Jesus aber erwiderte ihm: "Anderseits steht auch geschrieben: Du sollst den Herrn, deinen Gott, nicht versuchen." 
[4:8] Weiter nahm ihn der Teufel mit sich auf einen sehr hohen Berg. Von dort aus zeigte er ihm alle Reiche der Welt mit ihrer Pracht 
[4:9] und sprach zu ihm: "Dies alles will ich dir geben, wenn du vor mir niederfällst und mir huldigst." 
[4:10] Da antwortete ihm Jesus: "Mir aus den Augen, Satan! Denn es steht geschrieben: Du sollst dem Herrn, deinem Gott, anbetend huldigen und ihn allein verehren." 
[4:11] Da verließ ihn der Teufel, und nun kamen Engel herbei und brachten ihm Speise. 
[4:12] Auf die Kunde, Johannes sei verhaftet worden, zog sich Jesus nach Galiläa zurück. 
[4:13] Er verließ Nazaret und nahm seine Wohnung in Kapernaum am See in dem Gebiet von Sebulon und Naphtali. — 
[4:14] So erfüllte sich der Ausspruch des Propheten Jesaja: 
[4:15] Das Land Sebulon und das Land Naphtali, das Gebiet nach dem Meere zu, die Gegend östlich vom Jordan, das heidnische Galiläa 
[4:16] - das Volk, das im Finstern saß, hat ein großes Licht gesehn, und denen, die in des Todes Land und Schatten wohnten, hat ein Licht geleuchtet. 
[4:17] Seit der Zeit begann Jesus öffentlich zu lehren. Seine Botschaft lautete: "Ändert euern Sinn, denn das Königreich der Himmel ist nahe herbeigekommen!" 
[4:18] Als Jesus (eines Tages) an dem Ufer des Galiläischen Sees wandelte, erblickte er zwei Brüder: Simon, mit dem Beinamen Petrus, und seinen Bruder Andreas; die warfen ein Wurfnetz in den See, denn sie waren Fischer. 
[4:19] Und er sprach zu ihnen: "Kommt und folget mir, ich will euch zu Menschenfischern machen." 
[4:20] Da ließen sie sofort ihre Netze liegen und folgten ihm. 
[4:21] Als er dann weiterging, sah er ein anderes Brüderpaar: Jakobus, den Sohn des Zebedäus, und seinen Bruder Johannes; die brachten in ihrem Boote mit ihrem Vater Zebedäus ihre Hochseenetze in Ordnung. Und er berief sie. 
[4:22] Sogleich verließen sie das Boot und ihren Vater und folgten ihm. 
[4:23] Jesus zog umher in ganz Galiläa: er lehrte in ihren Versammlungshäusern, verkündigte die frohe Botschaft vom Königreiche und heilte allerlei Krankheiten und Gebrechen im Volke. 
[4:24] Die Kunde von ihm ging weiter und drang durch ganz Syrien. Da brachte man zu ihm alle, die an den verschiedenartigsten Gebrechen litten: von Schmerzen Geplagte, Besessene, Mondsüchtige, Gelähmte; und er heilte sie. 
[4:25] Es folgten ihm große Volksscharen aus Galiläa und dem Gebiete der Zehn Städte, aus Jerusalem und Judäa und aus der Gegend jenseits des Jordans. 
[5:1] Als er die Volksmenge sah, ging er auf die Bergeshöhe. Dort setzte er sich nieder, und seine Jünger traten zu ihm. 
[5:2] Da tat er seinen Mund auf und lehrte sie also: 
[5:3] "Selig sind die Armen im Geist! Denn das Königreich der Himmel ist ihr Teil. 
[5:4] Selig sind die Trauernden! Denn sie sollen getröstet werden. 
[5:5] Selig sind die stillen Dulder! Denn ihr Erbteil soll die Erde sein. 
[5:6] Selig sind, die hungern und dürsten nach der Gerechtigkeit! Denn sie sollen gesättigt werden. 
[5:7] Selig sind die Barmherzigen! Denn ihnen soll Erbarmen widerfahren. 
[5:8] Selig sind, die reines Herzens sind! Denn sie sollen Gott schauen. 
[5:9] Selig sind die Friedenstifter! Denn sie sollen Söhne Gottes heißen. 
[5:10] Selig sind, die um Gerechtigkeit willen Verfolgung gelitten haben! Denn das Königreich der Himmel ist ihr Teil. 
[5:11] Selig seid ihr, wenn man euch schmähet und verfolgt und um meinetwillen lügnerisch allerlei Böses von euch redet. 
[5:12] Freuet euch darüber und jubelt, denn euer Lohn dafür ist groß im Himmel! Ebenso hat man ja die Propheten verfolgt, die vor euch lebten. 
[5:13] Ihr seid das Salz der Erde. Wird aber das Salz fade, womit soll man ihm die Salzkraft wiedergeben? Es hat dann weiter keinen Wert; man muß es wegwerfen und von den Leuten zertreten lassen. 
[5:14] Ihr seid das Licht der Welt. Eine Stadt, die auf einem Berge liegt, kann nicht verborgen bleiben. 
[5:15] Man zündet auch nicht eine Lampe an und setzt sie dann unter einen Scheffel; sondern man stellt sie auf den Leuchter; dann gibt sie allen Hausbewohnern Licht. 
[5:16] Ebenso soll euer Licht vor den Menschen leuchten, damit sie eure guten Werke sehen und euern Vater im Himmel preisen. 
[5:17] Denkt nicht, ich sei gekommen, um das Gesetz oder die Propheten aufzuheben! Ich bin nicht gekommen, um aufzuheben, sondern um zu erfüllen. 
[5:18] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Eher können Himmel und Erde vergehn, als daß auch nur der kleinste Buchstabe oder ein einziger Strich vom Gesetz abhanden kommt, ohne daß alles erfüllt wird. 
[5:19] Wer darum eins von diesen Geboten, und sei es das geringste, aufhebt und so die Leute lehrt, der wird der Geringste heißen im Königreich der Himmel; wer es aber erfüllt und lehrt, der wird ein Großer heißen im Königreich der Himmel. 
[5:20] Denn ich versichere euch: Steht es bei euch mit der Gerechtigkeit nicht viel besser als bei den Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäern, so werdet ihr gewiß nicht eingehn ins Königreich der Himmel. 
[5:21] Ihr habt gehört, daß zu den Alten gesagt worden ist: Du sollst nicht morden! Wer aber einen Mord begeht, der soll dem Ortsgericht verfallen sein. 
[5:22] Ich aber sage euch: Wer seinem Bruder zürnt, der soll dem Ortsgericht verfallen; wer aber zu seinem Bruder mit Verachtung redet, der soll dem Hohen Rat verfallen; und wer das Scheltwort Narr gebraucht, der soll der Glut des Feuers verfallen. 
[5:23] Wenn du also deine Opfergabe schon zum Altar gebracht hast, und es fällt dir dort ein, daß dein Bruder gegen dich einen Grund zur Klage hat, 
[5:24] so laß dort deine Opfergabe vor dem Altar stehn und geh zunächst hin und söhne dich mit deinem Bruder aus; dann erst komm und bring dein Opfer dar! 
[5:25] Zeig dich beizeiten deinem Gläubiger entgegenkommend, solange du noch mit ihm auf dem Wege bist! Sonst könnte dich der Gläubiger vor den Richter bringen und der Richter dich dem Büttel übergeben, und man könnte dich ins Schuldgefängnis werfen. 
[5:26] Wahrlich, ich sage dir: Du kommst dort nicht eher heraus, als bis du den letzten Pfennig bezahlt hast. 
[5:27] Ihr habt gehört, daß gesagt worden ist: Du sollst nicht ehebrechen! 
[5:28] Ich aber sage euch: Wer ein Weib begehrlich anblickt, der hat schon in seinem Herzen Ehebruch mit ihr getrieben. 
[5:29] Wenn dich nun dein rechtes Auge zur Sünde verführt, so reiß es aus und wirf es von dir! Denn es ist dir besser, eins von deinen Gliedern geht dir verloren, als daß dein ganzer Leib in die Hölle geworfen werde. 
[5:30] Und wenn dich deine rechte Hand zur Sünde verführt, haue sie ab und wirf sie von dir! Denn es ist dir besser, eins von deinen Gliedern geht dir verloren, als daß dein ganzer Leib in die Hölle fahre. 
[5:31] Ferner ist gesagt worden: Wer sein Weib entläßt, der soll ihr einen Scheidebrief geben. 
[5:32] Ich aber sage euch: Wer sein Weib entläßt — abgesehn von dem Falle, daß sie Unzucht getrieben —, der setzt sie der Gefahr aus, daß sie Ehebruch begeht; und wer eine (von ihrem Mann) entlassene Frau zum Weibe nimmt, der begeht damit einen Ehebruch. 
[5:33] Weiterhin habt ihr gehört, daß zu den Alten gesagt worden ist: Du sollst nicht falsch schwören, du sollst vielmehr dem Herrn deine Eide (und Gelübde) erfüllen. 
[5:34] Ich aber sage euch: Ihr sollt überhaupt nicht schwören: weder bei dem Himmel, denn er ist Gottes Thron, 
[5:35] noch bei der Erde, denn sie ist seiner Füße Schemel, noch bei Jerusalem, denn sie ist des großen Königs Stadt. 
[5:36] Du sollst auch nicht bei deinem Haupte schwören; denn du bist nicht imstande, ein einziges Haar weiß oder schwarz zu machen. 
[5:37] In eurer Rede sei vielmehr das Ja ein Ja, das Nein ein Nein; was dem hinzugefügt wird, stammt von dem Bösen. 
[5:38] Ihr habt gehört, daß gesagt worden ist: Auge um Auge und Zahn um Zahn! 
[5:39] Ich aber sage euch: Setzt einem bösen Menschen keinen Widerstand entgegen! Im Gegenteil: Wer dich auf die rechte Wange schlägt, dem halte auch die andre hin! 
[5:40] Und wer dir durch eine Klage vor Gericht dein Unterkleid entreißen will, dem gib freiwillig auch dein Oberkleid. 
[5:41] Und wer dein Geleit für eine Meile haben will, mit dem gehe zwei! 
[5:42] Wer dich um etwas bittet, dem gib; und wer etwas von dir borgen will, von dem wende dich nicht ab! 
[5:43] Ihr habt gehört, daß gesagt worden ist: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben und deinen Feind hassen! 
[5:44] Ich aber sage euch: Liebet eure Feinde und betet für eure Verfolger! 
[5:45] Dann zeigt ihr euch als Söhne eures Vaters im Himmel. Denn er läßt seine Sonne aufgehn über Böse und Gute und läßt regnen über Gerechte und Ungerechte. 
[5:46] Denn wenn ihr nur die liebt, die euch lieben, was für eine Belohnung habt ihr da zu erwarten? Tun das nicht auch die Zöllner? 
[5:47] Und wenn ihr nur mit euern Volksgenossen verkehrt, was tut ihr da Besonderes? Tun das nicht auch die Heiden? 
[5:48] Darum sollt ihr vollkommen sein, wie euer himmlischer Vater vollkommen ist. 
[6:1] Hütet euch, eure Frömmigkeit vor den Augen der Leute zu üben, um von ihnen bewundert zu werden! Sonst habt ihr keine Belohnung von euerm Vater im Himmel zu erwarten. 
[6:2] Wenn du nun Liebeswerke übst, laß es nicht vor dir ausposaunen, wie es die Heuchler machen in den Versammlungshäusern und auf den Straßen, um vor den Leuten gelobt zu werden. Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Sie haben ihre Belohnung schon weg. 
[6:3] Sondern, wenn du Liebeswerke übst, so soll deine linke Hand nicht wissen, was deine rechte tut, 
[6:4] damit dein Wohltun im Verborgenen bleibe. Dann wir dein Vater, der ins Verborgene sieht, es dir vergelten. 
[6:5] Und wenn ihr betet, macht's nicht wie die Heuchler! Die lieben es, in den Versammlungshäusern und an den Straßenecken zu stehen und zu beten, um den Leuten aufzufallen. Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Sie haben ihre Belohnung schon weg. 
[6:6] Sondern wenn du beten willst, so geh in deine Kammer, schließ die Tür hinter dir und bete dann zu deinem Vater, der im Verborgenen wohnt! Dann wird dein Vater, der ins Verborgene sieht, es dir vergelten. 
[6:7] Beim Beten plappert nicht gedankenlos wie die Heiden! Die meinen, sie finden Erhörung, wenn sie viel Worte machen. 
[6:8] Gleicht ihnen nicht! Denn euer Vater weiß was ihr bedürft, noch ehe ihr ihn bittet. 
[6:9] Ihr sollt nun also beten: Unser Vater, der du bist im Himmel! Dein Name werde geheiligt! 
[6:10] Dein Königreich komme! Dein Wille geschehe, wie im Himmel, also auch auf Erden! 
[6:11] Unser Brot für morgen gib uns heute! 
[6:12] Und vergib uns unsere Schulden, wie auch wir vergeben unseren Schuldnern. 
[6:13] Und führe uns nicht in Versuchung! Sondern bewahre uns vor dem Bösen! 
[6:14] Denn wenn ihr den Menschen ihre Fehltritte vergebt, so wird euch euer himmlischer Vater auch vergeben. 
[6:15] Wenn ihr aber den Menschen nicht vergebt, so wird euch euer Vater eure Fehltritte auch nicht vergeben. 
[6:16] Wenn ihr fastet, schaut nicht trübselig drein wie die Heuchler! Die entstellen ihr Gesicht, damit die Leute ihr Fasten sehen. Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Sie haben ihre Belohnung schon weg. 
[6:17] Wenn du fastest, so salbe dein Haupt und wasche dein Antlitz, 
[6:18] damit die Leute dein Fasten nicht sehen, sondern allein dein Vater, der im Verborgnen wohnt. Dann wird dein Vater, der ins Verborgne sieht, es dir vergelten. 
[6:19] Sammelt euch nicht Schätze hier auf Erden, wo Motten und Würmer Zerstörung üben, und wo Diebe einbrechen und stehlen. 
[6:20] Sammelt euch vielmehr Schätze im Himmel, wo keine Motten und Würmer Zerstörung üben, und wo keine Diebe einbrechen und stehlen. 
[6:21] Denn wo dein Schatz ist, da ist auch dein Herz. 
[6:22] Des Leibes Leuchte ist das Auge. Ist dein Auge gesund, so ist dein ganzer Leib im Lichte. 
[6:23] Ist aber dein Auge krank, so ist dein ganzer Leib in Finsternis. Wenn nun das Licht in dir verfinstert ist, wie groß muß dann die Finsternis sein! 
[6:24] Niemand kann zwei Herren dienen. Denn er wird den einen hassen und den andern lieben oder doch dem einen anhangen und gering von dem andern denken. Ihr könnt nicht Gott und zugleich dem Gelde dienen. 
[6:25] Darum sage ich euch: Sorgt nicht ängstlich für euer Leben, was ihr essen und trinken sollt, auch nicht für euern Leib, was ihr anziehen sollt. Ist nicht das Leben mehr wert als die Nahrung? Und steht der Leib nicht höher als die Kleidung? 
[6:26] Seht auf die Vögel, die unter dem Himmel fliegen! Sie säen nicht, sie ernten nicht, sie sammeln nichts in Speicher; trotzdem ernährt sie euer himmlischer Vater. Steht ihr denn nicht viel höher als sie? 
[6:27] Wer von euch kann mit all seinem Sorgen sein Leben auch nur um eine kurze Spanne Zeit verlängern? 
[6:28] Betrachtet doch die wilden Lilien auf dem Felde, wie sie wachsen! Sie mühen sich nicht ab, sie spinnen nicht. 
[6:29] Und doch — das sage ich euch — ist selbst Salomo in all seiner (königlichen) Pracht nicht so (herrlich) gekleidet gewesen wie eine von ihnen. 
[6:30] Wenn Gott nun das Gras auf dem Felde, das heute noch in Blüte steht und morgen in den Ofen geworfen wird, so herrlich kleidet, wird er da nicht viel mehr euch Kleidung geben, ihr Kleingläubigen? 
[6:31] Darum sollt ihr nicht ängstlich sorgen und sagen: 'Was sollen wir essen? Was sollen wir trinken? Was sollen wir anziehen?' 
[6:32] Denn das sind lauter Fragen, womit sich die Heiden beschäftigen. Euer himmlischer Vater weiß ja, daß ihr dies alles nötig habt. 
[6:33] Trachtet vielmehr vor allem nach dem Königreiche Gottes und nach der Gerechtigkeit, die er verlangt; dann soll euch alles dies daneben auch zuteil werden. 
[6:34] Seid also nicht besorgt im Blick auf morgen; denn der morgende Tag wird selber für sich sorgen. Jeder Tag hat genug an seiner eigenen Mühsal. 
[7:1] Richtet nicht (hart und lieblos), damit ihr nicht (einst ebenso) gerichtet werdet! 
[7:2] Denn ganz ebenso, wie ihr jetzt richtet, sollt ihr dereinst gerichtet werden; und mit dem Maß, womit ihr messet, soll euch (das Urteil) zugemessen werden. 
[7:3] Warum siehst du den Splitter in deines Bruders Auge, während du den Balken in deinem Auge nicht bemerkst? 
[7:4] Oder wie kannst du dir herausnehmen, zu deinem Bruder zu sagen: 'Laß mich den Splitter aus deinem Auge entfernen', während in deinem Auge der Balken steckt? 
[7:5] Du Heuchler, entferne zunächst den Balken aus deinem Auge! Dann erst magst du sehn, wie du den Splitter aus deines Bruders Auge entfernst. 
[7:6] Gebt das Heilige nicht den Hunden preis und werft eure Perlen nicht den Schweinen vor! Sie könnten sie mit ihren Füßen zertreten und sich dann gegen euch wenden und euch zerreißen. 
[7:7] Bittet, so wird euch gegeben! Suchet, so werdet ihr finden! Klopfet an, so wird euch aufgetan! 
[7:8] Denn wer bittet, der empfängt; wer sucht, der findet; und wer anklopft, dem wird aufgetan. 
[7:9] Es wird doch niemand unter euch seinem Sohne, der ihn um Brot bittet, einen Stein geben 
[7:10] oder ihm, wenn er um einen Fisch bittet, eine Schlange reichen. 
[7:11] Wißt ihr nun, obwohl ihr böse seid, euern Kindern gute Gaben zu geben: wieviel mehr wird da euer Vater im Himmel Gutes geben denen, die ihn darum bitten! 
[7:12] Alles nun, was ihr von den Leuten erwartet, das sollt ihr ihnen auch erweisen. Dies ist der Inhalt des Gesetzes und der Propheten. 
[7:13] Tretet ein durch das enge Tor! Denn weit und breit ist der Weg, der ins Verderben führt, und viele wählen diesen Weg. 
[7:14] Wie eng dagegen ist das Tor und wie schmal der Weg, der in das Leben führt, und wie wenige sind es, die ihn finden! 
[7:15] Hütet euch vor den falschen Propheten! Sie kommen in Schafskleidern zu euch, inwendig aber sind sie reißende Wölfe. 
[7:16] An ihren Früchten sollt ihr sie erkennen. Man kann doch nicht Trauben sammeln von Dornbüschen oder Feigen von Distelgestrüpp. 
[7:17] Ebenso bringt jeder edle Baum auch nützliche Früchte, ein schädlicher Baum aber bringt verderbliche Früchte. 
[7:18] Ein edler Baum kann nicht verderbliche Früchte tragen, und ein schädlicher Baum kann nicht nützliche Früchte tragen. 
[7:19] Jeder Baum, der nicht nützliche Früchte bringt, wird abgehauen und ins Feuer geworfen. 
[7:20] An ihren Früchten also sollt ihr sie erkennen. 
[7:21] Nicht jeder, der zu mir sagt: 'Herr, Herr!' wird eingehen in das Königreich der Himmel, vielmehr nur der, der da erfüllt den Willen meines Vaters, der im Himmel ist. 
[7:22] An jenem Tage werden viele zu mir sprechen: 'Herr, Herr! Haben wir nicht kraft deines Namens geweissagt? Haben wir nicht kraft deines Namens böse Geister ausgetrieben? Haben wir nicht kraft deines Namens viele Wunder gewirkt? 
[7:23] Dann werde ich ihnen frei und offen sagen: 'Nie habe ich euch gekannt! Hinweg von mir, ihr Übeltäter! 
[7:24] Wer nun diese meine Worte hört und befolgt, gleicht einem klugen Manne, der sein Haus auf Felsenboden baut. 
[7:25] Wenn dann der Regen niederströmt und Überschwemmung kommt, und wenn die Winde wehen und treffen auf das Haus, so fällt es nicht; denn seine Mauer ruht auf Felsengrund. 
[7:26] Wer aber diese meine Worte hört und nicht befolgt, gleicht einem törichten Manne, der sein Haus auf sandigen Boden baut. 
[7:27] Wenn dann der Regen niederströmt und Überschwemmung kommt, und wenn die Winde wehen und stoßen auf das Haus, so fällt es! Ja es wird ein großer Trümmerhaufen!" 
[7:28] Als Jesus diese Rede vollendet hatte, war die Volksmenge von seiner Lehre ergriffen und betroffen. 
[7:29] Denn er lehrte sie wie einer, der dazu (göttliche) Vollmacht hatte, und nicht wie ihre Schriftgelehrten. 
[8:1] Als er von der Bergeshöhe hinabging, folgten ihm große Scharen 
[8:2] Da näherte sich ihm ein Aussätziger, fiel vor ihm nieder und sprach: "Herr, wenn du willst, so kannst du mich reinigen." 
[8:3] Jesus streckte sein Hand aus, rührte ihn an und sprach: "Ich will es, sei gereinigt!" Sofort ward er von seinem Aussatz rein. 
[8:4] Und Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Hüte dich, irgendwie davon zu reden; doch geh, zeige dich dem Priester und bring das Opfer dar, das Mose vorgeschrieben hat, zum Zeugnis für die Leute!" 
[8:5] Als er nach Kapernaum zurückkam, nahte ihm ein Hauptmann mit den Worten: 
[8:6] "Herr, mein Diener liegt gelähmt zu Hause und hat große Schmerzen." 
[8:7] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Ich soll kommen und ihn heilen?" 
[8:8] Der Hauptmann antwortete: "Herr, ich bin nicht wert, daß du unter mein Dach trittst; sondern sprich nur ein Wort, so wird mein Diener schon genesen. 
[8:9] Denn auch ich bin zwar einem Vorgesetzten untergeben, aber ich habe Kriegsleute unter mir. Sage ich nun zu dem einen: 'Geh!', so geht er, zu dem anderen: 'Komm!', so kommt er, und zu meinem Knechte: 'Tue das!', so tut er's 
[8:10] Als Jesus das hörte, wunderte er sich und sprach zu seinen Begleitern: "Wahrlich, sich sage euch: Nirgends habe ich solchen Glauben in Israel gefunden. 
[8:11] Ich tue euch aber kund: Viele werden von Osten und Westen kommen und mit Abraham, Isaak und Jakob im Königreiche der Himmel am Mahle teilnehmen. 
[8:12] Doch die geborenen Erben des Königreichs werden in die Finsternis, die draußen ist, verstoßen werden; dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein." 
[8:13] Dann sagte Jesus zu dem Hauptmann: "Geh! Dir geschehe, wie du geglaubt!" Und sein Diener ward gesund in jener Stunde. 
[8:14] Dann kam Jesus in des Petrus Haus und sah dessen Schwiegermutter fieberkrank daniederliegen. 
[8:15] Da berührte er ihre Hand, und das Fieber verließ sie. Nun erhob sie sich von ihrem Lager und wartete ihm bei der Mahlzeit auf. 
[8:16] Am Abend brachte man viele Besessene zu ihm; er trieb die (bösen) Geister durch sein Machtwort aus und heilte alle Leidenden. 
[8:17] So erfüllte sich der Ausspruch des Propheten Jesaja: Er hat unsre Gebrechen hinweggenommen, und unsere Krankheiten hat er beseitigt. 
[8:18] Als Jesus dann eine Menge Volks um sich sah, ließ er sich an das andere Ufer fahren. 
[8:19] Da nahte ihm ein Schriftgelehrter mit den Worten: "Meister, ich will dir folgen, wohin du gehst." 
[8:20] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Die Füchse haben Höhlen, und die Vögel, die unter dem Himmel fliegen, haben Nester; doch der Menschensohn hat keine Stätte, wo er sein Haupt niederlegen kann." 
[8:21] Ein anderer seiner Jünger sprach zu ihm: "Herr, erlaube mir, daß ich vorher hingehe und meinen Vater begrabe!" 
[8:22] Jesus aber antwortete ihm: "Folge mir und laß die Toten ihre Toten begraben!" 
[8:23] Dann stieg er in ein Fischerboot, und seine Jünger begleiteten ihn. 
[8:24] Plötzlich erhob sich ein heftiger Sturm auf dem See, so daß die Wogen ins Fahrzeug schlugen. Er aber schlief. 
[8:25] Da traten die Jünger zu ihm und weckten ihn mit dem Rufe: "Herr, hilf uns, wir ertrinken!" 
[8:26] Er aber sprach zu ihnen: "Was seid ihr so furchtsam, ihr Kleingläubigen?" Dann stand er auf und schalt die Winde und den See. Da ward eine tiefe Stille. 
[8:27] Die Leute aber sprachen voll Verwunderung: "Was ist das für ein Mann, daß ihm sogar Wind und Wogen gehorchen!" 
[8:28] Als er ans andre Ufer kam in das Gebiet der Gadarener, begegneten ihm zwei Besessene: die kamen aus den Felsengräbern und waren sehr gefährlich, so daß niemand jenes Weges gehen konnte. 
[8:29] Und sie fingen an zu schreien: "Was haben wir mit dir zu schaffen, du Gottessohn? Bist du hierhergekommen, um uns vor der Zeit zu quälen?" 
[8:30] Nun weidete in der Ferne eine große Schweineherde. 
[8:31] Da baten ihn die bösen Geister: "Treibst du uns aus, so laß uns in die Schweineherde fahren!" 
[8:32] Er sprach zu ihnen: "Geht!" Da fuhren sie aus und gingen in die Schweine. Nun stürmte die ganze Herde den Abhang hinunter in den See und kam in den Fluten um 
[8:33] Die Hirten aber flohen. Bei ihrer Ankunft in der Stadt erzählten sie den ganzen Vorgang, und was mit den Besessenen geschehen war. 
[8:34] Da gingen alle Einwohner hinaus, Jesus entgegen, und als sie ihn trafen, baten sie ihn, er möge ihr Gebiet verlassen. 
[9:1] Er stieg nun in ein Fahrzeug, fuhr über den See und kam in seine Stadt. 
[9:2] Dort brachte man auf einem Tragbett einen Gelähmten zu ihm. Als Jesus ihren Glauben sah, sprach er zu dem Gelähmten: "Sei getrost, mein Sohn, deine Sünden sind dir vergeben!" 
[9:3] Da dachten einige Schriftgelehrte bei sich: "Der Mann lästert Gott." 
[9:4] Jesus durchschaute ihre Gedanken und sprach: "Warum denkt ihr Böses in euern Herzen? 
[9:5] Was ist denn leichter, zu sagen: 'Deine Sünden sind dir vergeben' oder das Wort zu sprechen: 'Steh auf und wandle'? 
[9:6] Ihr sollt aber sehen, daß der Menschensohn die Vollmacht hat, auf Erden Sünden zu vergeben." Nun wandte er sich zu dem Gelähmten und sprach: "Steh auf, nimm dein Bett und geh nach Hause!" 
[9:7] Da stand er auf und ging nach Hause. 
[9:8] Bei diesen Anblick wurden die Leute mit heiliger Scheu erfüllt und priesen Gott, der den Menschen solche Vollmacht gegeben. 
[9:9] Als Jesus von dort weiterging, sah er einen Mann, mit Namen Matthäus, vor seinem Zollhaus sitzen, und er sprach zu ihm: "Folge mir!" Da stand er auf und folgte ihm. 
[9:10] Während nun Jesus in des Matthäus Haus zu Gast war, fanden sich auch viele Zöllner und Sünder ein und nahmen mit Jesus und seinen Jüngern an dem Mahle teil. 
[9:11] Als das die Pharisäer sahen, sprachen sie zu seinen Jüngern: "Warum ißt euer Meister mit den Zöllnern und Sündern?" 
[9:12] Jesus hörte das und erwiderte: "Die Gesunden bedürfen des Arztes nicht, sondern die Kranken. 
[9:13] Geht aber hin und lernt, was das Wort bedeutet: Barmherzigkeit will ich und nicht Opfer. Denn ich bin nicht gekommen, um Gerechte zu berufen, sondern Sünder." 
[9:14] Darauf kamen die Jünger des Johannes zu ihm und sprachen: "Warum fasten wir und die Pharisäer so oft, während deine Jünger nicht fasten?" 
[9:15] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Können denn die Hochzeitsgäste trauern, solange der Bräutigam bei ihnen ist? Es kommt jedoch die Zeit, wo ihnen der Bräutigam entrissen ist, dann werden sie fasten. 
[9:16] Niemand setzt einen Flicken von neuem Tuch auf ein altes Kleid. Sonst reißt der Einsatz noch an anderen Stellen etwas von dem Kleid weg, und der Riß wird desto ärger. 
[9:17] Man gießt auch nicht neuen Wein in alte Schläuche. Sonst reißen die Schläuche: dann fließt der Wein aus, und die Schläuche sind verloren. Man gießt vielmehr neuen Wein in neue Schläuche: so halten sich beide." 
[9:18] Als er so zu ihnen redete, da kam ein Vorsteher, der fiel vor ihm nieder und sprach: "Meine Tochter ist soeben gestorben; aber komm und leg deine Hand auf sie, dann wird sie wieder lebendig!" 
[9:19] Jesus erhob sich und folgte ihm mit seinen Jüngern. 
[9:20] Und sieh, eine Frau, die schon zwölf Jahre am Blutfluß litt, trat von hinten an ihn heran und berührte die Quaste seines Mantels. 
[9:21] Denn sie dachte bei sich: wenn ich nur seinen Mantel berühre, so werde ich gesund. 
[9:22] Jesus wandte sich um, erblickte sie und sprach: "Sei getrost, meine Tochter; dein Glaube hat dich schon gesund gemacht!" Und von dem Augenblick an ward die Frau gesund. 
[9:23] Dann kam Jesus in das Haus des Vorstehers. Beim Anblick der Flötenspieler und der lärmenden Menge aber sprach er: 
[9:24] "Geht hinaus!" Denn das Mädchen ist nicht tot, es schläft nur." Da verlachten sie ihn. 
[9:25] Als aber die Leute aus dem Hause geschickt waren, trat er ein und faßte das Mädchen bei der Hand. Da stand es auf. 
[9:26] Und die Kunde davon verbreitete sich in jener ganzen Gegend. 
[9:27] Als Jesus von dort weiterging, folgten ihm zwei Blinde, die riefen laut: "Erbarme dich unser, Sohn Davids!" 
[9:28] Als dann Jesus in sein Haus kam, traten die Blinden zu ihm. Jesus fragte sie: "Glaubt ihr, daß ich dies tun kann?" Sie antworteten: "Ja, Herr!" 
[9:29] Nun berührte er ihre Augen mit den Worten: "Nach euerm Glauben geschehe euch!" 
[9:30] Da taten sich ihre Augen auf. Und Jesus befahl ihnen streng: "Gebt acht, daß es niemand erfahre!" 
[9:31] Sobald sie aber das Haus verlassen hatten, machten sie ihn in jener ganzen Gegend bekannt. 
[9:32] Gerade als sie weggingen, brachte man einen Menschen zu ihm, der durch den Einfluß eines bösen Geistes stumm war. 
[9:33] Doch nach der Austreibung des bösen Geistes konnte der Stumme reden. Da verwunderten sich die Leute und sprachen: "So etwas hat man noch nie in Israel erlebt." 
[9:34] Die Pharisäer aber sagten: "Im Bunde mit dem obersten der bösen Geister treibt er die Geister aus." 
[9:35] So durchwanderte Jesus alle Städte und Dörfer: er lehrte in ihren Versammlungshäusern, verkündigte die Frohe Botschaft vom Königreich und heilte allerlei Krankheiten und Gebrechen. 
[9:36] Beim Anblick der Volksscharen aber ward er von Mitleid erfüllt, denn sie waren abgetrieben und ermattet wie Schafe ohne Hirten. 
[9:37] Da sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Die Ernte ist groß, aber der Arbeiter sind wenig. 
[9:38] Darum bittet den Herrn der Ernte, daß er Arbeiter auf sein Erntefeld sende!" 
[10:1] Dann rief er seine zwölf Jünger herbei und gab ihnen Vollmacht, unreine Geister auszutreiben und allerlei Krankheiten und Gebrechen zu heilen. Dies sind aber die Namen der zwölf Apostel: 
[10:2] Simon, genannt Petrus, — als erster — und seinen Bruder Andreas; Jakobus, des Zebedäus Sohn, und sein Bruder Johannes; 
[10:3] Philippus und Bartholomäus; Thomas und der Zöllner Matthäus; Jakobus, des Alphäus Sohn, und Lebbäus mit dem Beinamen Thaddäus; 
[10:4] Simon der Eiferer und Judas aus Kariot, der ihn verraten hat. 
[10:5] Diese Zwölf sandte Jesus aus mit folgendem Auftrag: "Nehmt euern Weg nicht zu den Heiden und betretet keine Stadt der Samariter! 
[10:6] Geht vielmehr zu den verirrten Schafen des Hauses Israel! 
[10:7] Geht und verkündigt: 'Das Königreich der Himmel ist nahe herbeigekommen!' 
[10:8] Heilt die Kranken, erweckt die Toten, reinigt die Aussätzigen, treibt die bösen Geister aus! Umsonst habt ihr's empfangen, umsonst sollt ihr's geben. 
[10:9] Steckt euch kein Gold, kein Silber und kein Kupfergeld in eure Gürtel! 
[10:10] Nehmt keine Ranzen mit euch auf den Weg, auch nicht zwei Unterkleider, keine Schuhe, keinen Wanderstab! Denn der Arbeiter ist seiner Nahrung wert. 
[10:11] Kommt ihr in eine Stadt oder in ein Dorf, so erkundigt euch, wer dort (euch aufzunehmen) verdient; bleibt dann so lange da, bis ihr weiterzieht! 
[10:12] Bei euern Eintritt aber wünscht dem Hause Frieden! 
[10:13] Ist nun das Haus es wert, so wird der Friede, den ihr wünscht, ihm auch zuteil; verdient es ihn aber nicht, so fällt der Friedensgruß auf euch zurück. 
[10:14] Und wo man euch nicht aufnimmt noch eure Botschaft hören will, ein solches Haus und eine solche Stadt verlasset und schüttelt den Staub von euern Füßen! 
[10:15] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Dem Lande Sodom und Gomorra wird es am Tage des Gerichts viel besser gehn als solcher Stadt. 
[10:16] Ich sende euch jetzt wie Schafe mitten unter Wölfe. So seid denn klug wie die Schlangen, aber auch ohne Falsch wie die Tauben! 
[10:17] Seid aber vor den Menschen auf der Hut! Denn sie werden euch den Gerichten überliefern, und in ihren Versammlungshäusern werden sie euch geißeln. 
[10:18] Ja man wird euch vor Statthalter und Könige führen um meinetwillen, damit ihr ihnen und den Heiden ein Zeugnis gebt. 
[10:19] Stellt man euch nun vor ein Gericht, so macht euch keine Sorte, wie oder was ihr reden sollt! Denn in jenem Augenblick wird euch das rechte Wort gegeben werden. 
[10:20] Ihr seid es ja nicht, die dann reden, sondern es ist euers Vaters Geist, der durch euch redet. 
[10:21] Ein Bruder aber wird den andern zum Tode bringen und Väter ihre Kinder; ja Kinder werden sich erheben gegen ihre Eltern und sie töten lassen. 
[10:22] Und allgemein wird man euch hassen, weil ihr Bekenner meines Namens seid. Wer aber ausharrt bis ans Ende, der soll errettet werden. 
[10:23] Verfolgen sie euch nun in einer Stadt, so flieht in eine andere! Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Vor des Menschensohnes Kommen wird eure Arbeit an den Städten Israels noch nicht vollendet sein. 
[10:24] Ein Schüler darf kein anderes Los erwarten als sein Lehrer; ein Sklave soll's nicht besser haben wollen als sein Herr. 
[10:25] Der Schüler muß zufrieden sein, wenn es ihm geht wie seinem Lehrer, der Sklave, wenn es ihm geht wie seinen Herrn. Hat man den Hausherrn mit dem Namen Beelzebul geschmäht, um wieviel mehr wird man seine Hausgenossen so schmähen. 
[10:26] Fürchtet euch darum nicht vor ihnen! Denn nichts ist so verhüllt, daß es nicht einst enthüllt würde; und nichts ist so verborgen, daß es nicht einst gesehen würde. 
[10:27] Was ich euch im geheimen sage, das verkündigt öffentlich; und was ich euch ins Ohr flüstere, das predigt auf den Dächern! 
[10:28] Seid dabei ohne Furcht vor denen, die wohl den Leib, doch nicht die Seele töten können! Seid aber voller Furcht vor dem, der Seele und Leib in der Hölle verderben kann! 
[10:29] Verkauft man nicht zwei Sperlinge für fünf Pfennige? Trotzdem fällt kein einziger von ihnen zu Boden ohne euers Vaters Willen. 
[10:30] Bei euch sind aber sogar die Haare euers Hauptes allesamt gezählt. 
[10:31] Darum habt keine Furcht! Ihr seid mehr wert als viele Sperlinge. 
[10:32] Wer sich nun zu mir bekennt vor den Menschen, zu dem will ich mich auch bekennen vor meinem Vater im Himmel. 
[10:33] Wer mich aber verleugnet vor den Menschen, den will ich auch verleugnen vor meinem Vater im Himmel. 
[10:34] Denkt nicht, ich sei gekommen, um Frieden auf die Erde zu bringen! Ich bin nicht gekommen, um Frieden zu bringen, sondern Krieg. 
[10:35] Denn ich bin gekommen, um zu entzweien Vater und Sohn, Mutter und Tochter, Schwiegermutter und Schwiegertochter; 
[10:36] und die eignen Hausgenossen wird man zu Feinden haben. 
[10:37] Wer Vater oder Mutter mehr liebt als mich, der ist mein nicht wert; wer Sohn oder Tochter mehr liebt als mich, der ist mein nicht wert. 
[10:38] Wer nicht sein Kreuz auf sich nimmt, und mir nachfolgt, der ist mein nicht wert. 
[10:39] Sein Leben retten heißt: es verlieren! Sein Leben verlieren um meinetwillen heißt: es retten! 
[10:40] Wer euch aufnimmt, der nimmt mich auf; und wer mich aufnimmt, der nimmt den auf, der mich gesandt hat. 
[10:41] Wer einen Propheten als solchen aufnimmt, der wird den Lohn empfangen, den ein Prophet empfängt; wer einen Gerechten als solchen aufnimmt, der wird den Lohn empfangen, den ein Gerechter empfängt. 
[10:42] Und wer einem dieser kleinen Kinder hier auch nur einen Becher frischen Wassers zum Trunke reicht, weil es mein Jünger ist, der soll — das sage ich euch feierlich — gewiß nicht seines Lebens verlustig gehen!" 
[11:1] Als Jesus seinen zwölf Jüngern diese Weisungen erteilt hatte, ging er von dort weiter, um in den Städten des Landes zu lehren und zu predigen. 
[11:2] Als Johannes im Gefängnis von der Wirksamkeit des Messias hörte, ließ er ihn durch seine Jünger fragen: 
[11:3] "Bist du es, der kommen soll, oder müssen wir auf einen anderen warten?" 
[11:4] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Geht und berichtet Johannes, was ihr hört und seht: 
[11:5] Blinde werden sehend und Lahme gehen, Aussätzige werden rein und Taube hören, ja Tote werden auferweckt und Armen wird die Heilsbotschaft verkündigt; 
[11:6] und selig ist, wer an mir nicht irre wird!" 
[11:7] Als die Boten weggingen, begann Jesus zu den Volksscharen von Johannes zu reden: "Warum seid ihr einst in die Wüste hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr euch ein Schilfrohr ansehen, das sich im Winde hin und her bewegte? Doch sicher nicht! 
[11:8] Warum seid ihr denn hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr einen feingekleideten Weltmann sehen? Solche feingekleidete Leute finden sich an den Königshöfen. 
[11:9] Warum seid ihr denn hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr einen Propheten sehen? Ja ich sage euch: Dieser Mann ist noch weit mehr als ein Prophet. 
[11:10] Denn er ist es, von dem geschrieben steht: Sieh, ich sende meinen Boten vor dir her, der deinen Weg vor dir bereiten soll 
[11:11] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Unter allen Weibersöhnen ist kein Größerer aufgetreten als Johannes der Täufer; doch der Kleinste im Königreich der Himmel ist größer als er. 
[11:12] Aber seit dem Auftreten Johannes des Täufers bis jetzt wird das Königreich der Himmel gestürmt. Und die Stürmer reißen es an sich. 
[11:13] Denn alle Propheten und das Gesetz haben davon geweissagt bis auf Johannes. 
[11:14] Und wollt ihr's gelten lassen: er ist der Elia, der kommen soll. 
[11:15] Wer Ohren hat, der höre! 
[11:16] Wem soll ich aber das Volk von heute vergleichen? Es gleicht Kindern, die auf der Straße sitzen und ihren Gespielen zurufen: 
[11:17] Wir haben euch die Flöte gespielt, doch ihr habt nicht getanzt; wir haben ein Klagelied gesungen, doch ihr habt nicht geweint. 
[11:18] Johannes ist aufgetreten und hat streng enthaltsam gelebt in Speise und Trank; da sagte man: 'Er ist von einem bösen Geist besessen!' 
[11:19] Der Menschensohn ist aufgetreten und ißt und trinkt wie andere; da sagt man nun: 'Seht, er ist ein Fresser und Weintrinker, der Zöllner und Sünder Freund'. Aber doch ist die Weisheit (Gottes) durch ihr ganzes Tun gerechtfertigt worden." 
[11:20] Dann fing er an, die Städte zu schelten, in denen seine meisten Wundertaten geschehen waren, und die sich trotzdem nicht bekehrt hatten: 
[11:21] "Weh dir, Chorazin! Wehe dir, Bethsaida. Denn wären in Tyrus und Sidon die Wundertaten geschehen, die in euch geschehen sind, sie hätten sich schon längst, in Sack und Asche sitzend, bekehrt. 
[11:22] Doch ich sage euch: Es wird Tyrus und Sidon am Tage des Gerichts erträglicher gehen als euch. 
[11:23] Und du, Kapernaum, meinst du vielleicht, du wirst bis zum Himmel erhoben? In die Tiefe der Unterwelt sollst du hinabgestürzt werden! Denn wären in Sodom die Wundertaten geschehen, die in dir geschehen sind, es stünde noch heutigentags. 
[11:24] Doch ich sage euch: Es wird dem Lande Sodom am Tage des Gerichts erträglicher gehen als dir." 
[11:25] Zu jener Zeit tat Jesus seinen Mund auf und sprach: "Ich preise dich, o Vater, Herr des Himmels und der Erde, daß du dies den Weisen und Verständigen verborgen und es den Einfältigen offenbart hast. 
[11:26] Ja, Vater, so hat dir's gefallen! 
[11:27] Alles ist mir von meinem Vater übergeben worden. Und niemand kennt den Sohn vollkommen als nur der Vater; auch kennt niemand den Vater recht als nur der Sohn und der, dem der Sohn es offenbaren will. 
[11:28] Kommt alle her zu mir, die ihr euch abmüht und von Last gedrückt seid! Ich will euch Ruhe schenken. 
[11:29] Nehmt mein Joch auf euch und lernt von mir; denn ich bin mild und voller Herzensdemut; dann werdet ihr Ruhe finden für eure Seelen. 
[11:30] Denn mein Joch ist sanft, und meine Last ist leicht." 
[12:1] Zu jener Zeit ging Jesus an einem Sabbat durch Getreidefelder. Seine Jünger aber hatten Hunger; darum begannen sie, Ähren abzureißen und die Körner zu essen. 
[12:2] Das sahen die Pharisäer und sprachen zu ihm: "Sieh, deine Jünger tun, was nicht erlaubt ist am Sabbat." 
[12:3] Er aber antwortete ihnen: "Habt ihr nicht gelesen, was David tat, als ihn und seine Begleiter hungerte? 
[12:4] Wie er in das Haus Gottes trat und die Schaubrote aß, die doch er und seine Begleiter nicht essen durften, sondern nur die Priester? 
[12:5] Habt ihr ferner nicht gelesen im Gesetz, daß die Priester im Tempel auch am Sabbat tätig sind, ohne sich zu versündigen? 
[12:6] Doch ich sage euch: Hier ist etwas Größeres als der Tempel. 
[12:7] Verstündet ihr aber die Bedeutung des Wortes: Barmherzigkeit will ich und nicht Opfer, so hättet ihr die Schuldlosen nicht verurteilt. 
[12:8] Denn der Menschensohn ist Herr des Sabbats." 
[12:9] Als er von dort weiterging, kam er in ihr Versammlungshaus. 
[12:10] Da war ein Mann mit einem abgestorbenen Arm, und sie fragten ihn: "Ist es erlaubt, am Sabbat zu heilen?" Denn sie suchten einen Grund, ihn zu verklagen. 
[12:11] Er aber antwortete ihnen: "Fiele einem von euch am Sabbat sein einziges Schaf in eine Grube, zöge er's da nicht sofort heraus? 
[12:12] Steht nun ein Mensch nicht hoch über einem Schaf? Also darf man auch am Sabbat Gutes tun." 
[12:13] Dann sprach er zu dem Mann: "Strecke deinen Arm aus!" Da streckte er ihn aus, und er ward wiederhergestellt und gesund wie der andere. 
[12:14] Als dann die Pharisäer den Gottesdienst verließen, berieten sie sich miteinander wider ihn, wie sie ihn zu Tode bringen könnten. 
[12:15] Aber Jesus erfuhr das und verließ jene Gegend. Viele begleiteten ihn, und er heilte alle. 
[12:16] Aber er schärfte ihnen ein, sie sollten ihn nicht öffentlich bekanntmachen, 
[12:17] damit sich der Ausspruch des Propheten Jesaja erfüllte: 
[12:18] Das ist mein Knecht, den ich erwählt, und mein Geliebter, den mein Herz erkoren. Ich lege meinen Geist auf ihn, und er soll den Völkern Recht verkünden. 
[12:19] Er wird nicht zanken und nicht schreien, und seine Stimme schallt nicht auf den Straßen. 
[12:20] Geknicktes Rohr zerbricht er nicht, und glimmenden Docht löscht er nicht aus, bis er das Recht zu Sieg geführt. 
[12:21] Und auf seinen Namen werden die Völker hoffen. 
[12:22] Da wurde ein Besessener zu ihm gebracht, der war blind und stumm. Und er heilte ihn, so daß der Stumme redete und sah. 
[12:23] Da waren die Leute alle außer sich und sprachen: "Ist der etwa Davids Sohn?" 
[12:24] Als aber die Pharisäer davon hörten, sagten sie: "Nur im Bunde mit Beelzebul, dem Obersten der bösen Geister, treibt er die Teufel aus." 
[12:25] Er aber durchschaute ihre Gedanken und sprach zu ihnen: "Jedes Reich, das in sich selbst uneins ist, das fällt in Trümmer; und jede Stadt oder jedes Haus, das in sich selbst uneins ist, kann nicht bestehen. 
[12:26] Treibt nun der Satan den Satan aus, so ist er ja mit sich selbst im Streit: wie sollte da sein Reich bestehen können? 
[12:27] Treibe ich aber im Bunde mit Beelzebul die bösen Geister aus, mit wessen Hilfe treiben sie denn eure Anhänger aus? Sie werden darum eure Richter sein! 
[12:28] Treibe ich aber durch Gottes Geist die bösen Geister aus, so ist ja Gottes Königreich zu euch gekommen. 
[12:29] Oder wie kann jemand in das Haus eines starken Kriegsmannes dringen und ihm seinen Hausrat rauben, wenn er nicht zuvor den Starken bindet? Erst dann kann er sein Haus berauben. 
[12:30] Wer nicht mit mir ist, der ist gegen mich; und wer nicht mit mir sammelt, der zerstreut. 
[12:31] Darum sage ich euch: Jede Sünde und Lästerung wird den Menschen vergeben, die Lästerung des Geistes aber wird nicht vergeben. 
[12:32] Wer ein Wort sagt gegen den Menschensohn, dem wird vergeben. Wer aber wider den Heiligen Geist redet, der findet keine Vergebung: weder in dieser Weltzeit noch in der zukünftigen. 
[12:33] Erklärt ihr den Baum für gut, so müßt ihr auch seine Frucht für gut halten. Erklärt ihr aber den Baum für schädlich, so müßt ihr auch seine Frucht für schädlich halten. Denn an der Frucht erkennt man den Baum. 
[12:34] Ihr Schlangenbrut! wie könnt ihr Gutes reden, da ihr böse seid? Denn des Mundes Worte fließen aus des Herzens Quell. 
[12:35] Ein guter Mensch entnimmt aus seiner guten Vorratskammer Gutes; ein böser Mensch entnimmt aus seiner bösen Vorratskammer Böses. 
[12:36] Ich versichere euch aber: Von jedem bösen Worte, das die Menschen reden, müssen sie am Tage des Gerichtes Rechenschaft geben. 
[12:37] Denn nach deinen Worten sollst du freigesprochen und nach deinen Worten sollst du verurteilt werden." 
[12:38] Da redeten ihn einige Schriftgelehrte und Pharisäer an und sprachen: "Meister, wir wünschen von dir ein Zeichen zu sehen." 
[12:39] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ein böses, gottvergessenes Geschlecht begehrt ein Zeichen. Es soll ihm aber kein anderes Zeichen gegeben werden als das Zeichen des Propheten Jona. 
[12:40] Denn wie Jona drei Tage und drei Nächte in des Riesenfisches Leib gewesen ist, so wird auch der Menschensohn drei Tage und drei Nächte im Schoß der Erde sein. 
[12:41] Die Leute aus Ninive werden zugleich mit diesen Geschlecht vor Gericht erscheinen und es verurteilen; denn sie bekehrten sich bei Jonas Predigt. Und hier steht doch einer, der größer ist als Jona! 
[12:42] Die Königin aus Süden wird zugleich mit diesem Geschlecht vor Gericht erscheinen und es verurteilen; denn sie kam vom Ende der Erde, um Salomos Weisheit zu hören. Und hier steht doch einer, der größer ist als Salomo! 
[12:43] Ist der unreine Geist von einem Menschen ausgefahren, so wandert er durch Wüsten: er sucht dort eine Ruhstatt und findet keine. 
[12:44] Dann spricht er: 'Ich will zurückgehen in mein Haus, das ich verlassen habe.' Und kommt er dann, so findet er es leer, gefegt und wohlgeschmückt. 
[12:45] Nun geht er hin und holt noch sieben andere Geister, die schlimmer sind als er: die ziehen ein und wohnen dort. So wird's mit einem solchen Menschen am Ende ärger als zuvor. Ganz ebenso wird es auch gehen mit diesem bösen Geschlecht." 
[12:46] Als er noch zum dem Volke redete, siehe, da standen seine Mutter und seine Brüder draußen und wünschten ihn zu sprechen. 
[12:47]  
[12:48] Er aber antwortete dem, der ihm dies meldete: "Wer ist meine Mutter, und wer sind meine Brüder?" 
[12:49] Dann wies er mit ausgestreckter Hand auf seine Jünger und sprach: "Da seht meine Mutter und meine Brüder! 
[12:50] Denn wer den Willen meines Vaters im Himmel tut, der ist mir Bruder, Schwester und Mutter." 
[13:1] An jenem Tage ging Jesus aus seinem Hause und setzte sich an den Strand des Sees. 
[13:2] Da sammelte sich eine große Schar um ihn. Deshalb trat er in einen Fischerkahn und setzte sich dort nieder, während das ganze Volk am Ufer stand. 
[13:3] Und er redete zu ihnen vielerlei durch Gleichnisse und sprach: 
[13:4] "Ein Sämann ging aus zu säen. Beim Säen fielen einige Körner an den Weg. Da kamen die Vögel und pickten sie auf. 
[13:5] Andere Körner fielen auf steinigen Grund, wo sie nicht viel Erde hatten. Dort schossen sie schnell in den Halm, weil es der Erdschicht an Tiefe fehlte. 
[13:6] Als dann die Sonne heiß schien, litten die Halme von ihrer Glut; und weil sie nicht Wurzel hatten, verdorrten sie. 
[13:7] Andere Körner fielen dahin, wo Dornen wuchsen. Da schossen die Dornen auf und erstickten die Saat. 
[13:8] Andere Körner fielen auf guten Boden und brachten Frucht: hundertfältig, sechzigfältig, dreißigfältig. 
[13:9] Wer Ohren hat, der höre!" 
[13:10] Da traten seine Jünger zu ihm und sprachen: "Warum redest du zu ihnen in Gleichnissen?" 
[13:11] Er antwortete: "Weil euch die Fähigkeit verliehen ist, in die Geheimnisse des Königreichs der Himmel einzudringen, jenen aber nicht 
[13:12] Denn wer (viel) hat, der soll noch mehr empfangen, daß er die Fülle habe; doch wer nur wenig hat, dem soll sogar das wenige genommen werden. 
[13:13] Gerade deshalb rede ich zu ihnen in Gleichnissen, weil sie trotz ihrer Augen nicht sehen und trotz ihrer Ohren nicht hören und verstehen. 
[13:14] So erfüllt sich an ihnen die Weissagung Jesajas: Hören sollt ihr und nicht verstehen, sehen und nicht erkennen, 
[13:15] denn dieses Volkes Herz ist unempfänglich, ihre Ohren hören schwer, und ihre Augen haben sie verschlossen. (So können sie nicht sehen mit ihren Augen, mit ihren Ohren können sie nicht hören, mit ihrem Herzen nicht verstehen und sich bekehren, daß ich sie heile.) 
[13:16] Glückselig aber sind eure Augen, weil sie sehen, und eure Ohren, weil sie hören. 
[13:17] Denn viele Propheten und Gerechte — das versichere ich euch — haben sich gesehnt, zu schauen was ihr seht, und haben es nicht geschaut, und zu hören, was ihr hört, und haben es nicht gehört. 
[13:18] Euch nun will ich das Gleichnis vom Sämann deuten: 
[13:19] Hört einer das Wort vom Königreich und hat kein Verständnis dafür, so kommt der Böse und nimmt den Samen weg, der in sein Herz gesät war: bei solchem fällt der Same an den Weg. 
[13:20] Was auf steinigen Boden fällt, das bedeutet einen, der das Wort hört und es sogleich mit Freuden aufnimmt; 
[13:21] es schlägt aber nicht Wurzel in ihm, sondern er hält nur eine Zeitlang aus. Kommen Trübsal und Verfolgung um des Wortes willen, so wird er bald im Glauben wankend. 
[13:22] Was dahin fällt, wo Dornen wachsen, das bedeutet einen Hörer, bei dem die Sorge um die irdischen Dinge und der verführerische Reiz des Reichtums das Wort zu ersticken, so daß es fruchtlos bleibt. 
[13:23] Was aber auf guten Boten fällt, dies bedeutete einen Hörer, der für das Verständnis hat: der bringt dann Frucht, der eine hundertfältig, der andere sechzigfältig, der dritte dreißigfältig. 
[13:24] Ein anderes Gleichnis trug er ihnen vor, indem er sprach: "Das Königreich der Himmel gleicht einem Menschen, der guten Samen auf seinen Acker säte. 
[13:25] Als aber die Leute schliefen, kam sein Feind: der streute Unkrautsamen mitten unter den Weizen und ging dann weg. 
[13:26] Als nun die Saat aufging und Frucht ansetzte, zeigte sich auch das Unkraut. 
[13:27] Da kamen die Knechte zum Hausherrn und sprachen: 'Herr, hast du nicht guten Samen auf deinen Acker gesät? Woher hat er denn das Unkraut?' 
[13:28] Er antwortete ihnen: 'Das hat ein Feind getan.' Da fragten ihn seine Knechte: 'Sollen wir nun hingehen und es ausjäten?' 
[13:29] Er sagte: 'Nein; ihr würdet sonst beim Sammeln des Unkrauts auch den Weizen mit ausreißen. 
[13:30] Laßt beides miteinander wachsen bis zur Ernte. Zur Erntezeit will ich dann den Schnittern sagen: Sammelt zuerst das Unkraut und bindet es in Bündel zum Verbrennen, den Weizen aber bringt in meinen Speicher!'" 
[13:31] Ein anderes Gleichnis trug er ihnen vor: "Das Königreich der Himmel ist einem Senfkorn gleich, das einer nimmt und auf seinen Acker sät. 
[13:32] Es ist das kleinste unter allen Samenkörnern. Ist es aber ausgewachsen, so ist es größer als die anderen Gartenkräuter und wird sogar ein Baum, so daß die Vögel des Himmels kommen und in seinen Zweigen nisten." 
[13:33] Ein anderes Gleichnis redete er zu ihnen: "Das Königreich der Himmel gleicht einem Sauerteig, den eine Frau nimmt und ihn so lange in drei Scheffel Weizenmehl knetet, bis der ganze Teig durchsäuert ist." 
[13:34] Dies alles redete Jesus zu dem Volk in Gleichnissen, und ohne Gleichnis redete er nichts zu ihnen, damit sich der Ausspruch des Propheten erfülle: Ich will meinen Mund zu Gleichnisreden öffnen; ich will verkünden, was seit Anbeginn der Welt verhüllt gewesen ist. 
[13:35] 
[13:36] Dann entließ er die Volksmenge und kehrte in sein Haus zurück. Da traten seine Jünger zu ihm und sprachen: "Deute uns das Gleichnis vom Unkraut auf dem Acker!" 
[13:37] Er antwortete: "Der Sämann, der den guten Samen ausstreut, ist der Menschensohn. 
[13:38] Der Acker ist die Welt. Der gute Same sind die Kinder des Königreichs. Das Unkraut sind die Kinder des Bösen. 
[13:39] Der Feind, der das Unkraut sät, ist der Teufel. Die Ernte ist das Ende dieser Weltzeit. Die Schnitter sind die Engel. 
[13:40] Wie man nun das Unkraut sammelt und mit Feuer verbrennt, so wird es auch am Ende dieser Weltzeit gehen. 
[13:41] Der Menschensohn wird seine Engel senden; die sollen aus seinem Königreich alle Verführer und Übeltäter sammeln 
[13:42] und sie in den Feuerofen werfen: dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein. 
[13:43] Dann werden die Gerechten hervorleuchten wie die Sonne in ihres Vaters Königreich. Wer Ohren hat, der höre! 
[13:44] Das Königreich der Himmel gleicht einem Schatz, der in einem Ackerfeld vergraben liegt. Den findet einer, deckt ihn wieder zu (mit Erde) und geht dann hin in seiner Freude, verkauft all seine Habe und kauft den Acker. 
[13:45] Weiter gleicht das Königreich der Himmel einem Händler, der wertvolle Perlen sucht. 
[13:46] Hat er aber eine besonders wertvolle Perle gefunden, so geht er hin, verkauft all seine Habe und kauft die Perle. 
[13:47] Weiter gleicht das Königreich der Himmel einem Schleppnetz, das ins Meer geworfen wird und womit man allerlei Fische fängt. 
[13:48] Ist es voll, so zieht man es ans Ufer. Dort setzen sich die Fischer und sammeln die guten Fische in Gefäße, die schlechten aber werfen sie weg. 
[13:49] So wird es auch am Ende dieser Weltzeit sein. Die Engel werden ausgehen, sie werden die Bösen von den Gerechten scheiden 
[13:50] und sie in den Feuerofen werfen: dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein. 
[13:51] Hab ihr dies alles verstanden?" 
[13:52] Sie antworteten ihm: "Jawohl!" Dann fuhr er fort: "Darum gilt hier der Satz: Jeder Schriftgelehrte, der für den Dienst des Königreichs der Himmel ausgebildet worden ist, gleicht einem Hausherrn, der aus seinem Vorrat Neues und Altes mitteilt." 
[13:53] Als Jesus diese Gleichnisreden vollendet hatte, zog er von dort weg 
[13:54] und kam in seine Vaterstadt. Dort lehrte er die Leute in ihrem Versammlungshaus, so daß sie voller Staunen sprachen: "Woher hat der Mann solche Weisheit und Wunderkräfte? 
[13:55] Ist er nicht des Tischlers Sohn? Heißt nicht seine Mutter Maria? Sind nicht Jakobus, Josef, Simon und Judas seine Brüder? 
[13:56] Wohnen nicht auch seine Schwestern alle hier bei uns? Woher hat er denn dies alles?" 
[13:57] Und sie wollten nichts von ihm wissen. Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Ein Prophet gilt nirgends weniger als in seiner Heimat und im Kreise seiner Hausgenossen." 
[13:58] Er tat dort auch nur wenig Wunder, weil sie nicht glaubten. 
[14:1] Um jene Zeit hörte der Vierfürst Herodes von Jesus, 
[14:2] und er sprach zu seinen Hofleuten: "Das ist Johannes der Täufer! Der ist von den Toten auferstanden, darum sind die Wunderkräfte in ihm wirksam." 
[14:3] Herodes hatte nämlich damals Johannes ergreifen, mit Ketten binden und gefangensetzen lassen wegen Herodias, der Frau seines Bruders Philippus. 
[14:4] Denn Johannes hatte ihm gesagt: "Du darfst sie nicht zur Frau haben." 
[14:5] Er hätte ihn nun gern getötet; aber er scheute sich vor dem Volke, denn das hielt ihn für einen Propheten. 
[14:6] Da geschah es bei der Geburtstagsfeier des Herodes, daß die Tochter der Herodias vor den Gästen tanzte. Das gefiel Herodes so sehr, 
[14:7] daß er ihr eidlich versprach, er wolle ihr geben, um was sie bitte. 
[14:8] Da sprach sie, von ihrer Mutter dazu angestiftet: "Gib mir hier auf einer Schüssel das Haupt Johannes des Täufers!" 
[14:9] Darüber ward der König betrübt. Doch um des Eides und der Tischgenossen willen befahl er's ihr zu geben. 
[14:10] So sandte er denn hin und ließ Johannes in seinem Kerker enthaupten. 
[14:11] Sein Haupt ward dann auf einer Schüssel hergebracht und dem Mädchen gegeben; die brachte es ihrer Mutter. 
[14:12] Und seine Jünger kamen, holten seinen Leichnam und begruben ihn. Dann gingen sie hin und gaben Jesus Bericht. 
[14:13] Auf diese Kunde entfernte sich Jesus von dort in einem Boot nach einer unbewohnten Gegend, um allein zu sein. Aber die Leute hörten davon und gingen ihm zu Fuß aus den Städten nach. 
[14:14] Als nun Jesus aus dem Fahrzeug stieg, empfand er tiefes Mitleid bei dem Anblick der großen Menge, und er heilte ihre Kranken. 
[14:15] Am Abend traten seine Jünger zu ihm und sprachen: "Die Gegend hier ist unbewohnt, und es ist schon spät. Laß deshalb die Leute ziehen, damit sie in die nächsten Dörfer gehen und sich Lebensmittel kaufen." 
[14:16] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Sie brauchen nicht zu gehen; gebt ihr ihnen zu essen!" 
[14:17] Sie erwiderten ihm: "Wir haben hier nichts weiter als fünf Brote und zwei Fische." 
[14:18] Er sprach: "Bringt sie mir her!" 
[14:19] Und er ließ die Leute sich auf dem Gras lagern. Nun nahm er die fünf Brote und die beiden Fische, sah auf zum Himmel und sprach den Lobpreis. Dann brach er die Brote und gab sie seinen Jüngern, die Jünger aber reichten sie den Leuten. 
[14:20] So aßen alle und wurden satt. Die übriggebliebenen Brocken hob man vom Boden auf: zwölf große Körbe voll. 
[14:21] Es hatten aber ungefähr fünftausend Mann gegessen, ohne die Frauen und Kinder. 
[14:22] Nun drängte er seine Jünger, sofort in das Boot zu gehen und an das andere Ufer vorauszufahren während er das Volk entlassen wollte. 
[14:23] Als dies geschehen, ging er auf die Bergeshöhe, um in der Einsamkeit zu beten. Beim Eintritt der Dunkelheit war er dort allein. 
[14:24] Inzwischen war das Boot schon mitten auf dem See und mußte heftig mit den Wellen kämpfen, denn es fuhr gegen den Wind. 
[14:25] Da, in der vierten Nachtwache, kam er, über den See hingehend, auf sie zu. 
[14:26] Als ihn die Jünger so auf dem See wandeln sahen, waren sie entsetzt; denn sie dachten, es wäre ein Gespenst, und sie schrien laut vor Furcht. 
[14:27] Aber alsbald rief ihnen Jesus zu: "Seid getrost, ich bin's, fürchtet euch nicht!" 
[14:28] Da antwortete ihm Petrus: "Herr, bist du es, so laß mich auf dem Wasser zu dir kommen." 
[14:29] Er sprach: "Komm!" Da stieg Petrus aus dem Boot und ging auf dem Wasser zu Jesus hin. 
[14:30] Als er aber den starken Wind spürte, ward ihm bange, und er begann zu sinken. Da schrie er auf: "Herr, hilf mir!" 
[14:31] Sofort streckte Jesus seine Hand aus, ergriff ihn und sprach zu ihm: "Du Kleingläubiger, warum hast du gezweifelt?" 
[14:32] Dann stiegen sie beide in das Boot, und er Wind legte sich. 
[14:33] Die anderen aber, die im Boot waren, fielen vor ihm nieder und sprachen: "Du bist wahrhaftig Gottes Sohn!" 
[14:34] Als sie die Überfahrt vollendet hatten, stiegen sie ans Land und kamen nach Genezaret. 
[14:35] Sobald ihn die Bewohner dieser Gegend erkannten, schickten sie Boten in den ganzen Umkreis. 
[14:36] Da brachte man ihm alle Kranken und bat ihn, daß sie nur die Quaste seines Mantels berühren dürften. Und alle, die sie berührten, wurden gesund. 
[15:1] Dann traten zu Jesus Schriftgelehrte und Pharisäer, die aus Jerusalem gekommen waren, und sprachen: 
[15:2] "Warum übertreten deine Jünger Vorschriften, die uns die Alten überliefert haben? Sie waschen sich ja vor der Mahlzeit die Hände nicht." 
[15:3] Er antwortete ihnen: "Warum übertretet ihr denn euern Vorschriften zuliebe Gottes Gebot? 
[15:4] Gott hat doch gesagt: Ehre deinen Vater und deine Mutter! und: wer Vater oder Mutter schmäht, der soll des Todes sterben. 
[15:5] Ihr aber behauptet: Wer zum Vater oder zur Mutter spricht: 'Ich stifte für den Tempelschatz, was ich dir sonst zum Unterhalt gegeben hätte' — der braucht Vater oder Mutter nicht zu ehren. 
[15:6] So setzt ihr eurer Satzung zuliebe Gottes Gesetz außer Kraft. 
[15:7] Ihr Heuchler! Treffend hat Jesaja von euch geweissagt: 
[15:8] Dies Volk ehrt mich mit den Lippen, aber ihr Herz ist fern von mir. 
[15:9] Ihr Gottesdienst ist wertlos, denn sie verkünden Lehren, die nichts als Menschensatzung sind." 
[15:10] Dann rief er das Volk herbei und sprach zu ihnen: "Hört und versteht es! 
[15:11] Nicht das macht den Menschen unrein, was zum Mund eingeht; sondern was zum Munde ausgeht, das macht den Menschen unrein." 
[15:12] Da traten seine Jünger zu ihm und sprachen: "Weißt du, daß die Pharisäer über dein Wort, das sie haben hören müssen, entrüstet gewesen sind?" 
[15:13] Er antwortete: "Jede Pflanze, die mein himmlischer Vater nicht gepflanzt hat, soll ausgerottet werden. 
[15:14] Laß sie! Sie sind blinde Blindenführer. Wenn aber ein Blinder den anderen führt, so fallen sie beide in die Grube." 
[15:15] Da nahm Petrus das Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Deute uns dies Gleichnis!" 
[15:16] Er erwiderte: "Seid ihr denn auch noch immer so unverständig? 
[15:17] Seht ihr nicht ein, daß alles, was zum Munde eingeht, in den Magen kommt und dann durch den Darm ausgeschieden wird? 
[15:18] Was aber zum Munde ausgeht, das kommt aus dem Herzen, und das macht den Menschen unrein. 
[15:19] Denn aus dem Herzen kommen böse Gedanken: Mord, Ehebruch, Unzucht, Diebstahl, falsches Zeugnis und Verleumdung. 
[15:20] Hierdurch wird der Mensch verunreinigt. Aber mit ungewaschenen Händen essen, das macht den Menschen nicht unrein." 
[15:21] Dann verließ Jesus jene Gegend und begab sich in das Gebiet von Tyrus und Sidon. 
[15:22] Und sieh, eine Kananiterin aus jener Landschaft kam zu ihm; die fing an zu rufen: "Herr, Sohn Davids, erbarme dich mein! Meine Tochter wird von einem bösen Geist arg gequält." 
[15:23] Er aber erwiderte ihr kein einziges Wort. Da traten seine Jünger zu ihm mit der Bitte: "Fertige sie doch ab! Sie schreit ja hinter uns her." 
[15:24] Er aber antwortete: "Ich bin nur zu den verirrten Schafen des Hauses Israel gesandt." 
[15:25] Da kam die Frau, fiel ihm zu Füßen und bat: "Herr, hilf mir!" 
[15:26] Er aber erwiderte: "Es wäre nicht recht, den Kindern das Brot zu nehmen und es den Hündchen hinzuwerfen." 
[15:27] Sie sprach: "Gewiß, Herr! Denn die Hündchen dürfen ja nur die Brocken fressen, die von ihrer Herren Tische fallen." 
[15:28] Da antwortete ihr Jesus: "O Weib, dein Glaube ist groß! Dir geschehe, wie du willst." Und zu der Stunde ward ihre Tochter gesund. 
[15:29] Dann verließ Jesus die Gegend und kam an das Ufer des Galiläischen Sees: er ging auf die Berghöhe und blieb dort. 
[15:30] Da kamen viele Leute zu ihm; die brachten Lahme, Blinde, Stumme Krüppel und viele andere Kranke und legten sie zu seinen Füßen nieder. Und er heilte sie. 
[15:31] Da wunderten sich die Leute, als sie sahen, wie die Stummen redeten, die Krüppel genasen, die Lahmen gingen und die Blinden sahen. Und sie priesen den Gott Israels. 
[15:32] Da rief Jesus seine Jünger zu sich und sprach: "Mich jammert der Leute, denn sie sind nun schon drei Tage bei mir und haben nichts mehr zu essen; und hungrig mag ich sie nicht gehen lassen, sonst könnten sie unterwegs ermattet zusammenbrechen." 
[15:33] Seine Jünger sprachen zu ihm: "Woher sollen wir in dieser unbewohnten Gegend Brot genug bekommen, um so viele Menschen zu sättigen?" 
[15:34] Jesus fragte sie: Wieviel Brote habt ihr denn?" Sie sprachen: "Sieben und ein paar kleine Fische." 
[15:35] Da ließ er die ganze Schar sich auf die Erde lagern. 
[15:36] Dann nahm er die sieben Brote und die Fische, sprach das Dankgebet, brach sie und gab sie den Jüngern, die dann die Leute speisten. 
[15:37] So aßen alle und wurden satt. Die übriggebliebenen Brocken hob man vom Boden auf: sieben kleine Körbe voll. 
[15:38] Es hatten aber etwa viertausend Mann gegessen, ohne die Frauen und Kinder. 
[15:39] Dann ließ er die Menge gehen, stieg in sein Boot und kam in das Gebiet von Magadan. 
[16:1] Dort traten Pharisäer und Sadduzäer an ihn heran, um ihn auszuhorchen, und forderten ihn auf, er möge sie ein Wunderzeichen vom Himmel sehen lassen. 
[16:2] Er aber erwiderte ihnen: "(Am Abend sagt ihr: 'Es wird gutes Wetter, denn der Himmel ist gerötet', 
[16:3] und frühmorgens: 'Heute wird es stürmisch, denn der Himmel ist rötlich und trübe.' Des Himmels Aussehen wißt ihr zu deuten, und die Zeichen der Zeit versteht ihr nicht?) 
[16:4] Ein böses, gottvergessenes Geschlecht begehrt ein Zeichen; es wird ihm aber kein anderes Zeichen gegeben werden als das Zeichen des Propheten Jona." Damit wandte er sich von ihnen und ging weg. 
[16:5] Als die Jünger an das andere Ufer kamen, entdeckten sie, daß sie vergessen hatten, Brot mitzunehmen. 
[16:6] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Habt acht und hütet euch vor dem Sauerteig der Pharisäer und Sadduzäer!" 
[16:7] Die Jünger dachten bei sich und sprachen es auch gegeneinander aus: "Das sagt er, weil wir kein Brot mitgenommen haben." 
[16:8] Jesus merkte das und sprach: "Ihr Kleingläubigen, was macht ihr euch Gedanken darüber, daß ihr kein Brot mithabt? 
[16:9] Fehlt's euch denn immer noch an Einsicht? Denkt ihr nicht an die fünf Brote für die Fünftausend, und wieviel große Körbe voll ihr noch mitgenommen habt? 
[16:10] Und denkt ihr nicht an die sieben Brote für die Viertausend, und wieviel kleine Körbe voll ihr noch mitgenommen habt? 
[16:11] Seht ihr denn nicht ein, daß ich bei meinen Worten nicht an Brot gedacht habe? Hütet euch aber vor dem Sauerteig der Pharisäer und Sadduzäer!" 
[16:12] Nun erst verstanden sie, daß er nicht gemeint hatte, sie sollten sich hüten vor dem Sauerteig der Brote, sondern vor der Lehre der Pharisäer und Sadduzäer. 
[16:13] Hierauf kam Jesus in das Gebiet von Cäsarea Philippi. Dort frage er seine Jünger: "Wofür halten die Leute den Menschensohn?" 
[16:14] Sie sprachen: "Die einen halten dich für Johannes den Täufer, die anderen für Elia, wieder andere für Jeremia oder sonst einen der Propheten." 
[16:15] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Für wen haltet ihr mich denn?" 
[16:16] Simon Petrus antwortete: "Du bist der Messias, der Sohn Gottes, des Lebendigen." 
[16:17] Da erwiderte ihm Jesus: "Selig bist du, Simon, Jonas Sohn; denn nicht ein sterblicher Mensch von Fleisch und Blut hat dir dies offenbart, sondern mein Vater im Himmel. 
[16:18] Und ich sage dir: Du bist Petrus, und im Anschluß an diesen Stein will ich das Haus meiner Kirche bauen, und des Totenreiches Tore sollen sie nicht bezwingen. 
[16:19] Ich will dir die Schlüssel des Königreichs der Himmel geben: Was du auf Erden binden wirst, das soll im Himmel gebunden sein; und was du auf Erden lösen wirst, das soll im Himmel gelöst sein." 
[16:20] Dann schärfte er seinen Jüngern ein, sie sollten niemand sagen, daß er der Messias sei. 
[16:21] Von der Zeit an begann Jesus seinen Jüngern darzulegen: er müsse nach Jerusalem gehen und dort viel leiden von den Ältesten, Hohenpriestern und Schriftgelehrten; ja er müsse den Tod erdulden, aber am dritten Tag wieder auferstehen. 
[16:22] Da nahm ihn Petrus beiseite, begann ihm ernste Vorstellungen zu machen und sprach: "Gott bewahre, Herr! Das darf dir nimmermehr geschehen!" 
[16:23] Er aber wandte sich weg und sprach zu Petrus: "Mir aus den Augen, Satan! Du willst mich verführen! Denn du denkst nicht göttlich, sondern menschlich." 
[16:24] Dann sprach Jesus zu seinen Jüngern: "Wer mein Nachfolger sein will, der verleugne sich selbst und nehme sein Kreuz auf sich und folge mir. 
[16:25] Denn wer sein Leben retten will, der wird's verlieren; wer aber sein Leben um meinetwillen verliert, der wird es gewinnen. 
[16:26] Was nützt es dem Menschen, wenn er die ganze Welt gewinnt und dabei sein Seelenheil verliert? Oder welchen Preis kann jemand zahlen, um sich damit sein Seelenheil zu erkaufen? 
[16:27] Denn der Menschensohn wird kommen in seines Vaters Herrlichkeit und in Begleitung seiner Engel; dann wird er einem jeden nach seinem Tun vergelten. Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Einige von denen, die hier stehen, sollen den Tod nicht schmecken, ehe sie den Menschensohn in seiner Königsherrschaft haben kommen sehen." 
[16:28] 
[17:1] Sechs Tage später nahm Jesus Petrus und das Brüderpaar Jakobus und Johannes mit sich und führte sie allein auf einen hohen Berg. 
[17:2] Dort trat vor ihren Augen in seinem Äußeren eine Wandlung ein: sein Antlitz strahlte wie die Sonne, und seine Kleider glänzten hell wie das Licht. 
[17:3] Und siehe, Mose und Elia erschienen ihnen, die hatten ein Gespräch mit ihm. 
[17:4] Da nahm Petrus das Wort und sprach zu Jesus: "Herr, es trifft sich gut, daß wir hier sind. Wenn du erlaubst, so will ich hier drei Hütten bauen, für dich eine, für Mose eine und für Elia eine." 
[17:5] Während er noch redete, umhüllte sie plötzlich eine lichthelle Wolke, und aus der Wolke rief eine Stimme: "Dies ist mein geliebter Sohn, den ich erkoren; auf den hört!" 
[17:6] Bei diesen Worten fielen die Jünger tieferschrocken auf ihr Angesicht. 
[17:7] Jesus aber trat zu ihnen rührte sie an und sprach: "Steht auf und fürchtet euch nicht!" 
[17:8] Da schlugen sie ihre Augen auf und sahen niemand als Jesus allein. 
[17:9] Als sie vom Berg hinabgingen, gebot ihnen Jesus: "Sagt niemand etwas von dem, was ihr gesehen, bis der Menschensohn von den Toten auferstanden ist." 
[17:10] Da fragten ihn die Jünger: "Warum behaupten denn die Schriftgelehrten, Elia müsse vorher kommen?" 
[17:11] Er antwortete: "Gewiß! Elia soll kommen und alles in Ordnung bringen. 
[17:12] Aber ich versichere euch: Elisa ist schon gekommen; doch sie haben ihn nicht anerkannt, sondern ihren Mutwillen an ihm geübt. Ebenso wird auch der Menschensohn von ihnen leiden müssen." 
[17:13] Da verstanden die Jünger, daß er von Johannes dem Täufer zu ihnen geredet hatte. 
[17:14] Als sie nun zu dem Volkshaufen kamen, trat ein Mann zu ihm, der bat in fußfällig: 
[17:15] "Herr, erbarme dich meines Sohnes! Er ist mondsüchtig und hat schwer zu leiden: er fällt oft ins Feuer und ins Wasser. 
[17:16] Ich habe ihn zu deinen Jüngern gebracht, aber sie haben ihn nicht heilen können." 
[17:17] Jesus antwortete: "Ihr ungläubige und verkehrte Art, wie lange soll ich bei euch sein? Wie lange soll ich euch ertragen? Bringt ihn mir her!" 
[17:18] Und Jesus bedrohte den bösen Geist: da fuhr er aus von dem Knaben, so daß er von Stund an gesund wurde. 
[17:19] Darauf traten die Jünger zu Jesus, als er mit ihnen allein war, und fragten: "Warum haben wir den bösen Geist nicht austreiben können?" 
[17:20] Er antwortete ihnen: "Weil ihr so wenig Glauben habt. Denn ich versichere euch: Hättet ihr nur Glauben wie ein Senfkorn, so könntet ihr zu dem Berg da sprechen: 'Rücke von hier weg dorthin!' und er würde es tun; ja nichts wäre euch unmöglich." 
[17:21]  
[17:22] Als sie zusammen in Galiläa wanderten, sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Der Menschensohn wird in der Menschen Hände überliefert werden, 
[17:23] und sie werden ihn töten; aber am dritten Tag wird er wieder auferstehen." Da wurden sie sehr betrübt. 
[17:24] Nach ihrer Ankunft in Kapernaum traten die Einnehmer der Tempelsteuer zu Petrus und fragten ihn: "Entrichtet euer Meister die Tempelsteuer nicht?" 
[17:25] Er antwortete: "Jawohl!" Dann ging er in das Haus (wo Jesus wohnte). Dort fragte ihn Jesus, noch ehe Petrus von dem Vorfall geredet hatte: "Was meinst du, Simon? Von wem erheben die Könige dieser Erde Zoll oder Steuer? von ihren Söhnen oder von ihren Untertanen?" 
[17:26] "Von ihren Untertanen", erwiderte er. Da sprach Jesus zu ihm: "Mithin sind die Söhne steuerfrei. 
[17:27] Damit wir aber den Leuten keinen Anstoß geben, so geh an den See und wirf die Angel aus! Den ersten Fisch, der anbeißt, den zieh empor und öffne ihm das Maul! Da wirst du eine Silbermünze finden; die nimm und gib sie ihnen für mich und dich!" 
[18:1] Zu jener Stunde traten die Jünger zu Jesus und fragten ihn: "Wer ist wohl der Größte im Königreich der Himmel?" 
[18:2] Da rief er ein kleines Kind herbei, stellte es mitten unter sie 
[18:3] und sprach: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wenn ihr nicht umkehrt und wie die kleinen Kinder werdet, so kommt ihr sicher nicht ins Königreich der Himmel. 
[18:4] Wer sich nun erniedrigt wie dies Kind hier, der ist der Größte im Königreich der Himmel. 
[18:5] Und wer ein solches Kind aufnimmt, weil es meinen Namen bekennt, der nimmt mich auf. 
[18:6] Wer aber eins von den kleinen Kindern hier, die an mich glauben, zur Sünde verführt, für den wäre es besser gewesen, man hätte ihm vorher einen großen Mühlstein um den Hals gehängt und ihn versenkt im Meer, wo es am tiefsten ist. 
[18:7] Weh der Welt, die voll Verführung ist! Verführungen sind zwar unvermeidlich; doch weh dem Menschen, durch den Verführung kommt! 
[18:8] Wenn dich aber deine Hand oder dein Fuß zur Sünde reizt, haue sie ab und wirf sie weg! Es ist besser für dich, du gehst verstümmelt oder hinkend ins Leben ein, als daß du zwei Hände oder zwei Füße hast und ins ewige Feuer geworfen wirst. 
[18:9] Und wenn dich dein Auge zur Sünde reizt, reiß es aus und wirf es weg! Es ist besser für dich, du gehst einäugig ins Leben ein, als daß du zwei Augen hast und ins höllische Feuer geworfen wirst. 
[18:10] Nehmt euch in acht, eins dieser Kinder geringzuschätzen! Denn ich sage euch: Ihre Engel haben im Himmel allzeit freien Zutritt zu meinem himmlischen Vater. 
[18:11]  
[18:12] Was meint ihr? Wenn jemand hundert Schafe hat und eins davon verirrt sich: läßt er dann nicht die anderen neunundneunzig allein in den Bergen weiden und geht hin, um das verirrte zu suchen? 
[18:13] Und glückt's ihm, es zu finden, ich versichere euch: er freut sich mehr darüber als über die neunundneunzig, die sich nicht verirrt. 
[18:14] So will auch euer Vater im Himmel nicht, daß eins dieser Kinder verlorengehe. 
[18:15] Hat sich dein Bruder an dir versündigt, so geh zu ihm und stelle ihm unter vier Augen sein Unrecht vor. Hört er auf dich, so hast du deinen Bruder gewonnen. 
[18:16] Hört er nicht, so geh nochmals zu ihm in Begleitung eines oder zweier Brüder, damit jedes Wort, das gesprochen wird, durch zwei oder drei Zeugen festgestellt werden könne. 
[18:17] Will er aber nicht auf diese Brüder hören, so bring die Sache vor die Gemeinde. Und hört er auch auf die Gemeinde nicht, dann sieh ihn an wie einen Heiden und Zöllner. 
[18:18] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Was ihr auf Erden bindet, das soll im Himmel gebunden sein; und was ihr auf Erden löst, das soll auch im Himmel gelöst sein. 
[18:19] Weiter sage ich euch: Wenn hier auf Erden zwei von euch einig sind, um etwas zu bitten, so soll es ihnen von meinem Vater im Himmel zuteil werden. 
[18:20] Denn wo zwei oder drei in meinem Namen versammelt sind, da bin ich in ihrer Mitte gegenwärtig." 
[18:21] Darauf trat Petrus zu ihm mit der Frage: "Herr, wenn sich mein Bruder gegen mich versündigt, wie oft muß ich ihm dann vergeben? Etwa siebenmal?" 
[18:22] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Ich sage dir: nicht siebenmal, sondern siebzigmal siebenmal. 
[18:23] Darum gleicht das Himmelreich einem König, der mit seinen Dienern abrechnen wollte. 
[18:24] Als er mit der Abrechnung begann, ward ihm einer vorgeführt, der ihm zehntausend Talente schuldig war. 
[18:25] Weil er aber nicht bezahlen konnte, ließ ihn der Herr mit Weib und Kind und all seiner Habe zur Deckung der Schuld verkaufen. 
[18:26] Da fiel ihm der Diener zu Füßen und bat: 'Hab nur Geduld mit mir, ich will dir alles bezahlen!' 
[18:27] Da hatte der Herr Erbarmen mit dem Diener: er gab ihn frei, und die Schuld erließ er ihm auch. 
[18:28] Beim Hinausgehen traf nun dieser Diener einen anderen, der ihm hundert Silberlinge schuldete. Den packte er an der Gurgel und rief: 'Bezahle mir, was du schuldig bist!' 
[18:29] Da warf sich sein Mitdiener vor ihm nieder und bat ihn: 'Hab nur Geduld mit mir, ich will dir's schon bezahlen.' 
[18:30] Aber er wollte nicht, sondern nahm ihn mit sich und ließ ihn ins Gefängnis werfen, bis er seine Schuld bezahlt hätte. 
[18:31] Als das die anderen Diener sahen, wurden sie sehr betrübt; sie gingen zu ihrem Herrn und erzählten ihm alles. 
[18:32] Da ließ der Herr den Diener rufen und sprach zu ihm: 'Du Bösewicht! Deine ganze Schuld habe ich dir auf dein Bitten erlassen. 
[18:33] Hättest du dich da nicht auch über deinen Mitknecht erbarmen müssen, wie ich mich über dich erbarmt habe?' 
[18:34] Und voll Zorn ließ ihn sein Herr den Folterknechten übergeben, bis er ihm die ganze Schuld bezahlt hätte. 
[18:35] Ebenso wird auch mein himmlischer Vater mit euch verfahren, wenn ihr nicht allesamt von Herzen den Brüdern vergebt." 
[19:1] Als Jesus diese Reden beendet hatte, verließ er Galiläa und zog durch das Ostjordanland in das Gebiet von Judäa. 
[19:2] Eine große Volksmenge begleitete ihn, deren Kranke er dort heilte. 
[19:3] Da traten Pharisäer zu ihm; die wollten ihm eine Falle stellen und fragten ihn: "Darf jemand sein Weib aus jedem beliebigen Grund entlassen?" 
[19:4] Er antwortete: "Habt ihr nicht gelesen, daß der Schöpfer im Anfang die Menschen als Mann und Weib geschaffen hat? 
[19:5] Und er hat gesagt: Deshalb wird ein Mann Vater und Mutter verlassen und sich aufs engste mit seinem Weib verbinden, und beide werden eins sein. 
[19:6] Sie sind als nicht mehr zwei, sondern eins. Was nun Gott vereinigt hat, das soll der Mensch nicht trennen!" 
[19:7] Sie sprachen zu ihm: "Warum hat denn Mose geboten, der Mann solle der Frau einen Scheidebrief ausstellen und dürfe sie dann aus seinem Haus entlassen?" 
[19:8] Er antwortete ihnen: "Wegen eurer Herzenshärtigkeit hat euch Mose erlaubt, eure Frauen zu entlassen. Doch anfangs ist es nicht so gewesen. 
[19:9] Ich sage euch aber: "Wer sein Weib aus einem anderen Grund entläßt als wegen Unzucht und eine andere heiratet, der ist ein Ehebrecher. Und wer eine (von ihrem Mann) entlassene Frau zum Weib nimmt, der ist auch ein Ehebrecher." 
[19:10] Da sprachen die Jünger zu ihm: "Wenn es zwischen Mann und Weib so steht, dann ist es besser, nicht zu heiraten." 
[19:11] Er antwortete ihnen: "Nicht jeder ist dazu fähig, sonder der allein, dem es verliehen ist. 
[19:12] Es gibt Ehelose, die von Geburt an zur Ehe untüchtig sind, und es gibt Ehelose, denen durch Menschen die Fähigkeit zur Ehe genommen worden ist; aber es gibt auch Ehelose, die mit Rücksicht auf das Königreich der Himmel freiwillig auf die Ehe verzichtet haben. Wer dazu fähig ist, der tue es!" 
[19:13] Dann brachte man kleine Kinder zu ihm, damit er ihnen unter Gebet die Hände auflege. Die Jünger aber fuhren die Leute mit rauhen Worten an. 
[19:14] Doch Jesus sprach: "Laßt die kleinen Kinder zu mir kommen und hindert sie nicht daran! Denn gerade ihnen ist das Himmelreich bestimmt." 
[19:15] Dann legte er ihnen die Hände auf und verließ den Ort. 
[19:16] Und siehe, einer trat an ihn heran und fragte: "Meister, was für ein gutes Werk muß ich tun, um das ewige Leben zu erlangen?" 
[19:17] Er antwortete ihm: "Warum fragst du mich nach dem, was gut ist? Nur ein einziger ist gut. Willst du aber zum Leben eingehen, so halte die Gebote." 
[19:18] Er sprach zu ihm: "Welche?" Jesus erwiderte: "Diese: Du sollst nicht morden, nicht ehebrechen, nicht stehlen, nicht falsches Zeugnis ablegen! 
[19:19] Ehre Vater und Mutter! Und: du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst." 
[19:20] Der Jüngling sprach zu ihm: "Dies alles habe ich treu erfüllt. Was fehlt mir noch?" 
[19:21] Da antwortete ihm Jesus: "Willst du vollkommen sein, so gehe hin, verkaufe deine Habe und gib das Geld den Armen: so wirst du einen Schatz im Himmel haben; dann komm und folge mir!" 
[19:22] Als der Jüngling das hörte, ging er traurig weg, denn er hatte ein großes Vermögen. 
[19:23] Da sprach Jesus zu seinen Jüngern: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ein Reicher kommt nur schwer ins Königreich der Himmel. 
[19:24] Ja ich sage euch: Ein Kamel kommt leichter durch ein Nadelöhr als ein Reicher in Gottes Königreich." 
[19:25] Als die Jünger das hörten, erschraken sie sehr und sprachen: "Ja, wer kann dann überhaupt gerettet werden?" 
[19:26] Jesus aber sah sie an und erwiderte: "Mit menschlicher Kraft ist das zwar nicht möglich; mit Gottes Hilfe aber ist alles möglich." 
[19:27] Da nahm Petrus das Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Sieh, wir haben alles aufgegeben und sind dir nachgefolgt. Welcher Lohn wird uns dafür?" 
[19:28] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wenn der Menschen zur Zeit der Wiedergeburt auf dem Thron seiner Herrlichkeit sitzt, dann sollt auch ihr, die ihr mir nachgefolgt seid, auf zwölf Thronen sitzen und die zwölf Stämme Israels als Herrscher leiten. 
[19:29] Ja jeder, der Geschwister, Eltern, Weib und Kind oder Äcker und Häuser um meines Namens willen fahren läßt, der soll reichen Ersatz dafür empfangen und das ewige Leben als Erbe bekommen. 
[19:30] Doch in vielen Fällen werden die Ersten die Letzten und die Letzten die Ersten sein. 
[20:1] Denn das Königreich der Himmel gleicht einem Hausherrn, der frühmorgens ausging, um Arbeiter für seinen Weinberg zu mieten. 
[20:2] Er vereinbarte mit ihnen einen Silberling als Tagelohn und sandte sie in seinen Weinberg. 
[20:3] Um die dritte Stunde ging er wieder aus und sah andere auf dem Marktplatz unbeschäftigt stehen; 
[20:4] zu denen sprach er: 'Geht auch ihr in meinen Weinberg! Ich will euch geben, was recht ist.' 
[20:5] Sie gingen hin. Wiederum ging er aus um die sechste und um die neunte Stunde und tat ebenso. 
[20:6] Als er aber um die elfte Stunde nochmals ausging, fand er andere dastehen und sprach zu ihnen: 'Warum steht ihr hier den ganzen Tag unbeschäftigt?' 
[20:7] Sie antworteten ihm: 'Es hat uns niemand in Arbeit genommen.' Er sprach zu ihnen: 'Geht auch ihr in meinen Weinberg!' 
[20:8] Am Abend aber sprach der Herr des Weinbergs zu seinem Verwalter: 'Rufe die Arbeiter und zahle ihnen den Lohn: fang bei den letzten an und höre bei den ersten auf!' 
[20:9] Da kamen die Arbeiter der elften Stunde, und jeder empfing einen Silberling. 
[20:10] Als nun die ersten kamen, meinten sie, sie würden mehr empfangen; doch auch sie bekamen jeder einen Silberling. 
[20:11] Als sie den empfingen, murrten sie gegen den Hausherrn 
[20:12] und sagten: 'Diese letzten haben nur eine Stunde gearbeitet, und du hast sie uns gleichgestellt, die wir des ganzen Tages Last und Hitze ertragen haben.' 
[20:13] Er aber antwortete einem von ihnen: 'Mein Freund, ich tue dir nicht unrecht. Hast du nicht einen Silberling mit mir vereinbart? 
[20:14] Nimm dein Geld und geh! Ich will aber diesen letzten ebensoviel geben wie dir. 
[20:15] Darf ich etwa nicht mit meinem Geld machen, was ich will? Oder bist du neidisch, weil ich so gütig bin?' 
[20:16] So werden die Letzten die Ersten und die Ersten die Letzten sein." 
[20:17] Jesus zog dann weiter nach Jerusalem und hatte nur die Zwölf als besondere Begleiter bei sich. Während der Wanderung sprach er zu ihnen: 
[20:18] "Jetzt gehen wir nach Jerusalem. Dort wird der Menschensohn den Hohenpriestern und den Schriftgelehrten überliefert werden. 
[20:19] Die werden ihn zum Tod verurteilen und ihn dann den Heiden überantworten, daß er verspottet, gegeißelt und gekreuzigt werde. Aber am dritten Tag wird er wieder auferstehen." 
[20:20] Da trat die Frau des Zebedäus mit ihren Söhnen zu ihm und trug ihm fußfällig eine Bitte vor. 
[20:21] Er fragte sie: "Was wünschst du?" Sie sprach zu ihm: "Bestimme, daß meine beiden Söhne hier dereinst in deinem Königreich dir zur Rechten und zur Linken sitzen!" 
[20:22] Jesus erwiderte: "Ihr versteht nicht, um was ihr bittet. Könnt ihr den Kelch trinken, den ich trinken soll?" Sie antworteten ihm: "Ja, das können wir." 
[20:23] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Meinen Kelch sollt ihr freilich trinken. Aber die Sitze zu meiner Rechten und zu meiner Linken kann ich euch nicht verleihen; die werden nur denen zuteil, für die sie mein Vater bestimmt hat." 
[20:24] Als die anderen Zehn dies hörten, äußerten sie ihren Unwillen über die beiden Brüder. 
[20:25] Da rief sie Jesus zu sich und sprach: "Ihr wißt, daß die Herrscher über die Völker unumschränkt gebieten, und daß die Großen ihre Untergebenen ihre Macht fühlen lassen. 
[20:26] So soll's bei euch nicht sein. Im Gegenteil: wer unter euch der groß sein will, der sei euer Diener; 
[20:27] und wer unter euch der Erste sein will, der sei euer Knecht. 
[20:28] So ist ja auch der Menschensohn nicht gekommen, um sich dienen zu lassen, sondern um selbst zu dienen und sein Leben dahinzugeben als Lösegeld für viele." 
[20:29] Als sie Jericho verließen, folgte ihm viel Volk. 
[20:30] Und sieh, es saßen zwei Blinde am Weg. Als sie hörten, Jesus käme vorbei, da riefen sie: "Herr, erbarme dich unser, du Davidssohn!" 
[20:31] Die Leute aber fuhren sie mit rauhen Worten an, sie sollten schweigen. doch sie riefen nur noch lauter: "Herr, erbarme dich unser, du Davidssohn!" 
[20:32] Da blieb Jesus stehen, rief sie zu sich und fragte sie: "Was begehrt ihr von mir?" 
[20:33] Sie antworteten ihm: "Herr, laß sich unsere Augen öffnen!" 
[20:34] Da rührte Jesus voll Mitleid ihre Augen an, und sofort wurden sie wieder sehend und folgten ihm. 
[21:1] Als sie in die Nähe von Jerusalem kamen, nach Bethphage, an den Ölberg, entsandte Jesus zwei Jünger 
[21:2] mit dem Auftrag: "Geht in das Dorf, das vor euch liegt! Dort werdet ihr gleich am Eingang eine Eselin angebunden finden und bei ihr ein Füllen. Bindet beide Tiere los und bringt sie her zu mir! 
[21:3] Und will euch jemand dreinreden, so spracht: 'Der Herr bedarf ihrer' — dann wird er sie ohne weiteres ziehenlassen." 
[21:4] Dies ist geschehen, damit sich der Ausspruch des Propheten erfülle: 
[21:5] Sagt der Tochter Zion: Sieh, dein König kommt zu dir, voll Demut und auf einem Esel reitend, und zwar auf einem Lasttierfüllen. 
[21:6] Die Jünger gingen hin und taten, wie ihnen Jesus geboten hatte: 
[21:7] sie brachten die Eselin und das Füllen, legten ihre Mäntel auf der Tiere Rücken, und er setzte sich darauf. 
[21:8] Sehr viele Leute aber breiteten ihre Mäntel auf den Weg, andere hieben Zweige von den Bäumen und streuten sie auf die Straße. 
[21:9] Und alle, die mit ihm gingen — vorn im Zug und hinterdrein —, die riefen laut: Heil dem Sohn Davids! Gesegnet sei, der da kommt im Namen des Herrn! Heil soll erschallen droben in der Höhe!" 
[21:10] Bei seinem Einzug in Jerusalem geriet die ganze Stadt in Aufregung; man fragte: "Wer ist das?" 
[21:11] Die Leute antworteten: "Das ist der Prophet Jesus aus Nazaret in Galiläa." 
[21:12] Dann ging Jesus in den Tempel Gottes: er trieb alle hinaus, die im Tempel verkauften und kauften; er stieß die Tische der Wechsler und die Bänke der Taubenhändler um 
[21:13] und sprach zu ihnen: "Es steht geschrieben: Mein Haus soll ein Bethaus heißen; ihr aber habt eine Räuberhöhle daraus gemacht." 
[21:14] Dort im Tempel kamen Blinde und Lahme zu ihm, und er heilte sie. 
[21:15] Als aber die Hohenpriester und Schriftgelehrten die Wunder sahen, die er tat, und hörten, wie die Kinder im Tempel riefen: "Heil dem Sohn Davids!", da wurden sie unwillig 
[21:16] und sprachen zu ihm: "Hörst du nicht, was die hier rufen?" Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Jawohl! Habt ihr denn nie das Wort gelesen: Aus Kinder- und Säuglingsmund hast du dir Lob bereitet?" 
[21:17] Damit ließ er sie stehen und ging aus der Stadt hinaus nach Bethanien, wo er übernachtete. 
[21:18] Frühmorgens bei der Rückkehr in die Stadt empfand er Hunger. 
[21:19] Da sah er einen einzeln stehenden Feigenbaum am Wege. Auf den ging er zu, aber er fand nur Blätter daran. Da sprach er zu dem Baum: "In Zukunft sollst du niemals wieder Frucht tragen!" Sofort verdorrte der Feigenbaum. 
[21:20] Bei diesem Anblick waren die Jünger verwundert und fragten: "Wie hat der Feigenbaum sofort verdorren können?" 
[21:21] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wenn ihr Glauben hättet und nicht zweifeltet, so könntet ihr nicht nur dasselbe tun, was an dem Feigenbaum geschehen ist; sondern wenn ihr zu dem Berge dort sagtet: 'Heb dich von deiner Stelle und stürze dich ins Meer', so würde es geschehen. 
[21:22] Ja alles, was ihr im Glauben im Gebet erfleht, das werdet ihr empfangen." 
[21:23] Als er wieder im Tempel war und dort lehrte, traten die Hohenpriester und die Ältesten des Volkes zu ihm mit der Frage: "Mit welchem Recht tust du dies, und wer hat dir das Recht dazu gegeben?" 
[21:24] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Ich will euch auch eine Frage vorlegen; gebt ihr mir darauf Antwort, so will ich euch auch sagen, mit welchem Recht ich dies tue: 
[21:25] Woher stammte die Taufe des Johannes? Vom Himmel oder von Menschen?" Sie überlegten miteinander: "Sagen wir: 'vom Himmel', so wird er uns fragen: 'Warum habt ihr ihm denn nicht geglaubt?' 
[21:26] Antworten wir aber: 'von Menschen', so haben wir das Volk zu fürchten, denn das sieht allgemein Johannes als Propheten an." 
[21:27] Da erwiderten sie Jesus: "Wir wissen es nicht." Darauf sprach er zu ihnen: "So sage ich euch auch nicht, mit welchem Recht ich dies tue." 
[21:28] "Was meint ihr nun? Ein Mann hatte zwei Söhne. Er ging zu dem ersten und sagte: 'Mein Sohn, geh und arbeite heute in meinem Weinberg!' 
[21:29] Der erwiderte: 'Jawohl, Herr!' aber er ging nicht hin. 
[21:30] Dann wandte sich der Vater mit denselben Worten an den zweiten Sohn. Der entgegnete: 'Ich habe keine Lust.' Nachher aber tat's ihm leid, und er ging und er ging doch. 
[21:31] Wer von den beiden hat nun seines Vaters Willen ausgeführt?" Sie sprachen: "Der zweite." Da fuhr Jesus fort: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Die Zöllner und die Dirnen kommen eher in Gottes Königreich als ihr. 
[21:32] Denn Johannes ist zu euch gekommen, um euch den rechten Weg zu zeigen; aber ihr habt ihm nicht geglaubt. Die Zöllner dagegen und die Dirnen haben ihm geglaubt. Ihr habt das zwar gesehen, doch anderes Sinnes seid ihr trotzdem nachher nicht geworden: ihr habt ihm nicht geglaubt. 
[21:33] Hört noch ein anderes Gleichnis: Ein Hausherr pflanzte einen Weinberg; er zog einen Zaun darum, grub eine Kelterkufe darin aus und baute einen Turm. Dann verpachtete er ihn an Winzer und ging außer Landes. 
[21:34] Als sich nun die Zeit der Weinlese nahte, sandte er seine Knechte zu den Winzern, damit sie den Teil der Früchte abholten, der ihm zukam. 
[21:35] Die Winzer aber ergriffen diese Knechte: den einen mißhandelten sie, den anderen erschlugen sie, den dritten steinigten sie. 
[21:36] Dann sandte er andere Knechte, mehr als zuerst; doch mit diesen verfuhren sie ebenso.. 
[21:37] Zuletzt sandte er seinen Sohn zu ihnen, denn er dachte: vor meinem Sohn werden sie doch Ehrfurcht haben. 
[21:38] Als aber die Winzer den Sohn sahen, sprachen sie untereinander: 'Ha, da kommt der Erbe! Auf! laßt uns ihn töten und sein Erbgut in Besitz nehmen!' 
[21:39] Und sie ergriffen ihn, stießen ihn aus dem Weinberg und töteten ihn. 
[21:40] Wenn nun der Weinbergsbesitzer kommt, was wird er diesen Winzern tun?" 
[21:41] Sie erwiderten ihm: "Er wird diese Übeltäter übel umbringen und seinen Weinberg anderen Winzern verpachten, die ihm die Früchte zur rechten Zeit abliefern." 
[21:42] Jesus sprach zu ihnen: "(Allerdings!) Habt ihr denn niemals in der Schrift das Wort gelesen: Der Stein, den die Bauleute verworfen haben, der ist zum Eckstein geworden. Dies ist eine Tat des Herrn, und sie ist wunderbar in unseren Augen? 
[21:43] Darum sage ich euch: Gottes Königreich soll euch genommen und einem Volk gegeben werden, das auch die Früchte trägt, die diesem Reich Ehre machen." 
[21:44]  
[21:45] Als die Hohenpriester und die Pharisäer seine Gleichnisse hörten, merkten sie, daß er von ihnen redete. 
[21:46] Da sannen sie darauf, ihn festzunehmen; aber sie fürchteten sich vor dem Volk, denn das hielt ihn für einen Propheten. 
[22:1] Jesus nahm von neuem das Wort zu Gleichnisreden und sprach zu ihnen: 
[22:2] "Das Himmelreich gleicht einem König, der seinem Sohn die Hochzeit ausrichtete. 
[22:3] Er sandte seine Knechte aus, um die schon geladenen Gäste zur Hochzeit zu entbieten; aber sie hatten keine Lust zu kommen 
[22:4] Da sandte er nochmals andere Knechte mit dem Auftrag: 'Sagt den geladenen Gästen: Mein Frühmahl ist nun fertig, meine Ochsen und mein Mastvieh ist geschlachtet. Alles ist bereit, kommt zur Hochzeit!' 
[22:5] Doch, ohne diese Botschaft zu beachten, gingen die einen von den Gästen auf dem Acker oder beim Handel ihren täglichen Geschäften nach. 
[22:6] Die anderen aber ergriffen des Königs Knechte, verhöhnten sie, ja brachten sie ums Leben. 
[22:7] Da ward der König zornig: er sandte seine Heere aus; die brachten diese Mörder um und verbrannten ihre Stadt. 
[22:8] Dann sprach er zu seinen Knechten: 'Das Hochzeitsmahl ist fertig; doch die geladenen Gäste waren nicht wert, daran teilzunehmen. 
[22:9] So geht denn vor die Stadt hinaus: dorthin, wo die Feldwege beginnen, und alle, die ihr findet, ladet zur Hochzeit!' 
[22:10] Die Knechte gingen aus auf die Landstraßen, und alle die sie fanden, führten sie herbei: Böse sowohl wie Gute. Und der Hochzeitssaal füllte sich mit Gästen. 
[22:11] Nun trat der König ein, um sich die Gäste anzusehen. Da nahm er eine wahr, der trug kein Hochzeitskleid. 
[22:12] Und er sprach zu ihm: 'Mein Freund, wie hast du Einlaß finden können ohne Hochzeitskleid?' Er aber schwieg. 
[22:13] Da sprach der König zu den Dienern: 'Bindet ihn an Händen und Füßen und werft ihn in die Finsternis hinaus!' Dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein. 
[22:14] Denn viele sind berufen, aber nur wenige sind auserwählt." 
[22:15] Da gingen die Pharisäer hin und berieten sich, wie sie ihn in seinen eigenen Worten fangen könnten. 
[22:16] Sie sandten deshalb ihre Schüler zu ihm, die von Anhängern des Herodes begleitet waren. Die sprachen zu ihm: "Meister, wir wissen, du bist aufrichtig und lehrst in aller Wahrheit Gottes Weg; dabei nimmst du auf niemand Rücksicht, denn Menschengunst gilt nicht bei dir. 
[22:17] So sag uns denn, was meinst du: Darf man dem Kaiser Steuer zahlen oder nicht?" 
[22:18] Jesus aber merkte ihre böse Absicht und sprach zu ihnen: "Was versucht ihr mich, ihr Heuchler? 
[22:19] Zeigt mir die Steuermünze!" Da reichten sie ihm einen Silberling. 
[22:20] Und er fragte sie: "Wessen Bild und Inschrift steht hier?" 
[22:21] Sie antworteten ihm: "Des Kaisers." Da sprach er zu ihnen: "So gebt dem Kaiser, was dem Kaiser gebührt, und Gott, was Gott gebührt!" 
[22:22] Über diese Antwort waren sie verwundert, und sie verließen ihn und gingen ihres Weges. 
[22:23] An demselben Tag traten Sadduzäer zu ihm, die da behaupteten, es gebe keine Auferstehung, und legten ihm auch eine Frage vor. 
[22:24] "Meister", so sprachen sie, "Mose hat gesagt: Stirbt jemand kinderlos, so soll sein Bruder die verwitwete Schwägerin zum Weib nehmen und (mit ihr) seinem (verstorbenen) Bruder Nachkommen erwecken. 
[22:25] Nun lebten unter uns sieben Brüder. Der erste freite und starb kinderlos: so hinterließ er seine Witwe seinem Bruder. 
[22:26] Ebenso ging es mit dem zweiten und dritten, ja mit allen sieben. 
[22:27] Zuletzt von allen starb auch die Frau. 
[22:28] Wem von diesen sieben wird sie nun bei der Auferstehung als Gattin angehören? Sie haben sie ja alle zur Frau gehabt." 
[22:29] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Ihr seid im Irrtum, denn ihr kennt die Schriften nicht noch Gottes Macht. 
[22:30] Die Auferstandenen freien nicht und lassen sich nicht freien, sondern sind wie Gottes Engel im Himmel. 
[22:31] Was aber die Auferstehung der Toten betrifft, habt ihr da nicht gelesen, was Gott zu euch in dem bekannten Wort spricht: 
[22:32] Ich bin der Gott Abrahams, der Gott Isaaks und der Gott Jakobs? Gott ist nun aber nicht ein Gott der Toten, sondern der Lebendigen." 
[22:33] Das Volk, das diese Worte hörte, staunte über seine Lehre. 
[22:34] Als die Pharisäer erfuhren, er habe die Sadduzäer zum Schweigen gebracht, versammelten sie sich. 
[22:35] Einer aus ihrer Mitte, ein Gesetzeslehrer, wollte ihm eine Falle stellen und fragte ihn deshalb: 
[22:36] "Meister, welches ist das wichtigste Gebot im Gesetz?" 
[22:37] Er antwortete ihm: "Du sollst den Herrn, deinen Gott, lieben mit ganzem Herzen, mit ganzer Seele und mit allem Denken. 
[22:38] Dies ist das wichtigste und höchste Gebot. 
[22:39] Das andere aber, das ihm gleichsteht, lautet: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst. 
[22:40] In diesen beiden Geboten hängen das ganze Gesetz und die Propheten." 
[22:41] Als dann die Pharisäer beisammen waren, fragte sie Jesus: 
[22:42] "Was denkt ihr über den Messias? Wessen Sohn ist er?" Sie antworteten ihm: "Davids." 
[22:43] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Wie kann ihn denn David, vom Geist erleuchtet, Herr nennen, in dem Ausspruch: 
[22:44] Der Herr hat gesagt zu meinem Herrn: Sitze du zu meiner Rechten, bis ich dir deine Feinde zu Füßen lege.? 
[22:45] Wenn ihn nun David seinen Herrn nennt, wie kann er da zugleich sein Sohn sein?" 
[22:46] Darauf konnte ihm niemand ein Wort erwidern, und seitdem wagte auch keiner mehr, ihm eine Frage vorzulegen. 
[23:1] Dann wandte sich Jesus an das Volk und an seine Jünger. 
[23:2] "Moses Lehrstuhl", so begann er, "haben jetzt die Schriftgelehrten und die Pharisäer besetzt. 
[23:3] Alles nun, was sie euch sagen, das tut und haltet! Nach ihren Werken aber sollt ihr euch nicht richten. Denn sie lehren anders, als sie tun. 
[23:4] Sie binden Bündel schwerer Lasten zusammen und legen sie den Leuten auf die Schulter; sie selbst aber haben keine Lust, diese Lasten auch nur mit einer Fingerspitze zu berühren. 
[23:5] Bei all ihrem Tun wollen sie die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit erregen: Sie tragen breite Gebetsriemen und lange Mantelquasten. 
[23:6] Beim Mahl sitzen sie gern obenan, und in der gottesdienstlichen Versammlung wollen sie die Ehrenplätze haben; 
[23:7] auf den Straßen soll man sie voll Ehrfurcht grüßen, und sie lassen sich den Namen 'Meister' geben. 
[23:8] Ihr aber sollt euch nicht so nennen lassen; denn Einer ist euer Meister, und ihr seid alle Brüder. 
[23:9] Ihr sollt auch niemand auf Erden euern 'Vater' nennen; denn Einer ist euer Vater: der Vater im Himmel. 
[23:10] Auch sollt ihr euch nicht 'Lehrer' nennen lassen; denn Einer ist euer Lehrer: der Messias. 
[23:11] Der Größte unter euch soll allen anderen dienen. 
[23:12] Wer sich selbst erhöht, der soll erniedrigt werden; und wer sich selbst erniedrigt, der soll erhöht werden. 
[23:13] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Ihr schließt die Tür des Himmelreiches vor den Leuten zu. Ihr selbst geht nicht hinein und laßt auch die nicht ein, die es gern wollen. 
[23:14]  
[23:15] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Ihr zieht über Land und Meer, um einen einzigen Jünger zu gewinnen. Und ist euch das gelungen, so macht ihr ihn zu einem Kind der Hölle, das zweimal ärger ist als ihr! 
[23:16] Weh euch, ihr blinden Führer! Ihr sagt: Wer bei dem Tempel schwört, des Eid gilt nichts. Wer aber bei dem Gold des Tempels schwört, der ist gebunden. 
[23:17] Ihr Toren und ihr Blinden! Was steht denn höher: das Gold oder der Tempel, der doch dem Gold erst die Weihe gibt? 
[23:18] Wer bei dem Altar schwört — so sagt ihr ferner —, des Eid gilt nichts. Wer aber bei der Opfergabe auf dem Altar schwört, der ist gebunden. 
[23:19] Ihr Blinden! Was steht denn höher: die Opfergabe oder der Altar, der doch der Opfergabe erst die Weihe gibt? 
[23:20] Wer also bei dem Altar schwört, der schwört bei ihm und allem, was darauf ist. 
[23:21] Und wer beim Tempel schwört, der schwört bei ihm und dem, der darinnen wohnt. 
[23:22] Und wer beim Himmel schwört, der schwört bei Gottes Thron und dem, der darauf sitzt. 
[23:23] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Von Minze, Dill und Kümmel gebt ihr Zehnten, was aber im Gesetz viel höher steht: Gerechtigkeit, Barmherzigkeit und Treue — das laßt ihr außer acht. Dies solltet ihr vor allem üben, doch jenes auch nicht unterlassen. 
[23:24] Ihr blinden Führer, die Mücke schafft ihr weg, und das Kamel verschluckt ihr! 
[23:25] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Die Becher und die Schüsseln haltet ihr von außen rein, inwendig aber sind sie voller Raub und Gier! 
[23:26] Du blinder Pharisäer, erst reinige den Becher drinnen, dann ist sein Äußeres schon von selber rein! 
[23:27] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Ihr gleicht getünchten Gräbern 
[23:28] So seht auch ihr von außen gerecht und ehrbar aus, inwendig aber seid ihr voller Heuchelei und Frevel. 
[23:29] Weh euch, ihr Schriftgelehrten und Pharisäer, ihr Heuchler! Ihr pflegt die Gräber der Propheten und schmückt die Grabdenkmäler der Gerechten, 
[23:30] und dabei rühmt ihr euch: 'Wenn wir unserer Väter Zeit gelebt, wir hätten nicht mit ihnen der Propheten Blut vergossen.' 
[23:31] Damit bezeugt ihr aber selbst, daß ihr die Söhne der Prophetenmörder seid! 
[23:32] So macht denn ihr das Maß der Sünden eurer Väter voll! 
[23:33] Ihr Schlangen und ihr Natternbrut, wie wollt ihr nur der Hölle Strafgericht entrinnen? 
[23:34] Darum seht: ich sende euch Propheten, Weise, Schriftgelehrte. Die einen werdet ihr in euern Versammlungshäusern geißeln und sie verfolgen von einer Stadt zur anderen. 
[23:35] So wird sich an euch rächen all das unschuldige Blut, das da vergossen ist auf Erden: Vom Blut des gerechten Abel an bis auf Sacharjas Blut, des Sohnes Berechjas, den ihr gemordet zwischen Tempel und Altar. 
[23:36] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Die Strafe für das alles wird kommen über dies Geschlecht! 
[23:37] Jerusalem, Jerusalem, du tötest die Propheten und steinigst Gottes Boten! Wie oft habe ich deine Kinder um mich sammeln wollen, wie eine Henne ihre Küchlein unter ihre Flügel sammelt! Doch ihr habt nicht gewollt! 
[23:38] Darum soll euch euer Haus verödet liegen! 
[23:39] Denn ich sage euch: Ihr sollt mich ferner nicht mehr sehen, bis ihr einst ruft: 'Gesegnet sei, der da kommt im Namen des Herrn!'" 
[24:1] Darauf verließ Jesus den Tempelplatz. Als er so mit seinen Jüngern dahinging, traten diese zu ihm und machten ihn auf den prächtigen Bau des Tempels aufmerksam. 
[24:2] Er aber sprach zu ihnen: "Seht ihr nicht dies alles? Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Kein Stein wird hier auf dem anderen bleiben; alles soll zerstört werden." 
[24:3] Er ging dann auf den Ölberg und setzte sich dort nieder. Da traten die Jünger, als sie allein waren, zu ihm und sprachen: "Sag uns doch: Wann wird dies geschehen, und was ist das Zeichen deiner Wiederkunft und des Endes dieser Weltzeit?" 
[24:4] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Habt acht, daß euch niemand verführe! 
[24:5] Denn mancher wird kommen unter meinem Namen und behaupten: 'Ich bin der Messias!' Diese Leute werden viele irreführen. 
[24:6] Ihr werdet auch hören von Kriegen und Kriegsgerüchten. Laßt euch dadurch nicht schrecken! Denn das alles muß so kommen. doch es ist noch nicht das Ende. 
[24:7] Denn ein Volk wird sich erheben gegen das andere und ein Reich gegen das andere; hier und da werden Hungersnöte und Erdbeben sein. 
[24:8] Dies alles ist aber erst der Anfang der Nöte. 
[24:9] Zu der Zeit wird man euch verfolgen und töten; ja alle Völker werden euch hassen, weil ihr meine Jünger seid. 
[24:10] Dann werden viele vom Glauben abfallen, sie werden einander verraten und hassen. 
[24:11] Auch werden falsche Propheten in großer Zahl auftreten und viele verführen. 
[24:12] Und weil die Gesetzlosigkeit überhandnimmt, wird die Liebe bei den meisten erkalten. 
[24:13] Wer aber bis ans Ende ausharrt, der soll errettet werden. 
[24:14] Die Frohe Botschaft vom Königreich, die schon jetzt erschallt, soll in der ganzen Welt verkündigt werden, damit alle Völker ein Zeugnis empfangen. Dann erst wird das Ende kommen. 
[24:15] Seht ihr nun den Greuel der Verwüstung an heiliger Stätte stehen, wovon Daniel, der Prophet, geredet hat — wer das liest, beachte es wohl! —, 
[24:16] dann sollen, die in Judäa sind, in die Berge fliehen. 
[24:17] Wer auf dem Dach ist, gehe nicht erst ins Haus hinunter, um noch seine Habe zu holen; 
[24:18] und wer auf dem Feld ist, der kehre nicht in die Wohnung zurück, um sich noch sein Oberkleid zu holen. 
[24:19] Doch weh den Frauen, die Kinder erwarten, und stillenden Müttern in jenen Tagen! 
[24:20] Betet aber, daß eure Flucht nicht in den Winter oder auf den Sabbat falle! 
[24:21] Denn es wird dann eine große Trübsal sein, wie noch keine gewesen ist von Anfang der Welt bis heute, und wie auch keine wieder kommen wird. 
[24:22] Und wären diese Tage nicht abgekürzt, so würde kein Mensch errettet. Doch um der Auserwählten willen werden jene Tage abgekürzt. 
[24:23] Wenn euch dann jemand sagt: 'Jetzt ist der Messias hier oder da', so glaubt es nicht! 
[24:24] Denn es werden falsche Messiasse und falsche Propheten auftreten und große Zeichen und Wunder tun, um womöglich auch die Auserwählten zu verführen. 
[24:25] Ich warne euch! 
[24:26] Sagt man euch also: 'Er ist jetzt in der Wüste', so geht nicht hinaus, oder: 'er ist in diesem oder jenem Haus', so glaubt es nicht! 
[24:27] Denn wie der Blitz im Osten aufzuckt, und bis zum Westen leuchtet, so wird auch die Wiederkunft des Menschensohnes sein. 
[24:28] Denn wo der Leichnam liegt, da sammeln sich die Geier. 
[24:29] Gleich aber nach jener Trübsalszeit wird sich die Sonne verfinstern und der Mond kein Licht mehr geben, die Sterne werden vom Himmel fallen, und die Himmelskräfte werden wanken. 
[24:30] Dann erscheint am Himmel das Zeichen des Menschensohnes, und bei seinem Anblick werden wehklagen alle Völker der Erde; denn sie werden den Menschensohn kommen sehen auf des Himmels Wolken mit großer Macht und Herrlichkeit. 
[24:31] Und er wird seine Boten senden; die sollen die Posaune blasen, daß es weithin schallt: so werden sie seine Auserwählten zu ihm sammeln von allen Himmelsgegenden aus aller Welt. 
[24:32] Vom Feigenbaum entnehmt eine Lehre: Wenn seine Zweige saftig werden und Blätter treiben, so wißt ihr, daß der Sommer nahe ist. 
[24:33] So sollt ihr auch, wenn ihr dies alles seht, gewiß sein, daß Er nahe vor der Tür ist. 
[24:34] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Diese Weltzeit ist nicht eher zu Ende, als bis dies alles geschehen ist. 
[24:35] Himmel und Erde werden vergehen, meine Worte aber werden nimmermehr vergehen. 
[24:36] Den Tag und die Stunde aber kennt niemand, auch die Engel des Himmels nicht, sondern nur mein Vater allein. 
[24:37] Wie es aber zuging in Noahs Tagen, so wird's auch zugehen bei der Wiederkunft des Menschensohnes. 
[24:38] In den Tagen vor der Sintflut aßen und tranken die Menschen, sie nahmen zur Ehe und gaben zur Ehe. So trieben sie's bis zu dem Tage, als Noah in die Arche ging; 
[24:39] und sie ahnten die Gefahr nicht, bis die Flut hereinbrach und sie alle hinwegraffte. Ganz ebenso wird's bei der Wiederkunft des Menschensohnes sein. 
[24:40] Da werden zwei Männer auf demselben Acker arbeiten: der eine wird mitgenommen, der andere bleibt zurück. 
[24:41] Zwei Frauen werden an derselben Mühle mahlen: die eine wird mitgenommen, die andere bleibt zurück. 
[24:42] So wacht nun! Ihr wißt ja nicht, an welchem Tag euer Herr kommt. 
[24:43] Das seht ihr ein: wenn ein Hausherr wüßte, zu welcher Nachtstunde der Dieb käme, so bliebe er wach und ließe nicht in sein Haus einbrechen. 
[24:44] Darum haltet auch ihr euch immerfort bereit; denn der Menschensohn kommt zu einer Stunde, da ihr es nicht vermutet. 
[24:45] Wäre doch jeder Knecht treu und klug, den ein Hausherr über sein Gesinde setzt, damit er ihnen Speise gebe zu rechter Zeit! 
[24:46] Wohl dem Knecht, den sein Herr bei seiner Rückkehr also tätig findet! 
[24:47] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Er wird ihn über alle seine Güter setzen. 
[24:48] Ist aber der Knecht gewissenlos und denkt in seinem Herzen: 'Mein Herr bleibt noch lange weg'; 
[24:49] fängt er dann an, die ihm untergebenen Knechte zu mißhandeln, während er mit Trunkenbolden schmaust und zecht; 
[24:50] so wird sein Herr ihn überraschen an einem Tag, wo er's nicht erwartet. 
[24:51] Dann wird er ihn blutig peitschen lassen und ihn an den Ort verweisen, wo die Heuchler sind. Dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein. 
[25:1] Dann gleicht das Königreich der Himmel zehn Jungfrauen, die mit ihren Lampen in der Hand dem Bräutigam entgegengingen. 
[25:2] Aber fünf von ihnen waren töricht, und nur fünf waren klug. 
[25:3] Die törichten nahmen wohl ihre Lampen mit, aber keinen Ölvorrat. 
[25:4] Die klugen aber hatten außer ihren Lampen auch noch in Krügen Öl bei sich. 
[25:5] Als sich nun die Ankunft des Bräutigams verzögerte, nickten sie alle ein und fielen in Schlaf. 
[25:6] Um Mitternacht aber ertönte der laute Ruf: 'Jetzt kommt der Bräutigam! Geht und holt ihn festlich ein!' 
[25:7] Da wurden alle Jungfrauen wach und setzten ihre Lampen instand. 
[25:8] Nun sprachen die törichten zu den klugen: 'Gebt uns von euerm Öl, denn unsere Lampen verlöschen.' 
[25:9] Die klugen erwiderten: 'O nein! Es reicht nicht aus für uns und euch; geht lieber zu den Krämern und kauft euch Vorrat.' 
[25:10] Als sie auf dem Weg waren, um sich Öl zu kaufen, kam der Bräutigam. Die Jungfrauen, die bereit waren, gingen mit ihm in den Hochzeitssaal, und die Tür ward verschlossen. 
[25:11] Später kamen auch die anderen Jungfrauen und riefen: 'Herr, Herr, tue uns auf!' 
[25:12] Er aber antwortete: 'Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ich kenne euch nicht!' 
[25:13] Seid darum recht wachsam; denn Tag und Stunde sind euch unbekannt! 
[25:14] Es ist (mit dem Königreich der Himmel) wie mit einem Mann, der ins Ausland reisen wollte: der ließ vorher seine Knechte rufen und übergab ihnen sein Vermögen. 
[25:15] Dem einen gab er fünf Talente, dem anderen zwei, dem dritten eins, jedem nach seiner Fähigkeit. Dann reiste er ab. 
[25:16] Sofort machte sich der Empfänger der fünf Talente daran, das Geld vorteilhaft anzulegen, und gewann fünf andere dazu. 
[25:17] Ebenso gewann der Empfänger der zwei Talente noch zwei andere. 
[25:18] Der aber nur ein Talent empfangen hatte, ging hin, machte eine Grube in die Erde und verbarg darin das Geld seines Herrn. 
[25:19] Nach langer Zeit kam der Herr dieser Knechte zurück und rechnete mit ihnen ab. 
[25:20] Da erschien der Empfänger der fünf Talente, brachte noch fünf andere mit und sprach: 'Herr, fünf Talente hast du mir gegeben; sieh, fünf andere habe ich damit gewonnen.' 
[25:21] Da sprach sein Herr zu ihm: 'Recht so, du wackerer und treuer Knecht! Du bist über wenigem treu gewesen, ich will dich über viel setzen. Nimm teil an deines Herrn Freudenfest!' 
[25:22] Dann erschien der Empfänger der zwei Talente und sprach: 'Herr, zwei Talente hast du mir gegeben; sieh, zwei andere habe ich damit gewonnen.' 
[25:23] Da sprach sein Herr zu ihm: 'Recht so, du wackerer und treuer Knecht! Du bist über wenig treu gewesen, ich will dich über viel setzen. Nimm teil an deines Herrn Freudenfest!' 
[25:24] Endlich erschien der Empfänger des einen Talents und sprach: 'Herr, ich kenne dich als einen harten Mann: du willst ernten, wo du nicht gesät, und Korn einsammeln von der Tenne, wo du nicht geworfelt hast. 
[25:25] Deshalb bin ich aus Furcht hingegangen und habe dein Talent in der Erde verborgen. Hier hast du dein Geld wieder.' 
[25:26] Da antwortete ihm sein Herr: 'Du gewissenloser, fauler Knecht! Du weißt, ich will da ernten, wo ich nicht gesät, und Korn einsammeln von der Tenne, wo ich nicht geworfelt habe? 
[25:27] Nun, dann hättest du mein Geld wenigstens bei der Bank anlegen sollen: so hätte ich doch bei meiner Rückkehr mein Eigentum mit Zins zurückbekommen. 
[25:28] Nehmt ihm nun das Talent und gebt es dem, der die zehn Talente hat. — 
[25:29] Denn wer (viel) hat, der soll noch mehr empfangen, daß er die Fülle haben; doch wer nur wenig hat, dem soll sogar das wenige genommen werden. — 
[25:30] Den unbrauchbaren Knecht aber werft in die Finsternis hinaus: dort wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein.' 
[25:31] Ist aber der Menschensohn in seiner Herrlichkeit gekommen, und alle Engel mit ihm, dann setzt er sich auf seinen herrlichen Königsthron. 
[25:32] Alle Völker versammeln sich vor seinem Angesicht. Und er wird sie voneinander scheiden, wie ein Hirte die Schafe von den Ziegenböcken scheidet, 
[25:33] und er stellt die Schafe zu seiner Rechten, die Böcke aber zur Linken. 
[25:34] Dann wird der König sagen zu denen, die ihm zur Rechten stehen: 'Kommt her, ihr Gesegneten meines Vaters, nehmt in Besitz das Königreich, das euch bereitet ist seit Grundlegung der Welt! 
[25:35] Denn ich bin hungrig gewesen, und ihr habt mir Speise gereicht; ich bin durstig gewesen, und ihr habt mich getränkt; ich bin obdachlos gewesen, und ihr habt mich aufgenommen; 
[25:36] ich bin nackt gewesen, und ihr habt mich besucht; ich bin im Gefängnis gewesen, und ihr seid zu mir gekommen.' 
[25:37] Dann werden ihm die Gerechten erwidern: 'Herr, wann haben wir dich hungrig gesehen und gespeist, oder durstig und dich getränkt? 
[25:38] Wann haben wir dich obdachlos gesehen und in unser Haus genommen, oder nackt und dich bekleidet? 
[25:39] Wann haben wir dich krank gesehen oder im Gefängnis und sind zu dir gekommen?' 
[25:40] Und der König wird ihnen antworten: 'Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Jeden Liebesdienst, den ihr einem meiner geringsten Brüder, die hier stehen, erwiesen habt, den habt ihr mir erwiesen.' 
[25:41] Dann wird der König sagen zu denen, die ihm zur Linken stehen: 'Hinweg von meinem Angesicht, ihr Verfluchten! Geht in das ewige Feuer, das mein Vater dem Teufel und seinen Engeln bereitet hat! 
[25:42] Denn ich bin hungrig gewesen, und ihr habt mir keine Speise gereicht; ich bin durstig gewesen und ihr habt mich nicht getränkt; 
[25:43] ich bin obdachlos gewesen, und ihr habt mich nicht aufgenommen; ich bin nackt gewesen, und ihr habt mich nicht bekleidet; ich bin krank und im Gefängnis gewesen und ihr habt mich nicht besucht!' 
[25:44] Dann werden auch sie erwidern: 'Herr, wann haben wir dich hungrig oder durstig gesehen, wann obdachlos oder nackt, wann krank oder im Gefängnis, und haben dir nicht gedient?' 
[25:45] Dann wird er ihnen antworten: 'Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Was ihr versäumt habt an einem der Geringsten, die hier stehen, das habt ihr an mir versäumt.' 
[25:46] Und sie gehen weg zu ewiger Strafe; die Gerechten aber gehen ein ins ewige Leben." 
[26:1] Als Jesus alle diese Reden vollendet hatte, sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: 
[26:2] "Ihr wißt, daß übermorgen das Passahfest ist; dann wird der Menschensohn dem Kreuzestod überliefert." 
[26:3] Da versammelten sich die Hohenpriester und Ältesten des Volkes in dem Palast des Hohenpriesters, namens Kaiphas, 
[26:4] und beratschlagten, wie sie Jesus mit List in ihre Gewalt bekommen und töten könnten. 
[26:5] Sie sagten aber: "Nur nicht am Fest! Es könnte sonst zu einer Volkserhebung kommen." 
[26:6] Als sich nun Jesus in Bethanien im Haus Simons des Aussätzigen aufhielt, 
[26:7] trat eine Frau zu ihm mit einem Glas kostbaren Salböls und goß es auf sein Haupt, während er auf seinem Sitz beim Mahl ruhte. 
[26:8] Bei diesem Anblick wurden die Jünger unwillig und sprachen: 
[26:9] "Schade um das Salböl! Man hätte es teuer verkaufen und das Geld den Armen geben können." 
[26:10] Jesus hörte das und sprach zu ihnen: "Warum kränkt ihr die Frau? Sie hat ein rühmlich Werk an mir getan. 
[26:11] Denn Arme habt ihr immer bei euch, mich aber habt ihr nicht immer. 
[26:12] Mit diesem Öl, das sie auf meinen Leib gegossen, hat sie mich zum Begräbnis gesalbt. 
[26:13] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wo in der weiten Welt diese meine Heilsbotschaft verkündigt wird, da wird man auch zu ihrem Gedächtnis von ihrer Tat erzählen." 
[26:14] Darauf ging einer der Zwölf, mit Namen Judas, aus Kariot, zu den Hohenpriestern 
[26:15] und sprach: "Was wollt ihr mir geben, wenn ich ihn euch in die Hände liefere?" Sie zahlten ihm dreißig Silberlinge. 
[26:16] Seitdem suchte er nach einer günstigen Gelegenheit, ihn zu verraten. 
[26:17] Am ersten Tag der ungesäuerten Brote traten die Jünger zu Jesus und fragten ihn: "Wo sollen wir das Passahmahl bereiten?" 
[26:18] Er antwortete: "Geht in die Stadt zu dem und dem und sprecht zu ihm: 'Der Meister läßt dir sagen: Meine Zeit ist nahe; bei dir will ich das Passah halten mit meinen Jüngern.'" 
[26:19] Die Jünger führten Jesu Auftrag aus und richteten die Passahmahlzeit zu. 
[26:20] Als dann der Abend kam, nahm er mit den zwölf Jüngern beim Mahl Platz. 
[26:21] Während sie aßen, sprach er: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Einer unter euch wird mich verraten!" 
[26:22] Da wurden sie tief betrübt, und einer nach dem anderen fragte ihn: "Herr, ich bin's doch nicht?" 
[26:23] Er erwiderte: "Der eben seine Hand mit mir in die Schüssel getunkt hat, der wird mich verraten. 
[26:24] Der Menschensohn geht zwar zum Tode, das steht ja von ihm geschrieben. Doch weh dem Menschen, durch den der Menschensohn verraten wird! Für diesen Menschen wäre es am besten, er wäre nie geboren." 
[26:25] Da nahm Judas, sein Verräter, das Wort und fragte ihn: "Ich bin's doch nicht, Meister?" Er sprach zu ihm: "Du bist es." 
[26:26] Als sie aßen, nahm Jesus das Brot, sprach den Segen, brach's und gab es seinen Jüngern mit den Worten: "Nehmt, eßt, das ist mein Leib!" 
[26:27] Darauf nahm er einen Becher, sprach das Dankgebet und reichte ihn den Jüngern mit den Worten: 
[26:28] "Trinkt alle daraus! Denn dies ist mein Blut, das Blut des Neuen Bundes, das für viele vergossen werden soll zur Vergebung der Sünden. 
[26:29] Doch ich sage euch: Ich will nie wieder von diesem Gewächs des Weinstocks trinken bis zu dem Tag, wo ich den neuen Wein mit euch trinke in meines Vaters Königreich." 
[26:30] Nach dem Lobgesang gingen sie hinaus an den Ölberg. 
[26:31] Auf dem Weg dorthin sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "In dieser Nacht werdet ihr alle an mir irrewerden. Denn es steht geschrieben: Ich will den Hirten schlagen, und die Schafe der Herde werden sich zerstreuen. 
[26:32] Nach meiner Auferstehung aber will ich euch vorausgehen nach Galiläa." 
[26:33] Petrus sprach zu ihm: "Wenn auch alle anderen an dir irrewerden — ich nun und nimmer!" 
[26:34] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Wahrlich, ich sage dir: In dieser Nacht, noch vor dem Hahnenschrei, wirst du mich dreimal verleugnen." 
[26:35] Petrus entgegnete ihm: "Und müßte ich auch mit dir sterben, ich verleugne dich sicher nicht." Ebenso sprachen auch alle anderen Jünger. 
[26:36] Dann kam Jesus mit seinen Jüngern zu einem Landgut, mit Namen Gethsemane. Und er sprach zu ihnen: "Setzt euch hier nieder, während ich dorthin gehe und bete!" 
[26:37] Er nahm Petrus und die beiden Söhne des Zebedäus mit sich. Nun überfiel ihn Traurigkeit und Grauen, 
[26:38] und er sprach zu ihnen: "Meine Seele ist zum Tode betrübt; bleibt hier und wacht mit mir!" 
[26:39] Dann ging er ein wenig weiter, fiel nieder auf sein Angesicht und betete: "Mein Vater, ist es möglich, so gehe dieser Kelch an mir vorüber. Doch nicht wie ich will, sondern wie du willst." 
[26:40] Und er kam zurück zu seinen Jüngern und fand sie schlafend. Da sprach er zu Petrus: "Könnt ihr denn nicht einmal eine Stunde mit mir wachen? 
[26:41] Wachet und betet, damit ihr nicht in Versuchung fallet! Der Geist ist zwar willig, aber das Fleisch ist schwach." 
[26:42] Dann ging er zum zweiten Mal hin und betete: "Mein Vater, kann dieser Kelch nicht vorübergehen, ohne daß ich ihn trinke, so geschehe dein Wille." 
[26:43] Als er zurückkam fand er sie wieder schlafend; denn die Augen fielen ihnen zu vor Müdigkeit. 
[26:44] Und er verließ sie, ging wieder weg und betete zum dritten Mal, ganz mit denselben Worten. 
[26:45] Dann kam er zu den Jüngern und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr schlaft noch weiter und ruht? Seht, der Augenblick ist nahe! Jetzt wird der Menschensohn in Sünderhände geliefert! 
[26:46] Auf, wir gehn! Mein Verräter naht!" 
[26:47] Während er noch redete, da erschien Judas, einer der Zwölf, begleitet von einer großen Schar, die, mit Schwertern und Knütteln bewaffnet, von den Hohenpriestern und Ältesten des Volkes ausgesandt war. 
[26:48] Sein Verräter aber hatte ein Zeichen mit ihnen verabredet und gesagt: "Wen ich küsse, der ist's, den nehmt fest!" 
[26:49] Sogleich nun trat er auf Jesus zu mit den Worten: "Sei gegrüßt, Meister!" und küßte ihn. 
[26:50] Jesus aber sprach zu ihm: "Freund, wozu bist du hier?" Nun traten sie hinzu, legten Hand an Jesus und nahmen ihn gefangen. 
[26:51] Doch einer der Begleiter Jesu streckte seine Hand aus, zog sein Schwert, schlug nach dem Knecht des Hohenpriesters und hieb ihm das Ohr ab. 
[26:52] Da sprach Jesus zu ihm: "Stecke dein Schwert wieder ein! Denn alle, die zum Schwert greifen, sollen durchs Schwert umkommen. 
[26:53] Oder meinst du, ich könnte meinen Vater nicht bitten, er möge mir in diesem Augenblick mehr als zwölf Heerscharen Engel zu Hilfe senden? 
[26:54] Wie würde dann aber die Schrift erfüllt? Es muß so kommen!" 
[26:55] Zugleich sprach Jesus zu der Schar: "Wie gegen einen Räuber seid ihr mit Schwertern und Knütteln ausgezogen, um mich gefangenzunehmen. Tagtäglich habe ich im Tempel gesessen und gelehrt, und ihr habt mich nicht festgenommen." 
[26:56] - Dies alles aber ist geschehen, damit sich die Schriften der Propheten erfüllten. — Da verließen ihn alle seine Jünger und flohen. 
[26:57] Nach seiner Gefangennahme ward Jesus zu dem Hohenpriester Kaiphas geführt, bei dem sich die Schriftgelehrten und Ältesten versammelt hatten. 
[26:58] Petrus aber folgte ihm von weitem bis zu des Hohenpriesters Palast; dort trat er ein und setzte sich zu den Dienern, um zu sehen, wie es ende. 
[26:59] Die Hohenpriester aber und der ganze Hohe Rat suchten nach einem falschen Zeugnis gegen Jesus, damit sie ihm zum Tod verurteilen könnten. 
[26:60] Aber obwohl viele falsche Zeugen auftraten, fanden sie doch keines. Schließlich kamen zwei 
[26:61] und sagten aus: "Dieser Mann hat behauptet: Ich kann den Tempel Gottes niederreißen und ihn in drei Tagen wiederbauen." 
[26:62] Da erhob sich der Hohepriester und sprach zu ihm: "Antwortest du nichts auf das, was diese wider dich vorbringen?" 
[26:63] Doch Jesus schwieg. Dach sprach der Hohepriester zu ihm: "Ich beschwöre dich bei Gott, dem Lebendigen: Sag uns: bist du der Messias, Gottes Sohn?" 
[26:64] Jesus erwiderte: "Ja, ich bin's. Doch ich versichere euch: Von nun an sollt ihr den Menschensohn sitzen sehen zur Rechten der Macht und kommen auf des Himmels Wolken." 
[26:65] Da zerriß der Hohepriester seine Kleider und sprach: "Er hat Gott gelästert! Was brauchen wir noch weiter Zeugen? Ihr habt ja selbst seine Gotteslästerung gehört. 
[26:66] Wie urteilt ihr?" Sie erwiderten ihm: "Er ist des Todes schuldig!" 
[26:67] Nun spien sie ihm ins Angesicht und schlugen ihn mit Fäusten; andere gaben ihm Backenstreiche 
[26:68] und sprachen dabei (höhnisch): "Zeig dich als Prophet, Messias! Sag uns: wer hat dich geschlagen?" 
[26:69] Unterdes saß Petrus draußen im Hof. Da kam eine Magd auf ihn zu und sprach: "Du warst auch bei dem Jesus aus Galiläa!" 
[26:70] Er leugnete aber in Gegenwart aller und sagte: "Ich verstehe nicht, was du von mir willst." 
[26:71] Als er dann aus dem inneren Hof in die Halle trat, sah ihn eine andere Magd. Die sprach zu den Leuten dort: "Der hier hat zu Jesus von Nazaret gehört!" 
[26:72] Und wieder leugnete er und schwur dazu: "Ich kenne den Menschen nicht!" 
[26:73] Nach einer kleinen Weile traten die Umstehenden zu Petrus und sprachen: "Wahrhaftig, du gehörst auch zu ihnen! Schon deine Mundart verrät dich." 
[26:74] Da fing er an, sich zu verwünschen und zu schwören: "Ich kenne den Menschen nicht!" In dem Augenblick krähte ein Hahn. 
[26:75] Da dachte Petrus an Jesu Wort: "Noch vor dem Hahnenschrei wirst du mich dreimal verleugnen." Und er ging hinaus und weinte bitterlich. 
[27:1] Nach Tagesanbruch berieten alle Hohenpriester und die Ältesten des Volkes, wie sie das Todesurteil an Jesus am besten vollziehen lassen könnten. 
[27:2] Dann führten sie ihn gefesselt ab und überlieferten ihn dem Statthalter Pontius Pilatus. 
[27:3] Als Judas, sein Verräter, sah, daß er verurteilt worden war, da brachte er, von Reue gequält, die dreißig Silberlinge den Hohenpriestern und Ältesten zurück 
[27:4] und sprach: "Ich habe mich versündigt durch den Verrat unschuldigen Bluts." 
[27:5] Sie antworteten ihm: "Was geht uns das an? Das ist deine Sache!" Da warf er das Geld in den Tempel und eilte davon, ging hin und erhängte sich. 
[27:6] Die Hohenpriester aber nahmen das Geld und sprachen: "Es darf nicht in den Tempelschatz gelegt werden, denn es ist Blutgeld." 
[27:7] So kauften sie denn nach einer Beratung den bekannten Töpferacker dafür zum Begräbnisplatz für die Fremden. 
[27:8] Darum heißt der Acker noch heutigentags der Blutacker. 
[27:9] So erfüllte sich das Wort des Propheten Jeremia: Ich nahm die dreißig Silberlinge, die ich als Lohn empfangen für ihn, auf den einige der Söhne Israels einen Preis gesetzt, 
[27:10] und gab sie für den Töpferacker, wie mir der Herr befohlen hatte. 
[27:11] Jesus wurde nun vor den Statthalter geführt. Der fragte ihn: "Bist du der Juden König?" Jesus antwortete: "Ja, ich bin's." 
[27:12] Doch auf die Anklagen der Hohenpriester und Ältesten erwiderte er nichts. 
[27:13] Da sprach Pilatus zu ihm: "Hörst du nicht, was sie alles gegen dich vorbringen?" 
[27:14] Aber er antwortete ihm auf keine einzige Frage, so daß es den Statthalter sehr wunder nahm. 
[27:15] Nun pflegte der Statthalter an jedem Passahfest dem Volk nach dessen freier Wahl einen Gefangenen loszugeben. 
[27:16] Man hatte damals aber einen berüchtigten Gefangenen, der hieß Barabbas. 
[27:17] Als sich nun viele aus dem Volk angesammelt hatten, fragte sie Pilatus: "Wen soll ich euch losgeben: Barabbas oder Jesus, den man den Messias nennt?" 
[27:18] Er wußte nämlich, daß sie ihn nur aus Neid überantwortet hatten. 
[27:19] Während er auf dem Richterstuhl saß, ließ seine Frau ihm sagen: "Habe du nichts zu schaffen mit diesem Gerechten; denn ich habe heute nacht einen unheilvollen Traum über ihn gehabt." 
[27:20] Die Hohenpriester und die Ältesten hatten indes das Volk dazu beredet, Barabbas sich loszubitten und Jesu Tod zu fordern. 
[27:21] Als nun der Statthalter sie von neuem fragte: "Wen von diesen beiden soll ich euch losgeben?", da riefen sie: "Barabbas!" 
[27:22] Pilatus sprach zu ihnen: "Was soll ich denn mit Jesus machen, den man den Messias nennt?" Sie riefen alle: "Ans Kreuz mit ihm!" 
[27:23] Da fragte der Statthalter: "Was hat er denn verbrochen?" Sie aber schrien nur noch lauter: "Ans Kreuz mit ihm!" 
[27:24] Als nun Pilatus einsah, daß er nichts erreichte, sondern daß der Lärm immer ärger wurde, da ließ er Wasser bringen, wusch sich vor aller Augen die Hände und sprach: "Ich bin unschuldig an dem Blut dieses Gerechten! Seht ihr zu!" 
[27:25] Da rief das ganze Volk: "Sein Blut komme auf uns und auf unsere Kinder!" 
[27:26] Da gab er ihnen Barabbas los. Jesus aber ließ er geißeln und übergab ihn dann (den Soldaten) zur Kreuzigung. 
[27:27] Nun führten die Soldaten des Statthalters Jesus in das Innere des Palastes und sammelten die ganze Schar ihrer Genossen, um ihren Spott mit ihm zu treiben. 
[27:28] Sie entkleideten ihn, legten ihm einen scharlachroten Soldatenmantel um, 
[27:29] flochten aus Dornen eine Krone und setzten sie ihm aufs Haupt und gaben ihm einen Rohrstab in seine rechte Hand. Dann beugten sie die Knie vor ihm und riefen höhnisch: "Heil dir, Judenkönig!" 
[27:30] Dabei spien sie ihn an, nahmen den Rohrstab und schlugen ihn damit aufs Haupt. 
[27:31] Als sie so ihren Spott mit ihm getrieben hatten, zogen sie ihm den Soldatenmantel aus, legten ihm seine eigenen Kleider wieder an und führten ihn ab zur Kreuzigung. 
[27:32] Als sie die Stadt verließen, trafen sie einen Mann aus Kyrene, namens Simon. Den zwangen sie, Jesu Kreuz zu tragen. 
[27:33] So kamen sie zu einem Platz, namens Golgatha, das heißt Schädelstätte. 
[27:34] Dort gaben sie ihm betäubenden Wein zu trinken. Doch als er ihn gekostet hatte, wollte er ihn nicht trinken. 
[27:35] Nach seiner Kreuzigung verteilten sie seine Kleider unter sich, indem sie das Los darüber warfen. 
[27:36] Dann setzten sie sich dort nieder und hielten bei ihm Wache. 
[27:37] Über seinem Haupt aber war eine Inschrift angebracht mit der Angabe seiner Schuld, die lautete: Dies ist Jesus, der Juden König. 
[27:38] Auch wurden mit ihm zwei Räuber gekreuzigt, der eine zu seiner Rechten, der andere zu seiner Linken. 
[27:39] Die Vorübergehenden aber schmähten ihn: sie schüttelten den Kopf 
[27:40] und sprachen: "Du wolltest ja den Tempel niederreißen und ihn in drei Tagen wiederbauen. Nun hilf dir selbst! Bist du Gottes Sohn, so steige vom Kreuz herab!" 
[27:41] Auch die Hohenpriester samt den Schriftgelehrten und den Ältesten spotteten und sagten: 
[27:42] "Anderen hat er geholfen, und sich selbst kann er nun nicht helfen! Er will ja der König Israels sein! Nun gut, so mag er jetzt vom Kreuz heruntersteigen! Dann wollen wir an ihn glauben. 
[27:43] Er hat auf Gott vertraut; der mag ihn nun retten, wenn's ihm gefällt. Er hat ja gesagt: ich bin Gottes Sohn." 
[27:44] Ebenso beschimpften ihn die Räuber, die mit ihm gekreuzigt waren. 
[27:45] Von der sechsten Stunde aber bis zur neunten bedeckte Finsternis die ganze Gegend. 
[27:46] Und um die neunte Stunde rief Jesus mit lauter Stimme: "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani!" Das heißt: Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen? 
[27:47] Als dies einige der Umstehenden hörten, sprachen sie: "Der ruft Elia." 
[27:48] Sofort lief einer von ihnen hin, nahm einen Schwamm, füllte ihn mit Essig, steckte ihn auf einen Rohrstab und wollte ihm zu trinken geben. 
[27:49] Da sprachen die anderen: "Laß doch! Wir wollen sehen, ob Elia wirklich kommt und ihm hilft." 
[27:50] Jesus aber schrie nochmals laut und gab den Geist auf. 
[27:51] In diesem Augenblick zerriß der Tempelvorhang von oben bis unten in zwei Stücke. 
[27:52] Die Erde erbebte. Die Felsen zerbarsten. Die Gräber öffneten sich, und viele Leiber der entschlafenen Heiligen wurden auferweckt; 
[27:53] die gingen aus ihren Gräbern hervor, kamen nach seiner Auferstehung in die heilige Stadt und erschienen vielen. 
[27:54] Als aber der Hauptmann und seine Leute, die bei Jesus Wache hielten, das Erdbeben und, was sich sonst noch zutrug, sahen, da wurden sie von großer Furcht erfüllt und sprachen: "Dieser Mann ist wirklich Gottes Sohn gewesen!" 
[27:55] Es waren dort auch viele Frauen, die von fern zusahen: sie hatten Jesus von Galiläa her begleitet und ihm gedient. 
[27:56] Unter ihnen waren auch Maria aus Magdala, Maria, die Mutter des Jakobus und des Josef, und die Mutter der Söhne des Zebedäus. 
[27:57] Am Abend kam ein reicher Mann, aus Arimathäa gebürtig, mit Namen Josef, der auch eine Jünger Jesu geworden war. 
[27:58] Der ging zu Pilatus und bat ihn um Jesu Leichnam. Da befahl Pilatus, man solle ihm den Leichnam überlassen. 
[27:59] Nun nahm Josef den Leichnam, ließ ihn in reine Leinwand wickeln 
[27:60] und in ein noch unbenutztes Grab legen, da er für sich in einen Felsen hatte hauen lassen. Dann ließ er einen großen Stein vor die Grabesöffnung wälzen und entfernte sich. 
[27:61] Maria aus Magdala aber und die andere Maria blieben dort und setzten sich dem Grab gegenüber. 
[27:62] Am nächsten Tag, am Tag nach dem Freitag, kamen die Hohenpriester und die Pharisäer gemeinsam zu Pilatus 
[27:63] und sprachen: "Herr, es ist uns eingefallen, daß jener Betrüger bei seinen Lebzeiten gesagt hat: 'Nach drei Tagen werde ich auferstehen.' 
[27:64] Laß nun das Grab bis zum dritten Tag streng bewachen, damit nicht etwa seine Jünger kommen und ihn stehlen und dann zum Volk sagen: 'Er ist von den Toten auferstanden.' Dann wäre der letzte Betrug noch schlimmer als der erste." 
[27:65] Pilatus sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr sollt eine Wache haben. Geht hin und verwahrt das Grab, so gut ihr könnt." 
[27:66] Da gingen sie hin und sicherten das Grab: sie versiegelten den Stein und stellten die Wache aus. 
[28:1] Nach dem Sabbat, im Morgengrauen des ersten Wochentages, gingen Maria von Magdala und die andere Maria hin, um das Grab zu besuchen. 
[28:2] Plötzlich entstand ein starkes Erdbeben. Denn ein Engel des Herrn kam vom Himmel herab, trat zum Grab, wälzte den Stein hinweg und setzte sich darauf. 
[28:3] Er sah aus wie ein leuchtender Blitz, und sein Gewand war weiß wie Schnee. 
[28:4] Bei seinem Anblick erschraken die Grabeswächter: sie erbebten und waren wie tot. 
[28:5] Der Engel aber sprach zu den Frauen: "Fürchtet ihr euch nicht! Ich weiß, ihr wollt nach Jesus sehen, dem Gekreuzigten. 
[28:6] Er ist nicht hier, er ist auferstanden, wie er es vorausgesagt. Kommt her und seht die Stätte, wo er gelegen hat! 
[28:7] Geht jetzt schnell hin und meldet seinen Jüngern: 'Er ist auferstanden von den Toten und geht euch nun voraus nach Galiläa; dort werdet ihr ihn sehen!' Das versichere ich euch." 
[28:8] Da gingen sie schnell von dem Grab weg, und noch voll Schrecken, aber auch in großer Freude eilten sie davon, um seinen Jüngern, diese Botschaft zu bringen. 
[28:9] Plötzlich trat ihnen Jesus entgegen mit den Worten: "Seid gegrüßt!" Da eilten sie auf ihn zu, umfaßten seine Füße und fielen vor ihm nieder. 
[28:10] Jesus aber sprach zu ihnen: "Fürchtet euch nicht! Geht hin und sagt meinen Brüdern, sie sollen nach Galiläa gehen: dort werden sie mich sehen.! 
[28:11] Während sie ihres Weges gingen, kamen einige der Grabeswächter in die Stadt und meldeten den Hohenpriestern alles, was vorgefallen war. 
[28:12] Da hielten diese mit den Ältesten eine Versammlung und, als sie Rats gepflogen, gaben sie den Soldaten reichlich Geld 
[28:13] und sprachen: "Sagt: 'Seine Jünger sind bei Nacht gekommen und haben ihn gestohlen, als wir gerade schliefen.' 
[28:14] Und wenn es dem Statthalter zu Ohren kommt, so wollen wir ihn schon beschwichtigen und dafür sorgen, daß ihr straflos ausgeht." 
[28:15] Da nahmen sie das Geld und taten, wie sie angewiesen waren. So hat sich dies Gerede bei den Juden verbreitet, und noch heute ist es in Umlauf. 
[28:16] Die elf Jünger aber gingen nach Galiläa auf den Berg, wohin sie Jesus beschieden hatte. 
[28:17] Bei seinem Anblick fielen sie anbetend vor ihm nieder; andere aber hatten Zweifel. 
[28:18] Da trat Jesus näher und sprach zu ihnen: "Mir ist alle Macht verliehen worden im Himmel und auf Erden. 
[28:19] So geht denn hin und sammelt mir aus allen Völkern Jünger: führt sie durch die Taufe in die Gemeinschaft des Vaters, des Sohnes und des Heiligen Geistes 
[28:20] und lehrt sie gehorchen allem, was ich euch geboten habe. Und wisset: ich bin bei euch alle Tage bis an das Ende dieser Weltzeit." 

### Mark

[1:1] Die Frohe Botschaft Jesu Christi wurde eingeleitet 
[1:2] im Einklang mit den Worten in dem Buch des Propheten Jesaja: Sieh, ich sende meinen Boten vor dir her, der dir den Weg bereiten soll. 
[1:3] In der Wüste ruft eine Stimme: Bereitet dem Herrn den Weg, ebnet ihm die Pfade! 
[1:4] Demgemäß trat Johannes der Täufer in der Wüste auf; er verkündigte eine Taufe, die von Sinnesänderung begleitet sein müsse, damit man Vergebung der Sünden empfangen könne. 
[1:5] Da gingen zu ihm hinaus die Leute aus dem ganzen jüdischen Land und alle Bewohner Jerusalems. Die ließen sich im Jordanfluß von ihm taufen und bekannten ihre Sünden. 
[1:6] Johannes trug ein Kleid von Kamelhaaren und um seine Hüften einen Ledergurt; er nährte sich von Heuschrecken und wildem Honig. 
[1:7] In seiner Predigt sagte er: "Nach mir kommt einer, der hat größere Gewalt als ich; ich bin nicht wert, mich zu bücken und ihm seine Schuhriemen aufzubinden. 
[1:8] Ich habe euch nur mit Wasser getauft; er aber wird euch mit Heiligem Geist taufen." 
[1:9] In jenen Tagen kam nun auch Jesus aus dem galiläischen Ort Nazaret und ließ sich von Johannes im Jordan taufen. 
[1:10] In dem Augenblick, wo er aus dem Wasser wieder ans Ufer stieg, sah er, wie sich der Himmel öffnete und der Geist wie eine Taube auf ihn herniederschwebte. 
[1:11] Und eine Stimme aus dem Himmel sprach: "Du bist mein geliebter Sohn; dich habe ich erkoren." 
[1:12] Unmittelbar darauf führte ihn der Geist mit unwiderstehlicher Gewalt in die Wüste. 
[1:13] Dort hielt er sich vierzig Tage auf und ward von dem Satan versucht. Die wilden Tiere umgaben ihn, und die Engel brachten ihm Speise. 
[1:14] Als Johannes verhaftet war, kam Jesus nach Galiläa und verkündigte dort die Frohe Botschaft Gottes. 
[1:15] "Die Zeit", so sprach er, "ist erfüllt, und Gottes Königreich ist nahe herbeigekommen! Ändert euern Sinn und glaubt an die Frohe Botschaft!" 
[1:16] Als Jesus (eines Tages) an dem Ufer des Galiläischen Sees wandelte, sah er, wie Simon und sein Bruder Andreas gerade ein Wurfnetz in dem See auswarfen; denn sie waren Fischer. 
[1:17] Jesus sprach zu ihnen: "Kommt und folgt mir! Ich will euch zu Menschenfischern machen." 
[1:18] Da ließen sie sofort ihre Netze liegen und folgten ihm. 
[1:19] Als er eine kleine Strecke weiterging, sah er Jakobus, den Sohn des Zebedäus, und seinen Bruder Johannes, wie sie in ihrem Boot ihre Hochseenetze in Ordnung brachten. Sogleich berief er sie. 
[1:20] Da ließen sie ihren Vater Zebedäus mit den Lohnarbeitern im Boot und folgten ihm. 
[1:21] Sie kamen nach Kapernaum. Gleich am nächsten Sabbat ging er in das Versammlungshaus und lehrte. 
[1:22] Da staunten die Leute ob seiner Lehre. Denn er lehrte sie wie einer, der (göttliche) Vollmacht dazu hatte, und nicht wie die Schriftgelehrten. 
[1:23] Nun war in ihrem Versammlungshaus ein Mensch, der hatte einen unreinen Geist. 
[1:24] Der schrie plötzlich auf: "Was haben wir mit dir zu schaffen, Jesus von Nazaret? Du bist gekommen, um uns zu verderben. Wir wissen von dir, wer du bist: der Heilige Gottes." 
[1:25] Aber Jesus bedrohte ihn: "Schweig und fahr aus von ihm!" 
[1:26] Da zerrte der unreine Geist den Menschen hin und her und fuhr aus von ihm mit lautem Geschrei. 
[1:27] Da staunten sie alle und fragten einander: "Was bedeutet das? Das ist eine neue Lehre mit (göttlicher) Vollmacht! Sogar die unreinen Geister gehorchen seinem Gebot." 
[1:28] Und die Kunde von ihm verbreitete sich bald überall in jener ganzen Gegend Galiläas. 
[1:29] Sobald sie das Versammlungshaus verlassen hatten, gingen sie, begleitet von Jakobus und Johannes, in die Wohnung des Simon und Andreas. 
[1:30] Dort lag Simons Schwiegermutter fieberkrank darnieder. Das teilte man Jesus sofort mit. 
[1:31] Da ging er zu ihr, ergriff sie bei der Hand und ließ sie aufstehen. Sogleich wich das Fieber von ihr, und sie wartete ihnen bei der Mahlzeit auf. 
[1:32] Am Abend, nach Sonnenuntergang, brachte man alle Leidenden und Besessenen zu ihm. 
[1:33] Ja, die ganze Stadt war vor der Tür versammelt. 
[1:34] Er heilte viele, die an mancherlei Krankheiten litten, und trieb viele böse Geister aus. Aber er erlaubte den Geistern nicht zu reden; denn sie wußten, wer er war. 
[1:35] Frühmorgens, als es noch ganz dunkel war, stand er auf, verließ das Haus und ging an eine einsame Stätte. Dort betete er. 
[1:36] Simon aber und die anderen (Jünger) suchten ihn überall. 
[1:37] Als sie ihn gefunden hatten, sprachen sie zu ihm: "Alle Leute fragen nach dir." 
[1:38] Er antwortete ihnen: "Gehen wir doch anderswohin in die Flecken ringsum! Auch dort will ich die Heilsbotschaft verkündigen. Deshalb bin ich ja von Hause weggegangen." 
[1:39] So predigte er in ganz Galiläa in ihren Versammlungshäusern und trieb die bösen Geister aus. 
[1:40] Eines Tages nahte ihm ein Aussätziger. Der war sich vor ihm auf die Knie und flehte ihn an: "Wenn du nur willst, kannst du mich reinigen." 
[1:41] Da streckte Jesus voll Mitleid seine Hand aus, rührte ihn an und sprach: "Ich will es, werde rein!" 
[1:42] Sobald er dies gesagt, wich der Aussatz von ihm, und er wurde rein. 
[1:43] Jesus ließ ihn sofort gehen und befahl ihm streng: 
[1:44] "Hüte dich, irgendwie davon zu reden! Doch geh, zeig dich dem Priester und bring für deine Reinigung das Opfer, das Mose vorgeschrieben hat, zum Zeugnis für die Leute." 
[1:45] Kaum aber war der Mann hinausgegangen, so begann er jedem von seiner Heilung zu erzählen. Ja er machte den Vorfall so bekannt, daß Jesus nicht mehr öffentlich in einer Stadt erscheinen konnte. Er hielt sich vielmehr draußen an unbewohnten Orten auf. Aber auch dorthin strömten die Leute von allen Seiten zu ihm. 
[2:1] Nach einigen Tagen kehrte er wieder nach Kapernaum zurück. 
[2:2] Kaum ward es ruchbar, er sei zu Hause, da sammelten sich alsbald so viele (in seiner Wohnung), daß die Leute selbst vor der Tür nicht alle stehen konnten. Während er ihnen nun das Wort verkündigte, 
[2:3] brachte man ihm einen Gelähmten, der von vier Männern getragen wurde. 
[2:4] Da sie aber den Kranken der vielen Menschen wegen nicht zu ihm bringen konnten, deckten sie gerade über der Stelle, wo sich Jesus befand, das Dach ab, machten dann in der Decke eine Öffnung und ließe durch diese das Bett hinab, worauf der Gelähmte lag. 
[2:5] Als Jesus ihren Glauben sah, sprach er zu dem Gelähmten: "Mein Sohn, deine Sünden sind dir vergeben!" 
[2:6] Es saßen dort aber einige Schriftgelehrte, die dachten in ihren Herzen: 
[2:7] "Wie darf dieser Mensch so reden? Er lästert ja! Wer kann Sünden vergeben als Gott allein?" 
[2:8] Jesus erkannte sofort in seinem Geist, daß sie so bei sich dachten, und sprach zu ihnen: "Was denkt ihr da in euern Herzen? 
[2:9] Was ist leichter, zu dem Gelähmten zu sagen: 'Deine Sünden sind dir vergeben' oder das Wort zu sprechen: 'Steh auf, nimm dein Bett und wandle'? 
[2:10] Ihr sollt aber sehen, daß der Menschensohn die Vollmacht hat, auf Erden Sünden zu vergeben." Nun wandte er sich zu dem Gelähmten und sprach: 
[2:11] "Ich sage dir: Steh auf, nimm dein Bett und geh nach Hause!" 
[2:12] Da stand er auf, nahm auf der Stelle sein Bett und ging vor aller Augen hinaus. Darüber waren alle außer sich vor Staunen und priesen Gott, indem sie laut bekannten: "So etwas haben wir noch nie erlebt!" 
[2:13] Dann ging er wieder hinaus an den See. Da kam alles Volk zu ihm, und er lehrte sie. 
[2:14] Im Vorbeigehen sah er Levi, des Alphäus Sohn, vor seinem Zollhaus sitzen, und er sprach zu ihm: "Folge mir nach!" Da stand er auf und folgte ihm. 
[2:15] Als Jesus nun in Levis Haus zu Gast war, nahmen auch viele Zöllner und Sünder mit Jesus und seinen Jüngern am Mahl teil; denn eine große Zahl von ihnen hatte sich Jesus angeschlossen. 
[2:16] Als ihn aber einige Schriftgelehrte, die zu den Pharisäern gehörten, mit Sündern und Zöllnern essen sahen, sprachen sie zu seinen Jüngern: "Mit Zöllnern und Sündern ißt er?" 
[2:17] Jesus hörte das und sprach zu ihnen: "Nicht die Gesunden bedürfen des Arztes, sondern die Kranken. Ich bin nicht gekommen, um Gerechte zu berufen, sondern Sünder." 
[2:18] Die Jünger des Johannes und der Pharisäer fasteten einst. Da kamen die Leute zu Jesus und fragten ihn: "Warum fasten die Jünger des Johannes und die Jünger der Pharisäer (so viel), währen deine Jünger nicht fasten?" 
[2:19] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Können denn die Hochzeitsgäste fasten, solange der Bräutigam bei ihnen ist? Solange sie den Bräutigam bei sich haben, können sie nicht fasten. 
[2:20] Es kommt aber die Zeit, wo ihnen der Bräutigam entrissen ist: dann werden sie fasten. 
[2:21] Niemand setzt einen Flicken von neuem Tuch auf ein altes Kleid. Sonst reißt der neue Einsatz noch an anderen Stellen etwas von dem alten Kleid weg, und der Riß wird desto ärger. 
[2:22] Es gießt auch niemand neuen Wein in alte Schläuche. Sonst zerreißt der Wein die Schläuche, und dann geht der Wein samt den Schläuchen verloren. Drum soll man neuen Wein in neue Schläuche gießen." 
[2:23] Einst ging er am Sabbat durch Getreidefelder. Beim Gehen begannen seine Jünger Ähren abzureißen. 
[2:24] Da sprachen die Pharisäer zu ihm: "Sieh doch! warum tun sie etwas, was man am Sabbat nicht darf?" 
[2:25] Er antwortete ihnen: "Habt ihr nie gelesen, was David tat, als er nichts zu essen hatte und ihn und seine Begleiter hungerte? 
[2:26] Wie er zur Zeit des Hohenpriesters Abjatar in das Haus Gottes ging und die Schaubrote aß, die nur die Priester essen dürfen, und auch seinen Gefährten davon gab?" 
[2:27] Dann fuhr er fort: "Der Sabbat ist da um des Menschen willen und nicht der Mensch um des Sabbats willen. 
[2:28] Darum ist der Menschensohn auch über den Sabbat Herr." 
[3:1] Als er wieder einmal in das Versammlungshaus kam, war dort ein Mann mit einem abgestorbenen Arm. 
[3:2] Und sie lauerten ihm auf, ob er ihn wohl am Sabbat heilen werden; denn sie suchten einen Grund, ihn zu verklagen. 
[3:3] Da sprach er zu dem Mann mit dem abgestorbenen Arm: "Steh auf, tritt vor!" 
[3:4] Dann fragte er sie: "Soll man am Sabbat lieber Gutes oder Böses tun, ein Leben retten oder vernichten?" Sie aber schwiegen. 
[3:5] Da sah er sie ringsum zornig an und zugleich voll Trauer über die Verstocktheit ihres Herzens. Dann sprach er zu dem Mann: "Strecke deinen Arm aus!" Da streckte er ihn aus, und sein Arm ward wiederhergestellt. 
[3:6] Als die Pharisäer den Gottesdienst verließen, berieten sie sich alsbald mit den Anhängern des Herodes wider ihn, wie sie ihn zu Tode bringen könnten. 
[3:7] Jesus ging hierauf mit seinen Jüngern an den See zurück, und eine große Volksmenge aus Galiläa zog ihm nach. Auch aus Judäa 
[3:8] und Jerusalem, aus Idumäa, dem Ostjordanland und aus der Gegend von Tyrus und Sidon kamen die Leute auf die Kunde von seinen Taten in großen Scharen zu ihm. 
[3:9] Da sagte er zu seinen Jüngern, es solle der vielen Leute wegen stets ein Boot für ihn bereitstehen, damit man ihn nicht dränge. 
[3:10] Denn weil er viele heilte, so stürzten sich alle, die ein Leiden hatten, auf ihn, um ihn anzurühren. 
[3:11] Und wenn ihn die unreinen Geister erblickten, so fielen sie vor ihm nieder und schrien: "Du bist Gottes Sohn!" 
[3:12] Aber dann verbot er ihnen aufs strengste, ihn bekanntzumachen. 
[3:13] Eines Tages ging er auf das Gebirge. Dorthin rief er zu sich, die er selbst bestimmte, und sie kamen zu ihm. 
[3:14] Aus ihnen erwählte er zwölf, die sollten ständig um ihn sein, und er wollte sie aussenden, damit sie das Wort verkündigten 
[3:15] und auch die Macht besäßen, die bösen Geister auszutreiben. 
[3:16] Dies sind nun die Zwölf, die er bestellte: Simon, dem er den Namen Petrus gab; 
[3:17] ferner Jakobus, der Sohn des Zebedäus, und Johannes, der Bruder des Jakobus, denen er den Namen Boanerges, das heißt Donnersöhne, gab; 
[3:18] ferner Andreas, Philippus, Bartholomäus, Matthäus, Thomas, Jakobus, der Sohn des Alphäus, Thaddäus, Simon der Eiferer 
[3:19] und Judas aus Kariot, der ihn verraten hat. 
[3:20] Als er nach Hause kam, sammelten sich wieder viele Leute, so daß sie nicht einmal Gelegenheit hatten, einen Imbiß zu nehmen. 
[3:21] Als seine Verwandten das erfuhren, kamen sie herbei, um ihn mit Gewalt hinwegzuführen. Denn sie sagten: "Er ist von Sinnen!" 
[3:22] Die Schriftgelehrten aber, die von Jerusalem gekommen waren, sprachen: "Er ist besessen von Beelzebul, und im Bunde mit dem Obersten der bösen Geister treibt er die Teufel aus." 
[3:23] Da rief er sie heran und wandte sich an sie in einer Gleichnisrede. "Wie ist es möglich", so sprach er, "daß der Satan den Satan austreiben kann? 
[3:24] Ein Reich, das in sich selbst uneins ist, ein solches Reich kann nicht stehen. 
[3:25] Ein Haus, das in sich selbst uneins ist, ein solches Haus kann nicht bestehen. 
[3:26] Wenn sich nun der Satan gegen seine eigene Macht erhebt und mit sich selbst uneins ist, so kann er nicht länger bestehen, sondern es ist aus mit ihm. 
[3:27] Niemand kann in das Haus eines starken Kriegsmannes dringen und ihm seinen Hausrat rauben, wenn er nicht zuvor den Starken bindet; dann erst kann er sein Haus berauben. 
[3:28] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Alle Sünden werden den Menschenkindern vergeben, auch alle Lästerungen, die sie aussprechen mögen. 
[3:29] Wer aber eine Lästerung ausspricht gegen den Heiligen Geist, der findet in Ewigkeit keine Vergebung: er ist einer Sünde schuldig, die ewig auf ihm lastet." 
[3:30] So sprach Jesus, weil sie sagten: "Er hat einen unreinen Geist." 
[3:31] Da kamen seine Brüder und seine Mutter. Die blieben draußen stehen und ließen ihn zu sich rufen. 
[3:32] Es saß aber eine Menge Menschen um ihn. Da sagte man zu ihm: "Sieh, deine Mutter, deine Brüder und deine Schwestern sind draußen und fragen nach dir." 
[3:33] Er antwortete: "Wer ist meine Mutter? Wer sind meine Brüder?" 
[3:34] Dann sah er auf die, die rings im Kreis um ihn saßen, und sprach: "Da seht meine Mutter und meine Brüder! 
[3:35] Denn wer den Willen Gottes tut, der ist mir Bruder, Schwester und Mutter." 
[4:1] Dann begann er von neuem an dem Ufer des Sees zu lehren. Da sammelte sich eine sehr große Schar um ihn. Deshalb stieg er in einen Fischerkahn und setzte sich dort nieder: so war er auf dem See, während die Leute dicht gedrängt am Ufer auf dem Land standen. 
[4:2] Und er lehrte sie vielerlei durch Gleichnisse. In seiner Unterweisung sagte er ihnen: 
[4:3] "Merkt auf! Ein Sämann ging aus zu säen. 
[4:4] Beim Säen fielen einige Körner an den Weg. Da kamen die Vögel und pickten sie auf. 
[4:5] Andere Körner fielen auf steinigen Grund, wo sie nicht viel Erde hatten. Dort schossen sie schnell in den Halm, weil es der Erdschicht an Tiefe fehlte. 
[4:6] Als dann die Sonne heiß schien, litten die Halme von ihrer Glut; und weil sie nicht Wurzel hatten, verdorrten sie. 
[4:7] Andere Körner fielen dahin, wo Dornen wuchsen. Da schossen die Dornen auf und erstickten die Saat, und es gab keine Frucht. 
[4:8] Andere Körner fielen auf guten Boden. Die keimten und wuchsen und brachten Früchte: Dreißigfältig, sechzigfältig, ja hundertfältig." 
[4:9] Und er schloß mit den Worten: "Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre!" 
[4:10] Als er dann wieder allein war, fragten ihn die Jünger samt den Zwölfen nach diesem Gleichnis. 
[4:11] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Euch ist vertraut des Gottesreiches geheimnisvolle Wahrheit. Den anderen aber, die draußen stehen, wird alles nur in Gleichnisreden mitgeteilt. 
[4:12] Denn: Sie sollen sehen und nicht erkennen, sie sollen hören und nicht verstehen, damit sie nicht zur Umkehr kommen und Vergebung finden." 
[4:13] Dann fuhr er fort: "Dies Gleichnis versteht ihr nicht? Wie sollt ihr da die anderen alle fassen? 
[4:14] Der Sämann sät das Wort. 
[4:15] Bei denen das Wort an den Weg fällt, da wird das Wort wohl ausgesät, doch wenn sie es kaum gehört, so kommt schon der Satan und nimmt das in ihr Herz gestreute Wort hinweg. 
[4:16] Bei denen der Same auf steinigen Boden fällt, die nehmen das Wort, sobald sie es hören, mit Freuden auf; 
[4:17] aber es schlägt in ihnen nicht Wurzel, sondern sie halten nur eine Zeitlang aus. Kommt dann Trübsal oder Verfolgung wegen des Wortes, so werden sie bald im Glauben wankend. 
[4:18] Bei anderen fällt der Same unter die Dornen. Diese Leute sind wohl Hörer des Wortes, 
[4:19] aber die irdischen Sorgen, der verführerische Reiz des Reichtums und tausend andere Begierden, die dringen ins Herz und ersticken das Wort, und es bleibt ohne Frucht. 
[4:20] Aber auch solche gibt es, bei denen der Same auf guten Boden fällt. Die hören das Wort und nehme es auf und bringen Frucht: Dreißigfältig, sechzigfältig, ja hundertfältig." 
[4:21] Weiter sprach er zu ihnen: "Bringt man eine Lampe in ein Zimmer, um sie unter einen Scheffel oder unter ein Bett zu setzen? Nein, man stellt sie auf den Leuchter. 
[4:22] Denn nichts ist so verborgen, daß es nicht einmal offenbar würde; und nicht ist so versteckt, daß es nicht dereinst ans Licht käme. 
[4:23] Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre!" 
[4:24] Dann fuhr er fort: "Achtet auf das, was ihr hört! Mit dem Maß, womit ihr meßt, soll euch, den Hörern, zugemessen werden, und noch darüber hinaus. 
[4:25] Denn wer (die rechte Aufmerksamkeit) hat, dem wird (Erkenntnis) mitgeteilt; wer (sie) aber nicht hat, dem soll sogar (das wenige), was er (noch an Erkenntnis) hat, genommen werden." 
[4:26] Weiter sprach er: "Mit dem Gottesreich verhält es sich so wie mit einem Landmann, der Samen auf den Acker streut. 
[4:27] Mag er schlafen oder wachen, bei Nacht und bei Tage — der Samen sprießt, und der Halm wird länger, er begreift nicht, wie es zugeht. 
[4:28] Ganz von selbst bringt die Erde Frucht: Zuerst den Halm, dann die Ähre, dann den Weizen, der die Ähre füllt. 
[4:29] Ist aber die Frucht zur Reife gelangt, so schickt er alsbald die Schnitter hin; denn die Erntezeit ist da!" 
[4:30] Weiter sprach er: "Wie sollen wir Gottes Königreich abbilden, oder in welche Gleichnisrede sollen wir es fassen? 
[4:31] Es ist einem Senfkorn gleich. Sät man das aufs Land, so ist's das kleinste unter allen Samenkörnern auf Erden. 
[4:32] Aber ist es einmal gesät, so wächst es heran und wird am größten unter allen Gartenkräutern. Ja es treibt so große Zweige, daß unter seinem Schatten die Vögel des Himmels nisten können." 
[4:33] Durch viele solche Gleichnisreden verkündigte er den Leuten je nach ihrer Fassungskraft das Wort. 
[4:34] Während er aber zu dem Volk überhaupt nur in Gleichnissen zu reden pflegte, gab er seinen Jüngern, wenn er mit ihnen allein war, von den Gleichnisreden stets eine Auslegung. 
[4:35] Am Abend jenes Tages sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Laßt uns ans andere Ufer fahren!" 
[4:36] Da ließen sie die Menge gehen und führten ihn, müde wie er war, ins Boot. Noch andere Boote fuhren mit ihm. 
[4:37] Da brach ein heftiger Sturmwind los, und die Wogen schlugen hinein ins Boot, daß es sich mit Wasser zu füllen begann. 
[4:38] Und er war hinten im Heck, auf dem Kissen schlafend niedergestreckt. Da weckten sie ihn und sprachen zu ihm: "Meister, kümmert's dich nicht, daß wir ertrinken?" 
[4:39] Da stand er auf und schalt den Wind und sprach zum See: "Schweig! Verstumme!" Da legte sich der Wind, und es ward eine tiefe Stille. 
[4:40] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Warum seid ihr so furchtsam? Fehlt's euch denn noch immer an Glauben?" 
[4:41] Da erfaßte sie großes Entsetzen, und sie sprachen zueinander: "Wer ist doch dieser Mann, daß ihm selbst Wind und Wogen gehorchen?" 
[5:1] Sie kamen an das andere Ufer des Sees in das Gebiet der Gerasener. 
[5:2] Als er aus dem Boot stieg, kam ihm plötzlich aus den Gräbern, die dort waren, ein Mensch entgegen, der von einem unreinen Geist besessen war. 
[5:3] Der hauste in den Felsengräbern, und niemand hatte ihn bis dahin fesseln können, nicht einmal mit Ketten. 
[5:4] Denn oft schon hatte man ihn an Händen und Füßen gebunden, aber immer wieder hatte er die Handfesseln zerrissen und die Fußketten zerrieben, und niemand konnte ihn bändigen. 
[5:5] Beständig, bei Tag und bei Nacht, hielt er sich in den Gräbern und in den Bergen auf; dabei schrie er laut und zerschlug sich mit Steinen. 
[5:6] Als er nun Jesus von weitem sah, rannte er hin, fiel vor ihm nieder und rief mit lauter Stimme: 
[5:7] "Was habe ich mit dir zu schaffen, Jesus, du Sohn Gottes, des Höchsten? Ich beschwöre dich bei Gott: quäle mich doch nicht!" 
[5:8] Jesus wollte nämlich zu ihm sagen: "Fahr aus von dem Menschen, du unreiner Geist!" 
[5:9] Da fragte ihn Jesus: "Wie heißt du?" Er antwortete: "Ich heiße Legion; denn unser sind viele." 
[5:10] Die bösen Geister baten ihn dringend, sie nicht aus jener Gegend wegzusenden. 
[5:11] Nun weidete dort am Berghang eine große Herde Schweine. 
[5:12] Da baten sie ihn: "Sende uns in die Schweine dort; laß uns in sie fahren!" 
[5:13] Jesus erlaubte es ihnen sofort. Nun fuhren die unreinen Geister aus und gingen in die Schweine. Da stürmte die Herde den Abhang hinab in den See, an zweitausend Stück, und sie ertranken im See. 
[5:14] Ihre Hirten aber flohen und erzählten den Vorfall in der Stadt und auf dem Land. Da eilten die Leute herbei, um zu schauen, was da geschehen. 
[5:15] Als sie zu Jesus kamen und sahen, wie der Mann der eben noch von der Geisterschar besessen gewesen war, bekleidet und vernünftig dasaß, da wurden sie von Furcht ergriffen. 
[5:16] Die Augenzeugen erzählten ihnen auch, wie es dem Besessenen ergangen war, dazu den Vorfall mit den Schweinen. 
[5:17] Da begannen sie ihn zu bitten, er möge ihr Gebiet verlassen. 
[5:18] Als Jesu in das Boot steigen wollte, bat ihn der geheilte Besessene, daß er bei ihm bleiben dürfe. Doch er erlaubte es ihm nicht, sondern sprach zu ihm: "Geh heim zu deinen Angehörigen und erzähle ihnen, was der Herr an dir getan und wie er sich dein erbarmt hat!" 
[5:19] 
[5:20] Da ging er hin begann in den Zehn Städten zu verkünden, was Jesus an ihm getan, und alle waren darüber verwundert. 
[5:21] Als Jesus in dem Boot wieder ans andere Ufer kam, sammelte sich eine große Volksmenge um ihn. Er war noch am Ufer des Sees, 
[5:22] da erschien ein Gemeindevorsteher, mit Namen Jairus. Kaum sah er Jesus, da fiel er ihm zu Füßen 
[5:23] und bat ihn dringend: "Mein Töchterlein liegt in den letzten Zügen; komm doch und leg ihr die Hände auf, damit sie gesund werde und am Leben bleibe!" 
[5:24] Da ging er mit ihm. Eine große Volksmenge begleitete ihn und umdrängte ihn von allen Seiten. 
[5:25] Nun war dort eine Frau, die litt schon zwölf Jahre am Blutfluß. 
[5:26] Sie hatte unter den Händen mancher Ärzte Schweres erduldet und ihr ganzes Vermögen dabei zugesetzt. Doch alles war ohne Nutzen geblieben: ihr Leiden war nur noch schlimmer geworden. 
[5:27] Da hörte sie von Jesus. Diese Frau trat jetzt im Gedränge von hinten zu ihm und berührte seinen Mantel. 
[5:28] Denn sie dachte: "Wenn ich auch nur seine Kleider berühre, so werde ich gesund." 
[5:29] Sofort hörte der Blutfluß auf, und sie fühlte in ihrem Körper, daß sie von ihrer Plage geheilt war. 
[5:30] Aber auch Jesus merkte sogleich, daß Heilungskraft von ihm ausgegangen war. Daher wandte er sich um im Gedränge und fragte: "Wer hat meine Kleider angerührt?" 
[5:31] Seine Jünger antworteten ihm: "Du siehst doch, wie dich die Leute drängen, und da fragst du: Wer hat mich angerührt?" 
[5:32] Doch seine Augen suchten in der Runde, um die herauszufinden, die es getan. 
[5:33] Da geriet die Frau in Furcht, und zitternd vor Angst — denn sie wußte, was ihr geschehen — trag sie hervor, fiel vor ihm nieder und erzählte ihm die volle Wahrheit. 
[5:34] Er aber sprach zu ihr: "Meine Tochter, dein Glaube hat dich gesund gemacht. Geh hin in Frieden und sei genesen von deiner Plage!" 
[5:35] Während er noch so redete, erschienen Boten aus dem Haus des Gemeindevorstehers und meldeten ihm: "Deine Tochter ist schon gestorben; was bemühst du den Meister noch?" 
[5:36] Jesus aber beachtete diese Worte nicht weiter, sondern sprach sofort zu dem Vorsteher: "Fürchte dich nicht, glaube nur!" 
[5:37] Und er ließ niemand mitgehen als Petrus, Jakobus und Johannes, des Jakobus Bruder. 
[5:38] So kamen sie in des Vorstehers Haus. Dort ging es lärmend zu: Jesus hörte lautes Weinen und Klagen. 
[5:39] Da trat er ein und sagte zu den Leuten: "Was lärmt und weint ihr denn? Das Kind ist ja nicht tot, es schläft nur." Da verlachten sie ihn. 
[5:40] Nun schickte er die Leute alle hinaus. Nur des Kindes Eltern und seine Jünger, die ihn begleiteten, nahm er mit und trat in das Gemach, wo das Mädchen lag. 
[5:41] Er faßte das Kind bei der Hand und sprach zu ihm: "Talitha kum", das heißt: "Mägdlein, ich sage dir: steh auf!" 
[5:42] Sofort erhob sich das Mädchen und ging umher. Denn sie war schon zwölf Jahre alt. Da gerieten sie alsbald vor Staunen ganz außer sich. 
[5:43] Doch er gebot ihnen streng, daß niemand davon erführe. Und er ließ dem Kinde zu essen geben. 
[6:1] Dann ging er weg von dort und kam in seine Vaterstadt, und seine Jünger folgten ihm. 
[6:2] Am nächsten Sabbat fing er an, in dem Versammlungshaus zu lehren. Viele der Hörer sprachen voll Staunen: "Woher hat er das? Welche Weisheit ist ihm verliehen? Und solche Wunder geschehen durch seine Hände? 
[6:3] Ist das nicht der Tischler, der Sohn Marias und der Bruder des Jakobus, Joses, Judas und Simon? wohnen nicht auch seine Schwestern hier bei uns?" Und sie wollten nichts von ihm wissen. 
[6:4] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Ein Prophet gilt nirgends so wenig wie in seiner Heimat und bei seinen Verwandten und Hausgenossen." 
[6:5] Er konnte dort auch kein einziges Wunder tun; nur einige Kranke machte er durch Handauflegung gesund. 
[6:6] Und er war verwundert über ihren Unglauben. Dann durchzog er lehrend die Dörfer im Umkreis. 
[6:7] Darauf rief er die Zwölf herbei und begann sie zu Zweien auszusenden. Dabei gab er ihnen Macht über die unreinen Geister. 
[6:8] Er befahl ihnen, außer einem Wanderstab nicht mit auf den Weg zu nehmen: kein Brot, keinen Ranzen, kein Geld im Gürtel; 
[6:9] "aber", so fuhr er fort, "ihr sollt Schuhe tragen, doch nicht zwei Unterkleider anziehen." 
[6:10] Ferner sprach er zu ihnen: "In jedem Haus, wo ihr Eingang findet, da bleibt, bis ihr weiterwandert! 
[6:11] Wo man euch aber nicht aufnimmt und hören will, den Ort verlaßt und schüttelt den Staub von euern Füßen, zum Zeugnis wider sie!" 
[6:12] So zogen sie aus und forderten zur Sinnesänderung auf. 
[6:13] Sie trieben viele böse Geister aus; viele Kranke salbten sie mit Öl und heilten sie. 
[6:14] Auch der König Herodes hörte von Jesus, denn sein Name war in aller Mund. Einige sagten: "Johannes der Täufer ist von den Toten auferstanden; darum sind die Wunderkräfte in ihm wirksam." 
[6:15] Andere meinten: "Er ist Elia", wieder andere: "Er ist ein Prophet, ähnlich den Propheten der alten Zeit." 
[6:16] Als aber Herodes davon hörte, sprach er: "Es ist Johannes, den ich habe enthaupten lassen; der ist wieder auferstanden!" 
[6:17] Herodes hatte nämlich Johannes festnehmen lassen und in Ketten gefangengehalten wegen Herodias, der Frau seines Bruders Philippus. Die hatte Herodes geheiratet. 
[6:18] Aber Johannes hatte ihm gesagt: "Du darfst deines Bruders Weib nicht zur Frau haben." 
[6:19] Deshalb haßte ihn Herodias, und sie wollte ihn zu Tode bringen. Doch das gelang nicht. 
[6:20] Denn Herodes hatte Ehrfurcht vor Johannes. Er kannte ihn als einen gerechten und heiligen Mann. Darum nahm er ihn in Schutz. Und oft, wenn er ihn hörte, bekam er starke Gewissensbedenken; trotzdem hörte er ihn gern. 
[6:21] Endlich kam für Herodias eine gelegene Stunde; Herodes gab an seinem Geburtstag seinen hohen Würdenträgern und ersten Hauptleuten und den Vornehmen von Galiläa ein Festgelage. 
[6:22] Da trat die Tochter der Herodias ein und tanzte. Damit gefiel sie Herodes und seinen Gästen. Und der König sprach zu dem Mädchen: "Erbitte von mir, was du willst; du sollst es haben!" 
[6:23] Ja er schwur ihr: "Was du von mir verlangst, das will ich dir geben, und sei es die Hälfte meines Königreichs." 
[6:24] Da ging sie hinaus und fragte ihre Mutter: "Was soll ich mir fordern?" Die sagte: "Das Haupt Johannes des Täufers." 
[6:25] Gleich ging sie in Eile wieder zum König hinein und bat ihn: "Laß mir sofort auf einer Schüssel das Haupt Johannes des Täufers geben!" 
[6:26] Da ward der König aufs tiefste betrübt. Aber um seines Eides und seiner Gäste willen wollte er ihr die Bitte nicht versagen. 
[6:27] So sandte denn der König auf der Stelle einen seiner Leibwächter hin mit dem Befehl, des Johannes Haupt zu bringen. Der ging und enthauptete ihn im Gefängnis. 
[6:28] Dann brachte er sein Haupt auf einer Schüssel und gab es dem Mädchen, und das Mädchen gab's ihrer Mutter. 
[6:29] Als die Jünger des Johannes dies erfuhren, da kamen sie, holten seinen Leichnam und begruben ihn. 
[6:30] Die Apostel berichteten Jesus bei ihrer Rückkehr alles, was sie getan und gelehrt hatten. 
[6:31] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Kommt, laßt uns allein in eine menschenleere Gegend gehen: da ruht ein wenig!" Denn es war ein ständiges Kommen und Gehen, und sie fanden nicht einmal Zeit zum Essen. 
[6:32] Da fuhren sie allein in ihrem Boot an einen abgelegenen Ort. 
[6:33] Aber viele sahen sie abfahren und erkannten sie. So kam es, daß aus allen Städten dort, wohin das Boot steuerte, Leute zu Fuß zusammenliefen und noch vor ihnen den Ort erreichten. 
[6:34] Als Jesus aus dem Boot stieg, sah er eine große Schar. Er empfand tiefes Mitleid bei dem Anblick der Leute, denn sie waren wie Schafe ohne Hirten. Und er begann, sie über vieles zu belehren. 
[6:35] Als der Tag zur Neige ging, traten seine Jünger zu ihm und sprachen: "Die Gegend hier ist unbewohnt, und es ist schon spät. 
[6:36] Laß deshalb die Leute ziehen, damit sie in die umliegenden Gehöfte und Dörfer gehen und sich Lebensmittel kaufen." 
[6:37] Er aber antwortete: "Gebt ihr ihnen doch zu essen!" Da entgegneten sie ihm: "Sollen wir hingehen und für zweihundert Silberlinge Brot kaufen und ihnen zu essen geben?" 
[6:38] Da fragte er sie: "Wieviel Brote habt ihr? Geht hin, seht nach!" Sie sahen nach und sagten: "Fünf und außerdem zwei Fische." 
[6:39] Da befahl er ihnen, alle sollten sich gruppenweise auf dem grünen Rasen lagern. 
[6:40] Und sie setzten sich in Scharen zu hundert und zu fünfzig nieder. 
[6:41] Nun nahm er die fünf Brote und die beiden Fische, sah auf zum Himmel und sprach den Lobpreis. Dann brach er die Brote und gab sie seinen Jüngern, damit sie sie den Leuten vorlegten. Auch die beiden Fische teilte er unter sie alle. 
[6:42] So aßen alle und wurden satt. 
[6:43] Ja man las noch zwölf große Körbe voll Brocken auf, dazu auch Überbleibsel von den Fischen. 
[6:44] Die aber von den Broten gegessen hatten, deren Zahl betrug fünftausend Mann. 
[6:45] Gleich darauf drängte er seine Jünger, in das Boot zu gehen und an das andere Ufer nach Bethsaida vorauszufahren, während er selbst das Volk entlassen wollte. 
[6:46] Als er die Leute verabschiedet hatte, ging er auf die Bergeshöhe, um dort zu beten. 
[6:47] Beim Eintritt der Dunkelheit war das Boot mitten auf dem See und er allein auf dem Land. 
[6:48] Da sah er, wie sie große Mühe beim Rudern hatten, denn sie fuhren gegen den Wind. Um die vierte Nachtwache kam er, über den See hinwandelnd, auf sie zu, 
[6:49] als wollte er an ihnen vorübergehen. Als sie ihn so auf dem See wandeln sahen, meinten sie, es wäre ein Gespenst, und schrien auf. 
[6:50] Denn alle sahen ihn und waren voll Entsetzen. Aber alsbald redete er sie an. Er sprach zu ihnen: "Seid getrost, ich bin's; fürchtet euch nicht!" 
[6:51] Dann stieg er zu ihnen ins Boot: da legte sich der Wind. Darüber gerieten sie vor Staunen ganz außer sich. 
[6:52] Denn durch die wunderbare Speisung mit den Broten hatten sie nichts gelernt: ihr Herz war stumpf und unempfänglich geblieben. 
[6:53] Nach ihrer Überfahrt landeten sie in Genezaret und gingen dort vor Anker. 
[6:54] Als sie das Boot verließen, erkannten ihn die Leute sogleich: 
[6:55] sie eilten umher in der ganzen Gegend und trugen die Kranken auf ihren Betten hierhin und dorthin, wo er nach dem Gerücht sich aufhielt. 
[6:56] In den Dörfern, Städten und Gehöften, wohin er kam, setzte man die Kranken auf die freien Plätze und bat ihn, daß sie nur die Quaste seines Mantels berühren dürften. Und alle, die sie berührten, wurden gesund. 
[7:1] Eines Tages fanden sich die Pharisäer bei ihm ein und einige Schriftgelehrte, die aus Jerusalem gekommen waren. 
[7:2] Die sahen, wie einige seiner Jünger mit unreinen, das heißt mit ungewaschenen Händen ihre Mahlzeit hielten. — 
[7:3] Die Pharisäer nämlich und alle Juden essen nichts, ohne sich vorher nach den Satzungen der Vorfahren vom Ellenbogen bis zu den Fingerspitzen die Hände zu waschen. 
[7:4] Auch wenn sie vom Markt nach Hause kommen, genießen sie nicht eher etwas, als bis sie sich mit Wasser besprengt haben. Außerdem haben sie noch vieles andere zu halten angenommen: so zum Beispiel spülen sie Becher, Krüge und Kupfergeschirr vor dem Gebrauch im Wasser ab. — 
[7:5] Da fragten ihn die Pharisäer und die Schriftgelehrten: "Warum befolgen eine Jünger nicht die Vorschriften, die uns die Alten überliefert haben, sondern essen ihre Mahlzeit mit ungewaschenen Händen?" 
[7:6] Er antwortete ihnen: "Treffend hat Jesaja von euch Heuchlern geweissagt in dem Schriftwort: Dies Volk ehrt mich mit den Lippen. Doch ihr Herz ist fern von mir. 
[7:7] Ihr Gottesdienst ist wertlos, denn sie verkünden Lehren, die nichts als Menschensatzung sind. 
[7:8] Gottes Gebot laßt ihr außer acht und haltet statt dessen der Menschen Satzung: ihr spült Krüge und Becher ab, und viel anderes derart beobachtet ihr." 
[7:9] Dann fuhr er fort: "Ihr versteht es trefflich, Gottes Gebot beiseitezusetzen, um eure Überlieferung festzuhalten. 
[7:10] Mose hat zum Beispiel geboten: Ehre deinen Vater und deine Mutter, und: wer Vater oder Mutter schmäht, der soll des Todes sterben! 
[7:11] Ihr aber lehrt: Wenn ein Sohn zum Vater oder zur Mutter sagt: 'Als Korban hab ich erklärt', das heißt: 'Ich stifte für den Tempelschatz, was ich dir sonst zum Unterhalt gegeben hätte' — 
[7:12] so braucht er für Vater oder Mutter nichts mehr zu tun. 
[7:13] Damit setzt ihr Gottes Wort außer Kraft durch eure Satzung, die ihr lehrt. Und dergleichen tut ihr noch viel." 
[7:14] Dann rief er wieder das Volk herbei und sprach zu ihnen: "Hört mir alle zu und versteht! 
[7:15] Nichts, was von außen in den Menschen eingeht, kann ihn unrein machen; sondern was von dem Menschen ausgeht, das ist es, was ihn unrein macht. 
[7:16] Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre!" 
[7:17] Als er das Volk verlassen hatte und in ein Haus getreten war, fragten ihn seine Jünger nach dem Sinn dieses Gleichnisses. 
[7:18] Er antwortete ihnen: "Seid ihr denn auch noch unverständig? Seht ihr nicht ein, daß alles, was von außen in den Menschen eingeht, ihn nicht verunreinigen kann? 
[7:19] Denn es kommt ja nicht in sein Herz, sondern nur in den Magen und geht dann hinaus durch den Darm, der alles Unzuträgliche von den Speisen ausscheidet." 
[7:20] Dann fuhr er fort: "Was von dem Menschen ausgeht, das macht den Menschen unrein. 
[7:21] Denn von innen, aus dem Herzen der Menschen, kommen die bösen Gedanken: Unzucht, Diebstahl, Mord, Ehebruch, 
[7:22] Habsucht, Bosheit, Arglist, Ausschweifung, Neid Verleumdung, Hochmut, Leichtsinn. 
[7:23] All dies Böse kommt von innen heraus und verunreinigt den Menschen." 
[7:24] Dann verließ er jene Gegend und begab sich in das Gebiet von Tyrus und Sidon. Dort trat er in ein Haus, und niemand sollte etwas davon erfahren. Es gelang ihm aber nicht, seinen Aufenthalt zu verbergen. 
[7:25] So kam denn eine Frau, deren Töchterlein von einem unreinen Geist besessen war, auf die Kunde von seiner Ankunft herbei und warf sich ihm zu Füßen. 
[7:26] Die Frau war eine Heidin und stammte aus Phönizien. Sie bat ihn, er möge den bösen Geist von ihrer Tochter austreiben. 
[7:27] Er aber sprach zu ihr: "Laß zuerst die Kinder satt; denn es wäre nicht recht, den Kindern das Brot zu nehmen und es den Hündchen hinzuwerfen." 
[7:28] Sie antwortete ihm: "Gewiß, Herr! Und doch dürfen die Hündchen unter dem Tisch die Brocken der Kinder fressen." 
[7:29] Da sprach er zu ihr: "Um dieses Wortes willen geh! Der böse Geist ist ausgefahren von deiner Tochter." 
[7:30] Und wirklich, als sie nach Hause kam, fand sie das Kind auf dem Bett liegend, und der böse Geist war ausgefahren. 
[7:31] Dann verließ er das Gebiet von Tyrus und kam über Sidon wieder an den Galiläischen See mitten in die Landschaft der Zehn Städte. 
[7:32] Dort brachte man einen Taubstummen zu ihm und bat ihn, er möge ihm die Hand auflegen. 
[7:33] Da nahm er ihn abseits von der Menge. Als er so allein mit ihm war, legte er ihm seine Finger in die Ohren und berührte ihm die Zunge mit Speichel. 
[7:34] Dann sah er seufzend auf zum Himmel und sprach zu ihm: "Effatha!" — das heißt: "Tue dich auf!" 
[7:35] Da taten sich seine Ohren auf, das Band seiner Zunge löste sich, und er konnte deutlich reden. 
[7:36] Und Jesus verbot ihnen, es weiter zu sagen. Aber je mehr er es ihnen verbot, desto eifriger machten sie es kund. 
[7:37] Und aufs höchste verwundert sprachen die Leute: "All sein Tun ist herrlich! Den Tauben gibt er das Gehör und den Stummen die Sprache." 
[8:1] In jenen Tagen war wieder eine große Volksmenge versammelt, und die Leute hatten nichts zu essen. Da rief er seine Jünger herbei und sprach zu ihnen: "Mich jammert der Leute, denn sie sind nun schon drei Tage bei mir und haben nichts mehr zu essen. 
[8:2] 
[8:3] Lasse ich sie aber hungrig nach Hause gehen, so brechen sie unterwegs ermattet zusammen; es sind ja auch manche von weither gekommen." 
[8:4] Seine Jünger antworteten ihm: "Woher soll man in dieser menschenleeren Gegend Brot bekommen, um sie zu sättigen?" 
[8:5] Da fragte er sie: "Wieviel Brote habt ihr denn?" Sie sprachen: "Sieben." 
[8:6] Da ließ er die ganze Schar sich auf die Erde lagern. Dann nahm er die sieben Brote, sprach das Dankgebet, brach sie und gab sie seinen Jüngern zur Austeilung; die reichten sie dann den Leuten. 
[8:7] Sie hatten auch noch einige kleine Fische. Über die sprach er den Segen und ließ sie auch austeilen. 
[8:8] So aßen sie und wurden satt. Die übriggebliebenen Brocken hob man vom Boden auf: sieben kleine Körbe voll. 
[8:9] Es waren aber gegen viertausend (die gegessen hatten). Und er ließ sie gehen. 
[8:10] Dann bestieg er sofort mit seinen Jüngern ein Boot und kam in das Gebiet von Dalmanutha. 
[8:11] Dort tauchten die Pharisäer auf. Die knüpften eine Unterredung mit ihm an, und, um ihn auszuhorchen, verlangten sie von ihm, er möge vom Himmel her ein Wunderzeichen kommen lassen. 
[8:12] Da seufzte er aus tiefstem Herzen und sprach: "Warum will dies Geschlecht ein Zeichen schauen? Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Dies Geschlecht soll nimmermehr ein Wunderzeichen zu sehen bekommen." 
[8:13] Damit ließ er sie stehen. Dann stieg er wieder ins Boot und fuhr ans andere Ufer. 
[8:14] Die Jünger hatten nun vergessen, Brote mitzunehmen; nur eins noch hatten sie bei sich im Fahrzeug. 
[8:15] Da warnte er sie: "Habt acht und hütet euch vor dem Sauerteig der Pharisäer und dem Sauerteig des Herodes!" 
[8:16] Da dachten sie und sprachen es auch gegeneinander aus: "Wir haben ja kein Brot!" 
[8:17] Jesus merkte das und sprach zu ihnen: "Was macht ihr euch Gedanken darüber, daß ihr kein Brot mithabt? Fehlt's euch denn immer noch an Einsicht und Verständnis? Bleibt euer Herz so stumpf und unempfänglich? 
[8:18] Ihr habt doch Augen, könnt ihr da nicht sehen? Und ihr habt Ohren, könnt ihr da nicht hören? Habt ihr kein Gedächtnis? 
[8:19] Als ich die fünf Brote für die Fünftausend brach, wieviel große Körbe voll Brocken habt ihr da aufgelesen?" Sie erwiderten: "Zwölf." 
[8:20] "Als ich dann die sieben Brote für die Viertausend brach, wieviel kleine Körbe voll Brocken habt ihr da aufgelesen?" Sie antworteten: "Sieben." 
[8:21] Da fragte er sie: "Seid ihr denn immer noch unverständig?" 
[8:22] Dann kamen sie nach Bethsaida. Dort ward ein Blinder zu ihm gebracht, und man bat ihn, ihn anzurühren. 
[8:23] Da nahm er den Blinden bei der Hand und führte ihn aus dem Dorf hinaus. Dann benetzte er ihm die Augen mit Speichel, legte ihm die Hände auf und fragte ihn: "Siehst du etwas?" 
[8:24] Da blickte er auf und sagte: "Ich kann die Leute erkennen, ich sehe sie gehen — so groß wie Bäume!" 
[8:25] Nun legte er ihm nochmals die Hände auf die Augen. Da konnte er deutlich sehen: er war geheilt und sah auch in der Ferne alle Gegenstände scharf. 
[8:26] Jetzt schickte ihn Jesus nach Hause, doch er wies ihn an: "Geh nicht in das Dorf zurück!" 
[8:27] Von dort zog Jesus mit seinen Jüngern weiter in die Dörfer bei Cäsarea Philippi. Unterwegs fragte er seine Jünger "Wofür halten mich die Leute?" 
[8:28] Sie antworteten ihm: "Für Johannes den Täufer, andere für Elia, noch andere für einen der Propheten." 
[8:29] Da fragte er sie: "Für wen haltet ihr mich denn?" Petrus erwiderte ihm: "Du bist der Messias." 
[8:30] Da verbot er ihnen streng, das irgendwem von ihm zu sagen. 
[8:31] Dann wies er sie zum erstenmal darauf hin: der Menschensohn müsse vieles leiden, dazu verworfen werden von den Ältesten, den Hohenpriestern und den Schriftgelehrten; ja er müsse den Tod erdulden, aber nach drei Tagen wieder auferstehen. 
[8:32] Dies alles sprach er offen aus. Da nahm ihn Petrus beiseite und begann ihn ernstlich zu tadeln. 
[8:33] Aber Jesus wandte sich um, sah seine Jünger an und sprach zu Petrus die strengen Worte: "Mir aus den Augen, Satan! Denn du denkst nicht göttlich, sondern menschlich." 
[8:34] Dann rief er das Volk herbei samt seinen Jüngern und sprach zu ihnen: "Wer mein Nachfolger sein will, der verleugne sich selbst und nehme sein Kreuz auf sich und folge mir! 
[8:35] Denn wer sein Leben retten will, der wird es verlieren; wer aber sein Leben um meinetwillen und im Dienst der Heilsbotschaft verliert, der wird es retten. 
[8:36] Was nützt es einem Menschen, wenn er die ganze Welt gewinnt und dabei sein Seelenheil verliert? 
[8:37] Denn welchen Preis kann jemand zahlen, um sich damit sein Seelenheil zu erkaufen? 
[8:38] Wer sich nun in diesem gottvergessenen, sündigen Geschlecht mein und meiner Worte schämt, des wird sich auch der Menschensohn schämen, wenn er, begleitet von den heiligen Engeln, in seines Vaters Herrlichkeit erscheint." 
[9:1] Dann fuhr er fort: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Einige von denen, die hier stehen, sollen den Tod nicht schmecken, ehe sie Gottes Königreich in Kraft haben erscheinen sehen." 
[9:2] Sechs Tage später nahm Jesus Petrus, Jakobus und Johannes mit sich und führte sie ganz allein auf einen hohen Berg. Dort trat vor ihren Augen in seinem Äußeren eine Wandlung ein; 
[9:3] auch seine Kleider wurden so glänzend und weiß, wie sie kein Bleicher auf Erden machen könnte. 
[9:4] Und es erschien ihnen Elia, begleitet von Mose, und beide hatten ein Gespräch mit Jesus. 
[9:5] Da nahm Petrus das Wort und sprach zu Jesus: "Meister, es trifft sich gut, daß wir hier sind! Laß uns nun drei Hütten bauen: für dich eine, für Mose eine und für Elia eine." 
[9:6] Er wußte nämlich nicht, was er sagen sollte: so überwältigt waren sie. 
[9:7] Da kam eine Wolke, die umhüllte sie, und aus der Wolke rief eine Stimme: "Die ist mein geliebter Sohn; auf den hört!" 
[9:8] Da schauten sie sich um; und plötzlich sahen sie niemand mehr bei sich als Jesus allein. 
[9:9] Als sie dann von dem Berg herabgingen, gebot er ihnen, sie sollten das, was sie gesehen, niemand erzählen, bis der Menschensohn von den Toten auferstanden sei. 
[9:10] Sie behielten es auch für sich; doch sie sprachen darüber, was wohl dies Auferstehen von den Toten bedeute. 
[9:11] Darum fragten sie ihn: "Die Schriftgelehrten behaupten doch, Elia müsse vorher kommen." 
[9:12] Er antwortete ihnen: "Gewiß, Elia soll vorher kommen und alles in Ordnung bringen. Aber wie reimt es sich damit, daß von dem Menschensohn geschrieben steht: er soll viel leiden und für nichts geachtet werden? 
[9:13] Trotzdem versichere ich euch: Elia ist schon gekommen; aber sie haben ihren Mutwillen an ihm geübt. Und das steht ja auch von ihm geschrieben." 
[9:14] Als er zu den anderen Jüngern zurückkam, sah er einen großen Volkshaufen und Schriftgelehrte um sie versammelt, die mit ihnen redeten. 
[9:15] Sobald alle die Leute ihn erblickten, waren sie freudig überrascht: sie eilten ihm entgegen und begrüßten ihn. 
[9:16] Da fragte er sie: "Worüber redet ihr mit ihnen?" 
[9:17] Einer aus der Menge antwortete ihm: "Meister, ich habe meinen Sohn zu dir gebracht, der ist von einem stummen Geist besessen. 
[9:18] Wenn der ihn packt, so zerrt er ihn hin und her; dann tritt ihm Schaum vor den Mund, er knirscht mit den Zähnen und liegt starr da. Ich habe nun deine Jünger gebeten, ihn auszutreiben; aber sie haben es nicht gekonnt." 
[9:19] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Ihr ungläubige Art! Wie lange soll ich noch bei euch sein? Wie lange euch noch ertragen? Bringt ihn her zu mir!" 
[9:20] Da brachten sie ihm den Knaben. Bei Jesu Anblick aber zerrte der (böse) Geist den Knaben in allen seinen Gliedern: er fiel zu Boden und wälzte sich, indem ihm Schaum vor den Mund trat. 
[9:21] Jesus fragte den Vater: "Wie lange hat er das schon?" Der Vater antwortete: "Von Kindheit an; 
[9:22] und oft hat ihn der Geist sogar ins Feuer und ins Wasser geworfen, um ihn zu töten. Doch wenn du kannst, so hilf uns, hab Erbarmen mit uns!" 
[9:23] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Du sagst: 'Wenn du kannst'. Wer glaubt, kann alles." 
[9:24] Sofort rief des Kindes Vater laut: "Ich glaube! Hilf meinem Unglauben!" 
[9:25] Als Jesus sah, daß immer mehr Leute herbeiströmten, da bedrohte er den unreinen Geist mit den Worten: "Du stummer und tauber Geist, ich gebiete dir: fahr aus von ihm und kehr nie wieder in ihn zurück!" 
[9:26] Da fuhr der Geist laut schreiend aus und riß dabei den Knaben in heftigen Krämpfen hin und her. Der Knabe lag wie eine Leiche da, so daß die meisten sagten: "Er ist tot." 
[9:27] Aber Jesus ergriff ihn bei der Hand und richtete ihn auf: da kam er zu sich. — 
[9:28] Nach seiner Heimkehr fragten die Jünger Jesus, als sie allein mit ihm waren: "Warum haben wir den bösen Geist nicht austreiben können?" 
[9:29] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ein böser Geist von dieser Art kann durch nichts anderes ausgetrieben werden als durch Gebet und Fasten." 
[9:30] Sie verließen dann die Gegend und wanderten durch Galiläa hin. 
[9:31] Aber er wollte nicht, daß es jemand erführe. Er lehrte nämlich seine Jünger und sagte ihnen: "Der Menschensohn wird in der Menschenhände überliefert, und sie werden ihn töten; aber drei Tage nach seinem Tod wird er wieder auferstehen." 
[9:32] Sie verstanden freilich nicht, was er mit diesen Worten meinte; doch sie scheuten sich, ihn danach zu fragen. 
[9:33] Dann kam er nach Kapernaum. Zu Hause fragte er sie: "Worüber habt ihr unterwegs gesprochen?" 
[9:34] Sie schwiegen (beschämt); denn sie hatten unterwegs davon geredet, wer von ihnen der Größte sei. 
[9:35] Da setzte er sich, rief die Zwölf und sprach zu ihnen: "Wer der Erste sein will, der muß der Allerletzte werden und aller Diener." 
[9:36] Dann nahm er ein kleines Kind, stellte es mitten unter sie, umarmte es und sprach zu ihnen: 
[9:37] "Wer ein solches Kind aufnimmt, weil es meinen Namen bekennt, der nimmt mich auf. Und wer mich aufnimmt, der nimmt nicht mich auf, sondern den, der mich gesandt hat." 
[9:38] Da sprach Johannes zu ihm: "Meister, wir haben gesehen, wie einer, der uns nicht nachfolgt, in deinem Namen böse Geister austrieb; aber wir haben es ihm verboten." 
[9:39] Jesus antwortete: "Ihr hättet es ihm nicht verbieten sollen. Denn wer in meinem Namen Wunder tut, der kann nicht gleich darauf mich schmähen. 
[9:40] Wer nicht gegen uns ist, der ist für uns. 
[9:41] Ja, wer euch auch nur einen Becher Wasser zu trinken gibt, weil ihr Christi Jünger seid, der soll — das sage ich euch feierlich — seines Lohnes nicht verlustig gehen. 
[9:42] Wer aber eins von den jungen Kindern, die gläubig sind, zur Sünde verführt, für den wäre es besser gewesen, man hätte ihm vorher einen großen Mühlstein um den Hals gehängt und ihn ins Meer geworfen. 
[9:43] Und wenn deine Hand dich zur Sünde reizt, haue sie ab! Es ist besser für dich, du gehst verstümmelt ins Leben ein, als daß du zwei Hände hast und fährst in die Hölle: Ins Feuer, das niemand löschen kann. 
[9:44] 
[9:45] Und wenn dein Fuß dich zur Sünde reizt, haue ihn ab! Es ist besser für dich, du gehst hinkend ins Leben ein, als daß du zwei Füße hast und in die Hölle geworfen wirst. 
[9:46] 
[9:47] Und wenn dich dein Auge zur Sünde reizt, reiße es aus! Es ist besser für dich, du kommst einäugig ins Gottesreich, als daß du zwei Augen hast und in die Hölle geworfen wirst, 
[9:48] wo 'ihr Wurm nicht stirbt, und das Feuer nicht erlischt.' 
[9:49] Jeder wird ja mit Feuer gesalzen. 
[9:50] Gut ist das Salz. Wenn aber das Salz den Geschmack verliert, womit wollt ihr's dann wieder würzen? So habt denn Salz in euch und haltet Frieden untereinander!" 
[10:1] Dann brach Jesus von dort auf und zog durch das Ostjordanland in das Gebiet von Judäa. Da kamen abermals die Leute in Scharen zu ihm, und er lehrte sie wiederum, wie er auch sonst zu tun pflegte. 
[10:2] Da traten Pharisäer zu ihm mit der Frage, ob ein Mann sein Weib entlassen dürfe. Damit wollten sie ihm eine Falle stellen. 
[10:3] Er antwortete ihnen: "Was hat euch Mose geboten?" 
[10:4] Sie sprachen: "Mose hat erlaubt, die Frau mit einem Scheidebrief zu entlassen." 
[10:5] Jesus entgegnete ihnen: "Wegen eurer Herzenshärtigkeit hat er euch dies Gebot geschrieben. 
[10:6] Im Anfang der Welt aber hat Gott die Menschen als Mann und Weib geschaffen. 
[10:7] Deshalb wird ein Mann Vater und Mutter verlassen, 
[10:8] und beide (Mann und Frau) werden eins sein. Sie sind also nicht mehr zwei, sondern eins. 
[10:9] Was nun Gott vereinigt hat, das soll der Mensch nicht trennen!" 
[10:10] Zu Hause fragten ihn seine Jünger nochmals hierüber. 
[10:11] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Wer sein Weib entläßt und eine andere heiratet, der begeht dem ersten Weib gegenüber einen Ehebruch. 
[10:12] Und wenn sich eine Frau von ihrem Mann trennt und einen anderen heiratet, so begeht sie auch einen Ehebruch." 
[10:13] Dann brachte man kleine Kinder zu ihm, damit er sie (segnend) berühre. Die Jünger aber fuhren die Leute, die sie brachten,, mit rauhen Worten an. 
[10:14] Als Jesus das sah, ward er unwillig und sprach zu ihnen: "Laßt die kleinen Kinder zu mir kommen und hindert sie nicht daran! Denn gerade ihnen ist Gottes Königreich bestimmt. 
[10:15] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer Gottes Königreich nicht annimmt wie ein Kind, der kommt sicher nicht hinein." 
[10:16] Dann umarmte er sie, legte ihnen die Hände auf und segnete sie. 
[10:17] Als er seine Wanderung fortsetzen wollte, lief einer zu ihm, fiel vor ihm auf die Knie und fragte ihn: "Guter Meister, was muß ich vollbringen, um ewiges Leben mir zu erringen?" 
[10:18] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Warum nennst du mich gut? Niemand ist gut als Gott allein. 
[10:19] Du kennst ja die Gebote: Du sollst nicht morden, nicht ehebrechen, nicht stehlen, nicht falsches Zeugnis ablegen! Du sollst niemand um das Seine bringen! Ehre Vater und Mutter!" 
[10:20] Er sprach zu ihm: "Meister, dies alles habe ich treu erfüllt von meiner Jugend auf." 
[10:21] Da sah ihn Jesus voll Liebe an und entgegnete ihm: "Eins fehlt dir noch: geh hin, verkaufe deine Habe und gib das Geld den Armen; so wirst du einen Schatz im Himmel haben. Dann komm, nimm dein Kreuz und folge mir nach!" 
[10:22] Er aber ward traurig bei diesem Wort und ging bekümmert weg; denn er hatte ein großes Vermögen. 
[10:23] Da sah sich Jesus im Kreis um und sprach zu seinen Jüngern: "Wie schwer ist doch für die Reichen der Eingang in Gottes Königreich!" 
[10:24] Die Jünger waren über diese Worte betroffen. Doch Jesus wiederholte ihnen: "Kinder, wie schwer ist doch (für Leute die am Geld hängen,) der Eingang in Gottes Königreich! 
[10:25] Ein Kamel kommt leichter durch ein Nadelöhr als ein Reicher in Gottes Königreich." 
[10:26] Da erschraken sie noch mehr und sagten zueinander: "Ja, wer kann dann überhaupt gerettet werden?" 
[10:27] Jesus sah sie an und sprach: "Für Menschen ist das zwar unmöglich, doch nicht für Gott; denn für Gott ist alles möglich." 
[10:28] Da nahm Petrus das Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Siehe, wir haben alles aufgegeben und sind dir nachgefolgt." 
[10:29] Jesus erwiderte: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Jeder, der Haus, Geschwister, Eltern, Kinder oder Äcker fahren läßt aus Liebe zu mir und der Heilsbotschaft, 
[10:30] der soll dafür hundertfältig Ersatz empfangen: jetzt schon in dieser Welt empfängt er Häuser, Geschwister, Mütter, Kinder und Äcker, wenn auch unter Verfolgungen, und in der zukünftigen Welt das ewige Leben. 
[10:31] Doch in vielen Fällen werden die Ersten die Letzten und die Letzten die Ersten sein." 
[10:32] Sie waren auf dem Weg nach Jerusalem. Jesus ging seinen Jüngern kühn voran; sie aber waren voll Staunen. Auch andere, die ihm folgten, zeigten Furcht und Zagen. Da nahm er abermals die Zwölf allein und begann mit ihnen davon zu reden, was ihm widerfahren würde. 
[10:33] "Jetzt", so sprach er, "gehen wir nach Jerusalem. Dort wird der Menschensohn den Hohenpriestern und den Schriftgelehrten überliefert werden. Die werden ihm zum Tod verurteilen und ihn dann den Heiden überantworten. 
[10:34] Die werden ihn verspotten und anspeien, ja sie werden ihn geißeln und töten; aber nach drei Tagen wird er auferstehen." 
[10:35] Da traten Jakobus und Johannes, die Söhne des Zebedäus, zu ihm mit den Worten: "Meister, wir möchten, daß du uns eine Bitte erfüllst." 
[10:36] Er sprach zu ihnen: "Was begehrt ihr von mir?" 
[10:37] Sie antworteten ihm: "Gewähre uns, daß wir einer zu deiner Rechten und einer zu deiner Linken neben dir sitzen in deiner Herrlichkeit." 
[10:38] Jesus erwiderte: "Ihr versteht nicht, um was ihr bittet. Könnt ihr den Kelch trinken, den ich trinken soll, oder die Taufe erleiden, die ich erleiden muß?" 
[10:39] Sie antworteten: "Ja, das können wir." Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Den Kelch, den ich trinke, sollt ihr trinken, und die Taufe, die ich erleide, sollt ihr auch erleiden. 
[10:40] Aber den Sitz zu meiner Rechten oder zu meiner Linken kann ich euch nicht verleihen; der wird nur denen zuteil, für die er bestimmt ist." 
[10:41] Als die anderen Zehn dies hörten, äußerten sie ihren Unwillen über Jakobus und Johannes. 
[10:42] Da rief sie Jesus zu sich und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr wißt, daß solche, die als Herrscher über die Völker gelten, unumschränkt über ihre Untertanen gebieten, und daß die Großen unter den Völkern die Untergebenen ihre Macht fühlen lassen. 
[10:43] So soll's bei euch nicht sein. Im Gegenteil: wer unter euch groß sein will, der sei euer Diener; 
[10:44] und wer unter euch der Erste sein will, der sei aller Knecht! 
[10:45] Denn auch der Menschensohn ist nicht gekommen, um sich dienen zu lassen, sondern um selbst zu dienen und sein Leben dahinzugeben als Lösegeld für viele." 
[10:46] Dann kamen sie nach Jericho. Als er mit seinen Jüngern und einer großen Volksmenge Jericho verließ, da saß ein bekannter blinder Bettler, Bartimäus, des Timäus Sohn, am Weg. 
[10:47] Als er hörte, Jesus von Nazaret sei da, begann er laut zu rufen: "Sohn Davids, Jesus, erbarme dich mein!" 
[10:48] Da fuhren ihn viele mit rauhen Worten an, er solle schweigen. Aber er rief nur noch lauter: "Sohn Davids, erbarme dich mein!" 
[10:49] Da blieb Jesus stehen und sprach: "Ruft ihn her!" Nun riefen sie den Blinden und sprachen zu ihm: "Sei getrost, steh auf, er ruft dich." 
[10:50] Da warf er seinen Mantel ab, sprang auf und kam zu Jesus. 
[10:51] Jesus fragte ihn: "Was begehrst du von mir?" Der Blinde antwortete ihm: "Lieber Meister, gib mir das Augenlicht wieder!" 
[10:52] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Geh hin, dein Glaube hat dich gesund gemacht!" Sofort ward er wieder sehend und folgte Jesus auf seiner Wanderung. 
[11:1] Als sie in die Nähe von Jerusalem kamen, nach Bethphage und Bethanien, an den Ölberg, da entsandte er zwei seiner Jünger 
[11:2] mit dem Auftrag: "Geht hin in das Dorf, das vor euch liegt! Gleich am Eingang werdet ihr ein Eselsfüllen angebunden finden, auf dem noch nie ein Mensch gesessen hat. Das bindet los und bringt es her! 
[11:3] Und fragt euch jemand: 'Was macht ihr da?', so sprecht: 'Der Herr bedarf sein, und er schickt es gleich wieder her.'" 
[11:4] Da gingen sie hin, und auf der Dorfstraße fanden sie draußen an der Haustür ein Füllen angebunden; das banden sie los. 
[11:5] Doch einige von den Leuten, die da standen, fragten sie: "Was macht ihr da? Ihr bindet das Füllen los?" 
[11:6] Sie antworteten ihnen, wie Jesus geboten hatte. Da ließ man sie gewähren. 
[11:7] Sie brachten nun das Füllen zu Jesus, legten ihre Mäntel auf des Tieres Rücken, und er setzte sich darauf. 
[11:8] Viele Leute aber breiteten ihre Mäntel auf den Weg, andere hieben auf den Feldern grüne Zweige ab und streuten sie aus. 
[11:9] Und alle, die mitgingen — vorn im Zug und hinterdrein —, die riefen laut: "Heil! Gesegnet sei, der da kommt in dem Namen des Herrn! 
[11:10] Gesegnet sei das Königreich, das nun beginnt, das Königreich unseres Vaters David! Heil droben in der Höhe!" 
[11:11] So zog er in Jerusalem ein. Und er ging in den Tempel. Dort schaute er sich alles an. Erst in später Stunde ging er mit den Zwölfen hinaus nach Bethanien. 
[11:12] Als sie am anderen Morgen Bethanien verließen, empfand er Hunger. 
[11:13] Da sah er von weitem einen Feigenbaum, der Blätter hatte. Auf den ging er zu, um zu sehen, ob er Früchte darauf fände. Doch als er hinkam, fand er nichts als Blätter; denn die Jahreszeit für die (reifen Sommer-) Feigen war noch nicht da. 
[11:14] Da sprach er zu dem Baum: "In Zukunft soll man nie wieder Frucht von dir essen!" Und seine Jünger hörten diese Worte. 
[11:15] Dann kamen sie nach Jerusalem. Er ging in den Tempel und begann all, die dort verkauften und kauften, hinauszutreiben; die Tische der Wechsler und die Bänke der Taubenhändler stieß er um 
[11:16] und wollte nicht dulden, daß man ein Hausgerät über den Tempelplatz trüge. 
[11:17] Er wies sie darauf hin: "Steht nicht geschrieben: Mein Haus soll ein Bethaus heißen für alle Völker? Ihr aber habt eine Räuberhöhle daraus gemacht." 
[11:18] Das hörten die Schriftgelehrten und die Hohenpriester, und sie überlegten, wie sie ihn aus dem Weg räumen könnten. Denn sie hatten Furcht vor ihm, weil seine Lehre auf das ganze Volk einen tiefen Eindruck machte. 
[11:19] Wenn der Abend kam, pflegte er die Stadt zu verlassen. 
[11:20] Als sie früh am anderen Morgen an dem Feigenbaum vorüberkamen, sahen sie, wie er bis zur Wurzel verdorrt war. 
[11:21] Da erinnerte sich Petrus an Jesu Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Meister, sieh, der Feigenbaum, den du verflucht hast, ist verdorrt." 
[11:22] Darauf erwiderte ihnen Jesus: "Habt Glauben, von Gott gewirkt! 
[11:23] Denn wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer zum dem Berg dort sagte: 'Heb dich von deiner Stelle und stürze dich ins Meer!' und er zweifelte dabei nicht in seinem Herzen, sondern glaubte wirklich, daß es so geschähe nach seinem Wort, dem würde auch sein Wunsch erfüllt. 
[11:24] Darum sage ich euch: Alles, was ihr erfleht im Gebet, das soll euch auch werden, wenn ihr nur glaubt, ihr hättet es schon. 
[11:25] Und schickt ihr euch an zum Gebet, so vergebet allen, gegen die ihr etwas habt, damit euer Vater im Himmel auch euch eure Fehler vergebe." 
[11:26]  
[11:27] Sie kamen dann wieder nach Jerusalem. Als er dort im Tempel umherging, traten die Hohenpriester, die Schriftgelehrten und die Ältesten zu ihm 
[11:28] mit der Frage: "Mit welchem Recht tust du dies, oder wer hat dir das Recht zu solchem Tun gegeben?" 
[11:29] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Ich will euch auch eine Frage vorlegen. Darauf gebt mir Antwort! Dann will ich euch sagen, mit welchem Recht ich dies tue. 
[11:30] Stammte die Taufe des Johannes vom Himmel oder von Menschen? Antwortet mir!" 
[11:31] Da überlegten sie miteinander: "Sagen wir: 'vom Himmel', so wird er fragen: 'Warum habt ihr ihm denn nicht geglaubt?' 
[11:32] Oder sollen wir antworten: 'von Menschen'?" Das wagten sie nicht aus Furcht vor dem Volk; denn alle glaubten, Johannes sei wirklich ein Prophet gewesen. 
[11:33] Da erwiderten sie Jesus: "Wir wissen's nicht." Darauf sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "So sage ich euch auch nicht, mit welchem Recht ich dies tue." 
[12:1] Dann begann er, zu ihnen in Gleichnissen zu reden: "Es pflanzte jemand einen Weinberg; er zog einen Zaun darum, grub eine Kelterkufe darin aus und baute einen Turm. Dann verpachtete er ihn an Winzer und ging außer Landes. 
[12:2] Zur Zeit der Weinlese sandte er einen seiner Knechte zu den Winzern, damit er von ihnen einen Teil der Weinbergsfrüchte abhole. 
[12:3] Die Winzer aber ergriffen diesen Knecht, schlugen ihn und schickten ihn mit leeren Händen heim. 
[12:4] Da sandte er noch einen anderen Knecht zu ihnen; dem schlugen sie den Kopf blutig und beschimpften ihn. 
[12:5] Wider sandte er einen anderen; den töteten sie. Dann sandte er noch viele andere aus; doch die einen schlugen sie, die anderen töteten sie. 
[12:6] Am Ende hatte er nur noch Einen, den er senden konnte: seinen geliebten Sohn. Den sandte er zuletzt zu ihnen, denn er dachte: vor meinem Sohn werden sie doch Ehrfurcht haben. 
[12:7] Die Winzer aber sprachen zueinander: 'Ha, da kommt der Erbe! Auf! Laßt uns ihn töten, dann wird das Erbe unser sein!' 
[12:8] Und sie ergriffen ihn, töteten ihn und warfen seinen Leichnam aus dem Weinberg hinaus. 
[12:9] Was wird nun der Weinbergbesitzer tun? Er wird kommen und die Winzer töten und seinen Weinberg anderen geben. 
[12:10] Habt ihr nicht auch dies Schriftwort gelesen: Der Stein, den die Bauleute verworfen haben, der ist zum Eckstein geworden. 
[12:11] Dies ist eine Tat des Herrn, und sie ist wunderbar in unseren Augen?" 
[12:12] Da sannen sie darauf, ihn festzunehmen; denn sie hatten wohl gemerkt, daß er sie mit diesem Gleichnis treffen wollte. Aber sie fürchteten sich vor dem Volk. Darum verließen sie ihn und entfernten sich. 
[12:13] Darauf sandten sie einige von den Pharisäern und den Anhängern des Herodes zu ihm, die ihn in seinen eigenen Worten fangen sollten. 
[12:14] Die kamen zu ihm und sprachen voll Tücke: "Meister, wir wissen, du bist aufrichtig und nimmst auf niemand Rücksicht; denn Menschengunst gilt nicht bei dir, du lehrst vielmehr in aller Wahrheit Gottes Weg. Darf man dem Kaiser Steuer zahlen oder nicht?" 
[12:15] Er aber durchschaute ihre Falschheit und sprach zu ihnen: "Was versucht ihr mich? Reicht mir einen Silberling! Laßt sehen!" 
[12:16] Sie reichten ihm einen. Dann fragte er sie: "Wessen Bild und Inschrift steht hier?" Sie erwiderten ihm: "Des Kaisers." 
[12:17] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "So gebt dem Kaiser, was dem Kaiser gebührt, und Gott, was Gott gebührt!" Und sie verwunderten sich über ihn. 
[12:18] Dann kamen Sadduzäer zu ihm, die da behaupteten, es gebe keine Auferstehung, und legten ihm eine Frage vor. 
[12:19] "Meister", so sprachen sie, "Mose hat uns vorgeschrieben: Stirbt einem der Bruder und hinterläßt der ein Weib, aber keine Kinder, so soll sein Bruder die verwitwete Schwägerin zum Weib nehmen und (mit ihr) seinem (verstorbenen) Bruder Nachkommen erwecken. 
[12:20] Nun waren da sieben Brüder. Der erste nahm ein Weib und starb kinderlos. 
[12:21] Da nahm der zweite Bruder die Witwe; doch auch er starb kinderlos. Ebenso der dritte 
[12:22] und alle sieben: Nachkommen hatte keiner. Zuletzt von allen starb auch die Frau. 
[12:23] Bei der Auferstehung nun, wenn sie alle auferstehen, — wem von ihnen wird sie da als Gattin angehören? Denn alle sieben haben sie ja zur Frau gehabt." 
[12:24] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Seid ihr nicht deshalb im Irrtum, weil ihr die Schrift nicht kennt noch Gottes Macht? 
[12:25] Denn wenn die Menschen von den Toten auferstehen, so freien sie nicht noch lassen sie sich freien, sondern sie sind wie die Engel im Himmel. 
[12:26] Was aber die Auferstehung der Toten betrifft, habt ihr da nicht gelesen, wie Gott im Buch Mose, in der Geschichte vom Dornbusch, zu Mose gesprochen hat: Ich bin der Gott Abrahams, der Gott Isaaks und der Gott Jakobs? 
[12:27] Gott ist nun aber nicht ein Gott der Toten, sondern der Lebendigen. Ihr seid sehr im Irrtum!" 
[12:28] Ein Schriftgelehrter hatte diesen Reden zugehört und bemerkt, wie treffend ihnen Jesus antwortete. Nun trat er näher und fragte ihn: "Welches ist das wichtigste Gebot?" 
[12:29] Jesus antwortete: "Das wichtigste Gebot ist: Höre, Israel, der Herr unser Gott ist Herr allein; 
[12:30] und du sollst den Herrn, deinen Gott, lieben mit ganzem Herzen, mit aller Kraft. 
[12:31] Das andere Gebot ist dies: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst. Es gibt kein anderes Gebot, das höher stünde als diese." 
[12:32] Da sprach der Schriftgelehrte zu ihm: "Recht so, Meister! Es ist wahr, was du gesagt: Es gibt nur Einen Gott, und es ist kein anderer neben ihm. 
[12:33] Und ihn lieben mit ganzem Herzen, mit aller Einsicht und mit aller Kraft und seinen Nächsten wie sich selbst, das ist viel mehr wert als alle Brandopfer und anderen Opfer." 
[12:34] Als Jesus merkte, wie verständig er antwortete, sprach er zu ihm: "Du bist nicht fern von Gottes Königreich." Und niemand wagte, ihn weiter zu fragen. 
[12:35] Als Jesus dann im Tempel lehrte, stellte er die Frage: "Wie können die Schriftgelehrten behaupten, der Messias sei Davids Sohn? 
[12:36] David selbst hat doch, vom Heiligen Geist erleuchtet, den Ausspruch getan: Der Herr hat gesagt zu meinem Herrn: Sitze du zu meiner Rechten, bis ich dir deine Feinde zu Füßen lege. 
[12:37] Also David selbst nennt ihn seinen Herrn; wie kann er da zugleich sein Sohn sein?" Und die große Menge hörte ihm gern zu. 
[12:38] Im Lauf seiner Reden sprach Jesus weiter: "Hütet euch vor den Schriftgelehrten! Sie gehen mit Vorliebe in langen Gewändern einher, auf den Straßen soll man sie voll Ehrfurcht grüßen, 
[12:39] in der gottesdienstlichen Versammlung wollen sie die Ehrenplätze haben und beim Mahl sitzen sie gern obenan. 
[12:40] Sie verschlingen der Witwen Eigentum und halten zum Schein lange Gebete. Sie wird die schlimmste Strafe treffen!" 
[12:41] Dann setzte er sich dem Opferstock gegenüber und sah zu, wie die Leute Geld einwarfen in den Opferstock. Manche Reiche gaben viel. 
[12:42] Da kam auch eine arme Witwe, die legte zwei Münzen im Wert eines Pfennigs ein. 
[12:43] Da rief er seine Jünger herbei und sprach zu ihnen: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Diese arme Witwe hat mehr als alle anderen in den Opferstock gelegt. 
[12:44] Denn jene haben alle eingelegt aus ihrem Überfluß; sie aber hat trotz ihrer Dürftigkeit alles, was sie hatte, ihre ganze Habe eingelegt." 
[13:1] Als er den Tempel verließ, sprach einer seiner Jünger zu ihm: "Meister, sieh doch, was für Steine, was für Bauten!" 
[13:2] Jesus antwortete: "Du siehst diese mächtigen Bauten (bewundernd an)? Kein Stein davon soll auf dem anderen bleiben; alles soll in Trümmer gehen!" 
[13:3] Er ging dann auf den Ölberg und setzte sich dort dem Tempel gegenüber. Da fragten ihn, als sie allein waren, Petrus, Jakobus, Johannes und Andreas: 
[13:4] "Sage uns doch, wann wird dies geschehen? Und was wird das Zeichen sein, wenn sich dies alles erfüllen soll?" 
[13:5] Jesus fing an zu erwidern: "Habt acht, daß euch niemand verführe! 
[13:6] Mancher wird kommen unter meinem Namen und sagen: 'Ich bin der Messias!' Und sie werden viele irreführen. 
[13:7] Hört ihr dann von Kriegen und Kriegsgerüchten, laßt euch nicht schrecken! Das muß so kommen. Doch ist es noch nicht das Ende. 
[13:8] Denn erheben wird sich Volk wider Volk und Königreich wider Königreich. Hier und da werden Erdbeben sein, es werden Hungersnöte kommen. Das ist aber erst der Anfang der Wehen. 
[13:9] Seid ihr nur auf eurer Hut! Überliefern wird man euch den Gerichten; in den Versammlungshäusern wird man euch geißeln; vor Statthalter und Könige wird man euch stellen um meinetwillen, ihnen ein Zeugnis zu bringen. 
[13:10] Denn unter allen Völkern muß zuvor die Frohe Botschaft verkündigt werden. 
[13:11] Wenn man euch nun wegführt und vor Gericht stellt, macht euch im voraus nicht Sorge, was ihr reden sollt. Sondern was euch eingegeben wird zu jener Stunde, das redet! Ihr seid es ja nicht, die dann reden, sondern der Heilige Geist. 
[13:12] Ein Bruder wird aber den anderen zum Tode bringen und der Vater sein Kind. Ja Kinder werden sich gegen die Eltern erheben und werden sie töten lassen. 
[13:13] Und alle Welt wird euch hassen, weil ihr meinen Namen bekennt. Wer aber ausharrt bis ans Ende, der soll gerettet werden. 
[13:14] Seht ihr nun den Greuel der Verwüstung da, wo er nicht soll stehen — wer das liest, beachte es wohl! —, dann sollen, die in Judäa sind, in die Berge fliehen! 
[13:15] Wer auf dem Dach ist, der steige nicht erst hinunter ins Haus und gehe nicht hinein, um etwas aus seinem Haus zu holen! 
[13:16] Und wer auf dem Feld ist, der kehre nicht in die Wohnung zurück, um seinen Mantel zu holen! 
[13:17] Doch weh den Frauen, die Kinder erwarten, und stillenden Mütter in jenen Tagen! 
[13:18] Betet aber, daß dies nicht geschehe zur Winterzeit! 
[13:19] Denn jene Tage werden eine Trübsal bringen, wie sie noch nie gewesen seit Anfang der Welt, die Gott geschaffen, bis heute, und wie auch keine mehr sein wird. 
[13:20] Ja kürzte der Herr die Tage nicht ab, so würde kein Mensch errettet. Doch wegen der Auserwählten, die er sich erlesen, hat er die Tage abgekürzt. 
[13:21] Wenn euch dann einer sagt: 'Der Messias ist hier oder dort!', so glaubt es nicht! 
[13:22] Denn manch falscher Messias, manch falscher Prophet tritt auf, und sie werden Zeichen und Wunder tun, um womöglich auch die Auserwählten irrezuführen. 
[13:23] Seid ihr auf eurer Hut! Ich warne euch vor allem. 
[13:24] Doch in jenen Tagen, nach jener Trübsal, wird sich die Sonne verfinstern und der Mond kein Licht mehr geben. 
[13:25] Die Sterne werden vom Himmel fallen, und wanken werden die Himmelskräfte. 
[13:26] Dann wird man sehen den Menschensohn in Wolken kommen mit großer Macht und Herrlichkeit. 
[13:27] Dann wird er seine Boten senden und sammeln seine Auserwählten aus allen vier Winden vom Ende der Erde bis zum Ende des Himmels. 
[13:28] Vom Feigenbaum entnehmt eine Lehre: wenn seine Zweige saftig werden und Blätter treiben, so wißt ihr, daß der Sommer nahe ist. 
[13:29] So sollt auch ihr, wenn ihr dies kommen seht, gewiß sein, daß Er nahe vor der Tür ist. 
[13:30] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Diese Weltzeit ist nicht eher zu Ende, als bis dies alles geschehen ist. 
[13:31] Himmel und Erde werden vergehen, meine Worte aber werden nicht vergehen. 
[13:32] Über den Tag und die Stunde aber hat niemand Kunde auch nicht die Engel im Himmel, selbst nicht der Sohn, allein nur der Vater. 
[13:33] Seid auf der Hut, wacht und betet! Ihr wißt ja nicht, wann der Zeitpunkt da ist. 
[13:34] Wenn einer verreist und sein Haus verläßt, gibt er seinen Knechten besonderen Befehl: Einem jeglichen teilt er zu sein Werk, dem Türhüter aber befiehlt er zu wachen. 
[13:35] So wacht nun! Ihr wißt ja nicht, wann der Hausherr kommt: Ob am Abend oder um Mitternacht, beim Hahnenschrei oder im Morgengrauen. 
[13:36] Er könnte ja unvermutet kommen und fände euch schlafend! 
[13:37] Was ich euch sage, das sage ich allen: Wacht!" 
[14:1] Es waren nun noch zwei Tage bis zu dem Fest des Passah und der ungesäuerten Brote. Da überlegten die Hohenpriester und die Schriftgelehrten, wie sie Jesus mit List in ihre Gewalt bekommen und töten könnten. 
[14:2] Doch sie sagten: "Nur nicht am Fest! Es könnte sonst zu einer Volkserhebung kommen." 
[14:3] Als nun Jesus in Bethanien im Haus Simons des Aussätzigen weilte und dort zu Tisch war, kam eine Frau mit einem Glas kostbaren Salböls aus echter Narde: sie zerbrach das Glas und goß das Öl auf sein Haupt. 
[14:4] Es waren aber einige da, die unwillig zueinander sagten: "Wozu ist das Öl so verschwendet worden? 
[14:5] Man hätte es leicht für mehr als dreihundert Silberlinge verkaufen und das Geld den Armen geben können." Und sie schalten die Frau mit harten Worten. 
[14:6] Jesus aber sprach: "Laßt sie in Ruhe! Warum kränkt ihr sie? Sie hat ein rühmlich Werk an mir getan. 
[14:7] Denn Arme habt ihr immer bei euch, und sooft ihr wollt, könnt ihr ihnen Gutes tun; mich aber habt ihr habt ihr nicht immer. 
[14:8] Sie hat getan, was sie konnte: sie hat meinen Leib im voraus zu Begräbnis gesalbt. 
[14:9] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wo in der weiten Welt die Heilsbotschaft verkündigt wird, da wird man auch zu ihrem Gedächtnis von ihrer Tat erzählen." 
[14:10] Und Judas aus Kariot, einer von den Zwölfen, ging zu den Hohenpriestern, um ihnen Jesus in die Hände zu liefern. 
[14:11] Sie aber waren über seinen Vorschlag erfreut und versprachen, ihm Geld zu geben. Da suchte er nach einer günstigen Gelegenheit, ihn zu verraten. 
[14:12] Am ersten Tag der ungesäuerten Brote, da man das Passahlamm zu opfern pflegte, sprachen die Jünger zu Jesus: "Wo sollen wir hingehen und das Passahmahl für dich bereiten?" 
[14:13] Da sandte er zwei seiner Jünger ab und gebot ihnen: "Geht in die Stadt; da wird euch ein Mann begegnen, der einen irdenen Krug mit Wasser trägt. 
[14:14] Dem folgt, und dort, wo er hineingeht, da sagt zu dem Hausherrn: 'Der Meister läßt dich fragen: Wo ist das von mir bestellte Zimmer, wo ich das Passahmahl mit meinen Jüngern halten kann?' 
[14:15] Dann wird er euch ein geräumiges Oberzimmer zeigen, mit Tischpolstern belegt und für die Mahlzeit hergerichtet. Dort rüstet alles für uns zu!" 
[14:16] Da machten sich die Jünger auf den Weg und kamen in die Stadt. Sie fanden es so, wie er ihnen gesagt hatte, und richteten die Passahmahlzeit her. 
[14:17] Als der Abend kam, fand er sich mit den Zwölfen ein. 
[14:18] Während sie bei Tische waren und aßen, sprach Jesus: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Einer unter euch, der mit mir ißt, wird mich verraten." 
[14:19] Da wurden sie betrübt, und einer nach dem anderen fragte ihn: "Ich bin's doch nicht?" 
[14:20] Er antwortete ihnen: "Einer von euch Zwölfen ist's, einer der mit mir in die Schüssel tunkt. 
[14:21] Denn der Menschensohn geht zwar zum Tod, das steht ja von ihm geschrieben. Doch weh dem Menschen, durch den der Menschensohn verraten wird! Für diesen Menschen wäre es am besten, er wäre nie geboren." 
[14:22] Während des Essens nahm Jesus ein Brot, sprach den Segen, brach's und gab es ihnen mit den Worten: "Nehmt hin, das ist mein Leib!" 
[14:23] Dann nahm er einen Becher, sprach das Dankgebet und reichte ihn den Jüngern; und sie tranken alle daraus. 
[14:24] Dabei sprach er zu ihnen: "Dies ist mein Blut, das Bundesblut, das vergossen werden soll zum Heil für viele. 
[14:25] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ich will von dem Gewächs des Weinstocks nicht mehr trinken bis zu dem Tage, wo ich den neuen Wein trinken werde in Gottes Königreich." 
[14:26] Nach dem Lobgesang gingen sie hinaus an den Ölberg. 
[14:27] Auf dem Weg dorthin sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Ihr werdet alle an mir irrewerden; denn es steht geschrieben: Ich will den Hirten schlagen, und die Schafe werden sich zerstreuen. 
[14:28] Nach meiner Auferstehung aber will ich euch vorausgehen nach Galiläa." 
[14:29] Da sprach Petrus zu ihm: "Wenn auch alle anderen an dir irrewerden — ich nicht!" 
[14:30] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Wahrlich, ich sage dir: Heute, in dieser Nacht, ehe der Hahn zweimal kräht, wirst du mich dreimal verleugnen." 
[14:31] Er aber beteuerte nur um so eifriger: "Und müßte ich auch mit dir sterben, ich verleugne dich nun und nimmer!" Ebenso sprachen auch die anderen alle. 
[14:32] Und sie kamen zu einem Landgut, mit Namen Gethsemane, da sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Setzt euch hier nieder, während ich bete!" 
[14:33] Und er nahm Petrus, Jakobus und Johannes mit sich. Da erfaßte ihn Schrecken und Grauen. 
[14:34] Und er sprach zu ihnen: "Meine Seele ist zum Tode betrübt, bleibt hier und wacht!" 
[14:35] Dann ging er ein wenig weiter, fiel nieder zur Erde und betete, daß, wenn es möglich sein, an ihm die Stunde vorübergehe. 
[14:36] Er sprach: "Abba, Vater! Dir ist ja alles möglich, laß diesen Kelch an mir vorübergehen! Doch nicht wie ich will, sondern wie du willst!" 
[14:37] Dann kam er zurück und fand sie schlafend und sagte zu Petrus: "Simon, du schläfst? Nicht eine Stunde konntest du wachen? 
[14:38] Wacht und betet, damit ihr nicht in Versuchung fallt! Der Geist zwar ist willig, aber das Fleisch ist schwach." 
[14:39] Dann ging er abermals hin und betete mit denselben Worten. 
[14:40] Als er zurückkam, fand er sie wiederum schlafend; denn die Augen fielen ihnen zu vor Müdigkeit, und sie wußten ihm nichts zu erwidern. 
[14:41] Da kam er zum drittenmal und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr schlaft noch weiter und ruht? Nun genug! Die Stunde ist da! Jetzt wird der Menschensohn in der Sünder Hände überliefert. 
[14:42] Auf, wir gehen! Seht, mein Verräter naht!" 
[14:43] In dem Augenblick, da er noch redete, erschien Judas, einer der Zwölf, begleitet von einer Schar, die, mit Schwertern und Knütteln bewaffnet, von den Hohenpriestern, Schriftgelehrten und Ältesten ausgesandt war. 
[14:44] Sein Verräter aber hatte ein Zeichen mit ihnen verabredet und gesagt: "Wen ich küsse, der ist's; den nehmt fest und führt ihn sicher ab!" 
[14:45] Als er nun kam, trat er sogleich auf ihn zu, grüßte ihn: "Meister! Meister!" und küßte ihn. 
[14:46] Da legten sie Hand an ihn und nahmen ihn gefangen. 
[14:47] Doch einer von denen, die dastanden, zog ein Schwert, schlug damit nach dem Knecht des Hohenpriesters und hieb ihm das Ohr ab. 
[14:48] Da wandte sich Jesus zu den Leuten und sprach: "Wie gegen einen Räuber seid ihr mit Schwertern und Knütteln ausgezogen, um mich gefangenzunehmen. 
[14:49] Tagtäglich bin ich bei euch im Tempel gewesen und habe gelehrt, und ihr habt mich nicht ergriffen. Dies alles aber geschieht, damit sich die Schriften erfüllen." 
[14:50] Da verließen ihn alle und flohen. 
[14:51] Ein Jüngling nur folgte ihm, der trug auf bloßem Leib ein Hemd aus feiner Leinwand. Den griffen sie. 
[14:52] Da ließ er sein Gewand im Stich und enteilte ganz unbekleidet. 
[14:53] Man führte dann Jesus vor den Hohenpriester. Dort versammelten sich alle Hohenpriester, Ältesten und Schriftgelehrten. 
[14:54] Petrus aber folgte ihm von weitem bis hinein in des Hohenpriesters Palast. Dort setzte er sich im Hof zu den Dienern und wärmte sich am Feuer. 
[14:55] Die Hohenpriester aber und der ganze Hohe Rat suchten nach einem Zeugnis gegen Jesus, damit sie ihn zum Tod verurteilen könnten; aber sie fanden keines. 
[14:56] Denn es brachten wohl viele falsches Zeugnis gegen ihn vor, doch ihre Aussagen stimmten nicht überein. 
[14:57] Da traten einige auf, die erhoben die falsche Anklage gegen ihn: 
[14:58] "Wir haben ihn behaupten hören: Ich will diesen von Menschenhänden errichteten Tempel niederreißen und dafür in drei Tagen einen anderen bauen, der nicht Händen gemacht ist." 
[14:59] Doch nicht einmal in diesem Wortlaut stimmte ihr Zeugnis überein. 
[14:60] Da erhob sich der Hohepriester, trat mitten in die Versammlung und fragte Jesus: "Antwortest du nichts auf das, was diese wider dich vorbringen?" 
[14:61] Er aber schwieg und gab ihm keine Antwort. Da fragte ihn der Hohepriester zum zweitenmal: "Bist du der Messias, der Sohn des Hochgelobten?" 
[14:62] Jesus erwiderte: "Ich bin's! Und ihr sollt den Menschensohn sitzen sehen zur Rechten der Macht und kommen mit den Wolken des Himmels." 
[14:63] Da zerriß der Hohepriester seine Kleider und sprach: "Was brauchen wir noch weiter Zeugen? 
[14:64] Ihr habt die Gotteslästerung gehört. Was meint ihr nun?" Da gaben alle das Urteil ab, er sei des Todes schuldig. 
[14:65] Nun begannen einige, ihn anzuspeien, ihm das Gesicht zu verhüllen und ihn dann mit Fäusten zu schlagen, indem sie höhnisch riefen: "Zeige dich als Prophet!" Auch die Diener schlugen ihn ins Angesicht, als er ihnen übergeben wurde. 
[14:66] Unterdessen saß Petrus unten im Hof. Da kam eine von den Mägden des Hohenpriesters. 
[14:67] Als die sah, wie sich Petrus wärmte, schaute sie ihn an und sprach: "Du warst auch bei dem Jesus von Nazaret!" 
[14:68] Er leugnete aber und sagte: "Ich weiß nicht — ich verstehe nicht — was meinst du denn?" Dann ging er aus dem inneren Hof in den Vorhof. Da krähte ein Hahn. 
[14:69] Nun sah ihn dort dieselbe Magd, und wieder fing sie an, zu denen, die dabeistanden, zu sagen: "Das ist auch einer von ihnen!" 
[14:70] Da leugnete er von neuem: Nach einer kleinen Weile sprachen die Umstehenden wiederum zu Petrus: "Wahrhaftig, du gehörst zu ihnen! Du bist ja auch ein Galiläer; schon deine Mundart ist ganz so." 
[14:71] Nun fing er an, sich zu verwünschen und zu schwören: "Ich kenne den Menschen nicht, von dem ihr redet!" 
[14:72] Da krähte ein Hahn zum zweitenmal. Jetzt entsann sich Petrus des Wortes, das Jesus zu ihm gesagt hatte: "Ehe der Hahn zweimal kräht, wirst du mich dreimal verleugnen." Als er daran dachte, brach er ihn lautes Weinen aus. 
[15:1] Sofort nach Tagesanbruch kamen alle Glieder des Hohen Rates — die Hohenpriester mit den Ältesten und Schriftgelehrten — zu einem fertigen Beschluß. Dann ließen sie Jesus gefesselt wegführen und überlieferten ihn Pilatus. 
[15:2] Pilatus fragte ihn: "Bist du der Juden König?" Er antwortete ihm: "Ja, ich bin's." 
[15:3] Die Hohenpriester erhoben dann viele Klagen gegen ihn. 
[15:4] Da fragte ihn Pilatus abermals: "Hast du nichts darauf zu sagen? Höre doch, was sie alles gegen dich vorbringen." 
[15:5] Aber Jesus gab ihm keine Antwortmehr, so daß sich Pilatus wunderte. 
[15:6] Nun pflegte er ihnen an jedem Passahfest einen Gefangenen loszugeben nach ihrer freien Wahl. 
[15:7] Damals lag ein gewisser Barabbas im Kerker zusammen mit anderen Empörern, die beim Aufruhr einen Mord begangen hatten. 
[15:8] Als nun das Volk (zum Palast des Pilatus) hinaufkam und zu verlangen begann, was er ihnen sonst gewährte, 
[15:9] da fragte sie Pilatus: "Soll ich euch den König der Juden losgeben?" 
[15:10] Er hatte nämlich wohl gemerkt, daß ihn die Hohenpriester nur aus Neid überantwortet hatten. 
[15:11] Die Hohenpriester aber wiegelten das Volk auf, es möge lieber um die Freilassung des Barabbas bitten. 
[15:12] Da nahm Pilatus abermals das Wort und sprach zu ihnen: "Was soll ich denn mit dem Mann tun, den ihr den Judenkönig nennt?" 
[15:13] Sie schrien wieder: "Kreuzige ihn!" 
[15:14] Da fragte sie Pilatus: "Was hat er denn verbrochen?" Sie schrien nur noch lauter: "Kreuzige ihn!" 
[15:15] Weil nun Pilatus die Menge zufriedenstellen wollte, so gab er ihnen Barabbas frei. Jesus aber ließ er geißeln; dann übergab er ihn (den Soldaten) zur Kreuzigung. 
[15:16] Nun führten ihn die Soldaten in den inneren Hof des Statthalterpalastes und riefen die ganze Schar (ihrer Genossen) zusammen. 
[15:17] Sie zogen ihm einen Purpurmantel an, setzten ihm eine Dornenkrone auf, die sie geflochten hatten, 
[15:18] und begannen ihn zu grüßen: "Heil dir, König der Juden!" 
[15:19] Dabei schlugen sie ihn mit einem Rohr aufs Haupt, spien ihn an, beugten ihre Knie und huldigten ihm. 
[15:20] Als sie so ihren Spott mit ihm getrieben hatten, zogen sie ihm den Purpurmantel aus und legten ihm wieder seine eigenen Kleider an. Dann führten sie ihn ab zur Kreuzigung. 
[15:21] Da kam ein gewisser Simon des Weges, ein Mann aus Kyrene, des Alexander und Rufus Vater, der kam von einem Dorf zurück; den zwangen sie, Jesus das Kreuz zu tragen. 
[15:22] So brachten sie ihn nach dem Platz Golgatha, das heißt Schädelstätte. 
[15:23] Dort reichten sie ihm betäubenden Würzwein; aber er nahm ihn nicht. 
[15:24] Dann kreuzigten sie ihn. Darauf verteilten sie seine Kleider unter sich, indem sie das Los darüber warfen, was jeder von ihnen bekommen solle. 
[15:25] Es war die dritte Stunde, als sie ihn kreuzigten. 
[15:26] Oben an dem Kreuz stand eine Inschrift mit der Angabe seiner Schuld; die lautete: Der Juden König. 
[15:27] Mit ihm kreuzigten sie zwei Räuber, den einen zu seiner Rechten, den anderen zu seiner Linken. 
[15:28] So wurde das Schriftwort erfüllt: "Er ist unter die Verbrecher gerechnet worden." 
[15:29] Die Vorübergehenden aber schmähten ihn: sie schüttelten den Kopf und sprachen: "He! du wolltest ja den Tempel niederreißen und ihn in drei Tagen wiederbauen: 
[15:30] hilf dir nun selbst und steige vom Kreuz herab!" 
[15:31] Auch die Hohenpriester samt den Schriftgelehrten verspotteten ihn untereinander und sagten: "Anderen hat er geholfen, und sich selbst kann er nun nicht helfen! 
[15:32] Der Messias, der König Israels, mag jetzt vom Kreuz heruntersteigen, damit wir's sehen! Dann wollen wir an ihn glauben!" Auch die Männer, die mit ihm gekreuzigt waren, beschimpften ihn. 
[15:33] Nach der sechsten Stunde aber bedeckte Finsternis die ganze Gegend bis zur neunten Stunde. 
[15:34] Und in der neunten Stunde schrie Jesus mit lauter Stimme: Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthanei! Das heißt: Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen! 
[15:35] Als einige der Umstehenden das hörten, sprachen sie: "Hört, er ruft den Elia." 
[15:36] Da lief einer hin, füllte einen Schwamm mit Essig, steckte ihn auf einen Rohrstab und wollte ihm zu trinken geben, indem er sagte: "Wartet, wir wollen doch sehen, ob Elia kommt, um ihn herabzunehmen." 
[15:37] Jesus aber tat einen lauten Schrei und verschied. 
[15:38] In diesem Augenblick zerriß der Tempelvorhang von oben bis unten in zwei Stücke. 
[15:39] Als der Hauptmann, der dem Kreuz gegenüberstand, ihn so verscheiden sah, da sprach er: "Wahrhaftig, dieser Mann ist Gottes Sohn gewesen!" 
[15:40] Es sahen auch Frauen von fern zu; unter ihnen waren Maria aus Magdala, Maria, die Mutter Jakobus des Kleinen und des Joses, und Salome — 
[15:41] die ihn schon, als er noch in Galiläa war, begleitet und bedient hatten — und außerdem noch viele andere, die mit ihm nach Jerusalem hinaufgezogen waren. 
[15:42] Als es schon Abend war — zudem war es Freitag, der Tag vor dem Sabbat —, da kam Josef von Arimathäa, 
[15:43] ein angesehener Ratsherr, der auch auf das Königreich Gottes wartete, ging mit kühnem Mut zu Pilatus und bat ihn um Jesu Leichnam. 
[15:44] Pilatus war verwundert, daß Jesus schon gestorben sein sollte. Er ließ deshalb den Hauptmann rufen und fragte ihn, ob er schon länger tot sei. 
[15:45] Als ihm der Hauptmann dies bestätigte, da schenkte er Josef den Leichnam. 
[15:46] Nun kaufte Josef feine Leinwand, ließ dann den Leichnam vom Kreuz herabnehmen, ihn in die Leinwand hüllen und in ein Grab legen, das in einen Felsen gehauen war. Dann ließ er einen Stein vor die Grabesöffnung wälzen. 
[15:47] Maria aus Magdala aber und Maria, des Joses Mutter, sahen sich die Stätte an, wo er beigesetzt war. 
[16:1] Als der Sabbat vorüber war, kauften Maria aus Magdala, Maria, die Mutter des Jakobus, und Salome Gewürzkräuter, um hinzugehen und Jesu Leichnam zu salben. 
[16:2] Am ersten Wochentag in aller Frühe gleich nach Sonnenaufgang machten sie sich auf zum Grab. 
[16:3] Da sprachen sie zueinander: "Wer wälzt uns wohl den Stein von der Grabesöffnung?" 
[16:4] Doch als sie hinsahen, bemerkten sie, daß der Stein schon weggewälzt war; denn er war sehr groß. 
[16:5] Als sie dann in die Grabkammer traten, sahen sie rechts einen Jüngling in weißem Gewand sitzen. Und sie erschraken sehr. 
[16:6] Er aber sprach zu ihnen: "Entsetzt euch nicht! Ihr wollt nach Jesus sehen, dem Nazarener, der gekreuzigt ist? Er ist auferstanden, er ist nicht hier! Seht da die Stätte, wohin man ihn gelegt! 
[16:7] Und jetzt geht hin und meldet seinen Jüngern, vor allen Petrus: 'Er geht euch voraus nach Galiläa; dort werdet ihr ihn sehen, wie er euch gesagt.'" 
[16:8] Da verließen sie das Grab und eilten weg; denn Zittern und Entsetzen erfüllte sie. Und sie sagten niemand ein Wort davon; denn sie waren voll Furcht.... 
[16:9] Als Jesus früh am ersten Wochentag auferstanden war, erschien er zuerst Maria aus Magdala, von der er sieben böse Geister ausgetrieben hatte. 
[16:10] Die ging hin und verkündigte es denen, die ihn einst begleitet hatten und die nun trauerten und weinten. 
[16:11] Doch als sie hörten, er lebe und sei von ihr gesehen worden, da glaubten sie es nicht. 
[16:12] Dann offenbarte er sich in anderer Gestalt Zweien von ihnen unterwegs, als sie zu einem Dorf gingen. 
[16:13] Die gingen auch hin und verkündigten es den übrigen. Aber auch ihnen glaubten sie nicht. 
[16:14] Später offenbarte er sich den Elf, als sie bei Tisch waren: er schalt ihren Unglauben und ihre Herzenshärtigkeit, weil sie denen, die ihn nach seiner Auferstehung gesehen, nicht geglaubt hätten. 
[16:15] Dann sprach er zu ihnen: "Geht hin in alle Welt und verkündigt die Heilsbotschaft der ganzen Menschheit. 
[16:16] Wer dann zum Glauben kommt und sich taufen läßt, der soll errettet werden. Wer aber nicht glauben will, der wird verdammt. 
[16:17] Dies aber sind die Wunderzeichen, die den Gläubigen zuteil werden sollen: in meinem Namen werden sie böse Geister austreiben; sie werden mit neuen Zungen reden; 
[16:18] mit ihren Händen werden sie Schlangen aufheben, und wenn sie etwas Tödliches trinken, soll es ihnen nicht schaden; Kranken werden sie die Hände auflegen, und sie sollen genesen." 
[16:19] Als der Herr Jesus so mit ihnen geredet hatte, ward er aufgehoben in den Himmel und setzte sich zur Rechten Gottes. 
[16:20] Sie zogen aus und predigten überall. Dabei stand ihnen der Herr zur Seite und bestätigte ihr Wort durch die begleitenden Wunderzeichen. Alles aber, was ihnen aufgetragen war, verkündigten sie in Kürze Petrus und seinen Gefährten. Dann erschien ihnen auch Jesus selbst und sandte durch sie vom Osten bis zum Westen die heilige und unvergängliche Botschaft des ewigen Heils. / Sie aber wollten sich rechtfertigen und sprachen: "Diese gesetzlose und ungläubige Weltzeit steht unter Satans Herrschaft, und der sucht durch die Wirksamkeit unreiner Geister zu verhindern, daß Gottes Wahrheit zur Geltung komme. Darum offenbare schon jetzt deine Gerechtigkeit!" So sprachen sie zu Christus. Christus aber entgegnete ihnen: "Das Maß der Jahre für Satans Macht und Einfluß ist jetzt voll Aber eine schlimme Zeit anderer Art ist nahe! Zum Heil der Sünder aber bin ich in den Tod gegeben worden, damit sie sich zur Wahrheit wenden und nicht mehr sündigen, auf daß sie einst im Himmel den geistlichen und unvergänglichen Schmuck der Gerechtigkeit erlangen. So geht denn hin in alle Welt... 

### Luke

[1:1] Schon viele haben versucht, einen Bericht über die bei uns als sicher geltenden Begebenheiten 
[1:2] nach der Erzählung der ursprünglichen Augenzeugen und Diener des Wortes abzufassen. 
[1:3] So habe auch ich mich entschlossen, allen diesen Begebenheiten bis zu ihren Ausgangspunkten mit Sorgfalt nachzugehen und sie für dich, hochedler Theophilus, zusammenhängend aufzuzeichnen, 
[1:4] damit du deutlich einsiehst, daß alles, was du durch mündliche Belehrung vernommen hast, in jeder Hinsicht wahr und zuverlässig ist. 
[1:5] Zur Zeit des jüdischen Königs Herodes lebte ein Priester, mit Namen Zacharias. Er gehörte zu der Ordnung Abias und hatte eine Frau aus der Zahl der Töchter Aarons, die hieß Elisabet. 
[1:6] Beide waren rechtschaffen vor Gott und wandelten in allen Geboten und Satzungen des Herrn ohne Tadel. 
[1:7] Sie waren aber kinderlos, denn Elisabet war unfruchtbar; und beide standen schon in vorgerücktem Alter. 
[1:8] Als Zacharias nun einst mit seiner Ordnung wieder an der Reihe war und vor Gott diente, 
[1:9] da fiel ihm eines Tages — wie bei den Priestern Sitte war — durchs Los der Auftrag zu, das Räucherwerk anzuzünden. So trat er in des Herrn Tempel ein, 
[1:10] während die ganze Menge des Volkes zur Stunde des Räucheropfers draußen betete. 
[1:11] Da erschien ihm ein Engel des Herrn, der stand auf der rechten Seite des Räucheraltars. 
[1:12] Bei seinem Anblick erschrak Zacharias, und Furcht befiel ihn. 
[1:13] Aber der Engel sprach zu ihm: "Fürchte dich nicht, Zacharias! Dein Gebet ist erhört worden: deine Frau Elisabet wird dir einen Sohn schenken, dem sollst du den Namen Johannes geben. 
[1:14] Er wird deine Freude und Wonne sein, und viele werden sich über seine Geburt freuen. 
[1:15] Denn nach des Herrn Urteil wird er bedeutend sein. Wein und berauschende Getränke wird er nie genießen, sondern schon von Geburt an wird er mit Heiligem Geist erfüllt sein. 
[1:16] Viele von Israels Söhnen wird er zu dem Herrn, ihrem Gott, bekehren. 
[1:17] Ja in Elias Geist und Kraft wird er vor dem Herrn als Herold hergehen, um der alten Väter Sinn in dem jetzigen Geschlecht zu erwecken und die Ungehorsamen zu der Einsicht der Gerechten zu führen, damit dem Herrn ein Volk bereitet werde, das für sein Kommen gerüstet ist." 
[1:18] Zacharias sprach zu dem Engel: "Wie soll ich das für möglich halten? Denn ich bin ja ein alter Mann, und meine Frau ist auch schon hochbetagt." 
[1:19] Der Engel erwiderte ihm: "Ich bin Gabriel; ich stehe immer dienstbereit vor Gott und bin jetzt gesandt, um mit dir zu reden und dir diese frohe Botschaft zu bringen. 
[1:20] Sieh, bis zu dem Tag, wo dies geschieht, sollst du stumm sein und nicht reden können zur Strafe dafür, daß du meinen Worten nicht geglaubt, die sich zu ihrer Zeit erfüllen werden." 
[1:21] Das Volk wartete indes auf Zacharias und war verwundert, daß er so lange im Heiligtum weilte. 
[1:22] Als er heraustrat, konnte er kein Wort zu ihnen reden. Daraus schlossen sie, er habe im Heiligtum eine Erscheinung gehabt. Er selbst gab ihnen das auch durch Zeichen zu verstehen und blieb stumm. 
[1:23] Als seine Dienstwoche zu Ende war, kehrte er wieder heim. 
[1:24] Um diese Zeit ward sein Weib Elisabet guter Hoffnung. Die ersten fünf Monate verließ sie ihre Wohnung nicht; doch sie dachte: 
[1:25] "Dies hat der Herr an mir getan: jetzt hat er meine Schmach bei den Menschen in Gnaden weggenommen." 
[1:26] Im sechsten Monat sandte Gott den Engel Gabriel nach Galiläa in eine Stadt mit Namen Nazaret, 
[1:27] zu einer Jungfrau, die verlobt war mit einem Mann aus dem Haus Davids, namens Josef; die Jungfrau hieß Maria. 
[1:28] Als der Engel bei ihr eintrat, sprach er: "Sei gegrüßt, du Begnadigte! Der Herr ist mit dir." 
[1:29] Bei diesen Worten geriet sie in Verwirrung und fragte sich, was dieser seltsame Gruß bedeuten solle. 
[1:30] Da sprach der Engel zu ihr: "Fürchte dich nicht, Maria! Denn du hast Gnade bei Gott gefunden. 
[1:31] Siehe, du wirst empfangen und einen Sohn bekommen, des Namen sollst du Jesus nennen. 
[1:32] Der wird gewaltig sein und ein Sohn des Höchsten heißen. Ja Gott der Herr wird ihm den Thron seines Ahnherrn David geben, 
[1:33] und er wird über Jakobs Haus in Ewigkeit herrschen, und sein Königtum wird kein Ende haben." 
[1:34] Da sprach Maria zu dem Engel: "Wie soll das möglich sein? Ich habe ja keinen Ehegatten." 
[1:35] Der Engel entgegnete ihr: "Heiliger Geist wird über dich kommen, und des Höchsten Kraft wird dich überschatten. Darum soll auch das heilige Kind Sohn Gottes heißen. 
[1:36] Auch deine Verwandte Elisabet hat trotz ihres hohen Alters einen Sohn empfangen, und sie, die als unfruchtbar galt, steht jetzt im sechsten Monat. 
[1:37] Denn bei Gott ist nichts unmöglich." 
[1:38] Maria sprach: "Siehe, ich bin des Herrn Magd; mir geschehe nach deinem Wort." Da schied der Engel von ihr. 
[1:39] Bald darauf begab sich Maria ohne Verzug in eine Stadt des judäischen Berglandes. 
[1:40] Sie trat in des Zacharias Haus und begrüßte Elisabet. 
[1:41] Als Elisabet Marias Gruß vernahm, da hüpfte das Kind in ihrem Schoß. Zugleich ward Elisabet vom Heiligen Geist erfüllt, 
[1:42] und mit lautem Freudenschrei rief sie aus: "Gesegnet bist du unter den Frauen, und gesegnet ist das Kindlein in deinem Schoß! 
[1:43] Doch warum wird mir diese Ehre zuteil, daß die Mutter meines Herrn zu mir kommt? 
[1:44] Denn siehe, als dein Gruß in meine Ohren klang, da hüpfte das Kind vor Freude in meinem Schoß. 
[1:45] Heil dir, die du geglaubt hast, daß sich des Herrn Verheißung an dir erfüllen wird!" 
[1:46] Da sprach Maria: "Meine Seele rühmt den Herrn, 
[1:47] und mein Geist frohlockt über Gott, meinen Retter; 
[1:48] denn er hat seine niedrige Magd gnädig angesehen. Von nun an werden mich alle Geschlechter seligpreisen; 
[1:49] denn der Allmächtige hat Großes an mir getan. Sein Name ist heilig, 
[1:50] und sein Erbarmen erweist sich von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht an denen, die ihn fürchten. 
[1:51] Mit seinem Arm vollbringt er gewaltige Taten, er macht zuschanden alle, die in ihrem Herzen Hoffart sinnen. 
[1:52] Mächtige stößt er vom Thron, und Niedrige hebt er empor. 
[1:53] Hungrige füllt er mit Schätzen, und Reiche läßt er leer ausgehen. 
[1:54] Er hat sich seines Knechtes Israel in Liebe angenommen; 
[1:55] denn nach den Worten, die er einst geredet hat zu unseren Vätern, will er nun an Abraham und sein Geschlecht erbarmungsreich gedenken ewiglich." 
[1:56] Maria blieb etwa drei Monate bei Elisabet; dann kehrte sie wieder in ihre Heimat zurück. 
[1:57] Als für Elisabet die Stunde der Niederkunft kam, gebar sie einen Sohn. 
[1:58] Bei der Kunde, daß der Herr so große Barmherzigkeit an ihr getan, freuten sich ihre Nachbarn und Verwandten mit ihr. 
[1:59] Am achten Tag versammelte man sich zu der Beschneidung des Knaben. Man wollte ihm nach seinem Vater den Namen Zacharias geben. 
[1:60] Seine Mutter aber erhob Einspruch dagegen und sagte: "Nein, er soll Johannes heißen." 
[1:61] Man wandte ihr ein: "Kein einziger aus deiner Verwandtschaft trägt diesen Namen." 
[1:62] Nun fragte man seinen Vater durch Zeichen, welchen Namen er für ihn bestimme. 
[1:63] Da ließ er sich ein Täfelchen bringen und schrieb darauf: "Johannes ist sein Name." Alle staunten. 
[1:64] Sofort öffnete sich sein Mund, seine Zunge ward gelöst, er konnte wieder reden und pries Gott. 
[1:65] Da wurden alle Leute in der Nachbarschaft von heiliger Scheu ergriffen. Ja in dem ganzen Bergland von Judäa sprach man von allen diesen Begebenheiten. 
[1:66] Jeder, der davon hörte, behielt es im Gedächtnis und fragte sich: "Was wird wohl aus diesem Kind werden?" Denn die Hand des Herrn war in der Tat mit ihm. 
[1:67] Sein Vater Zacharias, vom Heiligen Geist erfüllt, sprach damals so in Weissagung: 
[1:68] "Gepriesen sein der Herr, der Gott Israels; denn er hat sein Volk in Gnaden angesehen und es befreit. 
[1:69] Ja einen starken Retter hat er uns erstehen lassen in dem Haus seines Knechtes David — 
[1:70] wie er von altersher durch seiner heiligen Propheten Mund verheißen hat —: 
[1:71] Um uns von unseren Feinden zu erretten und aus den Händen aller, die uns hassen. 
[1:72] Damit will er Barmherzigkeit beweisen unseren Vätern und auch gedenken seines heiligen Bundes: 
[1:73] Des Eides, den er unserem Vater Abraham geschworen. 
[1:74] Darum schenkt er uns die Gnade, der Feinde Händen zu entrinnen und ihm, von aller Furcht befreit, zu dienen, 
[1:75] indem wir heilig und gerecht all unsere Lebenstage vor ihm wandeln. 
[1:76] Du aber, Kind, sollst ein Prophet des Höchsten heißen. Denn du wirst vor dem Herrn hergehen, ihm die Wege zu bereiten: 
[1:77] Du sollst sein Volk zu der Erkenntnis jenes Heils führen, das sie erlangen werden durch Vergebung ihrer Sünden. 
[1:78] Die schenkt uns das Erbarmen unseres Gottes, durch dessen Gnadenblick uns strahlt ein Lichtglanz aus der Höhe, 
[1:79] der denen leuchten soll, die jetzt in Finsternis und Todesschatten sitzen, um unsere Schritte auf den Friedensweg zu lenken." 
[1:80] Der Knabe aber wuchs heran und erstarkte im Geist. Er lebte später in der Wüste bis zu dem Tag, da er öffentlich vor Israel auftrat. 
[2:1] Zu jener Zeit hatte der Kaiser Augustus befohlen, es sollten alle Bewohner des römischen Reiches in die Schätzungslisten eingetragen werden. 
[2:2] Diese Schätzung wurde vorgenommen, noch ehe Quirinius Statthalter von Syrien war. 
[2:3] Da gingen alle hin, um sich in die Listen eintragen zu lassen: ein jeder in seine Heimatstadt. 
[2:4] Auch Josef zog damals aus der Stadt Nazaret in Galiläa hinauf nach Judäa zu der Davidstadt mit Namen Bethlehem, weil er zu Davids Haus und Geschlecht gehörte, 
[2:5] um sich dort eintragen zu lassen mit Maria, seiner Ehefrau, die guter Hoffnung war. 
[2:6] Während sie dort weilten, kam für Maria die Stunde ihrer Niederkunft: 
[2:7] sie bekam ihren ersten Sohn, hüllte ihn in Windeln und bettete ihn in eine Krippe, weil sie sonst keinen Platz in dem Raum fanden. 
[2:8] Nun waren Hirten in jener Gegend, die auf freiem Feld Nachtwache hielten bei ihrer Herde. 
[2:9] Zu denen trat plötzlich ein Engel des Herrn, und ein Lichtglanz des Herrn umleuchtete sie. Da erschraken sie sehr. 
[2:10] Der Engel aber sprach zu ihnen: "Fürchtet euch nicht! Denn ich verkündige euch große Freude, die dem ganzen Volk widerfahren soll: 
[2:11] Euch ist heute in Davids Stadt ein Retter geboren: der Gesalbte, der Herr! 
[2:12] Und dies sei euch das Erkennungszeichen: ihr werdet ein Kindlein finden, das, in Windeln gehüllt, in einer Krippe liegt." 
[2:13] Plötzlich sammelte sich um den Engel eine Menge des himmlischen Heeres; sie alle lobten Gott und sprachen: 
[2:14] "Preis gebührt Gott in Himmelshöhen, und auf Erden ist nun Friede unter Menschen, die Gott wohlgefallen!" 
[2:15] Als die Engel sie verlassen hatten und wieder in den Himmel aufgefahren waren, da sprachen die Hirten zueinander: "Wir wollen doch nach Bethlehem hinübergehen und uns das ansehen, was der Herr uns kundgetan." 
[2:16] So gingen sie eilend hin und fanden Maria und Josef, dazu das Kindlein in der Krippe. 
[2:17] Bei seinem Anblick erzählten sie, was sie über dies Kind vernommen hatten. 
[2:18] Und alle, die es hörten, waren über die Erzählung der Hirten verwundert. 
[2:19] Maria aber behielt dies alles und dachte in ihrem Herzen oft darüber nach. 
[2:20] Die Hirten kehrten dann wieder (zu ihren Herden) zurück: sie priesen und lobten Gott für alles, was sie gehört und dieser Botschaft gemäß auch selbst gesehen hatten. 
[2:21] Acht Tage später wurde das Kind beschnitten. Da erhielt es den Namen Jesus, den der Engel schon vor seiner Empfängnis genannt hatte. 
[2:22] Als die von dem Gesetz Moses vorgeschriebenen Tage ihrer Reinigung zu Ende waren, brachten sie das Kind nach Jerusalem, um es dem Herrn darzustellen, 
[2:23] nach dem Wort im Gesetz des Herrn: Jeder erstgeborene Knabe soll dem Herrn geweiht heißen, 
[2:24] und um nach der Vorschrift im Gesetz des Herrn ein Opfer darzubringen: ein Paar Turteltauben oder zwei junge Tauben. 
[2:25] Nun lebte damals in Jerusalem ein Mann mit Namen Simeon. Der war gerecht und gottesfürchtig; er wartete auf den Tröster Israels, und der Heilige Geist ruhte auf ihm. 
[2:26] Es war ihm auch vom Heiligen Geist kundgetan, er solle den Tod nicht sehen, ehe er den Gesalbten des Herrn geschaut. 
[2:27] Vom Geist getrieben, kam er (an jenem Tag) in den Tempel. Als nun die Eltern das Jesuskind hineintrugen, um nach dem Brauch des Gesetzes mit ihm zu verfahren, 
[2:28] da nahm er es auf seine Arme, pries Gott und sprach: 
[2:29] "Nun läßt du, Herr, deinen Knecht nach deinem Wort in Frieden scheiden; 
[2:30] denn meine Augen haben ja dein Heil gesehen, 
[2:31] das du bereitet hast vor aller Völker Augen: 
[2:32] Es ist ein Licht, das leuchten soll den Heiden, und es soll Israel, dein Volk, verherrlichen." 
[2:33] Des Kindes Vater und Mutter staunten über diese Worte, die Simeon von ihm redete. 
[2:34] Dann segnete sie Simeon und sprach zu Maria, seiner Mutter: "Dies Kind hier ist dazu bestimmt, viele in Israel zu Fall zu bringen, aber auch viele aufzurichten; ja es wird ein Zeichen sein, dem man mit solcher Feindschaft widerspricht, 
[2:35] daß auch dir selbst ein Schwert durch deine Seele dringen wird. So sollen sich die Gedanken vieler Herzen offenbaren." 
[2:36] Es war auch noch zugegen eine Prophetin Hanna, eine Tochter Phanuels, aus dem Stamm Asser. Die war hochbetagt. Nur sieben Jahre hatte sie nach ihrer Jungfrauenzeit mit ihrem Mann in der Ehe gelebt, 
[2:37] und nun war sie eine Witwe von vierundachtzig Jahren. Sie verließ den Tempel nicht, sondern diente Gott mit Fasten und Beten Tag und Nacht. 
[2:38] Die kam auch in jenem Augenblick dazu, dankte Gott und redete von dem Kind zu allen, die auf Jerusalems Erlösung warteten. 
[2:39] Als sie alles ausgeführt hatten, was im Gesetz des Herrn vorgeschrieben war, kehrten sie zurück nach Galiläa in ihren Wohnort Nazaret. 
[2:40] Der Knabe aber wuchs heran und wurde stark; er ward erfüllt mit Weisheit, und Gottes Gnade waltete über ihm. 
[2:41] Jedes Jahr reisten seine Eltern nach Jerusalem zum Passahfest. 
[2:42] Als er zwölf Jahre alt war, zogen sie auch, wie es Sitte war, zum Fest hinauf. 
[2:43] Nach Ablauf der Festwoche machten sie sich wieder auf den Heimweg. Der Jesusknabe aber blieb in Jerusalem zurück, ohne daß seine Eltern es merkten. 
[2:44] Sie meinten vielmehr, er sei unter den Festpilgern, und legten deshalb (unbekümmert) den ersten Reisetag zurück. Da erst suchten sie ihn unter den Verwandten und Bekannten. 
[2:45] Als sie ihn dort nicht fanden, kehrten sie nach Jerusalem zurück und suchten überall nach ihm. 
[2:46] Am dritten Tag endlich fanden sie ihn im Tempel: dort saß er mitten unter den Lehrern, hörte ihrem Vortrag zu und richtete Fragen an sie. 
[2:47] Alle aber, die ihn hörten, staunten über die Einsicht, die er durch seine Antworten bewies. 
[2:48] Als seine Eltern ihn erblickten, waren sie außer sich, und seine Mutter sprach zu ihm: "Mein Kind, warum hast du uns das angetan? Sieh, dein Vater und ich haben dich voll Angst gesucht." 
[2:49] Da entgegnete er ihnen: "Wie habt ihr mich nur suchen können? Habt ihr denn nicht gewußt, daß ich in meines Vaters Werk tätig sein muß?" 
[2:50] Dies Wort war jedoch für sie ein Rätsel. 
[2:51] Dann kehrte er mit ihnen nach Nazaret zurück und war ihnen allezeit gehorsam. Und seine Mutter behielt dies alles fest in ihrem Herzen. 
[2:52] Jesus aber nahm zu an Weisheit und Leibesgröße sowie an Gunst bei Gott und Menschen. 
[3:1] Im fünfzehnten Regierungsjahr des Kaisers Tiberius — als Pontius Pilatus Statthalter von Judäa war, während Herodes in Galiläa, sein Bruder Philippus in den Landschaften Ituräa und Trachonitis und Lysanias in dem Gebiet von Abila als Vierfürsten herrschten — 
[3:2] zu der Zeit, als Hannas und Kaiphas Hohepriester waren: da erging Gottes Auftrag an Johannes, des Zacharias Sohn, der in der Wüste lebte. 
[3:3] Er trat auf in der Jordangegend und verkündigte dort überall die Taufe, die von Sinnesänderung begleitet sein müsse, damit man Vergebung der Sünden empfangen könne. 
[3:4] So erfüllte sich das Wort in dem Buch der Reden des Propheten Jesaja: In der Wüste ruft eine Stimme: Bereitet dem Herrn den Weg, ebnet ihm die Pfade! 
[3:5] Jedes Tal soll ausgefüllt, jeder Berg und Hügel soll abgetragen werden. Die krummen Bahnen sollen sich in gerade wandeln, die holprigen Wege in glatte. 
[3:6] Und alle Welt soll schauen Gottes Heil. 
[3:7] Johannes sprach nun zu den Scharen, die hinauszogen, um sich von ihm taufen zu lassen: "Ihr Schlangenbrut! Wer hat euch denn gesagt, daß ihr dem kommenden Zorngericht entrinnen könnt? 
[3:8] So bringt denn Früchte, wie sie der Sinnesänderung entsprechen! Beruhigt euch nur nicht bei dem Gedanken: 'Wir haben ja Abraham zum Vater!' Denn ich sage euch: Gott kann aus diesen Steinen hier dem Abraham Kinder erstehen lassen. 
[3:9] Es liegt auch schon die Axt den Bäumen an der Wurzel; und jeder Baum, der nicht gute Frucht bringt, wird abgehauen und ins Feuer geworfen." 
[3:10] Da fragten ihn die Leute: "Was sollen wir denn tun?" 
[3:11] Er antwortete ihnen: "Wer zwei Unterkleider hat, der schenke eins davon dem, der keines hat; und wer zu essen hat, der mache es ebenso!" 
[3:12] Es kamen auch Zöllner, um sich von ihm taufen zu lassen, und sprachen zu ihm: "Meister, was sollen wir tun?" 
[3:13] Er antwortete ihnen: "Fordert nicht mehr (von den Leuten), als vorgeschrieben ist!" 
[3:14] Ferner fragten ihn Kriegsleute: "Was sollen wir denn tun?" Denen antwortete er: "Erpreßt kein Geld durch Drohung oder Quälereien, sondern seid zufrieden mit eurer Löhnung!" 
[3:15] Als aber die Leute voll Spannung waren und alle bei sich dachten, ob Johannes nicht gar der Messias sei, 
[3:16] da gab Johannes allen zur Antwort: "Ich taufe euch nur mit Wasser. Es kommt aber einer, der hat größere Gewalt als ich; und ich bin nicht wert, ihm seine Schuhriemen aufzubinden: der wird euch mit Heiligem Geist und mit Feuer taufen. 
[3:17] Er hat schon die Wurfschaufel in der Hand, um seine Tenne zu reinigen: den Weizen sammelt er in seinen Speicher; aber die Spreu wird er verbrennen mit einem Feuer, das niemand löschen kann." 
[3:18] Auch noch viele andere ernste Worte richtete er an das Volk, indem er ihm die Heilsbotschaft verkündigte. 
[3:19] Der Vierfürst Herodes aber, der wegen Herodias, der Frau seines Bruders, und wegen all seiner anderen Frevel oft von Johannes gerügt worden war, 
[3:20] setzte seinen Übeltaten dadurch die Krone auf, daß er Johannes ins Gefängnis werfen ließ. 
[3:21] Mit allen anderen Leuten ließ sich auch Jesus taufen. Während er betete, tat sich der Himmel auf, 
[3:22] und der Heilige Geist schwebte in leiblicher Gestalt wie eine Taube auf ihn hernieder. Zugleich sprach eine Stimme aus dem Himmel: "Du bist mein Sohn, ich habe dich heute gezeugt." 
[3:23] Als Jesus seine Wirksamkeit begann, war er etwa dreißig Jahre alt. Er galt für einen Sohn Josefs. Der war Elis Sohn, 
[3:24] der Matthats, der Levis, der Melchis, der Jannais, der Josefs, 
[3:25] der des Mattathias, der des Amos, der Nahums, der Eslis, der Naggais, 
[3:26] der Maaths, der des Mattathias, der Semeins, der Josechs, der Jodas, 
[3:27] der Jochanans, der Resas, der Serubabels, der Sealthiels, der Neris, 
[3:28] der Melchis, der Addis, der Kosams, der Elmodams, der Hers, 
[3:29] der Josuas, der Eliesers, der Jorims, der Matthats, der Levis, 
[3:30] der Simeons, der Judas, der Josefs, der Jonams, der Eliakims, 
[3:31] der Meleas, der Mennas, der Mattathas, der Nathans, der Davids, 
[3:32] der Jesses, der Obeds, der des Boas, der Salmas, der Nahessons, 
[3:33] der Aminadabs, der Admins, der Arnis, der Hezrons, der des Perez, der Judas, 
[3:34] der Jakobs, der Isaaks, der Abrahams, der Tharahs, der Nahors, 
[3:35] der Serugs, der Regus, der Pelegs, der Ebers, der Selahs, 
[3:36] der Kenans, der Arpachsads, der Sems, der Noahs, der Lamechs, 
[3:37] der Methusalahs, der Henochs, der Jareds, der Mahalaleels, der Kenans, 
[3:38] der des Enos, der Seths, der Adams; der war ein Sohn Gottes. 
[4:1] Mit dem Heiligen Geist erfüllt, kehrte Jesus vom Jordan (nach Galiläa) zurück. Auf der Heimreise wurde er vom Geist vierzig Tage lang in der Wüste umhergeführt. 
[4:2] Dabei ward er vom Teufel versucht. In jenen Tagen aß er nichts, und als sie zu Ende waren, empfand er Hunger. 
[4:3] Da sprach der Teufel zu ihm: "Bist du Gottes Sohn, so befiehl, daß sich dieser Stein hier in Brot verwandle." 
[4:4] Doch Jesus antwortete ihm: "Es steht geschrieben: Der Mensch wird nicht durch Brot allein am Leben erhalten." 
[4:5] Dann führte ihn der Teufel auf eine Höhe, zeigte ihm von dort in einem einzigen Augenblick alle Reiche der Erde 
[4:6] und sprach zu ihm: "All diese Macht und dieser Reiche Herrlichkeit will ich dir geben; denn mir ist sie verliehen, und ich kann sie schenken, wem ich will. 
[4:7] Fällst du nun vor mir nieder und huldigst mir, so soll es alles dein sein." 
[4:8] Da erwiderte ihm Jesus: "Es steht geschrieben: Anbetend huldigen sollst du nur dem Herrn, deinem Gott und ihn allein verehren." 
[4:9] Dann führte er ihn nach Jerusalem, stellte ihn auf das flache Dach der Tempelhalle und sprach zu ihm: "Bist du Gottes Sohn, so stürze dich von hier hinab! 
[4:10] Denn es steht geschrieben: Er wird seinen Engeln deinetwegen Auftrag geben, daß sie dich treulich schützen; 
[4:11] ja sie sollen dich auf den Händen tragen, daß du nicht mit deinem Fuß an einen Stein stoßest." 
[4:12] Jesus aber erwiderte ihm: "Es steht auch da: Du sollst den Herrn, deinen Gott, nicht versuchen." 
[4:13] Als so der Teufel alle Versuchungen (die ihm damals möglich waren) erschöpft hatte, verließ er ihn, um einen günstigen Zeitpunkt (für einen neuen Angriff) abzuwarten. 
[4:14] Mit des Geistes Kraft erfüllt, kam Jesus dann zurück nach Galiläa, und die Kunde von ihm verbreitete sich in dem ganzen Nachbarland. 
[4:15] Er trat in ihren Versammlungshäusern auf und wurde als Lehrer von allen gepriesen. 
[4:16] So kam er auch nach Nazaret, wo er aufgewachsen war. Dort besuchte er nach seiner Gewohnheit am nächsten Sabbat das Versammlungshaus. Und er erhob sich, um die Schriftlesung zu halten. 
[4:17] Da reichte man ihm das Buch des Propheten Jesaja. Er schlug es auf und fand die Stelle, wo geschrieben stand: 
[4:18] Der Geist des Herrn ruht auf mir, denn er hat mich gesalbt. Den Armen soll ich frohe Botschaft bringen: dazu hat er mich ausgesandt: den Gefangenen soll ich Freiheit künden und den Blinden, daß sie sehend werden; den Bedrückten soll ich Erlösung schenken: 
[4:19] Ein Gnadenjahr des Herrn soll ich ausrufen. 
[4:20] Dann rollte er das Buch zusammen, gab es dem Diener zurück und setzte sich. Während nun alle in dem Versammlungshaus ihre Augen gespannt auf ihn richteten, begann er seine Rede mit den Worten: 
[4:21] "Heute hat sich diese Schriftstelle erfüllt, die ihr soeben gehört..." 
[4:22] Alle zollten ihm Beifall, sie staunten ob der lieblichen Worte, die von seinen Lippen kamen, und sprachen: "Ist das nicht Josefs Sohn?" 
[4:23] Da sagte er zu ihnen: "Ihr werdet mir jedenfalls das Sprichwort entgegenhalten: 'Arzt, heile dich selbst! Solche Taten, wie du in Kapernaum vollbracht, und wovon wir haben erzählen hören, die tue auch hier in deiner Vaterstadt!'" 
[4:24] Dann fuhr er fort: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Kein Prophet wird in seiner Heimat anerkannt. 
[4:25] Ich versichere euch: Als in Elias Tagen der Himmel drei Jahre und sechs Monate verschlossen wurde und eine große Hungersnot über das ganze Land kam, da gab es viele Witwen in Israel. 
[4:26] Doch zu keiner von ihnen wurde Elia gesandt, sondern vielmehr zu einer Witwe in Sarepta bei Sidon. 
[4:27] Es gab auch zur Zeit des Propheten Elisa viele Aussätzige in Israel. Doch keiner von ihnen ward rein. Nur Naeman der Syrer fand Heilung." 
[4:28] Bei diesen Worten gerieten alle im Versammlungshaus in Wut: 
[4:29] sie standen auf und trieben ihn zur Stadt hinaus. Dann führten sie ihn bis zu einem Abhang des Berges, auf dem ihre Stadt erbaut war, um ihn hinabzustürzen. 
[4:30] Doch er schritt mitten durch sie hin und ging davon. 
[4:31] Er begab sich nach der Stadt Kapernaum in Galiläa. Dort lehrte er die Leute am Sabbat. 
[4:32] Sie waren von seiner Lehre ergriffen und betroffen, denn er redete in (göttlicher) Vollmacht. 
[4:33] Nun war in dem Versammlungshaus ein Mensch, der hatte einen unreinen Geist. 
[4:34] Der schrie mit lauter Stimme: "Ha! was haben wir mit dir zu schaffen, Jesus von Nazaret? Bist du gekommen, um uns zu verderben? Ich weiß, wer du bist: der Heilige Gottes." 
[4:35] Aber Jesus bedrohte ihn mit den Worten: "Schweig und fahre aus von ihm!" Da warf der böse Geist den Menschen mitten unter der versammelten Gemeinde zu Boden und fuhr aus von ihm, ohne ihm zu schaden. 
[4:36] Da sprachen alle voller Staunen und Entsetzen zueinander: "Was ist das doch! Mit Macht und Kraft befiehlt er den unreinen Geistern, und sie fahren aus!" 
[4:37] Und die Kunde von ihm drang in alle Nachbarorte. 
[4:38] Als er das Versammlungshaus verlassen hatte, ging er in Simons Wohnung. Simons Schwiegermutter litt gerade an einem heftigen Fieber, und man bat ihn, ihr zu helfen. 
[4:39] Da trat er an ihr Bett, beugte sich über sie und bedrohte das Fieber. Da verschwand es. Sofort erhob sie sich von ihrem Lager und wartete ihnen bei der Mahlzeit auf. 
[4:40] Als die Sonne unterging, brachten die Leute ihre mancherlei Kranken zu ihm. Er legte allen die Hände auf und heilte sie. 
[4:41] Auch böse Geister fuhren von vielen aus und schrien: "Du bist Gottes Sohn." Doch er bedrohte sie und erlaubte ihnen nicht zu reden. Denn sie wußten, daß er der Messias war. 
[4:42] Bei Tagesanbruch verließ er das Haus und begab sich an eine einsame Stätte. Da machten sich die Leute auf und suchten ihn. Als sie zu ihm kamen, wollten sie ihn festhalten, daß er sie nicht verlasse. 
[4:43] Aber er sprach zu ihnen: "Ich muß auch den anderen Städten die Frohe Botschaft von Gottes Königreich verkünden; denn dazu bin ich ja gesandt." 
[4:44] Er predigte dann (eine Zeitlang) in den Versammlungshäusern Judäas. 
[5:1] Eines Tages stand er am Ufer des Sees Genezaret. Das Volk umringte ihn, um Gottes Wort zu hören. 
[5:2] Da sah er zwei Boote am Ufer liegen; die Fischer aber waren ausgestiegen und reinigten ihre Hochseenetze. 
[5:3] Er trat in eins der Boote und bat Simon, dem es gehörte, eine kleine Strecke in den See hinauszurudern. Dann setzte er sich in dem Boot nieder und lehrte von da aus die Leute. 
[5:4] Als er seine Rede beendet hatte, sprach er zu Simon: "Fahr mitten in den See und werft dort eure Netze zum Fangen aus!" 
[5:5] Simon antwortete ihm: "Meister, wir haben uns die ganze Nacht gemüht und nichts gefangen; doch auf dein Wort will ich die Netze auswerfen." 
[5:6] Sie taten es und fingen eine solche Menge Fische, daß ihre Netze reißen wollten. 
[5:7] Da winkten sie ihren Genossen im anderen Boot, sie möchten kommen und ihnen helfen. Sie kamen, und nun füllte man beide Boote, so daß sie zu sinken drohten. Als Simon Petrus das sah, fiel er vor Jesus nieder und rief aus: 
[5:8] "Herr, gehe weg von mir; ich bin ein sündiger Mensch!" 
[5:9] Denn über diesen Fang, den sie gemacht, waren er und alle seine Gefährten verwundert und entsetzt. 
[5:10] Ebenso ging es Jakobus und Johannes, des Zebedäus Söhnen, die Simons Gehilfen waren. Doch Jesus sprach zu Simon: "Sei ohne Furcht! Von nun an sollst du Menschen fangen." 
[5:11] Da brachten sie ihre Boote ans Land, verließen alles und folgten ihm. Ein andermal weilte Jesus in einer Stadt. 
[5:12] Da war ein Mann voller Aussatz. Als der Jesus sah, fiel er vor ihm auf sein Antlitz nieder und bat ihn: "Herr, wenn du willst, so kannst du mich reinigen." 
[5:13] Jesus streckte seine Hand aus, rührte ihn an und sprach: "Ich will es, sei gereinigt!" Sofort wich der Aussatz von ihm. 
[5:14] Jesus gebot ihm, kein Wort davon zu reden. "Doch", so fügte er hinzu, "geh hin, zeige dich dem Priester und bring für deine Reinigung das Opfer, wie es Mose vorgeschrieben hat, zum Zeugnis für die Leute!" 
[5:15] Das Gerücht von ihm verbreitete sich aber immer weiter, und die Leute eilten in großen Scharen herbei, um ihn zu hören und sich von ihren Krankheiten heilen zu lassen. 
[5:16] Doch er hielt sich in der Einsamkeit verborgen, um dort zu beten. 
[5:17] Als er eines Tages lehrte, waren die Pharisäer und Gesetzeslehrer zugegen, die aus allen Orten Galiläas und Judäas und aus Jerusalem gekommen waren. Des Herrn Kraft war gerade wirksam, daß er Kranke heilte, 
[5:18] als einige Männer einen Gelähmten auf einem Tragbett brachten. Den suchten sie in das Haus zu bringen und vor Jesus niederzusetzen. 
[5:19] Aber der vielen Menschen wegen war es ihnen unmöglich, ihn hineinzutragen. Deshalb stiegen sie auf das Dach und ließen ihn samt dem Bett durch die Ziegel mitten unter die Leute unmittelbar vor Jesus nieder. 
[5:20] Als Jesus ihren Glauben sah, sprach er: "Mensch, deine Sünden sind dir vergeben!" 
[5:21] Da begannen die Schriftgelehrten und die Pharisäer bei sich zu denken: "Was ist das für eine Mann? Er lästert ja Gott! Wer kann Sünden vergeben als Gott allein?" 
[5:22] Jesus aber durchschaute ihre Gedanken und sprach zu ihnen: 
[5:23] "Was denkt ihr da in euern Herzen? Was ist leichter, zu sagen: 'Deine Sünden sind dir vergeben' oder das Wort zu sprechen: 'Steh auf und wandle'? 
[5:24] Ihr sollt aber sehen, daß der Menschensohn die Vollmacht hat, auf Erden Sünden zu vergeben." Nun wandte er sich zu dem Gelähmten und sprach: "Ich sage dir: Steh auf, nimm dein Bett und geh nach Hause!" 
[5:25] Sofort stand er vor ihren Augen auf, nahm sein Bett, worauf er gelegen, und ging Gott preisend in sein Haus zurück. 
[5:26] Von Staunen ergriffen, priesen alle Gott und, von heiliger Scheu erfüllt, bekannten sie: "Wir haben heute wunderbare Dinge erlebt!" 
[5:27] Dann verließ Jesus das Haus und sah einen Zöllner namens Levi vor seinem Zollhaus sitzen. Zu dem sprach er: "Folge mir nach!" 
[5:28] Da stand er auf, verließ alles und folgte ihm. 
[5:29] Und Levi gab Jesus zu Ehren ein großes Festmahl in seinem Haus. Daran nahmen außer Jesus und seinen Jüngern auch viele Zöllner und andere Gäste teil. 
[5:30] Darüber murrten die Pharisäer und die Schriftgelehrten, die ihrer Richtung angehörten, im Gespräch mit seinen Jüngern. "Warum", so fragten sie, "eßt und trinkt ihr denn mit solchen Zöllnern und Sündern?" 
[5:31] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Die Gesunden bedürfen des Arztes nicht, sondern die Kranken. 
[5:32] Ich bin nicht gekommen, um Gerechte zur Sinnesänderung zu rufen, sondern Sünder." 
[5:33] Weiter sprachen sie zu ihm: "Die Jünger des Johannes fasten so oft und beten, und ebenso die Jünger der Pharisäer; doch deine Jünger essen und trinken (ganz unbedenklich)." 
[5:34] Jesus sprach zu ihnen: "Könnt ihr denn die Hochzeitsgäste zum Fasten nötigen, solange der Bräutigam bei ihnen ist? 
[5:35] Aber es kommt die Zeit dafür: wenn ihnen der Bräutigam entrissen ist, dann werden sie fasten." 
[5:36] Er sagte ihnen auch ein Gleichnis: "Niemand schneidet einen Flicken von einem neue Kleid und setzt ihn auf ein altes. Sonst zerreißt er das neue Kleid, und zu dem alten paßt der Flicken vom neuen nicht. 
[5:37] Es gießt auch niemand neuen Wein in alte Schläuche. Sonst zerreißt der neue Wein die Schläuche: dann fließt er aus, und die Schläuche sind verloren. 
[5:38] Man muß vielmehr neuen Wein in neue Schläuche gießen. 
[5:39] Und niemand, der alten Wein getrunken hat, mag neuen. Denn er sagt: der alte ist besser." 
[6:1] Einst ging er am Sabbat durch Getreidefelder. Seine Jünger rissen Ähren ab, 
[6:2] zerrieben sie in der Hand und aßen die Körner. Da sprachen einige der Pharisäer: "Warum tut ihr etwas, was man am Sabbat nicht darf?" 
[6:3] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Habt ihr denn nicht einmal gelesen, was David tat, als ihn und seine Begleiter hungerte? 
[6:4] Wie er in das Haus Gottes ging, dort die Schaubrote nahm und aß und auch seinen Gefährten davon gab, obwohl allein die Priester sie verzehren dürfen?" 
[6:5] Dann fuhr er fort: "Der Menschensohn ist auch über den Sabbat Herr." 
[6:6] An einem anderen Sabbat ging er in das Versammlungshaus und lehrte. Dort war ein Mann, dessen rechter Arm war abgestorben. 
[6:7] Die Schriftgelehrten und die Pharisäer aber lauerten ihm auf, ob er am Sabbat heile, damit sie einen Grund hätten, ihn zu verklagen. 
[6:8] Er aber merkte ihre Gedanken und sprach zu dem Mann mit dem abgestorbenen Arm: "Steh auf, tritt vor!" Er stand auf und trat vor. 
[6:9] Da sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "Ich frage euch: Soll man am Sabbat lieber Gutes oder Böses tun, ein Leben retten oder vernichten?" 
[6:10] Dann sah er sie alle ringsum zornig an und sprach zu dem Mann: "Strecke deinen Arm aus!" Das tat er, und sein Arm ward wiederhergestellt. 
[6:11] Da wurden sie mit Wut erfüllt und besprachen miteinander, was sie gegen Jesus tun könnten. 
[6:12] In jenen Tagen zog er sich auf die Höhe zurück, um dort zu beten, und er verbrachte die ganze Nacht im Gebet zu Gott. 
[6:13] Nach Tagesanbruch rief er seine Jünger herbei und erwählte aus ihnen zwölf, die er auch Apostel nannte: 
[6:14] Simon, dem er den Namen Petrus gab, und Andreas, seinen Bruder; Jakobus und Johannes; Philippus und Bartholomäus; 
[6:15] Matthäus und Thomas; Jakobus, des Alphäus Sohn, und Simon, genannt "der Eiferer"; 
[6:16] Judas, den Sohn des Jakobus, und Judas aus Kariot, der sein Verräter wurde. 
[6:17] Mit ihnen stieg er vom Berg herab und machte auf einem ebenen Platz Halt. Dort umringte ihn eine große Schar seiner Jünger und eine zahlreiche Volksmenge aus dem ganzen jüdischen Land, besonders aus Jerusalem, und aus dem Küstenstrich von Tyrus und Sidon. 
[6:18] Sie alle waren herbeigekommen, um ihn zu hören und sich von ihren Krankheiten heilen zu lassen. Auch die von unreinen Geistern Geplagten wurden gesund. 
[6:19] Jeder in der Menge suchte ihn anzurühren; denn eine Kraft ging von ihm aus, und er heilte sie alle. 
[6:20] Da hob er seine Augen auf, sah seine Jünger an und sprach: "Selig seid ihr Armen; denn Gottes Königreich ist euer Teil. 
[6:21] Selig seid ihr, die ihr jetzt hungert; denn ihr sollt einst gesättigt werden. Selig seid ihr, die ihr jetzt weint; denn ihr sollt einst lachen. 
[6:22] Selig seid ihr, wenn euch die Leute um des Menschensohnes willen hassen, ausstoßen, schmähen und euern Namen ächten. 
[6:23] Freut euch dann und hüpft vor Wonne! Denn euer Lohn ist groß im Himmel. Ihre Vorfahren haben es ja mit den Propheten ebenso gemacht. 
[6:24] Aber weh euch Reichen! Denn ihr habt euer Glück schon weg. 
[6:25] Weh euch, die ihr jetzt ganz gesättigt seid! Denn euch soll einst hungern. Weh euch, die ihr jetzt lacht! Denn ihr sollt einst voll Trauer weinen. 
[6:26] Weh euch, wenn euch alle Leute schmeicheln! Ihre Vorfahren haben es ja mit den falschen Propheten ebenso gemacht. 
[6:27] Euch aber, die ihr hören wollt auf meine Worte, sage ich: Liebt eure Feinde; tut Gutes denen, die euch hassen; 
[6:28] segnet, die euch fluchen; betet für alle, die euch schmähen! 
[6:29] Wer dich auf die eine Wange schlägt, dem halte auch die andere hin; und wer dir dein Oberkleid nimmt, dem versag auch nicht dein Unterkleid! 
[6:30] Wer dich um etwas bittet, dem gib; und wenn man dir das Deine nimmt, so fordere es nicht zurück! 
[6:31] Wie ihr von den Leuten behandelt werden wollt, ganz ebenso sollt ihr sie auch behandeln. 
[6:32] Denn wenn ihr nur die liebt, die euch liebhaben, wie könnt ihr dafür Dank erwarten? Sogar die Sünder lieben solche, von denen sie Liebe erfahren. 
[6:33] Und wenn ihr euern Wohltätern Gutes tut, wie könnt ihr dafür Dank erwarten? Das tun sogar die Sünder. 
[6:34] Und wenn ihr nur den Leuten leiht, von denen ihr etwas zu bekommen hofft, wie könnt ihr dafür Dank erwarten? Selbst Sünder leihen ihresgleichen, um denselben Dienst von ihnen zu empfangen. 
[6:35] Doch ihr sollt eure Feinde lieben; ihr sollt Gutes tun und leihen, ohne dafür auf einen Gegendienst zu rechnen. Dann wird euch reicher Lohn zuteil, und ihr werdet Söhne des Höchsten sein. Denn auch er ist gütig gegen die Undankbaren und Bösen. 
[6:36] Zeigt euch barmherzig, wie euer Vater barmherzig ist! 
[6:37] Richtet nicht, dann werdet ihr auch nicht gerichtet! Verurteilt nicht, dann werdet ihr auch nicht verurteilt! Verzeiht, dann wird euch auch verziehen! 
[6:38] Gebt, dann wird euch auch gegeben! Ein reichliches, gedrücktes, gerütteltes und übervolles Maß wird man euch schütten in euers Mantels Bausch. Denn mit dem Maß, womit ihr meßt, soll euch wieder gemessen werden." 
[6:39] Er fügte dann noch ein Gleichnis hinzu: "Kann ein Blinder den anderen führen? Müssen sie nicht beide in die Grube fallen? 
[6:40] Kein Schüler übertrifft seinen Lehrer; sondern wenn er ganz ausgebildet ist, wird er doch höchstens dem Lehrer gleichen. 
[6:41] Warum siehst du den Splitter in deines Bruders Auge, während du den Balken im eigenen Auge nicht bemerkst? 
[6:42] Wie kannst du es wagen, zu deinem Bruder zu sagen: 'Bruder, laß mich den Splitter herausziehen, der in deinem Auge steckt', während du den Balken in deinem Auge gar nicht siehst? Du Heuchler, zieh zunächst den Balken aus deinem Auge! Dann erst magst du sehen, wie du den Splitter aus deines Bruders Auge ziehst. 
[6:43] Kein nützlicher Baum bringt schädliche Frucht, und umgekehrt: kein schädlicher Baum bringt nützliche Frucht. 
[6:44] Jeden Baum erkennt man ja an seiner Frucht. Von Gestrüpp kann man keine Feigen sammeln und von einem Dornbusch keine Trauben lesen. 
[6:45] Ein guter Mensch bringt aus der guten Vorratskammer seines Herzens Gutes hervor. Ein böser Mensch bringt aus seiner bösen Vorratskammer Böses hervor. Denn seines Mundes Worte fließen aus des Herzens Quell. 
[6:46] Warum nennt ihr mich 'Herr, Herr', wenn ihr doch nicht tut was ich gebiete? 
[6:47] Wer zu mir kommt und meine Worte hört und danach tut: ich will euch zeigen, wem der gleicht. 
[6:48] Er gleicht einem Mann, der bei einem Hausbau tief ausschachten läßt und die Grundmauern auf Felsenboden setzt. Kommt dann eine Überschwemmung und prallt die Wasserflut an ein solches Haus, so kann sie es doch nicht erschüttern; denn es ist fest gebaut. 
[6:49] Wer aber meine Worte hört und nicht danach tut, der gleicht einem Mann, der sein Haus ohne feste Grundmauer auf die weiche Erde baut. Prallt dann die Wasserflut dagegen, so stürzt es gleich zusammen, und ein solches Haus wird ein großer Trümmerhaufen." 
[7:1] Als Jesus diese ganze Rede, die auch das Volk vernahm, beendet hatte, ging er nach Kapernaum hinein. 
[7:2] Dort lag eines Hauptmanns Knecht, den sein Herr besonders schätzte, so schwer krank, daß er dem Tod nahe war. 
[7:3] Als nun der Hauptmann von Jesus hörte, sandte er einige der jüdischen Ältesten zu ihm und ließ ihn bitten, er möge kommen und seinen Knecht gesund machen. 
[7:4] Die erschienen bei Jesus und baten ihn dringend, indem sie geltend machten: "Er verdient es wirklich, daß du ihm seinen Wunsch erfüllst. 
[7:5] Denn er hat unser Volk lieb, und das Versammlungshaus hat er uns aus seinen Mitteln erbaut." 
[7:6] Jesus ging mit. Als er aber nicht mehr weit von dem Haus war, da ließ ihm der Hauptmann durch einige seiner Freunde sagen: "Herr, bemühe dich nicht; denn ich bin nicht wert, daß du unter mein Dach trittst! 
[7:7] Darum habe ich mich auch nicht für würdig gehalten, zu dir zu kommen. Sondern sprich nur ein Wort, so muß mein Diener genesen! 
[7:8] Denn auch ich, obwohl einem Vorgesetzten untergeben, habe Kriegsleute unter mir. Sage ich nun zu dem einen: 'Geh!', so geht er, zu dem anderen: 'Komm!', so kommt er, und zu meinem Knecht: 'Tue das!', so tut er's." 
[7:9] Als Jesus das hörte, verwunderte er sich über ihn; er wandte sich zu dem Volk, das ihn begleitete, und sprach: "Ich sage euch: Nicht einmal in Israel habe ich solchen Glauben gefunden." 
[7:10] Bei ihrer Rückkehr in des Hauptmanns Haus fanden die Boten den kranken Knecht gesund. 
[7:11] Bald darauf begab sich Jesus auf den Weg zu einer Stadt mit Namen Nain, und mit ihm zogen seine Jünger und viel Volk. 
[7:12] Als er sich dem Stadttor näherte, da trug man gerade einen Toten hinaus; der war der einzige Sohn seiner Mutter, und sie war eine Witwe. Und sehr viele Leute aus der Stadt begleiteten sie. 
[7:13] Als der Herr sie sah, empfand er tiefes Mitgefühl mit ihr, und er sprach zu ihr: "Weine nicht!" 
[7:14] Dann trat er an den Sarg und berührte ihn. Da machten die Träger Halt. Und er sprach: "Jüngling, ich sage dir: wach auf!" 
[7:15] Da setzte sich der Tote aufrecht hin und begann zu reden. Und Jesus gab ihn seiner Mutter wieder. 
[7:16] Alle aber waren von heiliger Scheu ergriffen und priesen Gott. Die einen riefen: "Ein großer Prophet ist unter uns aufgetreten!" Andere sagten: "Gott hat sein Volk in Gnaden angesehen!" 
[7:17] Die Kunde von dieser seiner Tat verbreitete sich im ganzen jüdischen Land und in allen angrenzenden Gebieten. 
[7:18] Von alledem erhielt auch Johannes durch seine Jünger Nachricht. Da rief er zwei von ihnen zu sich, 
[7:19] sandte sie zum Herrn und ließ ihn fragen: "Bist du es, der kommen soll, oder müssen wir auf einen anderen warten?" 
[7:20] Die Männer erschienen bei ihm und sprachen: "Johannes der Täufer hat uns zu dir gesandt und läßt dich fragen: 'Bist du der verheißene Messias, oder müssen wir auf einen anderen warten?'" 
[7:21] Zu eben jener Stunde heilte Jesus viele von Krankheiten, Plagen und bösen Geistern, und vielen Blinden schenkte er das Augenlicht. 
[7:22] Da antwortete er den Boten: "Geht und berichtet Johannes, was ihr gesehen und gehört: Blinde werden sehend, Lahme gehen wieder, Aussätzige werden rein, Taube hören, Tote werden auferweckt, Armen wird die Heilsbotschaft verkündigt; 
[7:23] und selig ist, wer an mir nicht irre wird!" 
[7:24] Als die Boten des Johannes wieder weggegangen waren, begann Jesus zu den Volksscharen von Johannes zu reden: "Warum seid ihr einst in die Wüste hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr euch ein Schilfrohr ansehen, das sich im Wind hin- und herbewegte? 
[7:25] Doch sicher nicht! Warum seid ihr denn einst hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr einen feingekleideten Weltmann sehen? Solche Leute, die sich prächtig kleiden und üppig leben, sind an den Königshöfen. 
[7:26] Warum seid ihr denn hinausgegangen? Wolltet ihr einen Propheten sehen? Ja ich sage euch: Dieser Mann ist noch weit mehr als ein Prophet. 
[7:27] Denn er ist es, von dem geschrieben steht: Sieh, ich sende meinen Boten vor dir her, der deinen Weg vor dir bereiten soll. 
[7:28] Ich sage euch: Unter allen Weibersöhnen ist keiner größer als Johannes; der Kleinste aber im Königreich Gottes ist größer als er. 
[7:29] Das ganze Volk, das des Johannes Predigt hörte, besonders auch die Zöllner, haben sich von ihm taufen lassen und damit diese Ordnung Gottes als gerecht anerkannt. 
[7:30] Die Pharisäer aber und die Gesetzeslehrer haben sich nicht von ihm taufen lassen und dadurch die Gnadenabsicht, die Gott auch mit ihnen hatte, vereitelt. 
[7:31] Wem soll ich nun die Menschen von heute vergleichen? Wem sind sie ähnlich? 
[7:32] Sie sind wie Kinder, die auf der Straße sitzen und einander zurufen: Wir haben euch die Flöte gespielt, doch ihr habt nicht getanzt; wir haben ein Klagelied gesungen, doch ihr habt nicht geweint. 
[7:33] Johannes der Täufer ist aufgetreten: er hat kein Brot gegessen und keinen Wein getrunken; da sagt ihr: 'Er ist von einem bösen Geist besessen!' 
[7:34] Der Menschensohn ist aufgetreten und ißt und trinkt wie andere; da sagt ihr nun: 'Seht, er ist ein Fresser und Weintrinker, der Zöllner und Sünder Freund.' 
[7:35] Aber doch ist die Weisheit (Gottes) anerkannt worden von allen, die auf ihre Stimme hören." 
[7:36] Einst lud ihn ein Pharisäer ein, bei ihm zu speisen. Er ging in des Pharisäers Haus und nahm am Tisch Platz. 
[7:37] Nun wohnte in jener Stadt eine Frau, die ein lasterhaftes Leben führte. Als die vernahm, Jesus sei als Gast in des Pharisäers Haus, da kam sie mit einem Glas Salböl 
[7:38] und trat laut weinend rückwärts zu dem Platz, wo er mit seinen Füßen lag. Sie begann mit ihren Tränen seine Füße zu benetzen und trocknete sie mit ihrem Haupthaar. Dann küßte sie voll Inbrunst seine Füße und salbte sie mit dem Öl. 
[7:39] Als der Pharisäer, der ihn geladen hatte, das sah, da dachte er bei sich: "Wäre der Mann wirklich ein Prophet, so müßte er auch wissen, wer und was für eine Frau das ist, die ihn berührt, — er müßte wissen, daß dies Weib der Sünde dient." 
[7:40] Da nahm Jesus das Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Simon, ich habe dir etwas zu sagen." Er erwiderte: "Meister, sprich!" 
[7:41] Jesus sagte: "Ein Geldverleiher hatte zwei Schuldner; der eine war ihm fünfhundert Silberlinge schuldig, der andere fünfzig. 
[7:42] Da sie ihre Schuld nicht bezahlen konnten, so erließ er sie beiden. Sag mir: wer von ihnen wird ihn nun am meisten liebhaben?" 
[7:43] Simon antwortete: "Ich sollte meinen: der, dem er am meisten erlassen hat." Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Du hast recht geurteilt." 
[7:44] Dann wandte er sich zu der Frau und sprach zu Simon: "Du siehst die Frau hier. Als ich dein Haus betrat, hast du mir kein Wasser zu einem Fußbad bringen lassen; sie aber hat meine Füße mit ihren Tränen genetzt und sie mit ihrem Haar getrocknet. 
[7:45] Du hast mir keinen Willkommkuß gegeben; sie aber hat, seitdem ich hier eingetreten bin, mir unaufhörlich die Füße geküßt. 
[7:46] Du hast mir das Haupt nicht mit Öl gesalbt; sie aber hat mir mit ihrer köstlichen Salbe sogar die Füße gesalbt. 
[7:47] Darum sage ich dir: Für ihre vielen Sünden ist ihr schon Vergebung zuteil geworden; denn sie hat (mir) viel Liebe erwiesen. Wem aber nur wenig vergeben wird, der zeigt auch nur wenig Liebe." 
[7:48] Dann sprach er zu ihr: "Deine Sünden sind dir vergeben." 
[7:49] Da begannen die Tischgenossen bei sich zu denken: "Wer ist denn dieser Mann, daß er sogar Sünden vergibt?" 
[7:50] Er aber sprach zu der Frau: "Dein Glaube hat dich gerettet; geh hin in Frieden!" 
[8:1] Sodann zog Jesus durch das Land: er ging von Stadt zu Stadt, von Dorf zu Dorf, und überall verkündigte er die Frohe Botschaft von Gottes Königreich. Er wurde begleitet von den Zwölf 
[8:2] und auch von einigen Frauen, die er von bösen Geistern und von Krankheiten befreit hatte. Darunter waren Maria mit dem Beinamen Magdalena, von der sieben böse Geister ausgefahren waren, 
[8:3] Johanna, die Frau Chuzas, eines Verwalters des Herodes, Susanna und viele andere, die ihn aus ihren Mitteln unterstützten. 
[8:4] Als einst viel Volk zusammenkam und die Leute aus den Städten zu ihm eilten, trug er dies Gleichnis vor: 
[8:5] "Es ging ein Sämann aus, um seinen Samen auszustreuen. Beim Säen fielen einige Körner an den Weg: die wurden zertreten, und die Vögel unter dem Himmel pickten sie auf. 
[8:6] Andere Körner fielen auf steinigen Boden: die gingen auf; aber die Halme verdorrten, weil sie keine Feuchtigkeit hatten. 
[8:7] Andere Körner fielen mitten unter Dorngestrüpp: da wuchsen die Dornen mit auf und erstickten die Saat. 
[8:8] Andere Körner fielen auf guten Boden: die gingen auf und trugen hundertfältige Frucht." Bei diesen Worten rief er aus: "Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre!" 
[8:9] Da fragten ihn seine Jünger nach der Bedeutung dieses Gleichnisses. 
[8:10] Er antwortete: "Euch ist die Fähigkeit verliehen, in die Geheimnisse des Königreiches Gottes einzudringen. Die anderen aber werden nur durch Gleichnisse unterwiesen, denn: Sie sollen sehen und nicht beachten, sie sollen hören und nicht verstehen. 
[8:11] Dies ist die Deutung des Gleichnisses: Der Same ist das Wort Gottes. 
[8:12] Bei denen der Same an den Weg fällt, die hören wohl das Wort; dann aber kommt der Teufel und nimmt es weg aus ihrem Herzen, damit sie nicht zum Glauben kommen und gerettet werden. 
[8:13] Bei denen der Same auf steinigen Boden fällt, die nehmen zwar das Wort, wenn sie es hören, mit Freuden auf; es schlägt jedoch in ihnen keine Wurzel: sie glauben nur eine Zeitlang; aber wenn Prüfung kommt, fallen sie ab. 
[8:14] Was dorthin fällt, wo Dornen wachsen, das bedeutet solche, die das Wort wohl hören, dann aber hingehen und es von des Lebens Sorgen, Reichtum und Genüssen in sich ersticken lassen, so daß sie keine Frucht zur Reife bringen. 
[8:15] Was aber auf guten Boden fällt, bedeutet solche, die das Wort, das sie gehört, in einem guten, edlen Herzen bewahren und in beharrlicher Ausdauer Frucht bringen. 
[8:16] Niemand zündet eine Lampe an und bedeckt sie dann mit einem Gefäß oder stellt sie unter ein Bett, sondern er setzt sie auf einen Leuchter, damit alle, die eintreten, das Licht sehen. 
[8:17] Denn nichts ist so verborgen, daß es nicht einst offenbar würde; und nichts ist so versteckt, daß es nicht einst bekannt würde und ans Tageslicht käme. 
[8:18] Achtet darum darauf, wie ihr hört! Denn wer (die rechte Aufmerksamkeit) hat, dem wird (Erkenntnis) mitgeteilt; wer (sie) aber nicht hat, soll sogar auch das, was er (an Erkenntnis) zu haben meint, genommen werden." 
[8:19] Einst kamen seine Mutter und seine Brüder zu ihm; aber der vielen Leute wegen konnten sie nicht zu ihm gelangen. 
[8:20] Da wurde ihm gemeldet: "Deine Mutter und deine Brüder stehen draußen und wünschen dich zu sehen." 
[8:21] Darauf gab er zur Antwort: "Meine Mutter und meine Brüder sind alle, die Gottes Wort hören und befolgen." 
[8:22] Eines Tages stieg er mit seinen Jüngern in ein Boot und sprach zu ihnen: "Wir wollen an das andere Ufer des Sees fahren." Sie fuhren ab. 
[8:23] Während der Fahrt schlief er ein. Da kam ein Sturmwind über den See; das Boot füllte sich mit Wasser, und sie schwebten in (großer) Gefahr. 
[8:24] Da traten die Jünger zu ihm und weckten ihn mit dem Ruf: "Meister, Meister, wir ertrinken!" Da stand er auf und schalt den Wind und die Wasserwogen. Nun legten sie sich, und es ward still. 
[8:25] Dann sagte er zu ihnen: "Wo ist denn euer Glaube?" Sie aber waren voll Furcht und Staunen und sprachen zueinander: "Wer ist doch dieser Mann, daß er sogar den Winden und Wogen gebietet und sie ihm gehorchen?" 
[8:26] Sie fuhren dann in das Gebiet der Gergesener, das Galiläa gegenüberliegt. 
[8:27] Als er dort ans Land gestiegen war, trat ihm ein Mann aus der Stadt entgegen, der von bösen Geistern besessen war. Der trug schon lange keine Kleider mehr und hatte auch keine bestimmte Wohnung, sondern hauste in den Gräbern. 
[8:28] Als dieser Mann Jesus sah, warf er sich schreiend vor ihm nieder und rief mit lauter Stimme: "Was habe ich mit dir zu schaffen, Jesus, du Sohn Gottes, des Höchsten? Ich bitte dich: Quäle mich doch nicht!" 
[8:29] Jesus wollte nämlich gerade dem unreinen Geist gebieten, von dem Menschen auszufahren. Der war schon lange in der Gewalt des bösen Geistes; und wenn man ihn zur Sicherheit an Händen und Füßen binden wollte, so zerriß er jedesmal die Fesseln und wurde von dem bösen Geist in abgelegene Gegenden getrieben. 
[8:30] Jesus fragte ihn nun: "Wie heißt du?" Er antwortete: "Legion". Denn viele böse Geister waren in ihn gefahren. 
[8:31] Die Geister aber baten Jesus, er möge ihnen nicht befehlen, in den Abgrund zu fahren. 
[8:32] Nun war dort am Bergeshang gerade eine große Herde Schweine auf der Weide. Da baten ihn die bösen Geister, er möge ihnen erlauben, in die Schweine zu fahren. Das erlaubte er ihnen. 
[8:33] Nun fuhren die bösen Geister von dem Menschen aus und gingen in die Schweine. Da stürmte die Herde den Abhang hinunter in den See und ertrank. 
[8:34] Als die Hirten sahen, was geschah, da flohen sie und erzählten den Vorfall in der Stadt und auf dem Land. 
[8:35] Da eilten die Leute herbei, um zu sehen, was sich begeben hatte. Als sie zu Jesus kamen und den Mann, von dem die bösen Geister ausgefahren waren, bekleidet und vernünftig zu Jesu Füßen sitzend fanden, da wurden sie von Furcht ergriffen. 
[8:36] Die Augenzeugen erzählten ihnen, wie der Besessene gesund geworden sei. 
[8:37] Da bat ihn die ganze Bevölkerung in der Gegend von Gergesa, er möge sie verlassen; denn sie waren von großer Furcht ergriffen. Er stieg nun wieder ins Boot und fuhr zurück. 
[8:38] Der Mann aber, von dem die bösen Geister ausgefahren waren, bat ihn um die Erlaubnis, daß er bei ihm bleiben dürfe. Doch Jesus entließ ihn mit den Worten: 
[8:39] "Kehre nach Hause zurück und erzähle dort alles, was Gott an dir getan!" Da ging er hin und verkündigte in der ganzen Stadt, was Jesus ihm erwiesen hatte. 
[8:40] Bei seiner Rückkehr (nach Kapernaum) wurde Jesus von dem Volk mit Jubel empfangen; denn alle warteten auf ihn. 
[8:41] Da kam ein Mann mit Namen Jairus, einer von den Vorstehern der jüdischen Gemeinde. Der fiel Jesus zu Füßen und bat ihn, in sein Haus zu kommen; 
[8:42] denn er hatte eine einzige Tochter von etwa zwölf Jahren, und die lag im Sterben. Jesus machte sich auf den Weg, umdrängt von vielen Menschen. 
[8:43] Und eine Frau, die schon seit zwölf Jahren am Blutfluß litt, die ihr ganzes Vermögen für Ärzte ausgegeben und bei keinem hatte Heilung finden können, 
[8:44] die trat nun von hinten an ihn heran und berührte die Quaste seines Mantels; und augenblicklich stand ihr Blutfluß still. 
[8:45] Da fragte Jesus: "Wer hat mich berührt?" Als sich keiner meldete, sagten Petrus und die anderen: "Meister, die Leute drängen dich doch von allen Seiten und stoßen." 
[8:46] Jesus aber erwiderte: "Es hat mich jemand angerührt; denn ich habe gemerkt, daß eine Kraft von mir ausgegangen ist." 
[8:47] Als sich nun die Frau entdeckt sah, da kam sie zitternd herbei, fiel vor ihm nieder und bekannte vor allem Volk, weshalb sie ihn angerührt habe und wie sie sofort geheilt worden sei. 
[8:48] Da sprach er zu ihr: "Meine Tochter, dein Glaube hat dich gesund gemacht; geh hin in Frieden!" 
[8:49] Während er noch so redete, erschien jemand aus dem Haus des Gemeindevorstehers und brachte diesem die Botschaft: "Deine Tochter ist schon gestorben; bemühe den Meister nicht weiter!" 
[8:50] Als Jesus das hörte, sprach er zu ihm: "Fürchte dich nicht; glaube nur, und sie wird leben!" 
[8:51] Als er dann zu dem Haus kam, ließ er niemand mit sich eintreten als Petrus, Jakobus und Johannes und des Kindes Eltern. 
[8:52] Alle (im Haus) weinten und klagten laut um sie. Er aber sprach: "Weint nicht; sie ist ja nicht tot, sie schläft nur!" 
[8:53] Da verlachten sie ihn; denn sie wußten wohl, daß sie tot war. 
[8:54] Er aber ergriff sie bei der Hand und rief: "Kind, steh auf!" 
[8:55] Da kehrte ihr Geist zurück, und sie stand augenblicklich auf. Und er ordnete an, man solle ihr zu essen geben. 
[8:56] Ihre Eltern waren vor Staunen ganz außer sich. Aber er gebot ihnen, niemand etwas von dem Vorfall zu erzählen. 
[9:1] Dann rief er die zwölf Apostel zusammen und gab ihnen Kraft und Vollmacht, alle bösen Geister auszutreiben und Krankheiten zu heilen. 
[9:2] Darauf sandte er sie aus, um Gottes Königreich zu verkünden und die Kranken gesund zu machen. 
[9:3] Dabei sprach er zu ihnen: "Nehmt nichts mit auf den Weg: keinen Wanderstab, keinen Ranzen, kein Brot, kein Geld; auch sollt ihr nicht zwei Unterkleider haben! 
[9:4] In jedem Haus, wo ihr Eingang findet, da bleibt, bis ihr weiterwandert! 
[9:5] Wo man euch aber nicht aufnimmt, die Stadt verlaßt und schüttelt ihren Staub von euern Füßen, zum Zeugnis wider sie!" 
[9:6] So zogen sie denn aus und wanderten von Dorf zu Dorf; überall verkündigten sie die Frohe Botschaft und heilten Kranke. 
[9:7] Als der Vierfürst Herodes von dem allen hörte, wußte er nicht, was er davon halten sollte. Denn einige sagten: "Johannes ist von den Toten auferweckt", 
[9:8] andere: "Elia ist erschienen", wieder andere: "Einer der alten Propheten ist auferstanden." 
[9:9] Herodes aber sprach: "Johannes habe ich enthaupten lassen; wer ist nun dieser Mann, von dem ich solche Dinge höre?" Und er wünschte, ihn zu sehen. 
[9:10] Bei ihrer Rückkehr erzählten die Apostel Jesus alles, was sie ausgerichtet hatten. Da nahm er sie mit sich und zog sich in die Einsamkeit zurück in die Nähe einer Stadt, die hieß Bethsaida. 
[9:11] Die Leute aber erfuhren das und folgten ihm. Er nahm sie freundlich auf, redete zu ihnen von dem Königreich Gottes und machte alle Heilungsbedürftigen gesund. 
[9:12] Als sich der Tag zu neigen begann, traten die Zwölf zu ihm und sprachen: "Laß die Leute ziehen, damit sie in die umliegenden Dörfer und Gehöfte gehen und dort Unterkunft und Verpflegung finden; denn wir sind hier in einer unbewohnten Gegend." 
[9:13] Er aber sprach zu ihnen: "Gebt ihr ihnen zu essen!" Sie erwiderten: "Wir haben nicht mehr als fünf Brote und zwei Fische; wir müßten sonst hingehen und Lebensmittel kaufen für alle diese Menschen." 
[9:14] Es waren nämlich gegen fünftausend Mann. Da sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Laßt sie sich in Gruppen etwa zu je fünfzig lagern!" 
[9:15] Das taten sie und ließen alle sich niedersetzen. 
[9:16] Nun nahm er die fünf Brote und die beiden Fische, sah auf zum Himmel und sprach den Lobpreis. Dann brach er die Brote und gab sie seinen Jüngern, damit sie sie den Leuten vorlegten. 
[9:17] So aßen alle und wurden satt. Dann hob man die Brocken, die sie übriggelassen hatten, vom Boden auf: zwölf große Körbe voll. 
[9:18] Als er eines Tages in der Einsamkeit betete, waren nur die Jünger bei ihm. Da fragte er sie: "Wofür halten mich die Leute?" 
[9:19] Sie antworteten: "Für Johannes den Täufer, andere für Elia, noch andere meinen, einer der alten Propheten sei auferstanden." 
[9:20] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Für wen haltet ihr mich denn?" Petrus antwortete: "Für den Gesalbten Gottes." 
[9:21] Da verbot er ihnen streng, das irgendwem zu sagen. 
[9:22] Er fügte noch hinzu: "Der Menschensohn muß vieles leiden, dazu verworfen werden von den Ältesten, Hohenpriestern und Schriftgelehrten; ja er muß den Tod erdulden, aber am dritten Tag auferstehen." 
[9:23] Dann sprach er zu allen: "Wer mein Nachfolger sein will, der verleugne sich selbst und nehme Tag für Tag sein Kreuz auf sich und folge mir. 
[9:24] Denn wer sein Leben retten will, der wird es verlieren; wer aber sein Leben um meinetwillen verliert, der wird es retten. 
[9:25] Was nützt es einem Menschen, wenn er die ganze Welt gewinnt und dabei sich selbst verliert oder zu Schaden bringt? 
[9:26] Denn wer sich mein und meiner Worte schämt, des wird sich auch der Menschensohn schämen, wenn er in seiner, in seines Vaters und in der heiligen Engel Herrlichkeit erscheint. 
[9:27] Es ist die volle Wahrheit, wenn ich euch sage: Einige von denen, die hier stehen, sollen den Tod nicht schmecken, ehe sie Gottes Königreich gesehen haben." 
[9:28] Etwa acht Tage später nahm er Petrus, Johannes und Jakobus zu sich und ging auf den Berg, um dort zu beten. 
[9:29] Während er betete, veränderte sich das Aussehen seines Angesichts, und sein Gewand ward blendend weiß. 
[9:30] Und sieh, zwei Männer hatten ein Gespräch mit ihm: das waren Mose und Elia. 
[9:31] Die erschienen in überirdischem Glanz und redeten von seinem Lebensausgang, den er in Jerusalem vollenden sollte. 
[9:32] Petrus aber und seine Gefährten waren in tiefen Schlaf versunken. Als sie erwachten, sahen sie seine Herrlichkeit und die beiden Männer, die bei ihm standen. 
[9:33] Als die von ihm scheiden wollten, sprach Petrus zu Jesus: "Meister, es trifft sich gut, daß wir hier sind! Laß uns drei Hütten bauen: eine für dich, eine für Mose und eine für Elia." Er wußte aber nicht, was er da sagte. 
[9:34] Während er noch redete, kam eine Wolke und umhüllte sie; und sie wurden von Furcht ergriffen, als die Wolke sie umfing. 
[9:35] Da rief eine Stimme aus der Wolke: "Dies ist mein Sohn, den ich erkoren; auf den hört!" 
[9:36] Nach diesem Ruf war Jesus wieder allein. Die Jünger schwiegen über das, was sie gesehen hatten, und teilten damals keinem etwas davon mit. 
[9:37] Als sie am nächsten Tag von dem Berg hinabgingen, kam Jesus ein großer Volkshaufen entgegen. 
[9:38] Da rief ein Mann aus dem Haufen: "Meister, ich bitte dich, nimm dich meines Sohnes an; er ist mein einziges Kind! 
[9:39] Oft packt ihn ein böser Geist: dann schreit der Knabe plötzlich auf, ihm tritt Schaum vor den Mund, und er wird von dem Geist hin- und hergerissen; der weicht nur schwer von ihm und verzehrt seine Lebenskraft. 
[9:40] Ich habe deine Jünger gebeten, ihn auszutreiben; aber sie haben es nicht gekonnt." 
[9:41] Jesus antwortete: "Ihr ungläubige und verkehrte Art, wie lange soll ich bei euch sein und euch ertragen? Bring deinen Sohn hierher!" 
[9:42] Als der Knabe herankam, warf ihn der böse Geist zu Boden und zerrte ihn in allen seinen Gliedern. Aber Jesus bedrohte den unreinen Geist: so heilte er den Knaben und gab ihn seinem Vater wieder. 
[9:43] Da staunten alle über Gottes gewaltige Macht. Während sich die Leute über alle seine Taten verwunderten, sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: 
[9:44] "Merkt ihr recht auf die Worte, die ich euch jetzt sage: Der Menschensohn soll nun bald in der Menschen Hände überliefert werden." 
[9:45] Sie verstanden aber nicht, was er mit diesen Worten meinte; sie waren ihnen dunkel, so daß sie ihren Sinn nicht faßten. Aber sie scheuten sich, ihn um diesen Ausspruch näher zu befragen. 
[9:46] Einst unterhielten sie sich darüber, wer wohl der Größte unter ihnen sei. 
[9:47] Jesus, der die Gedanken ihres Herzens kannte, nahm ein kleines Kind bei der Hand, stellte es neben sich 
[9:48] und sprach zu ihnen: "Wer dies Kind aufnimmt, weil es meinen Namen bekennt, der nimmt mich auf. Und wer mich aufnimmt, der nimmt den auf, der mich gesandt hat. Wahrlich, der Kleinste unter euch allen — der ist der Größte." 
[9:49] Da nahm Johannes das Wort und sprach: "Meister, wir haben einen in deinem Namen böse Geister austreiben sehen; aber wir haben es ihm verboten, weil er dir nicht mit uns nachfolgt." 
[9:50] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Ihr hättet es ihm nicht verbieten sollen; denn wer nicht gegen euch ist, der ist für euch." 
[9:51] Als die Zeit herankam, wo er (diese Welt verlassen und in den Himmel) aufgenommen werden sollte, da war er fest entschlossen, nach Jerusalem zu ziehen. 
[9:52] Und er sandte Boten vor sich her. Die kamen in ein Dorf Samarias, um dort Unterkunft für ihn zu suchen. 
[9:53] Die Bewohner aber wollten ihn nicht aufnehmen, weil er auf der Wanderung nach Jerusalem war. 
[9:54] Da sprachen seine Jünger Jakobus und Johannes, die diese Abweisung erfahren hatten: "Herr, sollen wir befehlen, daß Feuer vom Himmel falle und sie verzehre (wie auch Elia getan hat)?" 
[9:55] Jesus aber wandte sich zu ihnen und wies sie ernst zurecht (indem er sagte: "Wißt ihr denn nicht, von welchem Geist ihr euch leiten lassen sollt? 
[9:56] Der Menschensohn ist nicht gekommen, um Menschenleben zu vernichten, sondern zu erretten"). 
[9:57] Sie gingen dann in ein anderes Dorf. Während ihrer Wanderung sagte einer zu ihm: "Ich will dir folgen, wohin du gehst." 
[9:58] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Die Füchse haben Höhlen, und die Vögel, die unter dem Himmel fliegen, haben Nester; aber der Menschensohn hat keine Stätte, wo er sein Haupt niederlegen kann." 
[9:59] Zu einem anderen sprach er: "Folge mir!" Der erwiderte: "Herr, erlaube mir, daß ich vorher hingehe und meinen Vater begrabe." 
[9:60] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Laß die Toten ihre Toten begraben; du aber geh und verkündige Gottes Königreich!" 
[9:61] Ein Dritter sprach: "Ich will dir folgen, Herr; vorher aber erlaube mir, von meinen Hausgenossen Abschied zu nehmen." 
[9:62] Ihm erwiderte Jesus: "Wer seine Hand an den Pflug gelegt hat und dann noch rückwärts blickt, der ist nicht tauglich für Gottes Königreich." 
[10:1] Hierauf erwählte der Herr noch siebzig andere (Jünger) und sandte sie zu zweien vor sich her in alle Städte und Ortschaften, die er später selbst besuchen wollte. 
[10:2] Er sprach zu ihnen: "Die Ernte ist groß, aber der Arbeiter sind wenig. Darum bittet den Herrn der Ernte, daß er Arbeiter auf sein Erntefeld sende! 
[10:3] So zieht denn aus! Ich sende euch jetzt wie Lämmer mitten unter Wölfe. 
[10:4] Nehmt keinen Geldbeutel, keinen Ranzen, keine Schuhe mit und grüßt niemand unterwegs! 
[10:5] Bei euerm Eintritt in ein Haus sei euer erstes Wort: 'Friede sei mit diesem Haus!' 
[10:6] Wohnt einer darin, der den Frieden liebt, so soll der Friede, den ihr wünscht, auf ihm ruhen; wenn nicht, so fällt der Friedensgruß auf euch zurück. 
[10:7] In jenem Haus bleibt dann, eßt und trinkt, was sie haben! Denn der Arbeiter ist seines Lohnes wert. Geht nicht von einem Haus in ein anderes! 
[10:8] Kommt ihr in eine Stadt und man nimmt euch auf, so eßt, was man euch vorsetzt! 
[10:9] Heilt die Kranken, die dort sind, und sagt den Bewohnern: 'Gottes Königreich ist euch genaht!' 
[10:10] Kommt ihr aber in eine Stadt und man nimmt euch nicht auf, so geht hinaus auf ihre freien Plätze und sprecht: 
[10:11] 'Sogar den Staub, der sich aus eurer Stadt an unsere Füße geheftet hat, den wischen wir ab, damit ihr ihn behaltet. Das eine aber sollt ihr wissen: Gottes Königreich ist nahe herbeigekommen!' 
[10:12] Ich sage euch: Es wird Sodom an jenem Tag erträglicher gehen als einer solchen Stadt. 
[10:13] Weh dir, Chorazin! Wehe dir, Bethsaida! Denn wären in Tyrus und Sidon die Wundertaten geschehen, die in euch geschehen sind, sie hätten sich schon längst, in Sack und Asche sitzend, bekehrt. 
[10:14] Doch es wird Tyrus und Sidon im Gericht erträglicher gehen als euch. 
[10:15] Und du, Kapernaum, meinst du vielleicht, du wirst bis zum Himmel erhoben? In die Tiefe der Unterwelt sollst du hinabgestürzt werden! 
[10:16] Wer euch hört, der hört mich; und wer euch verwirft, der verwirft mich. Wer aber mich verwirft, der verwirft den, der mich gesandt hat." 
[10:17] Bei ihrer Rückkehr berichteten die Siebzig voller Freude: "Herr, sogar die bösen Geister gehorchen uns, wenn wir deinen Namen aussprechen." 
[10:18] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ja, ich sah den Satan wie einen Blitz vom Himmel fallen. 
[10:19] Seht, ich habe euch die Macht verliehen, über Schlangen und Skorpione dahinzuschreiten und das ganze Heer des Feindes zu besiegen, so daß euch kein Schade treffen wird. 
[10:20] Doch freut euch nicht darüber, daß euch die Geister gehorchen; freut euch vielmehr darüber, daß eure Namen im Himmel eingetragen sind!" 
[10:21] In jener Stunde rief Jesus, erfüllt vom Heiligen Geist, in lautem Jubel aus: "Ich preise dich, o Vater, Herr des Himmels und der Erde, daß du dies den Weisen und Verständigen verborgen und es den Einfältigen offenbart hast. Ja, Vater, so hat dir's gefallen! 
[10:22] Alles ist mir von meinem Vater übergeben worden, und niemand weiß, wer der Sohn ist, als nur der Vater, und wer der Vater ist, als nur der Sohn und der, dem der Sohn es offenbaren will." 
[10:23] Dann sprach er, nur zu den Jüngern gewandt: "Selig sind die Augen, die das sehen, was ihr seht! 
[10:24] Denn ich sage euch: Viele Propheten und Könige haben gewünscht zu sehen, was ihr seht, und haben es nicht gesehen, und zu hören, was ihr hört, und haben es nicht gehört." 
[10:25] Da erhob sich ein Gesetzeslehrer, der ihm eine Falle stellen wollte, und fragte ihn: "Meister, was muß ich tun, um ewiges Leben zu erlangen?" 
[10:26] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Was steht im Gesetz geschrieben? Wie liest du dort?" 
[10:27] Er antwortete: "Du sollst den Herrn, deinen Gott, lieben mit ganzem Herzen, mit ganzer Seele, mit aller Kraft und mit allem Denken und deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst." 
[10:28] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Deine Antwort ist ganz richtig; tue das, so wirst du leben." 
[10:29] Doch der Gesetzeslehrer wollte sich (wegen seiner Frage) rechtfertigen und sprach deshalb zu Jesus: "Wer ist denn mein Nächster?" 
[10:30] Da erwiderte Jesus: "Ein Mann ging von Jerusalem hinab nach Jericho. Auf seiner Wanderung fiel er Räubern in die Hände. Die plünderten ihn aus, schlugen ihn blutig, ließen ihn halbtot liegen und gingen dann davon. 
[10:31] Nun kam zufällig ein Priester jenes Weges; der sah den Mann, aber er ging vorüber. 
[10:32] Ebenso kam ein Levit dorthin; der sah ihn und ging auch an ihm vorüber. 
[10:33] Dann kam ein Samariter, der auf Reisen war, an die Stätte. Als der den Mann erblickte, ward er von Mitgefühl ergriffen: 
[10:34] er trat hinzu, goß Öl und Wein in seine Wunden und verband sie ihm. Dann setzte er ihn auf sein Reittier, führte ihn in ein Gasthaus und pflegte ihn. 
[10:35] Am anderen Morgen zog er zwei Silberlinge aus seinem Beutel, gab sie dem Wirt und sagte: 'Pflege ihn; und was du sonst noch ausgibst, das will ich dir bei meiner Rückkehr ersetzen.' 
[10:36] Wer von diesen dreien hat nun nach deiner Meinung als Nächster an dem Mann gehandelt, der den Räubern in die Hände fiel?" 
[10:37] Der Gesetzeslehrer erwiderte: "Der Barmherzigkeit an ihm bewiesen hat." Da sprach Jesus zu ihm: "Geh hin und handle du ebenso!" 
[10:38] Als sie weiterwanderten, kam er in ein Dorf. Dort nahm ihn eine Frau mit Namen Martha in ihr Haus auf. 
[10:39] Sie hatte eine Schwester, die hieß Maria. Die lauschte, zu des Herrn Füßen sitzend, auf seine Unterweisung. 
[10:40] Martha aber machte sich viel zu schaffen, um ihn reichlich zu bewirten. Und sie trat zu Jesus und sprach: "Herr, kannst du es ruhig mitansehen, daß mich meine Schwester alles allein besorgen läßt? Sag ihr doch, sie solle mir helfen!" 
[10:41] Der Herr aber antwortete ihr: "Martha, Martha, du sorgst und mühst dich um vielerlei. 
[10:42] Aber nur wenig ist not. Denn Maria hat sich das beste Teil erwählt; das soll ihr nicht genommen werden." 
[11:1] Einst betete er an einem Ort. Als er damit zu Ende war, sprach einer seiner Jünger zu ihm: "Herr, lehre uns beten, wie auch Johannes seine Jünger es gelehrt hat." 
[11:2] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Wenn ihr betet, so sprecht: Vater, dein Name werde geheiligt! Dein Königreich komme! 
[11:3] Unser Brot für morgen gib uns Tag für Tag! 
[11:4] Und vergib uns unsere Sünden; denn auch wir vergeben jedem unserer Schuldner! Und führe uns nicht in Versuchung!" 
[11:5] Dann fuhr er fort: "Denkt euch: einer von euch hat einen Freund. Zu dem kommt er um Mitternacht mit der Bitte: 'Freund, leihe mir drei Brote; 
[11:6] ein Freund von mir ist auf der Reise bei mir eingekehrt, und ich habe ihm nichts vorzusetzen.' 
[11:7] Jener antwortet ihm nun von drinnen: 'Laß mich in Ruhe; die Tür ist schon verschlossen, und meine Kinder sind mit mir zu Bett gegangen. Ich kann nicht aufstehen und dir etwas geben.' 
[11:8] Ich sage euch: Steht er auch nicht deshalb auf und gibt ihm Brot, weil es sein Freund ist, so wird er doch, weil der andere ihm so zusetzt, aus seinem Bett aufstehen und ihm geben, soviel er nötig hat. 
[11:9] Darum sage ich euch auch: Bittet, so wird euch gegeben! Sucht, so werdet ihr finden! Klopft an, so wird euch aufgetan! 
[11:10] Denn wer bittet, der empfängt, wer sucht, der findet, und wer anklopft, dem wird aufgetan. 
[11:11] Wer von euch bittet seinen Vater um Brot, und der gibt ihm einen Stein? oder um einen Fisch, und er reicht ihm statt des Fisches eine Schlange? 
[11:12] Oder wer bittet seinen Vater um ein Ei, und der reicht ihm statt dessen einen Skorpion? 
[11:13] Wißt ihr nun, obwohl ihr böse seid, euern Kindern gute Gaben zu geben: wieviel mehr wird da der Vater vom Himmel her den Heiligen Geist denen geben, die ihn darum bitten!" 
[11:14] Eines Tages trieb er einen bösen Geist aus, der war stumm. Als der böse Geist ausgefahren war, konnte der Stumme sprechen. Da waren die Leute verwundert. 
[11:15] Einige aber von ihnen sagten: "Im Bunde mit Beelzebul, dem Obersten der bösen Geister, treibt er die Teufel aus." 
[11:16] Andere, die ihn aushorchen wollten, verlangten von ihm, er möge vom Himmel her ein Wunderzeichen kommen lassen. 
[11:17] Er aber durchschaute ihre Gedanken und sprach zu ihnen: "Jedes Reich, das in sich selbst uneins ist, das fällt in Trümmer: ein Haus stürzt auf das andere. 
[11:18] Ist nun auch der Satan mit sich selbst uneins, wie sollte da sein Reich bestehen können? Ihr sagt ja, ich treibe die bösen Geister aus im Bund mit Beelzebul. 
[11:19] Treibe ich nun im Bunde mit Beelzebul die bösen Geister aus, mit wessen Hilfe treiben sie denn eure Anhänger aus? Sie werden darum eure Richter sein. 
[11:20] Treibe ich aber durch Gottes Finger die bösen Geister aus, so ist ja Gottes Königreich zu euch gekommen. 
[11:21] Solange ein starker Kriegsmann in voller Waffenwehr seine Burg bewacht, ist sein Besitz in Sicherheit. 
[11:22] Wenn aber ein Stärkerer ihn überfällt und überwindet, so nimmt er ihm seine Rüstung, worauf er sich verließ, und teilt die Beute, die er gewonnen, unter seine Kampfgenossen aus. 
[11:23] Wer nicht mit mir ist, der ist gegen mich; und wer nicht mit mir sammelt, der zerstreut. 
[11:24] Ist der unreine Geist von einem Menschen ausgefahren, so wandert er durch Wüsten: er sucht dort eine Ruhstatt und findet keine. Dann spricht er: 'Ich will zurückgehen in mein Haus, das ich verlassen habe.' 
[11:25] Und kommt er dann, so findet er's gefegt und wohlgeschmückt. 
[11:26] Nun geht er hin und holt noch sieben andere Geister, die schlimmer sind als er: die ziehen ein und wohnen dort. So wird's mit einem solchen Menschen am Ende ärger als zuvor." 
[11:27] Als er so redete, rief ein Weib aus der Menge mit lauter Stimme: "Heil dem Schoß, der dich getragen! Heil der Brust, die dich genährt!" 
[11:28] Er aber sprach: "Jawohl, Heil denen, die Gottes Wort hören und es halten!" 
[11:29] Als sich die Leute um ihn scharten, fing er an zu reden: "Das gegenwärtige Geschlecht ist ein böses Geschlecht. Es begehrt ein Zeichen. Es wird ihm aber kein anderes Zeichen gegeben werden als das Zeichen Jonas. 
[11:30] Denn wie Jona den Bewohnern Ninives ein Zeichen wurde, ebenso wird auch der Menschensohn für dies Geschlecht ein Zeichen sein. 
[11:31] Die Königin aus Süden wird zugleich mit den Leuten dieses Geschlechts vor Gericht erscheinen und sie verurteilen; denn sie kam vom Ende der Erde, um Salomos Weisheit zu hören. Und hier steht doch einer, der größer ist als Salomo! 
[11:32] Die Leute aus Ninive werden zugleich mit diesem Geschlecht vor Gericht erscheinen und es verurteilen; denn sie bekehrten sich bei Jonas Predigt. Und hier steht doch einer, der größer ist als Jona! 
[11:33] Niemand zündet eine Lampe an und stellt sie dann in einen Keller oder unter einen Scheffel; sondern er setzt sie auf den Leuchter, damit alle, die eintreten, den Lichtglanz sehen. 
[11:34] Die Leuchte deines Leibes ist dein Auge. Ist dein Auge gesund, so ist auch dein ganzer Leib im Licht; ist es aber krank, so ist auch dein Leib in Finsternis. 
[11:35] Gib deshalb acht, daß nicht das Licht in dir verfinstert sei! 
[11:36] Wenn nun dein ganzer Leib vom Licht durchdrungen ist, so daß kein Teil an ihm verfinstert bleibt, dann wird er so nach allen Seiten hin erleuchtet werden, als wenn die Lampe dich mit ihrem hellen Schein bestrahlt." 
[11:37] Kaum hatte Jesus ausgeredet, da lud ihn ein Pharisäer zum Frühmahl ein. Jesus trat in des Pharisäers Haus und nahm am Tisch Platz. 
[11:38] Der Pharisäer aber war verwundert, als er sah, daß sich Jesus vor dem Essen nicht erst die Hände wusch. 
[11:39] Da sprach der Herr zu ihm: "Ja, ja, ihr Pharisäer! Ihr haltet Becher und Schüsseln von außen rein, doch drinnen in euern Herzen seid ihr voll Raubgier und Bosheit. 
[11:40] Ihr Toren, hat nicht derselbe, der das Äußere geschaffen, auch das Innere gebildet? 
[11:41] Gebt nur, was sich in euern Bechern und Schüsseln findet, als Almosen! Dann ist euch alles rein. 
[11:42] Doch weh euch Pharisäern! Minze, Raute und alle anderen Küchenkräuter verzehntet ihr. Aber recht zu handeln und Gott zu lieben: daran geht ihr vorüber. Doch gerade dies solltet ihr tun, aber auch jenes nicht unterlassen. 
[11:43] Weh euch, ihr Pharisäer! Ihr wollt in der gottesdienstlichen Versammlung die Ehrenplätze haben, und auf den Straßen soll man euch voll Ehrfurcht grüßen. 
[11:44] Weh euch! Ihr gleicht verdeckten Gräbern, über die man hingeht, ohne es zu merken." 
[11:45] Da nahm einer der anwesenden Gesetzeslehrer das Wort und sprach zu ihm: "Meister, mit diesen Worten beleidigst du auch uns." 
[11:46] Jesus erwiderte: "Weh auch euch Gesetzeslehrern! Denn ihr legt den Leuten Lasten auf, die sie nicht tragen können; aber ihr selbst rührt diese Lasten mit keinem Finger an. 
[11:47] Weh euch! Ihr erbaut den Propheten Grabdenkmäler, und eure Väter haben sie getötet. 
[11:48] Ihr seid darum Zeugen für die Taten eurer Väter und billigt sie; denn jene haben die Propheten getötet, und ihr errichtet ihnen Bauten. 
[11:49] Deshalb hat Gottes Weisheit auch gesprochen: 'Propheten und Apostel will ich ihnen senden; doch sie werden einige von ihnen töten und verfolgen, 
[11:50] damit das Blut aller Propheten, das seit Anbeginn der Welt vergossen ist 
[11:51] - von dem Blut Abels an bis auf das Blut Sacharjas, der zwischen dem Altar und dem Tempelhaus getötet worden ist —, von dem gegenwärtigen Geschlecht gefordert werde.' Ja, ich sage euch: Es soll gefordert werden von dem gegenwärtigen Geschlecht! 
[11:52] Weh euch Gesetzeslehrern! Ihr habt den Schlüssel zur Erkenntnis weggenommen. Ihr selbst seid nicht hineingegangen, und alle, die hineingehen wollten, habt ihr daran gehindert." 
[11:53] Als er von dort weggegangen war, begannen ihm die Schriftgelehrten und die Pharisäer sehr heftig zu grollen und ihn über manches auszufragen. 
[11:54] Dabei waren sie auf der Lauer, ob sie vielleicht ein unbedachtes Wort aus seinem Mund erhaschen könnten. 
[12:1] Inzwischen hatten sich Tausende von Menschen angesammelt; die drängten sich so sehr, daß sie einander traten. Da begann er zuerst zu seinen Jünger zu sagen: "Vor allem hütet euch vor dem Sauerteig der Pharisäer; damit meine ich: hütet euch vor der Heuchelei! 
[12:2] Denn nichts ist so verhüllt, daß es nicht einst enthüllt würde; und nichts ist so verborgen, daß es nicht einst gesehen würde. 
[12:3] Deshalb wird alles, was ihr im geheimen geredet habt, dereinst ganz öffentlich vernommen werden; und was ihr in den Kammern ins Ohr geflüstert habt, das soll auf den Dächern verkündigt werden. 
[12:4] Euch aber, meinen Freunden, sage ich: Fürchtet euch nicht vor denen, die den Leib töten und die danach nichts weiter tun können! 
[12:5] Ich will euch sagen, vor wem ihr euch zu fürchten habt: Fürchtet euch vor dem, der die Macht besitzt, nicht nur zu töten, sondern auch in die Hölle zu werfen! Ja, ich sage euch: Den fürchtet! 
[12:6] Verkauft man nicht fünf Sperlinge für zehn Pfennige? Trotzdem ist keiner von ihnen bei Gott vergessen. 
[12:7] Nun sind aber sogar die Haare auf euerm Haupt allesamt gezählt. Habt keine Furcht! Ihr seid mehr wert als viele Sperlinge. 
[12:8] Ferner sage ich euch: Wer sich zu mir bekennt vor den Menschen, zu dem wird sich der Menschensohn auch bekennen vor den Engeln Gottes. 
[12:9] Wer mich aber verleugnet vor den Menschen, der soll auch verleugnet werden vor den Engeln Gottes. 
[12:10] Wer ein Wort sagt gegen den Menschensohn, der wird Vergebung finden; wer aber eine Lästerung ausspricht gegen den Heiligen Geist, der findet keine Vergebung. 
[12:11] Führt man euch nun vor die Gemeindegerichte und vor die Obrigkeiten und Behörden, so macht euch keine Sorge, wie ihr euch verteidigen und was ihr sagen sollt. 
[12:12] Denn der Heilige Geist wird euch in jenem Augenblick die rechten Worte geben." 
[12:13] Einer aus dem Volk sprach zu ihm: "Meister, sage doch meinem Bruder, er solle das Erbe mit mir teilen." 
[12:14] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Mensch, wer hat mich zum Richter oder Schiedsmann über euch bestellt?" 
[12:15] Dann wandte er sich an alle und sprach: "Nehmt euch in acht und hütet euch vor aller Habsucht! Denn so reich auch jemand ist, sein Leben kann er sich nicht sichern durch seine Güter." 
[12:16] Nun trug er ihnen dieses Gleichnis vor: "Die Felder eines reichen Mannes hatten viel getragen. 
[12:17] Da dachte er bei sich: 'Was soll ich tun? Ich habe keinen Platz, wo ich meine Ernte unterbringen kann.' 
[12:18] Dann sprach er: 'So will ich's machen: ich lasse meine Speicher niederreißen und größere bauen. Dort bringe ich die ganze Ernte und meine andere Habe unter 
[12:19] und sage dann zu meiner Seele: Liebe Seele, du hast auf viele Jahre reichen Vorrat; nun ruhe, iß und trink und freue dich des Lebens!' 
[12:20] Gott aber sprach zu ihm: 'Du Tor! Diese Nacht noch soll dir deine Seele abgefordert werden. Was bleibt dir dann von allem, was du dir aufgespeichert hast?' 
[12:21] So geht es einem, der sich Schätze sammelt und ist dabei nicht reich für Gott." 
[12:22] Dann wandte er sich an seine Jünger mit den Worten: "Darum sage ich euch: Sorgt nicht ängstlich für euer Leben, was ihr essen sollt, auch nicht für euern Leib, was ihr anziehen sollt! 
[12:23] Denn das Leben ist mehr wert als die Nahrung, und der Leib steht höher als die Kleidung. 
[12:24] Seht die Raben an! Sie säen nicht, sie ernten nicht, sie haben keine Vorratskammer oder Speicher; trotzdem ernährt sie Gott. Wieviel höher steht ihr als die Vögel! 
[12:25] Wer von euch kann mit all seinem Sorgen sein Leben auch nur um eine kurze Spanne Zeit verlängern? 
[12:26] Vermögt ihr nun nicht einmal das Geringste, was macht ihr euch da Sorge um das andere? 
[12:27] Seht die wilden Lilien an! Sie spinnen nicht und weben nicht. Und doch — das sage ich euch — ist selbst Salomo in all seiner (königlichen) Pracht nicht so (herrlich) gekleidet gewesen wie eine von ihnen. 
[12:28] Wenn Gott nun das Gras auf dem Feld, das heute noch in Blüte steht und morgen in den Ofen geworfen wird, so herrlich kleidet, wie wird er da vielmehr euch Kleidung geben, ihr Kleingläubigen! 
[12:29] Darum sollt ihr nicht ängstlich fragen nach Speise und Trank. Seid deshalb ohne Bangen! 
[12:30] Denn das sind lauter Fragen, womit sich die Heiden hier in der Welt beschäftigen. Euer Vater weiß ja, daß ihr dies nötig habt. 
[12:31] Trachtet nur nach seinem Königreich; dann soll euch dies daneben auch zuteil werden. 
[12:32] Sei ohne Furcht, du kleine Herde! Denn euerm Vater hat's gefallen, euch das Königreich zu geben. 
[12:33] Verkauft eure Habe und gebt sie hin als Almosen! Macht euch Geldbeutel, die nicht veralten: erwerbt euch einen unerschöpflichen Schatz im Himmel, wo kein Dieb Zugang findet, wo keine Motte Zerstörung übt! 
[12:34] Denn wo euer Schatz ist, da ist auch euer Herz. 
[12:35] Seid umgürtet an euern Hüften und erhaltet eure Lampen brennend! 
[12:36] Denn ihr sollt Leuten gleichen, die auf die Rückkehr ihres Herrn von einer Hochzeit warten und ihm sofort zu öffnen haben, wenn er bei seiner Ankunft an die Tür klopft. 
[12:37] Wohl den Knechten, die der Herr bei seinem Kommen wachend findet! Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Er wird sich gürten, sie zu Tisch führen und dann herumgehen, um sie zu bedienen. 
[12:38] Mag er in der zweiten, mag er erst in der dritten Nachtwache kommen: wohl ihnen, wenn er sie so findet! 
[12:39] Das seht ihr ein: wenn ein Hausherr wüßte, zu welcher Stunde der Dieb käme, so (bliebe er wach und) ließe nicht in sein Haus einbrechen. 
[12:40] So haltet auch ihr euch immerfort bereit; denn der Menschensohn kommt zu einer Stunde, da ihr es nicht vermutet!" 
[12:41] Da sprach Petrus: "Herr, gilt dies Gleichnis nur uns oder auch allen anderen?" 
[12:42] Der Herr antwortete: "Wäre doch jeder Verwalter treu und klug, den ein Herr über seine Dienerschaft setzt, damit er jedem seine Speise gebe zu rechter Zeit! 
[12:43] Wohl dem Knecht, den der Herr bei seiner Rückkehr also tätig findet! 
[12:44] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Er wird ihn über alle seine Güter setzen. 
[12:45] Denkt aber jener Knecht in seinem Herzen: 'Mein Herr bleibt noch lange weg'; fängt er dann an, die Knechte und die Mägde zu mißhandeln, auch zu schmausen, zu zechen und sich zu berauschen: 
[12:46] so wird sein Herr ihn überraschen an einem Tag, wo er's nicht vermutet, und zu einer Stunde, wo er's nicht erwartet. Dann wird er ihn blutig peitschen lassen und ihn an den Ort verweisen, wo die Treulosen sind. 
[12:47] Ein Knecht, der seines Herrn Willen kennt und trotzdem nicht nach seinem Willen alles vorbereitet und besorgt, soll viele Streiche leiden. 
[12:48] Wer aber nicht des Herrn Willen kennt und etwas tut, wofür er Züchtigung verdient, der soll die Peitsche nur wenig fühlen. Wer viel empfangen hat, von dem wird auch viel gefordert; und wem viel anvertraut worden ist, von dem wird um so mehr verlangt. 
[12:49] Ich bin gekommen, um Feuer auf die Erde zu schleudern. O, was wünschte ich mehr, als daß es schon brennte! 
[12:50] Zuvor aber muß ich eine Taufe erleiden. Und wie sehne ich mich danach, daß sie vollzogen werde! 
[12:51] Meint ihr, ich sei gekommen, um Frieden zu stiften auf Erden? Nein, sage ich euch, sondern Zwietracht. 
[12:52] Denn von nun an werden fünf, die in demselben Haus wohnen, in Zwietracht miteinander leben: drei werden stehen gegen zwei und zwei gegen drei. 
[12:53] Der Vater wird in Feindschaft leben mit dem Sohn und der Sohn mit dem Vater, die Mutter mit der Tochter und die Tochter mit der Mutter, die Schwiegermutter mit der Schwiegertochter und die Schwiegertochter mit der Schwiegermutter." 
[12:54] Dann sprach er zu dem Volk: "Seht ihr Gewölk im Westen aufsteigen, so sagt ihr alsbald: 'Es gibt Regen', und so geschieht es auch. 
[12:55] Und weht ein Südwind, so sagt ihr: 'Es wird heiß', und so trifft's ein. 
[12:56] Ihr Heuchler, das Aussehen der Erde und des Himmels versteht ihr zu deuten; wie kommt es denn, daß ihr die Zeit, worin ihr lebt, nicht deuten könnt? 
[12:57] Warum könnt ihr nicht auch von selbst zu einem rechten Urteil kommen? 
[12:58] Wenn du mit deinem Gläubiger vor Gericht gehst, so gib dir noch unterwegs Mühe, dich gütlich mit ihm abzufinden. Sonst könnte er dich vor den Richter schleppen, und der Richter würde dich dann dem Gerichtsvollzieher übergeben, und der Gerichtsvollzieher wird dich ins Schuldgefängnis werfen. 
[12:59] Ich sage dir: Du kommst dort nicht eher heraus, als bis du den letzten Heller bezahlt hast." 
[13:1] Zu der Zeit kamen einige Leute zu Jesus und erzählten ihm von den Galiläern, die Pilatus bei ihrem Opfer hatte niederhauen lassen. 
[13:2] Da sagte er zu ihnen: "Meint ihr, diese Galiläer seien größere Sünder gewesen als alle anderen Galiläer, weil sie ein solches Ende genommen haben? 
[13:3] Nein, sage ich euch; sondern wenn ihr euch nicht bessert, werdet ihr alle ebenso schrecklich umkommen. 
[13:4] Meint ihr ferner, jene achtzehn, auf die der Turm am Teich von Siloah fiel und sie erschlug, seinen ärgere Missetäter gewesen als alle anderen Leute in Jerusalem? 
[13:5] Nein, sage ich euch; sondern wenn ihr euch nicht bessert, werdet ihr alle ebenso furchtbar umkommen." 
[13:6] Er erzählte ihnen dann dies Gleichnis: "Jemand hatte einen Feigenbaum in seinem Weinberg stehen. Er kam nun und suchte Frucht daran, doch fand er keine. 
[13:7] Da sprach er zu dem Weingärtner: 'Jetzt komme ich schon drei Jahre und suche Frucht an diesem Feigenbaum und finde keine. Haue ihn ab; warum soll er noch den Platz wegnehmen?' 
[13:8] Aber der Weingärtner erwiderte: 'Herr, laß ihn auch dieses Jahr noch stehen; ich will erst noch einmal rings um ihn her das Land umgraben und düngen. 
[13:9] Vielleicht trägt er dann künftig doch noch Frucht. Wo nicht, so laß ihn umhauen!'" 
[13:10] Einst lehrte er am Sabbat in einem Versammlungshaus. 
[13:11] Dort war eine Frau, die von einem (bösen) Geist zu leiden hatte, der sie schon achtzehn Jahre lang mit Krankheit plagte: sie war dadurch verkrümmt und nicht imstande, sich völlig gerade aufzurichten. 
[13:12] Als Jesus sie erblickte, rief er sie zu sich und sprach zu ihr: "Weib, du bist von deiner Krankheit frei." 
[13:13] Dann legte er ihr die Hände auf. Sofort ward sie wieder gerade und pries Gott. 
[13:14] Der Gemeindevorsteher aber war darüber ungehalten, daß Jesus am Sabbat heilte, und darum sprach er zu den Leuten: "Sechs Wochentage gibt's, an denen man arbeiten soll; da kommt und laßt euch heilen, doch nicht am Sabbattag!" 
[13:15] Darauf erwiderte der Herr: "Ihr Heuchler, bindet nicht ein jeder unter euch am Sabbat seinen Ochsen oder Esel von der Krippe los und führt ihn hin zur Tränke? 
[13:16] Und da sollte diese Frau, eine Tochter Abrahams, die der Satan nun schon achtzehn Jahre lang gebunden hat, nicht am Sabbattag von ihrer Fessel befreit werden dürfen?" 
[13:17] Bei diesen Worten schämten sich alle seine Widersacher; das ganze Volk aber freute sich über alle seine herrlichen Taten. 
[13:18] Dann sprach er: "Wem ist das Königreich Gottes gleich, und unter welchem Bild soll ich's darstellen? 
[13:19] Es ist wie ein Senfkorn, das einer nimmt und in seinen Garten sät; das wächst und wird zu einem großen Baum, und die Vögel des Himmels nisten in seinen Zweigen." 
[13:20] Ferner sagte er: "Unter welchem Bild soll ich das Königreich Gottes darstellen? 
[13:21] Es ist wie ein Sauerteig, den eine Frau nimmt und ihn so lange in drei Scheffel Weizenmehl knetet, bis der ganze Teig durchsäuert ist." 
[13:22] So wanderte er, die Leute lehrend, von Stadt zu Stadt, von Dorf zu Dorf und zog weiter nach Jerusalem. 
[13:23] Einst fragte ihn jemand: "Herr, soll wirklich nur eine kleine Schar gerettet werden?" Da sprach er zu den Anwesenden: 
[13:24] "Setzt alle Kraft daran, durch die enge Pforte einzugehen! Denn viele, das sage ich euch, werden in das Haus zu kommen suchen und es doch nicht können. 
[13:25] Hat sich der Hausherr erhoben und die Tür verschlossen, und ihr klopft dann erst draußen an die Tür und ruft: 'Herr, tue uns auf!', so wird er euch antworten: 'Ihr gehört nicht hierher.' 
[13:26] Dann werdet ihr anfangen zu sagen: 'Wir haben doch vor deinen Augen gegessen und getrunken, und auf unseren öffentlichen Plätzen hast du uns belehrt!' 
[13:27] Er aber wird euch erwidern: 'Ich wiederhole: ihr gehört nicht hierher; weicht von mir, all ihr Übeltäter!' 
[13:28] Da wird lautes Klagen und Zähneknirschen sein, wenn ihr seht, wie Abraham, Isaak und Jakob und die Propheten alle im Königreich Gottes sind, während ihr hinausgewiesen werdet. 
[13:29] Von Ost und West, von Nord und Süd werden die Leute kommen und sich im Königreich Gottes zum Mahl niederlassen. 
[13:30] Denn solche, die jetzt die Letzten sind, werden die Ersten sein, und solche, die jetzt die Ersten sind, werden die Letzten sein." 
[13:31] Zu der Stunde traten einige Pharisäer zu ihm und sagten: "Geh weg aus dieser Gegend, denn Herodes will dich töten lassen!" 
[13:32] Er antwortete ihnen: "Geht hin und meldet diesem Fuchs: Sieh, heute noch und morgen treibe ich böse Geister aus und heile Kranke, und erst übermorgen bin ich damit fertig. 
[13:33] Freilich muß ich heute und auch morgen noch und übermorgen wandern; denn es ist undenkbar, daß ein Prophet anderswo als in Jerusalem ums Leben komme. 
[13:34] Jerusalem, Jerusalem, du tötest die Propheten und steinigst Gottes Boten! Wie oft habe ich deine Kinder um mich sammeln wollen, wie eine Henne ihre Küchlein unter ihre Flügel sammelt! Doch ihr habt nicht gewollt! 
[13:35] Darum soll euch euer Haus verlorengehen. Ich sage euch: Ihr sollt mich nicht mehr sehen, bis einst die Zeit kommt, da ihr ruft: Gesegnet sei, der da kommt im Namen des Herrn!" 
[14:1] An einem Sabbat ging er in das Haus eines Gemeindevorstehers, der zu den Pharisäern gehörte, um an einem Mahl teilzunehmen. Alle Tischgenossen sahen scharf auf ihn. 
[14:2] Plötzlich stand ein Wassersüchtiger vor ihm. 
[14:3] Da nahm Jesus das Wort und sprach zu den Gesetzeslehrern und Pharisäern: "Darf man am Sabbat heilen oder nicht?" 
[14:4] Sie schwiegen. Nun faßte er den Kranken bei der Hand, heilte ihn und ließ ihn gehen. 
[14:5] Dann fragte er die Versammelten: "Zieht nicht jeder unter euch, dem am Sabbattag sein Esel oder sein Ochs in einen Brunnen fällt, ihn ohne weiteres sofort heraus?" 
[14:6] Darauf konnten sie keine Antwort geben. 
[14:7] Als er bemerkte, wie sich die geladenen Gäste nach den ersten Plätzen drängten, trug er ihnen ein Gleichnis vor: 
[14:8] "Wenn dich jemand zu einem Hochzeitsmahl lädt, so setze dich nicht obenan! Es könnte einer geladen sein, der vornehmer wäre als du. 
[14:9] Dann käme der Gastgeber, der euch beide geladen hat, und spräche zu dir: 'Mache diesem Platz!' Und du müßtest nun beschämt untenan sitzen. 
[14:10] Wirst du geladen, so gehe vielmehr und setze dich untenan! Dann wird der Gastgeber kommen und dich auffordern: 'Freund, rücke weiter hinauf!' Das wird dir eine Ehre sein vor allen deinen Tischgenossen. 
[14:11] Denn wer sich selbst erhöht, der soll erniedrigt werden; und wer sich selbst erniedrigt, der soll erhöht werden." 
[14:12] Zu dem Gastgeber sprach er dann: "Richtest du ein Mahl aus am Mittag oder Abend, so lade nicht deine Freunde, deine Brüder, deine Verwandten und deine reichen Nachbarn dazu ein! Die laden dich sonst wieder ein, und so wird dir Gleiches mit Gleichem vergolten. 
[14:13] Sondern wenn du jemand bewirten willst, so rufe Arme, Krüppel, Lahme und Blinde zu deiner Tafel! 
[14:14] Dann bist du glücklich zu preisen; denn diese Leute können es dir nicht wiedervergelten. Es soll dir aber vergolten werden bei der Auferstehung der Gerechten." 
[14:15] Bei diesen Worten sprach einer von den Gästen zu ihm: "Heil dem, der einst teilnehmen darf an dem Mahl in Gottes Königreich!" 
[14:16] Darauf versetzte Jesus: "Jemand wollte eine große Abendmahlzeit geben und lud viele dazu ein. 
[14:17] Als dann der Tag des Mahles kam, sandte er seinen Knecht zu den geladenen Gästen mit der Botschaft: 'Kommt, es ist nun angerichtet!' 
[14:18] Da begannen alle ohne Ausnahme sich zu entschuldigen. Der erste sprach zu ihm: 'Ich habe einen Acker gekauft und muß notwendig hingehen und ihn besichtigen; ich bitte dich: sieh mich als entschuldigt an.' 
[14:19] Ein anderer sagte: 'Ich habe fünf Paar Ochsen gekauft und will nun gerade hingehen, um sie mir anzusehen; ich bitte dich: sieh mich als entschuldigt an.' 
[14:20] Ein dritter sprach: 'Ich habe mich eben verheiratet; darum kann ich nicht kommen.' 
[14:21] Der Knecht kam zurück und meldete das alles seinem Herrn. Da ward der Hausherr zornig und sprach zu seinem Knecht: 'Lauf schnell auf die Plätze und Straßen der Stadt und bring die Armen, die Krüppel, die Blinden und Lahmen her!' 
[14:22] Der Knecht berichtete dann: 'Herr, dein Befehl ist ausgeführt; aber es ist noch Platz vorhanden.' 
[14:23] Da sprach der Herr zu dem Knecht: 'Geh auf die Feldwege und an die Zäune und rede den Leuten, die dort sind, eindringlich zu hierherzukommen, damit mein Haus sich fülle!' 
[14:24] Denn das sage ich euch: Keiner von den Männern, die zuerst geladen waren, soll mein Mahl genießen." 
[14:25] Große Scharen folgten ihm auf seiner Wanderung. An die wandte er sich mit den Worten: 
[14:26] "Wer zu mir kommt und nicht aufgibt Vater und Mutter, Weib und Kinder, Brüder und Schwestern, dazu sein eigenes Leben, der kann nicht mein Jünger sein. 
[14:27] Wer nicht sein Kreuz trägt und mir nachfolgt, der kann nicht mein Jünger sein. 
[14:28] Will einer von euch einen Turm bauen, setzt er sich dann nicht erst hin und berechnet die Kosten, damit er wisse, ob er auch die Mittel hat, den Bau ganz auszuführen? 
[14:29] Es könnte sonst geschehen, daß er nach der Grundlegung nicht imstande wäre, das Werk zu vollenden. Dann aber würden alle, die es sehen, anfangen, über ihn zu spotten 
[14:30] und zu sagen: 'Dieser Mensch hat einen Bau begonnen, aber er hat ihn nicht zu Ende führen können.' 
[14:31] Oder wenn ein König mit einem anderen König Krieg anfangen will, setzt er sich dann nicht erst hin und überlegt, ob er imstande ist, mit zehntausend Mann dem die Spitze zu bieten, der gegen ihn rückt mit zwanzigtausend? 
[14:32] Wo nicht, so schickt er eine Gesandtschaft an ihn, solange er noch fern ist, und sucht Friedensverhandlungen einzuleiten. 
[14:33] So kann auch keiner von euch mein Jünger sein, der nicht auf alles, was er hat, verzichtet. 
[14:34] Das Salz ist etwas Gutes. Wird aber das Salz fade, womit soll man ihm dann seine Würzkraft wiedergeben? 
[14:35] Es ist weder für das Land noch für den Düngerhaufen brauchbar; man wirft es weg. Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre!" 
[15:1] Überall pflegten sich die Zöllner und andere verrufene Leute an ihn heranzudrängen, um ihn zu hören. 
[15:2] Darüber waren die Pharisäer und die Schriftgelehrten unwillig. "Dieser Mann", so sprachen sie, "verkehrt ja mit offenbaren Sündern und läßt sich sogar von ihnen zu Tisch laden." 
[15:3] Darauf antwortete ihnen Jesus durch dies Gleichnis: 
[15:4] "Wenn einer von euch hundert Schafe hat und eins davon kommt ihm abhanden, läßt er dann nicht die neunundneunzig auf der Weide und sucht nach dem verirrten, bis er's findet? 
[15:5] Und hat er es gefunden, so nimmt er's voller Freude auf seine Schulter. 
[15:6] Kommt er dann nach Hause, so ruft er seine Freunde und Nachbarn zusammen und spricht zu ihnen: 'Freut euch mit mir, denn ich habe mein verirrtes Schaf wiedergefunden.' 
[15:7] Ich sage euch: Ebenso ist auch im Himmel über einen einzigen Sünder, der von seinem Irrweg umkehrt, größere Freude als über neunundneunzig Gerechte, die keine Bekehrung nötig haben. 
[15:8] Oder wenn eine Frau zehn Silberlinge hat und sie verliert einen, zündet sie dann nicht ein Licht an und kehrt das Haus und sucht mit Sorgfalt, bis sie ihn findet? 
[15:9] Und hat sie ihn gefunden, so ruft sie ihre Freundinnen und Nachbarinnen zusammen und spricht: 'Freut euch mit mir, denn ich habe den verlorenen Silberling wiedergefunden.' 
[15:10] Ebenso, sage ich euch, herrscht Freude bei den Engeln Gottes über einen einzigen Sünder, der sich bekehrt." 
[15:11] Weiter sprach er: "Ein Mann hatte zwei Söhne. 
[15:12] Der jüngste sprach zu seinem Vater: 'Vater, gib mir das Erbteil, das mir zukommt.' Da teilte der Vater das Vermögen unter sie. 
[15:13] Bald darauf nahm der jüngste Sohn all sein Gut zusammen und zog in ein fernes Land. Dort brachte er sein Vermögen in einem liederlichen Leben durch. 
[15:14] Als er alles ausgegeben hatte, entstand in jenem Land eine schwere Hungersnot. Da fing er an zu darben. 
[15:15] Er ging hin und trat in Dienst bei einem Bürger jenes Landes. Der schickte ihn auf seine Felder, um die Schweine zu hüten. 
[15:16] Da hätte er sich gern sattgegessen an den Schoten, die die Schweine fraßen; doch niemand gab sie ihm. 
[15:17] Da kam er zur Besinnung und sprach: 'Wieviel Tagelöhner meines Vaters haben Brot im Überfluß, und ich muß hier verhungern! 
[15:18] Ich will mich aufmachen und zu meinem Vater gehen und zu ihm sagen: 'Vater, ich habe gesündigt gegen den Himmel und wider dich; 
[15:19] ich bin nicht mehr wert, dein Sohn zu heißen; behandle mich wie einen deiner Tagelöhner.' 
[15:20] Er machte sich nun auf den Weg zu seinem Vater. Als er noch weit entfernt war, sah ihn schon sein Vater kommen, und voll Mitleid eilte er ihm entgegen, fiel ihm um den Hals und küßte ihn. 
[15:21] Da sprach der Sohn zu ihm: 'Vater, ich habe gesündigt gegen den Himmel und wider dich; ich bin nicht mehr wert, dein Sohn zu heißen.' 
[15:22] Doch der Vater befahl seinen Knechten: 'Holt schnell ein Festgewand — das allerbeste — und legt's ihm an; steckt einen Ring an seine Hand und zieht ihm Schuhe an die Füße! 
[15:23] Dann holt das Mastkalb her und schlachtet es: laßt uns ein Festmahl halten und fröhlich sein! 
[15:24] Denn dieser mein Sohn war tot und ist wieder lebendig geworden, er war verloren und ist wiedergefunden worden.' Und sie begannen ein Freudenmahl. 
[15:25] Der älteste Sohn war gerade auf dem Feld. Als er nun heimkam und sich dem Haus näherte, hörte er Spiel und Tanz. 
[15:26] Da rief er einen von den Knechten und fragte ihn, was das bedeute. 
[15:27] Der sagte ihm: 'Dein Bruder ist zurückgekommen; da hat dein Vater das Mastkalb geschlachtet, weil er ihn gesund wiederhat.' 
[15:28] Da ward er zornig und wollte nicht hineingehen. Da kam sein Vater heraus und redete ihm zu. 
[15:29] Er aber antwortete dem Vater: 'So viele Jahre schon diene ich dir wie ein leibeigener Knecht, und nie habe ich gegen dein Gebot gehandelt. Doch noch kein einzigmal hast du mir einen jungen Ziegenbock geschenkt, damit ich ein frohes Mahl mit meinen Freunden hielte. 
[15:30] Jetzt aber, wo dieser dein Sohn heimkommt, der dein Hab und Gut im Verkehr mit Dirnen vergeudet hat, da hast du ihm das Mastkalb schlachten lassen.' 
[15:31] Der Vater sprach zu ihm: 'Mein Kind, du bist ja immer bei mir, und alles, was mir gehört, gehört auch dir. Aber jetzt sollte doch lauter Freude herrschen; denn dieser dein Bruder war tot und ist lebendig geworden, er war verloren und ist wiedergefunden worden.'" 
[15:32] 
[16:1] Dann sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Ein reicher Mann hatte einen Verwalter. Über den wurde ihm hinterbracht, er verschwende ihm sein Vermögen. 
[16:2] Da ließ er ihn rufen und sprach zu ihm: 'Was muß ich von dir hören? Lege mir Rechnung ab von deiner Tätigkeit! Denn du kannst nicht länger in meinem Dienst bleiben.' 
[16:3] Da überlegte der Verwalter: 'Was soll ich machen, da mir mein Herr die Stelle nimmt? Zur Feldarbeit fehlt mir die Kraft, zum Betteln bin ich zu stolz. 
[16:4] Ich weiß schon, was ich tue, damit ich Leute finde, die mich nach meiner Entlassung in ihre Häuser aufnehmen.' 
[16:5] Er ließ nun alle Schuldner seines Herrn einzeln zu sich kommen. Den ersten fragte er: 'Wieviel bist du meinem Herrn schuldig?' 
[16:6] Der gab ihm zur Antwort: 'Hundert Eimer Öl.' Er sprach zu ihm: 'Hier ist dein Schuldschein; setz dich hin und schreib schnell: fünfzig!' 
[16:7] Dann fragte er einen anderen: 'Wieviel bist du schuldig?' Der sagte: 'Hundert Malter Weizen.' Zu dem sprach er: 'Hier ist dein Schuldschein, schreibe: achtzig!' 
[16:8] Und der Herr lobte seinen betrügerischen Verwalter, weil er klug gehandelt habe. Denn die Kinder dieser Weltzeit sind im Verkehr mit ihresgleichen klüger als die Kinder des Lichts. 
[16:9] Auch ich sage euch: Macht euch Freunde mit dem Geld, an dem oft so viel Unrecht klebt, damit ihr bei dem Scheiden aus dieser Welt in den ewigen Wohnungen Aufnahme findet. 
[16:10] Wer im Kleinsten treu ist, der ist auch im Großen treu; und wer im Kleinsten untreu ist, der ist es auch im Großen. 
[16:11] Seid ihr nun untreu in dem irdischen Geld und Gut, an dem doch so viel Unrecht klebt, wer wird euch dann die wahren Schätze anvertrauen? 
[16:12] Und geht ihr nicht treu mit fremdem Gut um, wer wird euch dann das geben, was euch gehört? 
[16:13] Kein Knecht kann zwei Herren dienen. Denn er wird den einen hassen und den anderen lieben oder doch dem einen anhangen und gering von dem anderen denken. Ihr könnt nicht Gott und zugleich dem Geld dienen." 
[16:14] Dies alles hörten die Pharisäer, die das Geld liebhatten, und sie spotteten über ihn. 
[16:15] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Ihr seid Leute, die vor den Menschen mit ihrer Frömmigkeit großtun; Gott aber durchschaut eure Herzen. Denn was die Menschen hochhalten, das ist ein Greuel vor Gott. 
[16:16] Das Gesetz und die Propheten schließen mit Johannes ab; seitdem wird die Frohe Botschaft von Gottes Königreich verkündigt, und jeder sucht hineinzustürmen. 
[16:17] Doch es ist leichter möglich, daß Himmel und Erde vergehen, als daß von dem Gesetz ein einziger Strich hinfällig werde. 
[16:18] Wer sein Weib entläßt und eine andere heiratet, der begeht einen Ehebruch; und wer eine von ihrem Mann entlassene Frau zum Weib nimmt, der begeht damit auch einen Ehebruch. 
[16:19] Es war einmal ein reicher Mann, der kleidete sich in Purpur und feine Leinwand und lebte alle Tage herrlich und in Freuden. 
[16:20] Ein Armer aber mit Namen Lazarus lag vor seiner Tür. Der war bedeckt mit Schwären 
[16:21] und sehnte sich danach, mit dem Abfall von des Reichen Tisch seinen Hunger zu stillen. Sogar die Straßenhunde kamen und beleckten seine Schwären. 
[16:22] Da starb der Arme und wurde von den Engeln in Abrahams Schoß getragen. Auch der Reiche starb und ward begraben. 
[16:23] Als er nun im Totenreich Qualen litt, hob er seine Augen auf: da sah er Abraham in weiter Ferne und Lazarus in seinen Armen. 
[16:24] Da rief er: 'Vater Abraham, erbarme dich mein und sende Lazarus, daß er seine Fingerspitze mit Wasser netze und mir die Zunge kühle; denn ich leide Pein hier in der Feuerglut!' 
[16:25] Abraham aber antwortete: 'Mein Sohn, bedenke: du hast die Güter, die dir begehrenswert erschienen, schon in deinem Erdenleben empfangen; Lazarus dagegen sind in seiner Lebenszeit die Leiden zuteil geworden. Jetzt wird er hier getröstet, und du leidest Pein. 
[16:26] Überdies liegt zwischen uns und euch auch eine weite Kluft: die soll den Weg für alle, die von hier zu euch hinüberwollen, unmöglich machen und ebenso den Weg von euch zu uns.' 
[16:27] Da sagte er: 'So bitte ich dich, Vater, sende ihn in meines Vaters Haus! 
[16:28] Denn ich habe noch fünf Brüder; die soll er ernstlich warnen, damit sie nicht auch an diesen Ort der Qual geraten.' 
[16:29] Abraham erwiderte: 'Sie haben Mose und die Propheten; auf die sollen sie hören.' 
[16:30] Er aber sprach: 'Nein, Vater Abraham; sondern wenn einer von den Toten zu ihnen kommt, dann werden sie sich bekehren.' 
[16:31] Da antwortete ihm Abraham: 'Hören sie nicht auf Mose und die Propheten, so lassen sie sich auch nicht überzeugen, wenn einer von den Toten aufersteht.'" 
[17:1] Jesus sprach dann weiter zu seinen Jüngern: "Verführungen sind zwar unvermeidlich; doch wehe dem, durch den sie kommen! 
[17:2] Es wäre für ihn besser, er läge in des Meeres Tiefe mit einem Mühlstein um den Hals, als daß er eins der Kinder, die hier stehen, zur Sünde verführte. 
[17:3] Hütet euch davor! Sündigt dein Bruder, so weise ihn ernst zurecht; und wenn er es bereut, vergib ihm! 
[17:4] Ja wenn er sich siebenmal an einem Tag gegen dich versündigte und er käme siebenmal zu dir zurück und spräche: 'Es tut mir leid', so sollst du ihm vergeben." 
[17:5] Da baten die Apostel den Herrn: "Gib uns mehr Glauben!" 
[17:6] Der Herr antwortete: "Wenn ihr Glauben hättet wie ein Senfkorn, so sprächt ihr zu diesem Maulbeerbaum: Entwurzele dich und verpflanze dich ins Meer!' —, und er gehorchte euch. 
[17:7] Wer von euch sagt zu seinem Acker- oder Hüteknecht, wenn er vom Feld heimkehrt: 'Geschwind komm her und geh zu Tisch'? 
[17:8] Wird er ihm nicht vielmehr befehlen: 'Mach mir mein Abendessen fertig, schürze dich und bediene mich, bis ich gegessen und getrunken habe — dann halte du dein Mahl'? 
[17:9] Dankt er etwa dem Knecht, weil er getan hat, was ihm befohlen worden ist? 
[17:10] Ebenso auch ihr: Habt ihr alles ausgeführt, was euch aufgetragen worden ist, so denkt: wir haben als Knechte kein Verdienst; wir haben nur getan, was wir zu tun schuldig waren." 
[17:11] Auf seiner Wanderung nach Jerusalem zog er längs der Grenze zwischen Samaria und Galiläa. 
[17:12] Als er in ein Dorf kam, begegneten ihm zehn aussätzige Männer: die blieben von weitem stehen 
[17:13] und riefen laut: "Jesus, Meister, erbarme dich unser!" 
[17:14] Als er sie erblickte, sagte er zu ihnen: "Geht hin und zeigt euch den Priestern!" Während sie hingingen, wurden sie rein. 
[17:15] Aber einer von ihnen kam zurück, als er sich geheilt sah: er pries Gott mit lauter Stimme, 
[17:16] warf sich zu Jesu Füßen auf sein Angesicht und dankte ihm. Das war ein Samariter. 
[17:17] Da fragte Jesus: "Sind nicht alle zehn gesund geworden? Wo sind die anderen neun? 
[17:18] Hat sich sonst keiner gefunden, der zurückkäme, um Gott die Ehre zu geben, als dieser Fremdling?" 
[17:19] Und er sprach zu ihm: "Steh auf und geh! Dein Glaube hat dich gesund gemacht." 
[17:20] Einst fragten ihn die Pharisäer: "Wann kommt Gottes Königreich?" Er antwortete ihnen: "Gottes Königreich kommt ganz ohne äußeres Aufsehen. 
[17:21] Man kann auch nicht sagen: 'Hier ist es oder dort.' Denn wißt: Gottes Königreich ist schon mitten unter euch." 
[17:22] Dann sagte er zu seinen Jüngern: "Die Zeit wird kommen, wo ihr euch danach sehnt, nur einen von den Tagen des Menschensohnes zu erleben; doch ihr sollt ihn nicht erleben. 
[17:23] Dann wird man zu euch sagen: 'Seht dort, seht hier (ist der Messias)!' Geht nicht hin, lauft solchen Leuten nicht nach! 
[17:24] Denn wie der Blitz aufleuchtet und am Himmel hin- und herzuckt, so wird der Menschensohn an seinem Tage sein. 
[17:25] Zuvor aber muß er viel leiden und von dem gegenwärtigen Geschlecht verworfen werden. 
[17:26] Wie es in Noahs Tagen zuging, so wird's auch zugehen in des Menschensohnes Tagen: 
[17:27] Man aß und trank, man nahm zur Ehe und gab zur Ehe bis zu dem Tag, als Noah in die Arche ging. Dann brach die Flut herein und vertilgte alle. 
[17:28] Ganz ebenso ging's in den Tagen Lots: man aß und trank, man kaufte und verkaufte, man pflanzte und baute. 
[17:29] Doch an dem Tag, wo Lot aus Sodom ging, fiel ein Feuer- und Schwefelregen vom Himmel und vertilgte alle. 
[17:30] So wird's auch an dem Tag sein, an dem der Menschensohn sich offenbart. 
[17:31] Wer an jenem Tag auf dem Dach ist und sein Gerät im Haus liegen hat, der soll nicht erst hinuntergehen und es holen; und ebenso: wer draußen auf dem Feld ist, der kehre nicht zurück in seine Wohnung. 
[17:32] Denkt an Lots Weib! 
[17:33] Wer sein Leben zu erhalten sucht, der wird's verlieren; und wer's verliert, der wird es sich bewahren. 
[17:34] Ich sage euch: In jener Nacht werden zwei Männer auf einem Lager ruhen: der eine wird mitgenommen, der andere bleibt zurück. 
[17:35] Zwei Frauen werden miteinander mahlen: die eine wird mitgenommen, die andere bleibt zurück." 
[17:36]  
[17:37] Da fragten ihn die Jünger: "Wo, Herr (finden wir dann Zuflucht)?" Er antwortete ihnen: "Wo der Leichnam ist, da versammeln sich auch die Geier." 
[18:1] Er erzählte ihnen ferner ein Gleichnis, um ihnen zu zeigen, daß sie allezeit beten müßten und dabei nie den Mut verlieren dürften. 
[18:2] "In einer Stadt", so sagte er, "war einst ein Richter, der kannte keine Gottesfurcht und keine Scheu vor Menschen. 
[18:3] Nun lebte eine Witwe in jener Stadt, die kam oft zu ihm und bat ihn: 'Hilf mir zu meinem Recht gegen meine Widersacher!' 
[18:4] Eine Zeitlang wollte er nicht. Dann aber dachte er bei sich: 'Sind mir auch Gottesfurcht und Scheu vor Menschen fremd, 
[18:5] so will ich dieser Witwe doch zu ihrem Recht verhelfen, weil sie mir keine Ruhe läßt. Sonst kommt sie immer wieder und peinigt mich.'" 
[18:6] "Hört", fuhr der Herr dann fort, "was hier der ungerechte Richter sagt! 
[18:7] Sollte Gott da nicht viel mehr seinen Auserwählten zu ihrem Recht verhelfen, wenn sie zu ihm rufen Tag und Nacht? Sollte er da zaudern, sie zu retten? 
[18:8] Ich sage euch: Er wird ihnen schnell zu ihrem Recht verhelfen. Doch wird der Menschensohn bei seiner Wiederkunft auf Erden auch das volle Maß des Glaubens finden?" 
[18:9] Im Blick auf Leute, die auf ihre eigene Frömmigkeit vertrauten und dabei die anderen verachteten, erzählte er dieses Gleichnis: 
[18:10] "Zwei Männer gingen in den Tempel, um zu beten: der eine war ein Pharisäer, der andere ein Zöllner. 
[18:11] Der Pharisäer trat (selbstgefällig) hin und betete in seinem Herzen: 'Gott, ich danke dir, daß ich nicht bin wie die anderen Menschen: ich bin kein Räuber, kein Betrüger, kein Ehebrecher, ich bin auch nicht wie jener Zöllner dort. 
[18:12] Ich faste zweimal in der Woche und gebe den Zehnten von meinem ganzen Einkommen.' 
[18:13] Der Zöllner aber blieb im Hintergrund stehen, er wagte nicht einmal die Augen zum Himmel zu erheben, sondern schlug an seine Brust und sprach: 'Gott, sei mir Sünder gnädig!' 
[18:14] Ich sage euch: Dieser ging gerechtfertigt nach Hause, der andere nicht. Denn wer sich selbst erhöht, der soll erniedrigt werden; und wer sich selbst erniedrigt, der soll erhöht werden." 
[18:15] Einst brachten die Leute ihre unmündigen Kinder zu ihm, damit er sie (segnend) berühre. Als die Jünger das sahen, fuhren sie die Leute mit harten Worten an. 
[18:16] Jesus aber rief die Kinder zu sich und sprach: "Laßt die kleinen Kinder zu mir kommen und hindert sie nicht daran! Denn gerade ihnen ist Gottes Königreich bestimmt. 
[18:17] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer Gottes Königreich nicht annimmt wie ein Kind, der kommt sicher nicht hinein." 
[18:18] Es fragte ihn ein Gemeindevorsteher: "Guter Meister, was muß ich tun, um das ewige Leben zu erlangen?" 
[18:19] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Warum nennst du mich gut? Niemand ist gut als Gott allein. 
[18:20] Du kennst doch die Gebote: Du sollst nicht ehebrechen, nicht morden, nicht stehlen, nicht falsches Zeugnis ablegen! Ehre Vater und Mutter!" 
[18:21] Er sprach zu ihm: "Dies alles habe ich von Jugend auf erfüllt." 
[18:22] Darauf antwortete ihm Jesus: "Eins fehlt dir noch: verkaufe deine ganze Habe und verteile den Erlös an die Armen, so wirst du einen Schatz im Himmel haben; dann komm und folge mir!" 
[18:23] Bei diesen Worten ward er sehr betrübt, denn er war außerordentlich reich. 
[18:24] Als Jesus ihn so traurig sah, da sprach er: "Wie schwer ist doch für die Begüterten der Eingang in Gottes Königreich! 
[18:25] Ein Kamel kommt leichter durch ein Nadelöhr als ein Reicher in Gottes Königreich." 
[18:26] Darauf sagten die Zuhörer: "Ja, wer kann dann überhaupt gerettet werden?" 
[18:27] Er erwiderte: "Was für Menschen unmöglich ist, das ist möglich bei Gott." 
[18:28] Da sprach Petrus: "Siehe, wir haben unser Heim aufgegeben und sind dir nachgefolgt." 
[18:29] Er antwortete ihnen: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Jeder, der Haus, Weib, Brüder, Eltern oder Kinder aus Liebe zu dem Königreich Gottes fahren läßt, 
[18:30] der soll dafür schon jetzt in diesem Leben vielfach Ersatz bekommen und in der zukünftigen Welt das ewige Leben empfangen." 
[18:31] Dann nahm er die Zwölf als seine besonderen Begleiter zu sich und sprach zu ihnen: "Jetzt gehen wir nach Jerusalem, und da erfüllt sich alles, was die Propheten von dem Menschensohn geschrieben haben. 
[18:32] Denn er wird den Heiden überliefert und verspottet, mißhandelt und angespien werden; 
[18:33] ja man wird ihn geißeln und töten; doch am dritten Tag wird er auferstehen." 
[18:34] Sie aber verstanden nichts davon, sondern diese Worte waren ihnen dunkel, und sie begriffen nicht, was er damit meinte. 
[18:35] Als er in die Nähe von Jericho kam, saß ein Blinder am Weg und bettelte. 
[18:36] Als der viele Leute vorbeigehen hörte, fragte er, was das bedeute. 
[18:37] Man sagte ihm, Jesus von Nazaret ziehe vorüber. 
[18:38] Da rief er: "Jesus, Sohn Davids, erbarme dich mein!" 
[18:39] Die aber vorn im Zug gingen, fuhren ihn mit harten Worten an, er solle schweigen. Doch er rief nur noch lauter: "Sohn Davids, erbarme dich mein!" 
[18:40] Da blieb Jesus stehen und ließ ihn zu sich führen. Als nun der Blinde nahe bei ihm war, fragte ihn Jesus: 
[18:41] "Was willst du von mir?" Er antwortete: "Herr, laß mich wieder sehend werden!" 
[18:42] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Sei wieder gesund, dein Glaube hat dich gesund gemacht!" 
[18:43] Da ward er auf der Stelle wieder sehend, und er folgte ihm und lobte Gott. Und alles Volk, das dieses sah, gab Gott die Ehre. 
[19:1] Dann kam Jesus nach Jericho hinein und zog durch den Ort. 
[19:2] Nun wohnte dort ein Mann mit Namen Zachäus, ein reicher Oberzöllner. 
[19:3] Der wollte Jesus gern von Angesicht sehen; doch des Gedränges wegen gelang es ihm nicht, denn er war klein von Gestalt. 
[19:4] Da lief er dem Zug voraus und stieg auf einen Maulbeerfeigenbaum, um ihn zu sehen; denn dort mußte er vorüberkommen. 
[19:5] Als nun Jesus an die Stelle kam, sah er zu ihm auf und rief: "Zachäus, komm schnell herab; denn ich muß heute in deinem Haus einkehren!" 
[19:6] Da stieg er eilend hinunter und nahm ihn mit Freuden auf. 
[19:7] Alle, die dies sahen, murrten und sprachen: "Er ist bei einem Sünder als Gast eingekehrt!" 
[19:8] Zachäus aber trat hervor und sagte zu dem Herrn: "Sieh, Herr, die Hälfte meiner Habe will ich den Armen geben; und wenn ich einem unrechtmäßig etwas abgefordert habe, so zahle ich es ihm vierfach zurück." 
[19:9] Da wandte sich Jesus zu ihm und sprach zu den Leuten: "Heute ist diesem Haus Heil zuteil geworden, weil er auch zu Abrahams Söhnen zählt. 
[19:10] Denn der Menschensohn ist gekommen, um das Verlorene zu suchen und zu retten." 
[19:11] Als die Leute noch auf diese Worte lauschten, fuhr er weiter fort und erzählte ein Gleichnis. Denn er war nun ganz nahe bei Jerusalem, und man meinte, Gottes Königreich müsse jetzt sofort erscheinen. 
[19:12] Er sprach: "Ein Mann von hoher Herkunft zog in ein fernes Land, um sich von dort die Königswürde zu holen und dann zurückzukommen. 
[19:13] Der rief zehn von seinen Knechten, gab ihnen zehn Pfund und sprach zu ihnen: 'Treibt damit Handel, bis ich wiederkomme.' 
[19:14] Seine Mitbürger aber haßten ihn und schickten nach seiner Abreise eine Gesandtschaft, durch die sie sagen ließen: 'Wir wollen diesen Mann nicht zu unserem König haben.' 
[19:15] Als er nun im Besitz der Königswürde wieder heimkam, ließ er die Knechte zu sich rufen, denen er das Geld gegeben hatte, um zu erfahren, wieviel ein jeder damit erworben habe. 
[19:16] Da erschien der erste und sprach: 'Herr, dein Pfund hat zehn Pfund eingebracht.' 
[19:17] Sein Herr erwiderte: 'Recht so, du wackerer Knecht! Weil du in so wenigem getreu gewesen bist, sollst du nun Machthaber über zehn Städte sein.' 
[19:18] Dann kam der zweite und sagte: 'Dein Pfund, Herr, hat fünf Pfund gewonnen.' 
[19:19] Zu dem sprach er: 'Du sollst Verwalter von fünf Städten sein.' 
[19:20] Nun kam der dritte und sprach: 'Hier hast du, Herr, dein Pfund, das ich in ein Tuch gewickelt und aufbewahrt habe. 
[19:21] Denn ich hatte Furcht vor dir, weil du ein strenger Mann bist: du hebst ab, was du nicht angelegt, und erntest, was du nicht gesät.' 
[19:22] Da sprach der Herr zu ihm: 'Nach deinen eigenen Worte will ich dir, gewissenloser Knecht, das Urteil sprechen. Du kanntest mich als einen strengen Mann: der abhebt, was er nicht angelegt, und erntet, was er nicht gesät. 
[19:23] Warum hast du da mein Geld nicht auf die Bank gegeben? Dann hätte ich's bei meiner Rückkehr mit Zinsen abgehoben.' 
[19:24] Und er befahl seinen Dienern, die dastanden: 'Nehmt ihm das Pfund und gebt es dem, der die zehn Pfund hat!' 
[19:25] Sie meinten: 'Herr, er hat ja schon zehn Pfund.' 
[19:26] 'Ich sage euch: Wer (viel) hat, der soll (noch mehr) empfangen; wer aber nichts hat, dem soll sogar das (wenige), was er hat, genommen werden. 
[19:27] Doch meine Feinde, die mich nicht zum König haben wollten — bringt sie her und haut sie nieder vor meinen Augen!'" 
[19:28] Nach diesen Worten zog er an der Spitze seiner Jünger weiter auf der Wanderung nach Jerusalem. 
[19:29] Als er in die Nähe von Bethphage und Bethanien, an den sogenannten Ölberg, kam, entsandte er zwei von seinen Jüngern 
[19:30] mit dem Auftrag: "Geht in das Dorf, das vor euch liegt! Dort werdet ihr am Eingang ein Eselsfüllen angebunden finden, auf dem noch nie ein Mensch gesessen hat. Das bindet los und führt es her! 
[19:31] Und fragt euch jemand: 'Warum bindet ihr es los?', dann sollt ihr sagen: 'Der Herr bedarf sein.'" 
[19:32] Die Abgesandten gingen hin und fanden das Füllen so, wie er gesagt hatte. 
[19:33] Als sie es aber losbinden wollten, sprachen die Eigentümer zu ihnen: "Warum bindet ihr das Füllen los?" 
[19:34] Sie antworteten: "Der Herr bedarf sein." 
[19:35] Dann brachten sie es zu Jesus, legten ihre Mäntel auf des Füllens Rücken und setzten Jesus darauf. 
[19:36] Während er dahinritt, breiteten manche ihre Mäntel auf dem Weg aus. 
[19:37] Als er der Stelle nahekam, wo sich der Ölberg ins Tal hinabsenkt, begann die ganze Schar der Jünger ob all der Wundertaten, die sie gesehen hatten, mit lauter Stimme freudig Gott zu preisen; 
[19:38] sie riefen: "Gesegnet sei der König, der da kommt im Namen des Herrn! Im Himmel wohnt Friede, und Lobgesänge klingen droben in der Höhe." 
[19:39] Da sprachen einige Pharisäer aus der Menge zu ihm: "Meister, verbiete doch deinen Jüngern dieses Treiben!" 
[19:40] Aber er antwortete: "Ich sage euch: Wenn diese schwiegen, so müßten die Steine schreien." 
[19:41] Als er näherkam und die Stadt erblickte, da weinte er über sie 
[19:42] und klagte: "Ach, möchtest doch auch du erkennen, wenigstens an diesem Tag, was zu deinem Heil dient! Nun aber ist's vor deinen Augen verborgen. 
[19:43] Denn es kommen Tage über dich, da werden deine Feinde dich mit einem Wall umgeben, dich rings umlagern und von allen Seiten bedrängen. 
[19:44] Ja sie werden dich dem Erdboden gleichmachen, und deine Kinder, die in deinen Mauern sind, werden sie zu Boden schmettern; sie werden keinen Stein an dir auf dem anderen lassen zur Strafe dafür, daß du nicht erkannt hast die Zeit, da Gott sein Heil dir angeboten hat." 
[19:45] Da ging er in den Tempel. Dort fing er an, die Verkäufer hinauszutreiben, 
[19:46] und sprach zu ihnen: "Es steht geschrieben: Mein Haus soll ein Bethaus sein. Ihr aber habt eine Räuberhöhle daraus gemacht." 
[19:47] Er lehrte täglich im Tempel. Die Hohenpriester aber und die Schriftgelehrten samt den Obersten des Volkes trachteten ihm nach dem Leben. 
[19:48] Doch sie fanden keine Gelegenheit, ihre Absicht auszuführen; denn alles Volk hing an seinen Lippen. 
[20:1] Als er eines Tages das Volk im Tempel lehrte und die Heilsbotschaft verkündigte, traten die Hohenpriester und Schriftgelehrten mit den Ältesten an ihn heran 
[20:2] und sprachen zu ihm: "Sag uns doch: mit welchem Recht tust du dies, oder wer hat dir das Recht dazu gegeben?" 
[20:3] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ich will euch auch eine Frage vorlegen. Sagt mir: 
[20:4] Stammte die Taufe des Johannes vom Himmel oder von Menschen?" 
[20:5] Da überlegten sie miteinander: "Sagen wir: 'vom Himmel', so wird er fragen: 'Warum habt ihr ihm denn nicht geglaubt?' 
[20:6] Antworten wir aber: 'von Menschen', so steinigt uns das ganze Volk; denn es ist überzeugt, daß Johannes ein Prophet gewesen ist." 
[20:7] Da erwiderten sie, sie wüßten nicht, woher sie stamme. 
[20:8] Darauf sprach Jesus zu ihnen: "So sage ich euch auch nicht, mit welchem Recht ich dies tue." 
[20:9] Dann fing er an, dem Volk dieses Gleichnis zu erzählen: "Jemand pflanzte einen Weinberg und verpachtete ihn an Winzer. Dann ging er für geraume Zeit außer Landes. 
[20:10] Zur Zeit der Weinlese sandte er einen seiner Knechte zu den Winzern, damit sie ihm einen Teil der Weinbergsfrüchte gäben. Die Winzer aber schlugen diesen Knecht und schickten ihn mit leeren Händen wieder heim. 
[20:11] Da sandte er noch einen anderen Knecht; auch den schlugen und beschimpften sie und schickten ihn mit leeren Händen wieder heim. 
[20:12] Dann sandte er noch einen dritten; den schlugen sie auch blutig und jagten ihn davon. 
[20:13] Da sprach der Weinbergsbesitzer: 'Was soll ich tun? Ich will meinen geliebten Sohn hinsenden; vielleicht werden sie vor dem doch Ehrfurcht haben.' 
[20:14] Als aber die Winzer ihn erblickten, berieten sie sich miteinander und sagten: 'Ha, da kommt der Erbe! Laßt uns ihn töten, damit das Erbe unser werde!' 
[20:15] Und sie stießen ihn zum Weinberg hinaus und töteten ihn. Was wird nun der Weinbergsbesitzer mit diesen Leuten tun? 
[20:16] Er wird kommen und diese Winzer töten und seinen Weinberg anderen geben." Als sie das hörten, sprachen sie: "Nimmermehr soll das geschehen!" 
[20:17] Da blickte er sie durchbohrend an und sagte: "Was bedeutet denn dies Schriftwort: Der Stein, den die Bauleute verworfen haben, der ist zum Eckstein geworden? 
[20:18] Wer auf diesen Stein fällt, der wird zerschmettert; auf wen aber der Stein fällt, der wird zerschmettert." 
[20:19] Da suchten die Schriftgelehrten und die Hohenpriester noch in derselben Stunde Hand an ihn zu legen; denn sie hatten wohl gemerkt, daß er sie mit diesem Gleichnis treffen wollte. Aber sie fürchteten sich vor dem Volk. 
[20:20] Darum suchten sie ihm einen Hinterhalt zu legen: sie schickten Späher ab, die sich den Anschein gaben, als meinten sie es ehrlich. Dabei wollten sie ihn aber bei einem Wort fassen, damit sie ihn dann der Obrigkeit und der Gewalt des Statthalters überliefern könnten. 
[20:21] Sie legten ihm nun eine Frage vor. "Meister", so sagten sie, "wir wissen: du sprichst und lehrst, was recht ist, und Menschengunst gilt nicht bei dir; du lehrst vielmehr in aller Wahrheit Gottes Weg. 
[20:22] Dürfen wir dem Kaiser Steuer zahlen oder nicht?" 
[20:23] Er aber merkte ihre Arglist und sprach zu ihnen: 
[20:24] "Zeigt mir einen Silberling! Wessen Bild und Inschrift trägt er?" Sie erwiderten: "Des Kaisers." 
[20:25] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Nun, so gebt dem Kaiser, was dem Kaiser gebührt, und Gott, was Gott gebührt!" 
[20:26] Sie konnten diesen Ausspruch in Gegenwart des Volkes nicht tadeln, und staunend über seine Antwort schwiegen sie. 
[20:27] Da traten einige Sadduzäer zu ihm, die da behaupteten, es gebe keine Auferstehung, und legten ihm eine Frage vor. 
[20:28] "Meister", so sagten sie, "Mose hat uns vorgeschrieben: Stirbt einem der Bruder und hinterläßt er ein Weib ohne Kinder, so soll sein Bruder die verwitwete Schwägerin zum Weib nehmen und (mit ihr) seinem (verstorbenen) Bruder Nachkommen erwecken. 
[20:29] Nun waren sieben Brüder da. Der erste nahm ein Weib und starb kinderlos. 
[20:30] Da heiratete der zweite Bruder die Witwe, 
[20:31] dann der dritte und so alle sieben; sie starben sämtlich kinderlos. 
[20:32] Zuletzt starb auch die Frau. 
[20:33] Wem von ihnen gehört nun die Frau bei der Auferstehung als Gattin an? Denn alle sieben haben sie ja zur Ehe gehabt." 
[20:34] Da antwortete ihnen Jesus: "Die Leute in dieser Weltzeit freien und lassen sich freien. 
[20:35] Die aber gewürdigt werden, jene Weltzeit zu erlangen und die Auferstehung, zu der nur eine Auswahl aus den Toten kommt, die freien nicht und lassen sich nicht freien. 
[20:36] Sie können ja auch nicht mehr sterben: sie sind den Engeln gleich und sind Gottes Kinder, weil sie der Auferstehung Kinder sind. 
[20:37] Daß aber die Toten auferstehen, das hat auch Mose in der Geschichte von dem Dornbusch angedeutet, wo er den Herrn den Gott Abrahams, den Gott Isaaks und den Gott Jakobs nennt. 
[20:38] Gott ist nun aber nicht ein Gott der Toten, sondern der Lebendigen. Denn alle sind für ihn lebendig." 
[20:39] Da sagten einige der Schriftgelehrten: "Meister, du hast treffend geantwortet." 
[20:40] Weiter aber wagten sie ihm keine Fragen vorzulegen. 
[20:41] Dann fragte er sie: "Wie kann man behaupten, der Messias sei Davids Sohn? 
[20:42] David selbst sagt ja im Psalmbuch: Der Herr hat gesagt zu meinem Herrn: Sitze du zu meiner Rechten, 
[20:43] bis ich dir deine Feinde zu Füßen lege. 
[20:44] David also nennt ihn seinen Herrn, wie kann er da zugleich sein Sohn sein?" 
[20:45] Vor den Ohren des ganzen Volkes sprach er dann zu seinen Jüngern: 
[20:46] "Hütet euch vor den Schriftgelehrten! Sie gehen mit Vorliebe in langen Gewändern einher, auf den Straßen lassen sie sich gern voll Ehrfurcht grüßen, in der gottesdienstlichen Versammlung wollen sie die Ehrenplätze haben, und beim Mahl sitzen sie gern obenan. 
[20:47] Sie verschlingen der Witwen Eigentum und halten zum Schein lange Gebete. Sie wird die schlimmste Strafe treffen." 
[21:1] Als er aufblickte, sah er, wie die Reichen ihre Gaben in den Opferstock warfen. 
[21:2] Da sah er auch eine arme Witwe dort zwei kleine Münzen einlegen 
[21:3] und sprach: "Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Diese arme Witwe hat mehr als alle anderen eingelegt. 
[21:4] Denn jene haben alle aus ihrem Überfluß eine Gabe in den Gotteskasten eingelegt; sie aber hat trotz ihrer Dürftigkeit ihre ganze Habe eingelegt." 
[21:5] Einige redeten davon, wie der Tempel mit schönen Steinen und Weihgeschenken geschmückt sei. Da sagte er: 
[21:6] "Es werden Tage kommen, wo von dem, was ihr hier seht, kein Stein auf dem anderen bleibt; alles soll in Trümmer gehen." 
[21:7] Sie fragten ihn: "Meister, wann geschieht denn das? Und welches Zeichen wird gegeben, wenn sich dies ereignen soll?" 
[21:8] Er erwiderte: "Habt acht, daß ihr euch nicht irreführen laßt! Denn mancher wird kommen unter meinem Namen und behaupten: 'Ich bin (der Messias)' und: 'Die Zeit ist nahe.' Folgt diesen Leuten nicht! 
[21:9] Hört ihr dann von Kriegen und von inneren Wirren, so laßt euch dadurch nicht in Schrecken bringen. Denn das muß zunächst geschehen. Aber damit ist noch nicht sofort das Ende da." 
[21:10] Dann fuhr er fort: "Ein Volk wird sich erheben gegen das andere und ein Reich gegen das andere. 
[21:11] Gewaltige Erdbeben werden stattfinden, hier und da werden Hungersnöte und Seuchen sein, und am Himmel wird man schreckliche Erscheinungen und große Wunderzeichen sehen. 
[21:12] Doch ehe dies alles eintritt, wird man die Hände an euch legen und euch verfolgen: dann bringt man euch vor die Gerichte und wirft euch ins Gefängnis, und um meines Namens willen führt man euch vor Könige und Statthalter. 
[21:13] Das wird euch widerfahren, damit ihr von mir Zeugnis ablegt. 
[21:14] Beherzigt nun, daß ihr nicht schon vorher an eure Verteidigung zu denken braucht. 
[21:15] Denn ich will euch Beredsamkeit und Weisheit schenken, so daß alle eure Widersacher dagegen nichts ausrichten oder sagen können. 
[21:16] Ihr werdet aber sogar von Eltern und Brüdern, von Blutsverwandten und Freunden (euern Feinden) überliefert werden; ja manche von euch wird man töten, 
[21:17] und alle Welt wird euch hassen, weil ihr meinen Namen bekennt. 
[21:18] Es soll jedoch kein Haar von euerm Haupt verlorengehen. 
[21:19] Durch eure Standhaftigkeit gewinnt euch das Leben! 
[21:20] Wenn ihr aber Jerusalem von Heeren umlagert seht, dann seid gewiß, daß die Verwüstung der Stadt ganz nahe ist. 
[21:21] Dann sollen, die in Judäa sind, in das Gebirge fliehen; die Leute auf dem Land sollen nicht hineingehen in die Stadt. 
[21:22] Denn dann sind die Tage der Vergeltung da, damit alles in Erfüllung gehe, was geschrieben steht. 
[21:23] Weh den Frauen, die Kinder erwarten, und stillenden Müttern in jenen Tagen! Denn es wird große Not im Land herrschen, und ein Zorngericht wird über dieses Volk ergehen: 
[21:24] sie werden durch des Schwertes Schärfe fallen und gefangen weggeführt unter alle Völker; und Heiden werden Jerusalem mit Füßen treten, bis die Zeit der Heidenvölker abgelaufen ist. 
[21:25] Dann wird man Wunderzeichen an Sonne, Mond und Sternen sehen, und auf Erden wird die Völker Angst ergreifen, wenn sie bei dem Tosen der Meereswogen ratlos sind. 
[21:26] Da sollen die Menschen vor Furcht vergehen in bangem Warten auf die Dinge, die über den Erdkreis kommen werden. Denn die Himmelskräfte werden wanken. 
[21:27] Und dann wird man den Menschensohn in einer Wolke kommen sehen mit großer Macht und Herrlichkeit. 
[21:28] Wenn aber dieses anfängt zu geschehen, so schaut auf und hebt das Haupt empor; denn eure Errettung naht!" 
[21:29] Er veranschaulichte dies durch ein Gleichnis: "Seht", so sprach er, "den Feigenbaum und alle anderen Bäume an! 
[21:30] Wenn ihr wahrnehmt, daß sie ausschlagen, so wißt ihr von selbst, daß nun der Sommer nahe ist. 
[21:31] So sollt ihr auch, wenn ihr dies kommen seht, gewiß sein, daß Gottes Königreich nahe ist. 
[21:32] Wahrlich, ich sage euch: Diese Weltzeit ist nicht eher zu Ende, als bis alles geschehen ist. 
[21:33] Himmel und Erde werden vergehen, meine Worte aber werden nimmermehr vergehen. 
[21:34] Seid aber auf der Hut, daß eure Herzen nicht durch Rausch und Trunkenheit und durch die Sorgen um das Irdische belastet werden; sonst überfällt euch jener Tag ganz unvermutet wie eine Schlinge. 
[21:35] Denn er wird sicher kommen über alle, die auf der ganzen Erde wohnen. 
[21:36] Darum wacht allezeit und betet, damit ihr jedem Widerstand zum Trotz die Kraft empfangt, zu entrinnen alledem, was kommen soll, und sicher dazustehen in der Gegenwart des Menschensohnes!" 
[21:37] Tagsüber hielt er sich im Tempel auf und lehrte dort; des Abends aber verließ er die Stadt und übernachtete auf dem sogenannten Ölberg. 
[21:38] Frühmorgens schon kam alles Volk zu ihm in den Tempel, um ihn zu hören. 
[22:1] Inzwischen nahte das Fest der ungesäuerten Brote, das sogenannte Passah. 
[22:2] Die Hohenpriester und die Schriftgelehrten überlegten, wie sie ihn aus dem Weg räumen könnten; denn sie hatten vor dem Volk Furcht. 
[22:3] Da fuhr der Satan in Judas, genannt der Mann aus Kariot, der zu der Zahl der Zwölf gehörte. 
[22:4] Der ging hin und verabredete mit den Hohenpriestern und den Hauptleuten der Tempelwache, wie er ihnen Jesus in die Hände liefern wolle. 
[22:5] Da freuten sie sich sehr und versprachen, ihm Geld zu geben. 
[22:6] Er nahm ihr Anerbieten an und suchte nach einer günstigen Gelegenheit, ihn ohne Aufsehen zu verraten. 
[22:7] So kam der Tag der ungesäuerten Brote, wo man das Passahlamm opfern mußte. 
[22:8] Da entsandte Jesus Petrus und Johannes mit dem Auftrag: "Geht und bereitet uns das Passahmahl, daß wir es essen." 
[22:9] Sie fragten ihn: "Wo sollen wir's bereiten?" 
[22:10] Er antwortete ihnen: "Wenn ihr jetzt in die Stadt kommt, dann wird euch ein Mann begegnen, der einen irdenen Krug mit Wasser trägt. Dem folgt in das Haus, in das er geht, 
[22:11] und sagt dem Hausherrn: 'Der Meister läßt dich fragen: Wo ist das Zimmer, in dem ich das Passahmahl mit meinen Jüngern halten kann?' 
[22:12] Dann wird er euch ein großes, mit Tischpolstern belegtes Oberzimmer zeigen; dort rüstet alles zu." 
[22:13] Sie gingen hin und fanden alles so, wie er ihnen gesagt hatte, und richteten die Passahmahlzeit her. 
[22:14] Als die Stunde kam, nahm er bei Tisch Platz und die Apostel mit ihm. 
[22:15] Da sagte er zu ihnen: "Von Herzen habe ich mich danach gesehnt, dies Passahmahl mit euch zu halten, bevor ich leide. 
[22:16] Denn ich sage euch: Nie werde ich es wieder mit euch halten, bis es im Königreich Gottes seine volle Erfüllung findet." 
[22:17] Nun nahm er einen Becher (den man ihm reichte), sprach das Dankgebet und sagte: "Nehmt ihn und teilt ihn unter euch! 
[22:18] Denn ich sage euch: Ich will von dem Gewächs des Weinstocks ferner nicht mehr trinken, bis Gottes Königreich gekommen ist." 
[22:19] Dann nahm er ein Brot, sprach das Dankgebet, brach das Brot und gab es ihnen mit den Worten: "Das ist mein Leib, der zu euerm Heil hingegeben werden soll; tut dies zu meinem Gedächtnis!" 
[22:20] Ebenso nahm er nach dem Mahl auch den Kelch und sprach: "Dieser Kelch ist der neue Bund in meinem Blut, das zu euerm Heil vergossen werden soll. 
[22:21] Doch mein Verräter hat jetzt mit mir seine Hand hier auf dem Tisch. 
[22:22] Der Menschensohn geht zwar zum Tod, wie es bestimmt ist; doch weh dem Menschen, durch den er verraten wird!" 
[22:23] Da begannen sie, miteinander darüber zu reden, wer von ihnen es wohl sein könnte, der das tun würde. 
[22:24] Es entstand auch unter ihnen ein Streit darüber, wer von ihnen als der Größte anzusehen sei. 
[22:25] Da sagte Jesus zu ihnen: "Die Könige der Völker gebieten über ihre Untertanen, und die weltlichen Machthaber bekommen den Namen Wohltäter. 
[22:26] Bei euch soll es nicht so sein. Im Gegenteil: der Älteste bei euch soll sich verhalten wie der Jüngste und der Gebieter wie der Diener. 
[22:27] Denn wer gilt mehr: wer am Mahl teilnimmt, oder wer dabei bedient? Nicht wahr: wer am Mahl teilnimmt? Ich aber nehme unter euch die Stelle eines Dieners ein. 
[22:28] Ihr habt mit mir in meinen Anfechtungen ausgeharrt. 
[22:29] Darum vermache ich euch eine Königsherrschaft, wie sie mir mein Vater bestimmt hat: 
[22:30] ihr sollt in meinem Königreich an meiner Tafel essen und trinken; ja ihr sollt auf Thronen sitzen und die zwölf Stämme Israels als Herrscher leiten. 
[22:31] Simon, Simon! Sieh, der Satan hat Macht über euch gesucht, um euch zu sieben wie den Weizen. 
[22:32] Ich aber habe für dich gebetet, damit dein Glaube nicht versiege. So stärke du denn, wenn du dich dereinst bekehrt hast, deine Brüder!" 
[22:33] Petrus aber sprach zu ihm: "Herr, mit dir bin ich bereit, sogar ins Gefängnis und in den Tod zu gehen." 
[22:34] Jesus erwiderte: "Ich sage dir, Petrus: Heute noch vor dem Hahnenschrei wirst du dreimal leugnen, daß du mich kennst." 
[22:35] Dann fuhr er fort: "Als ich euch ohne Geldbeutel, ohne Ranzen und Schuhe aussandte, hat euch da etwas gemangelt?" Sie antworteten: "Nein." 
[22:36] "Doch jetzt", so sprach er weiter, "beginnt die Zeit, wo jeder, der Geld im Beutel oder einen Ranzen hat, beides mit sich nehmen soll. Und wer kein Schwert hat, der verkaufe seinen Mantel und kaufe sich ein Schwert dafür! 
[22:37] Denn ich sage euch: Auch dies Schriftwort muß sich noch an mir erfüllen: Er ist unter die Verbrecher gerechnet worden. Denn was mir bestimmt ist, das vollzieht sich jetzt." 
[22:38] Da sprachen sie: "Herr, hier sind zwei Schwerter." Er erwiderte: "Genug davon!" 
[22:39] Dann verließ er die Stadt und begab sich, wie er oft zu tun pflegte, in der Begleitung seiner Jünger an den Ölberg. 
[22:40] Als er dort ankam, sagte er zu ihnen: "Betet, damit ihr nicht in Versuchung fallt!" 
[22:41] Darauf entfernte er sich von ihnen etwa einen Steinwurf weit, beugte seine Knie und betete: 
[22:42] "Vater, wenn du willst, laß diesen Kelch an mir vorübergehen; doch nicht mein, sondern dein Wille geschehe!" 
[22:43] Da erschien ihm ein Engel vom Himmel und stärkte ihn. 
[22:44] In heißem Seelenkampf betete er dann noch ernstlicher, so daß sein Schweiß wie Tropfen dicken Blutes auf die Erde fiel. 
[22:45] Als er von dem Gebet aufstand und zu seinen Jüngern kam, fand er sie vor Traurigkeit in Schlaf versunken. 
[22:46] Da sagte er zu ihnen: "Was schlaft ihr? Steht auf und betet, damit ihr nicht in Versuchung fallt!" 
[22:47] Während er noch redete, kam plötzlich eine Schar von Leuten, und an ihrer Spitze ging einer von den Zwölfen mit Namen Judas. Der trat auf Jesus zu, um ihn zu küssen. 
[22:48] Jesus aber sprach zu ihm: "Judas, mit einem Kuß willst du den Menschensohn verraten?" 
[22:49] Als die Begleiter Jesu sahen, was da kommen würde, fragten sie: "Herr, sollen wir mit dem Schwert dreinschlagen?" 
[22:50] Und einer von ihnen schlug nach des Hohenpriesters Knecht und hieb ihm das rechte Ohr ab. 
[22:51] Jesus aber sprach: "Laß das! Nicht weiter!" Dann berührte er das Ohr des Knechtes und heilte ihn. 
[22:52] Darauf sagte Jesus zu den Hohenpriestern, den Hauptleuten der Tempelwache und den Ältesten, die an ihn herangetreten waren: "Mit Schwertern und mit Knütteln seid ihr ausgezogen, als ginge es gegen einen Räuber? 
[22:53] Ich bin doch Tag für Tag bei euch im Tempel gewesen, und da habt ihr nicht die Hände nach mir ausgestreckt. Aber dies ist eure Stunde; dies ist der Machtbereich der Finsternis." 
[22:54] Nun ergriffen sie ihn und führten ihn weg. Sie brachten ihn in das Haus des Hohenpriesters. Petrus aber folgte von weitem. 
[22:55] Mitten im Hof hatten die Leute ein Feuer angezündet und sich zusammengesetzt. Auch Petrus nahm unter ihnen Platz. 
[22:56] Da sah ihn eine Magd am Feuer sitzen. Die blickte ihn scharf an und sagte: "Der hat auch zu ihm gehört!" 
[22:57] Er aber verleugnete ihn und sprach: "Weib, ich kenne ihn nicht!" 
[22:58] Nach einer kleinen Weile sah ihn ein anderer und sagte: "Auch du gehörst zu diesen Leuten!" Petrus aber antwortete: "Mensch, das ist nicht wahr!" 
[22:59] Nach Verlauf von etwa einer Stunde behauptete ein anderer: "Wahrhaftig, der hat auch zu ihm gehört; er ist ja auch ein Galiläer!" 
[22:60] Petrus aber erwiderte: "Mensch, ich verstehe nicht, was du von mir willst!" In demselben Augenblick, als er noch redete, krähte ein Hahn. 
[22:61] Da sah sich der Herr um und blickte Petrus an. Nun gedachte Petrus an das Wort des Herrn, wie er zu ihm gesagt hatte: "Heute noch vor dem Hahnenschrei wirst du mich dreimal verleugnen." 
[22:62] Und er ging hinaus und weinte bitterlich. 
[22:63] Die Männer aber, die Jesus zu bewachen hatten, verspotteten und schlugen ihn; 
[22:64] sie verhüllten ihm das Angesicht und fragten ihn dann: "Zeig dich als Prophet! Sag: wer hat dich geschlagen?" 
[22:65] Auch noch mit vielen anderen Lästerworten schmähten sie ihn. 
[22:66] Als es Tag ward, versammelten sich die Ältesten des Volkes: die Hohenpriester und die Schriftgelehrten. Vor diesen ihren Rat führten sie Jesus 
[22:67] und fragten ihn: "Bist du der Messias? Sag es uns!" Er erwiderte ihnen: "Wenn ich's euch auch sagte, ihr glaubtet es doch nicht; 
[22:68] und fragte ich euch, so gäbt ihr mir keine Antwort. 
[22:69] Von nun an aber wird der Menschensohn zur Rechten der Macht Gottes sitzen." 
[22:70] Da fragten alle: "Du bist also Gottes Sohn?" Er antwortete ihnen: "Jawohl, ich bin's!" 
[22:71] Da sprachen sie: "Was brauchen wir noch Zeugen zu vernehmen? Wir haben es ja selbst aus seinem Mund gehört." 
[23:1] Nun erhob sich die ganze Versammlung und führte Jesus zu Pilatus. 
[23:2] Dort begannen sie ihn zu verklagen. "Diesen Menschen", so sprachen sie, "haben wir entlarvt als einen Verführer unseres Volkes: er verbietet ihm, dem Kaiser Steuern zu zahlen, und gibt sich für den Messiaskönig aus." 
[23:3] Da fragte ihn Pilatus: "Bist du der Juden König?" Er antwortete ihm: "Ja, ich bin's." 
[23:4] Darauf sprach Pilatus zu den Hohenpriestern und dem Volk: "Ich finde keine Schuld an diesem Menschen." 
[23:5] Sie aber behaupteten noch entschiedener: "Er wiegelt das Volk in ganz Judäa mit seiner Lehre auf. In Galiläa hat er damit begonnen, und nun ist er auch hierher gekommen!" 
[23:6] Als Pilatus das hörte, fragte er, ob der Mann aus Galiläa wäre. 
[23:7] Wie er nun erfuhr, daß er ein Untertan des Herodes sei, schickte er ihn zu diesem, der sich damals auch in Jerusalem aufhielt. 
[23:8] Für Herodes war es eine große Freude, Jesus zu sehen. Denn es war schon lange sein Wunsch gewesen, ihn kennenzulernen, weil er viel von ihm gehört hatte. Er hoffte auch, Jesus würde ein Wunderzeichen vor ihm tun. 
[23:9] Er fragte ihn um vielerlei; doch Jesus gab ihm keine Antwort. 
[23:10] Die Hohenpriester und die Schriftgelehrten waren dabei zugegen und verklagten ihn in einem fort. 
[23:11] Herodes aber mit seiner Leibwache verlachte und verhöhnte ihn; dann schickte er ihn, mit einem prächtigen Gewand bekleidet, zu Pilatus zurück. 
[23:12] An dem Tag wurden Herodes und Pilatus Freunde; denn vorher lebten sie in Feindschaft miteinander. 
[23:13] Pilatus berief nun die Hohenpriester, die Mitglieder des Hohen Rates und das Volk 
[23:14] und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr habt mir diesen Mann vorgeführt, weil er das Volk verhetze. Nun, ihr seht, ich habe ihn in eurer Gegenwart verhört; aber ich kann an diesem Mann keine Spur der Schuld entdecken, die ihr ihm zur Last legt. 
[23:15] Auch Herodes nicht; denn er hat ihn uns zurückgesandt. Ihr seht also: er hat kein todeswürdiges Verbrechen begangen. 
[23:16] Darum will ich ihn geißeln lassen und dann in Freiheit setzen." 
[23:17]  
[23:18] Da schrien sie allesamt: "Weg mit diesem Menschen! Gib uns Barabbas los!" 
[23:19] - Der lag wegen Mordes, den er bei einem Aufruhr in der Stadt begangen hatte, im Gefängnis. — 
[23:20] Da richtete Pilatus zum zweitenmal das Wort an sie, weil er Jesus gern freigeben wollte. 
[23:21] Sie aber riefen: "Ans Kreuz, ans Kreuz mit ihm!" 
[23:22] Nun fragte er sie zum drittenmal: "Was hat denn dieser Mann verbrochen? Ich habe nichts Todeswürdiges an ihm entdecken können. Darum will ich ihn geißeln lassen und dann in Freiheit setzen." 
[23:23] Sie aber bestürmten ihn mit lautem Geschrei und verlangten, er solle gekreuzigt werden. Und ihr Geschrei drang durch: 
[23:24] Pilatus entschied zuletzt, ihr Verlangen solle erfüllt werden. 
[23:25] So entließ er, wie sie's wünschten, den Mann, der wegen eines Aufruhrs und Mordes im Gefängnis lag; Jesus aber gab er ihrem Willen preis. 
[23:26] Als sie ihn dann zur Richtstatt führten, trafen sie einen gewissen Simon, einen Mann aus Kyrene, der von einem Dorf zurückkam; dem legten sie das Kreuz auf seine Schulter, damit er es Jesus nachtrage. 
[23:27] Es folgte ihm aber eine große Menge Volks, auch viele Frauen, die um ihn trauerten und klagten. 
[23:28] Da wandte sich Jesus um zu ihnen und sprach: "Ihr Töchter von Jerusalem, weint nicht über mich; weint vielmehr über euch und über eure Kinder! 
[23:29] Denn wißt: es kommen Tage, da man sagen wird: 'Glücklich sind die Kinderlosen: glücklich sind die Leiber, die nicht geboren, und die Brüste, die nicht genährt haben!' 
[23:30] Dann wird man zu den Bergen sagen: 'Fallt über uns!' und zu den Hügeln: 'Begrabt uns!' 
[23:31] Denn wenn das grüne Holz schon so behandelt wird, was wird da erst dem dürren widerfahren?" 
[23:32] Es wurden auch noch zwei Verbrecher mit ihm zur Hinrichtung geführt. 
[23:33] Sie kamen dann an den Ort, der den Namen Schädelstätte trägt. Dort kreuzigten sie ihn und die Verbrecher, den einen zu seiner Rechten, den anderen zu seiner Linken. 
[23:34] Da sprach Jesus: "Vater, vergib ihnen; denn sie wissen nicht, was sie tun!" Dann verteilten sie seine Kleider unter sich, indem sie das Los darüber warfen. 
[23:35] Das Volk stand dabei und schaute zu. Die Mitglieder des Hohen Rates aber verhöhnten ihn und sprachen: "Anderen hat er geholfen; er rette sich nun selbst, wenn er der Gesalbte Gottes ist, der Auserwählte!" 
[23:36] Auch die Soldaten trieben ihren Spott mit ihm: sie traten hinzu, boten ihm Essig an 
[23:37] und sagten: "Bist du der Juden König, so hilf dir selbst!" 
[23:38] Es stand auch über seinem Haupt eine Inschrift mit griechischen, lateinischen und hebräischen Buchstaben; die lautete: Dies ist der Juden König. 
[23:39] Auch einer der gehenkten Verbrecher schmähte ihn: "Bist du nicht der Messias? So hilf dir selbst und uns!" 
[23:40] Der andere aber wies ihn zurecht und sprach: "Hast du denn keine Furcht vor Gott? Du leidest doch dieselbe Strafe. 
[23:41] Uns trifft sie mit vollem Recht, denn wir empfangen nur den Lohn für unsere Taten. Dieser aber hat nichts Ungehöriges getan." 
[23:42] Dann fuhr er fort: "Jesus, gedenke mein, wenn du in deiner Königsherrschaft kommst!" 
[23:43] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Wahrlich, ich sage dir: Heute noch sollst du mit mir im Paradies sein!" 
[23:44] Es war etwa um die sechste Stunde; da bedeckte Finsternis die ganze Gegend bis zu der neunten Stunde. 
[23:45] Die Sonne verlor ihren Schein, und der Tempelvorhang riß mitten entzwei. 
[23:46] Da rief Jesus mit lauter Stimme: "Vater, in deine Hände befehle ich meinen Geist!" Mit diesen Worten verschied er. 
[23:47] Der Hauptmann aber, der von diesem Vorgang Zeuge war, gab Gott die Ehre mit dem Bekenntnis: "Dieser Mann ist wirklich ohne Schuld gewesen!" 
[23:48] Und all die vielen Leute, die zu diesem Schauspiel herbeigekommen waren und sahen, was sich zutrug, schlugen sich an die Brust und kehrten in die Stadt zurück. 
[23:49] Alle seine Bekannten, auch Frauen, die ihn von Galiläa her begleitet hatten, standen von ferne und sahen dies mit an. 
[23:50] Nun war im Hohen Rat ein Mitglied namens Josef, ein trefflicher, gerechter Mann, 
[23:51] der dem Beschluß und der Handlungsweise der übrigen nicht zugestimmt hatte. Er war gebürtig aus der jüdischen Stadt Arimathäa und wartete auf Gottes Königreich. 
[23:52] Der ging zu Pilatus und bat ihn um Jesu Leichnam. 
[23:53] Dann ließ er ihn vom Kreuz herabnehmen, in feine Leinwand wickeln und in ein in Stein gehauenes Grab legen, worin noch niemand bestattet war. 
[23:54] Es war Freitag, und der Sabbat wollte anbrechen. 
[23:55] Die Frauen, die mit ihm aus Galiläa gekommen waren, gaben ihm das Geleit. Sie besahen sich das Grab und schauten zu, wie sein Leichnam beigesetzt wurde. 
[23:56] Dann kehrten sie in die Stadt zurück und besorgten Gewürzkräuter und Salben. Am Sabbat ruhten sie nach der Gesetzesvorschrift. 
[24:1] Am ersten Wochentag aber gingen sie in tiefer Morgenfrühe zum Grab und nahmen die Gewürze mit, die sie besorgt hatten. 
[24:2] Da fanden sie den Stein von dem Grab weggewälzt; 
[24:3] und als sie (in die Grabkammer) eintraten, fanden sie den Leichnam des Herrn Jesus nicht. 
[24:4] Als sie darüber betroffen waren, standen auf einmal zwei Männer in leuchtenden Gewändern bei ihnen. 
[24:5] Dieser Anblick erfüllte sie mit Furcht, und sie senkten ihren Blick zu Boden. Die Männer aber sprachen zu ihnen: "Warum sucht ihr den Lebendigen bei den Toten? 
[24:6] Er ist nicht hier, er ist auferstanden! Denkt daran, wie er zu euch geredet hat, als er noch in Galiläa war. 
[24:7] Da hat er von dem Menschensohn gesagt, er müsse in die Hände sündiger Menschen überliefert und gekreuzigt werden, aber am dritten Tag auferstehen." 
[24:8] Da gedachten sie an seine Worte. 
[24:9] Sie kehrten nun vom Grab in die Stadt zurück und berichteten das alles den elf Aposteln und allen übrigen. 
[24:10] Es waren dies aber Maria aus Magdala, Johanna und Maria, des Jakobus Mutter. Sie und die anderen Frauen erzählten das den Aposteln. 
[24:11] Denen aber erschienen diese Mitteilungen ganz märchenhaft, und sie glaubten den Frauen nicht. 
[24:12]  
[24:13] An demselben Tag gingen zwei von den Jüngern nach einem Dorf mit Namen Emmaus, das etwa anderthalb Meilen von Jerusalem entfernt war. 
[24:14] Sie redeten miteinander von allen diesen Begebenheiten. 
[24:15] Während sie sich so unterhielten und miteinander besprachen, näherte sich Jesus selbst und schloß sich ihnen auf der Wanderung an. 
[24:16] Doch ihre Augen wurden gehalten, so daß sie ihn nicht erkannten. 
[24:17] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Worüber redet ihr denn so eifrig miteinander auf euerm Weg?" Bei diesen Worten blieben sie mürrisch stehen. 
[24:18] Dann fragte ihn der eine von ihnen mit Namen Kleopas: "Bist du denn der einzige Fremdling in Jerusalem, der nichts von dem erfahren hat, was in diesen Tagen dort geschehen ist?" 
[24:19] Er sprach zu ihnen: "Was denn?" Da antworteten sie ihm: "Das, was sich ereignet hat mit Jesus von Nazaret. Der war ein Prophet, mächtig in Werk und Wort vor Gott und allem Volk. 
[24:20] Den haben unsere Hohenpriester und Obersten zur Todesstrafe ausgeliefert und kreuzigen lassen. 
[24:21] Wir aber hatten gehofft, er wäre Israels Befreier. Doch leider ist bei alledem heute schon der dritte Tag, seit dies geschehen ist. 
[24:22] Dazu haben uns noch einige Frauen aus unserem Kreis bestürzt gemacht. Die sind heute in der Frühe bei dem Grab gewesen 
[24:23] und haben seinen Leichnam nicht gefunden. Bei ihrer Rückkehr haben sie dann erzählt, es seien ihnen Engel erschienen, die hätten gesagt, er lebe. 
[24:24] Daraufhin sind einige von den Unseren zum Grab gegangen und haben es so gefunden, wie die Frauen berichtet hatten; ihn selbst aber haben sie nicht gesehen." 
[24:25] Da sprach er zu ihnen: "Wie seid ihr doch so unverständig, und wie ist euer Herz so träge, allen Worten der Propheten zu glauben! 
[24:26] Mußte denn der Messias nicht so leiden und dann in seine Herrlichkeit eingehen?" 
[24:27] Nun fing er bei Mose an, ging dann zu den Propheten über und legte ihnen aus, was sich in allen Schriften auf ihn bezog. 
[24:28] So kamen sie dem Dorf nahe, wohin sie wanderten. Da tat er so, als ob er weitergehen wolle. 
[24:29] Aber sie baten ihn dringend: "Kehre doch bei uns ein! Denn es geht zum Abend, und der Tag hat sich schon geneigt." Da trat er in das Haus, um bei ihnen zu bleiben. 
[24:30] Als er dann mit ihnen zu Tisch war, nahm er das Brot, sprach den Lobpreis darüber, brach es und gab es ihnen. 
[24:31] Da wurden ihnen die Augen geöffnet, und sie erkannten ihn. Doch er verschwand vor ihnen. 
[24:32] Da sprachen sie zueinander: "Brannte nicht unser Herz in uns, als er unterwegs mit uns redete und uns den Sinn der Schriften erschloß?" 
[24:33] Nun erhoben sie sich vom Mahl und kehrten noch in derselben Stunde nach Jerusalem zurück. Dort fanden sie die Elf mit den anderen Jüngern versammelt. 
[24:34] Die verkündigten ihnen: "Der Herr ist wahrhaftig auferstanden und Simon erschienen!" 
[24:35] Da erzählten sie auch, was sie auf ihrer Wanderung erlebt hatten, und wie er von ihnen bei dem Brechen des Brotes erkannt worden sei. 
[24:36] Während sie sich so unterhielten, trat er selbst in ihre Mitte. 
[24:37] Da gerieten sie in Angst und Furcht; denn sie meinten, einen Geist zu sehen. 
[24:38] Doch er sprach zu ihnen: "Was seid ihr so erschrocken, und warum steigen solche Gedanken in euern Herzen auf? 
[24:39] Seht meine Hände und Füße an — ich bin's ja selbst! Fühlt mich nur an, wie ihr's an mir wahrnehmt." 
[24:40]  
[24:41] Als sie aber vor freudiger Überraschung immer noch nicht glaubten und verwundert waren, fragte er sie: "Habt ihr hier etwas zu essen?" 
[24:42] Da reichten sie ihm ein Stück von einem gebratenen Fisch. 
[24:43] Das nahm er und aß es vor ihren Augen. 
[24:44] Dann sprach er zu ihnen: "Dies ist's, was ich zu euch geredet habe, als ich noch bei euch war. Da sagte ich euch, es müsse alles in Erfüllung gehen, was im Gesetz Moses, in den Propheten und den Psalmen von mir geschrieben steht. 
[24:45] Nun öffnete er ihnen den Sinn für das Verständnis der Schriften. 
[24:46] Hierauf fuhr er fort: "So steht geschrieben: Der Messias muß leiden und am dritten Tag von den Toten auferstehen, 
[24:47] und in seinem Namen sollen alle Völker aufgefordert werden, ihren Sinn zu ändern, damit sie Vergebung der Sünden empfangen. 
[24:48] In Jerusalem beginnend sollt ihr hiervon Zeugnis geben. 
[24:49] Und ich will auf euch niedersenden, was euch mein Vater verheißen hat. Ihr aber bleibt hier in der Stadt, bis ihr aus der Höhe mit Kraft gekleidet seid!" 
[24:50] Dann führte er sie hinaus bis dahin, wo es nach Bethanien geht. Da hob er seine Hände auf und segnete sie. 
[24:51] Und während er sie segnete, schied er von ihnen. 
[24:52] Sie aber kehrten hocherfreut nach Jerusalem zurück. 
[24:53] Dort waren sie beständig im Tempel und lobten Gott. 

### John

[1:1] Im Anfang (aller Dinge) war bereits das Wort; das Wort war eng vereint mit Gott, ja göttliches Wesen hatte das Wort. 
[1:2] Dies war im Anfang eng vereint mit Gott. 
[1:3] Alle Dinge sind durch das Wort erschaffen, und nichts ist ohne seine Wirksamkeit geworden. 
[1:4] Die ganze Schöpfung ist erfüllt mit seinem Leben, und dieses Leben war das Licht der Menschen. 
[1:5] Das Licht scheint (auch noch immer) in der Finsternis, denn von der Finsternis ist es nicht überwunden. 
[1:6] Ein Mann trat auf, von Gott gesandt, sein Name war Johannes. 
[1:7] Der kam, um Zeugnis abzulegen: er sollte zeugen von dem Licht, damit sie alle durch ihn zum Glauben kämen. 
[1:8] Er war nicht selbst das Licht; er hatte nur den Auftrag zu zeugen von dem Licht. 
[1:9] Das wahre Licht, das da erleuchtet jeden Menschen, war Er, der kommen sollte in die Welt. 
[1:10] Er war (schon) in der Welt, und durch ihn ist die Welt geworden, und dennoch hat die Welt ihn nicht erkannt. 
[1:11] Er kam in sein Eigentum, die Seinen aber nahmen ihn nicht auf. 
[1:12] Doch allen, die ihn aufgenommen haben, und die nun gläubig sind an seinen Namen, hat er verliehen dies Vorrecht, daß sie Gottes Kinder werden. 
[1:13] Nicht aus Geblüt der Menschen, auch nicht aus Fleischestrieb und Manneswillen, vielmehr durch Gottes Wirksamkeit ward er gezeugt. 
[1:14] So ist das Wort einst Fleisch geworden und hat für eine Weile unter uns gewohnt. Wir haben seine Herrlichkeit geschaut, ja eine Herrlichkeit, wie sie ein einziger Sohn empfängt von seinem Vater: voller Gnade und Wahrheit. 
[1:15] Johannes zeugt von ihm und ruft: "Ihn habe ich gemeint, als ich einst sagte: 'Der nach mir kommt, ist mir voraus; denn er war eher da als ich.'" 
[1:16] Aus seiner Fülle haben wir ja alle empfangen Gnade um Gnade. 
[1:17] Denn das Gesetz ward dargereicht durch Mose; die Gnade und die Wahrheit, sie sind gebracht durch Jesus Christus. 
[1:18] Kein Mensch hat jemals Gott gesehen. Der eingeborene Sohn, der in des Vaters Schoß zurückgekehrt, der hat ihn offenbart. 
[1:19] Dies ist das Zeugnis, das Johannes ablegte, als die Juden eine Abordnung von Priestern und Leviten aus Jerusalem zu ihm sandten, um ihn zu fragen, wer er sei. 
[1:20] Da legte er ein unumwundenes Bekenntnis ab; er erklärte: "Ich bin nicht der Messias." 
[1:21] Sie fragten ihn weiter: "Was bist du denn? Bist du Elia?" Er sprach: "Ich bin es nicht." "Bist du der (verheißene) Prophet?" Er antwortete: "Nein." 
[1:22] Da sagten sie zu ihm: "Wer bist du denn? Wir müssen doch denen, die uns gesandt haben, eine Antwort bringen. Wofür gibst du selbst dich aus?" 
[1:23] Er erwiderte: "Ich bin eine Stimme, die in der Wüste ruft: 'Ebnet dem Herrn dem Weg!' wie der Prophet Jesaja gesagt hat." 
[1:24] Die Abgesandten aber gehörten zu den Pharisäern. 
[1:25] Und sie fragten ihn weiter: "Warum taufst du denn, wenn du weder der Messias bist noch Elia noch der (verheißene) Prophet?" 
[1:26] Johannes erwiderte ihnen: "Ich taufe nur mit Wasser; doch mitten unter euch steht der, den ihr nicht kennt: 
[1:27] das ist der Mann, der nach mir kommt, und dessen Schuhriemen aufzulösen ich nicht würdig bin." 
[1:28] Dies geschah in Bethanien jenseits des Jordans, wo Johannes taufte. 
[1:29] Tags darauf sah er Jesus auf sich zukommen. Da sprach er: "Seht, dies ist Gottes Lamm, das die Sünde der Welt hinwegnimmt! 
[1:30] Dieser ist es, von dem ich einst gesagt habe: 'Nach mir kommt ein Mann, der mir voraus ist; denn er war eher da als ich.' 
[1:31] Auch ich habe ihn anfangs nicht gekannt; damit er aber für Israel offenbar werde, deshalb bin ich aufgetreten mit der Wassertaufe." 
[1:32] Johannes legte noch dies Zeugnis ab: "Ich habe gesehen, daß der Geist wie eine Taube aus dem Himmel herniederschwebte, und er blieb auf ihm. 
[1:33] Aber ich kannte ihn damals noch nicht. Doch er, der mich gesandt hat, um mit Wasser zu taufen, der sprach zu mir: 'Der Mann, auf den du den Geist herniederschweben siehst, so daß er auf ihm bleibt, der ist der Täufer mit dem Heiligen Geist.' 
[1:34] Das habe ich gesehen, und nun ist mein Zeugnis: 'Dieser ist Gottes Sohn.'" 
[1:35] Tags darauf stand Johannes wieder da mit Zweien seiner Jünger. 
[1:36] Da sah er Jesus vorübergehen und sprach: "Seht, dies ist Gottes Lamm!" 
[1:37] Die beiden Jünger hörten diese Worte und gingen Jesus nach. 
[1:38] Da wandte sich Jesus um, und als er sah, wie sie ihm folgten, sprach er zu ihnen: "Was wünscht ihr?" sie antworteten ihm: "Rabbi" — dies Wort bedeutet: Meister —, "wo hältst du dich auf?" 
[1:39] Er erwiderte ihnen: "Kommt mit, dann werdet ihr es sehen." Sie kamen mit und sahen, wo er wohnte, und blieben den Tag über bei ihm. Das war um die zehnte Stunde. 
[1:40] Andreas, der Bruder des Simon Petrus, war einer von den beiden, die Jesus auf das Wort des Johannes folgten. 
[1:41] Der traf zuerst seinen Bruder Simon und sprach zu ihm: "Wir haben den Messias gefunden" — dies Wort bedeutet: Gesalbter —. 
[1:42] Er führte ihn dann zu Jesus. Jesus sah ihn an und sagte: "Du bist Simon, des Johannes Sohn; du sollst Kephas heißen" — das bedeutet: Fels —. 
[1:43] Tags darauf wollte Jesus nach Galiläa ziehen. Da traf er Philippus und sprach zu ihm: "Folge mir!" 
[1:44] Philippus stammte aus Bethsaida, dem Heimatort des Andreas und Petrus. 
[1:45] Philippus traf Nathanael und sprach zu ihm: "Ihn, von dem Mose im Gesetz geschrieben und von dem die Propheten geredet, ihn haben wir gefunden. Es ist Jesus, Josefs Sohn, ein Mann aus Nazareth." 
[1:46] Nathanael sprach zu ihm: "Kann aus Nazaret etwas Gutes kommen?" Philippus antwortete ihm: "Komm mit und überzeuge dich!" 
[1:47] Als Jesus sah, wie Nathanael auf ihn zukam, sagte er von ihm: "Seht, das ist wirklich ein Israelit, in dem keine Unaufrichtigkeit ist!" 
[1:48] Nathanael sprach zu ihm: "Woher kennst du mich?" Jesus antwortete ihm: "Noch ehe dich Philippus herrief, sah ich dich, wie du unter dem Feigenbaum warst." 
[1:49] Nathanael erwiderte ihm: "Meister, du bist Gottes Sohn, du bist der König Israels!" 
[1:50] Jesus entgegnete ihm: "Glaubst du, weil ich dir gesagt habe, daß ich dich unter dem Feigenbaum gesehen? Du sollst noch Größeres erleben als dies." 
[1:51] Dann fuhr er fort: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ihr sollt den Himmel offen sehen und die Engel Gottes hinauffahren und herabsteigen über dem Menschensohn." 
[2:1] Zwei Tage später fand eine Hochzeit statt zu Kana in Galiläa. Die Mutter Jesu war dabei zugegen, 
[2:2] und auch Jesus wurde mit seinen Jüngern zu der Hochzeit eingeladen. 
[2:3] Als es an Wein mangelte, sprach die Mutter Jesu zu ihm: "Sie haben keinen Wein mehr." 
[2:4] Jesus antwortete ihr: "Was willst du von mir? Noch ist meine Stunde nicht gekommen." 
[2:5] Seine Mutter sprach zu den Dienern: "Was er euch sagt, das tut!" 
[2:6] Nun standen dort sechs steinerne Wasserkrüge, die nach jüdischer Sitte zur Reinigung bestimmt waren, und von denen jeder zwei oder drei Maß fassen konnte. 
[2:7] Jesus befahl den Dienern: "Füllt die Krüge mit Wasser!" Sie füllten sie bis zum Rand. 
[2:8] Dann sprach er weiter: "Schöpft jetzt etwas aus und bringt es dem Tafelmeister!" Sie brachten's ihm. 
[2:9] Als aber der Tafelmeister das nun in Wein verwandelte Wasser kostete, ohne zu wissen, woher es kam — nur die Diener, die das Wasser geschöpft hatten, wußten davon —, da ließ der Tafelmeister den Bräutigam rufen 
[2:10] und sprach zu ihm: "Jeder setzt seinen Gästen zuerst den guten Wein vor, und erst dann, wenn sie berauscht sind, gibt er den minderwertigen. Du hast den guten Wein bis jetzt zurückbehalten." 
[2:11] So tat Jesus zu Kana in Galiläa sein erstes Wunderzeichen. Dadurch offenbarte er seine Herrlichkeit, und seine Jünger wurden gläubig an ihn. 
[2:12] Dann ging er mit seiner Mutter, seinen Brüdern und seinen Jüngern nach Kapernaum hinab. Dort blieben sie aber nur einige Tage. 
[2:13] Denn weil das Passahfest der Juden nahe war, zog Jesus hinauf nach Jerusalem. 
[2:14] Dort fand er im Tempel außer den Geldwechslern auch die Händler sitzen, die Ochsen, Schafe und Tauben verkauften. 
[2:15] Da flocht er aus Stricken eine Geißel und trieb alle — Schafe und Ochsen — zum Tempel hinaus. Das Geld der Wechsler schüttete er auf den Boden, und ihre Tische stieß er um. 
[2:16] Den Taubenverkäufern gebot er: "Tragt dies alles weg und macht nicht meines Vaters Haus zu einem Krämerhaus!" 
[2:17] Da dachten seine Jünger an das Schriftwort: Der Eifer für dein Haus wird mich verzehren. 
[2:18] Die Juden aber fragten ihn: "Was für ein Wunderzeichen läßt du uns sehen, um zu beweisen, daß du so handeln darfst?" 
[2:19] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Reißt diesen Tempel nieder, dann will ich ihn in drei Tagen wiederbauen!" 
[2:20] Da sprachen die Juden: "Dieser Tempel ist in sechsundvierzig Jahren erbaut worden, und du willst ihn in drei Tagen aufbauen?" 
[2:21] Er aber meinte den Tempel seines Leibes. 
[2:22] Als er von den Toten auferstanden war, erinnerten sich seine Jünger dieser Worte, und sie glaubten nun der Schrift und der Belehrung, die ihnen Jesus gegeben hatte. 
[2:23] Während er nun an den Tagen des Passahfestes in Jerusalem verweilte, wurden viele an seinen Namen gläubig, weil sie die Wunderzeichen sahen, die er tat. 
[2:24] Jesus aber vertraute sich ihnen nicht an; denn er kannte alle 
[2:25] und hatte nicht nötig, daß ihm einer über den Menschen, mit dem er jedesmal zu tun hatte, näheren Aufschluß gab. Denn er kannte selbst den Herzenszustand eines jeden Menschen. 
[3:1] Unter den Pharisäern war ein Mann, mit Namen Nikodemus, ein Mitglied des jüdischen Hohen Rates. 
[3:2] Der kam bei Nacht zu Jesus und sprach zu ihm: "Meister, wir wissen, daß du ein von Gott gesandter Lehrer bist. Denn niemand kann die Wunderzeichen tun, die du vollbringst, wenn Gott nicht mit ihm ist." 
[3:3] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage dir: Wer nicht von oben her geboren wird, der kann Gottes Königreich nicht sehen." 
[3:4] Nikodemus sprach zu ihm: "Wie kann jemand in seinem hohen Alter geboren werden? Kann er denn zum zweitenmal in seiner Mutter Schoß gehen und dann geboren werden?" 
[3:5] Jesus erwiderte: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage dir: Wer nicht aus Wasser und Geist geboren wird, der kann in Gottes Königreich nicht eingehen. 
[3:6] Das aus dem Fleisch Geborene ist Fleisch, das aus dem Geist Geborene ist Geist. 
[3:7] Sei nicht erstaunt darüber, daß ich dir gesagt habe: ihr müßt von oben her geboren werden. 
[3:8] Der Wind weht, wo er will; du hörst zwar sein Brausen; aber du weißt nicht, woher er kommt und wohin er geht. Ebenso verhält sich's auch mit jedem, der aus dem Geist geboren ist." 
[3:9] Nikodemus entgegnete ihm: "Wie ist dies alles möglich?" 
[3:10] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Du bist ein so bekannter Lehrer Israels und weißt das nicht? 
[3:11] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage dir: Wir reden, was wir wissen, und bezeugen, was wir gesehen haben; trotzdem nehmt ihr unser Zeugnis nicht an. 
[3:12] Glaubt ihr nicht einmal, wenn ich von den irdischen Dingen zu euch geredet habe, wie werdet ihr da glauben, wenn ich erst von den himmlischen Dingen zu euch rede? 
[3:13] Niemand aber ist im Himmel heimisch als allein der Menschensohn, der aus dem Himmel herabgekommen ist. 
[3:14] Und wie einst Mose in der Wüste die Schlange erhöht hat, ebenso muß auch der Menschensohn erhöht werden, 
[3:15] damit jeder, der an ihn glaubt, das ewige Leben habe." 
[3:16] Denn so sehr hat Gott die Welt geliebt, daß er seinen eingeborenen Sohn gegeben hat, damit jeder, der an ihn glaubt, nicht verlorengehe, sondern das ewige Leben habe. 
[3:17] Denn Gott hat seinen Sohn nicht in die Welt gesandt, um die Welt zu richten, sondern damit die Welt durch ihn errettet werde. 
[3:18] Wer an ihn glaubt, der wird nicht gerichtet; wer aber nicht glaubt, der ist schon gerichtet, weil er nicht gläubig ist an den Namen des eingeborenen Sohnes Gottes. 
[3:19] Darin aber vollzieht sich das Gericht, daß das Licht in die Welt gekommen ist und die Menschen trotzdem die Finsternis dem Licht vorgezogen haben. Das taten sie, weil ihre Werke böse waren. 
[3:20] Denn jeder Übeltäter haßt das Licht und kommt nicht an das Licht, aus Furcht, daß seine Werke aufgedeckt und verurteilt werden. 
[3:21] Wer aber die Wahrheit tut, der kommt ans Licht, damit seine Werke offenbar werden; denn sie sind in Gott getan. 
[3:22] Darauf begab sich Jesus mit seinen Jüngern in die Landschaft Judäa. Dort blieb er mit ihnen eine Zeitlang und taufte. 
[3:23] Aber auch Johannes taufte damals in Ainon nahe bei Salim, weil dort viel Wasser war; und die Leute kamen zu ihm und ließen sich taufen. 
[3:24] Denn Johannes war noch nicht ins Gefängnis geworfen. 
[3:25] Einst stritten die Jünger des Johannes mit einem Juden über die Frage der Reinigung. 
[3:26] Da kamen sie zu Johannes und sagten ihm: "Meister, der Mann, der jenseits des Jordans bei dir war, und für den du Zeugnis abgelegt hast, der tauft jetzt auch, und alle kommen zu ihm." 
[3:27] Da antwortete Johannes: "Kein Mensch kann etwas nehmen, wenn es ihm nicht vom Himmel her gegeben ist. 
[3:28] Ihr selbst könnt mir bezeugen, daß ich gesagt habe: 'Ich bin nicht der Messias, ich bin nur sein Wegbereiter.' 
[3:29] Wer die Braut hat, ist der Bräutigam. Der Freund des Bräutigams aber, der bei ihm steht und auf seine Worte lauscht, ist voller Freude über des Bräutigams Glück. Solche Freude wird mir jetzt im vollen Maß zuteil. 
[3:30] Er muß wachsen, ich muß kleiner werden." 
[3:31] Er, der von oben kommt, ist allen überlegen. Wer von der Erde stammt, gehört (nach seiner ganzen Art) der Erde an, und auch alles, was er redet, geht von der Erde aus. Wer aus dem Himmel kommt, 
[3:32] der zeugt von dem, was er gesehen und gehört hat. Doch niemand nimmt sein Zeugnis an. 
[3:33] Wer aber sein Zeugnis annimmt, der bestätigt damit feierlich, daß Gott wahrhaftig ist. 
[3:34] Denn er, den Gott gesandt hat, redet Gottes Worte, weil Gott (ihm) den Geist nicht in beschränktem Maße gibt. 
[3:35] Der Vater liebt den Sohn, und alles hat er ihm in seine Hand gegeben. 
[3:36] Wer an den Sohn glaubt, der hat das ewige Leben. Wer aber dem Sohn nicht gehorcht, der wird kein Leben schauen; sondern Gottes Zorn lastet immerfort auf ihm. 
[4:1] Als der Herr erfuhr, die Pharisäer hätten vernommen, Jesus gewinne und taufe mehr Jünger als Johannes 
[4:2] - obwohl Jesus nicht selbst taufte, sondern nur seine Jünger —, 
[4:3] da verließ er Judäa und kehrte nach Galiläa zurück. 
[4:4] Er mußte aber durch Samaria ziehen. 
[4:5] So kam er zu einer Stadt Samarias mit Namen Sychar, die nahe bei dem Grundstück lag, das Jakob seinem Sohn Josef geschenkt hatte. 
[4:6] Dort war auch Jakobs Brunnen. Weil nun Jesus von der Wanderung müde war, setzte er sich ohne weiteres an dem Brunnen nieder. Es war um die sechste Stunde. 
[4:7] Da kam eine Samariterin, um Wasser zu schöpfen. Jesus bat sie: "Gib mir zu trinken!" 
[4:8] - Denn seine Jünger waren in die Stadt gegangen, um Lebensmittel einzukaufen. — 
[4:9] Die Samariterin antwortete ihm: "Wie kommst du als Jude dazu, mich, die Samariterin, um einen Trunk zu bitten?" — Denn die Juden haben keinen Verkehr mit den Samaritern. — 
[4:10] Jesus erwiderte ihr: "Kenntest du die Gottesgabe und wüßtest du, wer es ist, der zu dir spricht: 'Gib mir zu trinken', — so hättest du ihn (um einen Trunk) gebeten, und er hätte dir Quellwasser gegeben." 
[4:11] Da sprach das Weib zu ihm: "Herr, du hast doch kein Schöpfgefäß, und dazu ist der Brunnen tief; woher willst du da das Quellwasser nehmen? 
[4:12] Kannst du denn etwas Besseres geben als unser Vater Jakob, der uns diesen Brunnen geschenkt, aus dem er selbst mit seinen Söhnen und seinen Herden getrunken hat?" 
[4:13] Jesus antwortete: "Alle, die von dem Wasser dieses Brunnens trinken, wird nachher wieder dürsten. 
[4:14] Wer aber von dem Wasser trinkt, das ich ihm geben will, den soll in Ewigkeit nicht dürsten. Sondern das Wasser, das ich ihm geben will, soll in ihm ein Brunnquell werden, der noch im ewigen Leben Wasser spendet." 
[4:15] Die Frau sprach zu ihm: "Herr, gib mir dieses Wasser, damit ich keinen Durst mehr habe und zum Wasserschöpfen nicht mehr hierher zu kommen brauche!" 
[4:16] Jesus erwiderte ihr: "Geh, rufe deinen Mann und komm dann wieder!" 
[4:17] Die Frau antwortete: "Ich habe keinen Mann." Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Du hast ganz recht, wenn du sagst: 'Ich habe keinen Mann.' 
[4:18] Denn fünf Männer hast du schon gehabt; doch der Mann, den du jetzt hast, ist nicht dein Ehegatte. Darin hast du die Wahrheit gesprochen." 
[4:19] Die Frau entgegnete ihm: "Herr, ich sehe: du bist ein Prophet. 
[4:20] (Da habe ich nun eine Frage:) Unsere Vorfahren haben auf diesem Berg hier angebetet; ihr aber behauptet, in Jerusalem sei die Stätte, wo man anbeten müsse." 
[4:21] Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Glaube mir: die Stunde kommt, wo man weder auf diesem Berg noch in Jerusalem den Vater anbeten wird. 
[4:22] Ihr betet an, was ihr nicht kennt. Wir beten an, was wir kennen; denn das Heil geht von den Juden aus. 
[4:23] Aber die Stunde kommt und ist schon da, wo die wahren Anbeter den Vater in Geist und Wahrheit anbeten. Denn solche Anbeter will der Vater haben. 
[4:24] Gott ist Geist, und seine Anbeter müssen ihn in Geist und Wahrheit anbeten." 
[4:25] Die Frau entgegnete ihm: "Ich weiß, daß der Messias kommt" — dies Wort bedeutet: Gesalbter —; "wenn der kommt, so wird er uns über alles belehren." 
[4:26] Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Ich, der mit dir redet, ich bin der Messias!" 
[4:27] In diesem Augenblick kamen seine Jünger zurück. Sie waren verwundert, daß er mit einem Weib redete. doch keiner fragte ihn: "Was willst du von ihr?" oder: "Warum unterhältst du dich mit ihr?" 
[4:28] Die Frau nun ließ ihren Wasserkrug stehen, kehrte in die Stadt zurück und sagte den Leuten: 
[4:29] "Kommt schnell und seht einen Fremden, der mir all mein Tun aufgedeckt hat! Ist das vielleicht der Messias?" 
[4:30] Da verließen sie die Stadt und machten sich auf den Weg zu Jesus. 
[4:31] Inzwischen baten ihn die Jünger dringend: "Meister, iß doch!" 
[4:32] Er antwortete ihnen: "Für mich gibt's eine Speise, die ihr nicht kennt." 
[4:33] Da sprachen die Jünger zueinander: "Hat ihm denn einer zu essen gebracht?" 
[4:34] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Meine Speise ist, den Willen dessen zu tun, der mich gesandt hat, und sein Werk völlig auszurichten. 
[4:35] Sagt ihr nicht: 'Es sind jetzt noch vier Monate bis zur Ernte?' Nun, ich sage euch: Hebt eure Augen auf und schaut diese Felder an! Sie sind reif zur Ernte! 
[4:36] Wer diese Ernte einbringt, empfängt schon dadurch Belohnung, daß er Frucht fürs ewige Leben sammelt: so sollen sich der Sämann und der Schnitter miteinander freuen. 
[4:37] Denn hier trifft das Sprichwort zu: Der eine sät, der andere erntet. 
[4:38] Ich habe euch gesandt, um dort zu ernten, wo ihr euch vorher nicht abgemüht. Andere haben sich gemüht, und ihr erntet die Früchte ihrer mühevollen Arbeit." 
[4:39] Viele aber von den Samaritern aus jener Stadt wurden schon deshalb an ihn gläubig, weil die Frau versicherte: "Er hat mir all mein Tun aufgedeckt." 
[4:40] Als nun die Samariter zu ihm kamen, baten sie ihn, bei ihnen Aufenthalt zu nehmen. Er blieb auch zwei Tage dort. 
[4:41] Da kamen noch viel mehr zum Glauben durch seine Unterweisung, 
[4:42] und sie sprachen zu der Frau: "Wir glauben nun nicht mehr allein auf deine Erzählung hin. Denn wir haben jetzt mit eigenen Ohren gehört und wissen: Dieser Mann ist wahrhaftig der Welterlöser." 
[4:43] Nach Verlauf der beiden Tage zog Jesus von dort nach Galiläa weiter, 
[4:44] obwohl er selbst erklärt hatte, daß ein Prophet in seiner eigenen Heimat keine Anerkennung finde. 
[4:45] Als er aber nach Galiläa kam, nahmen ihn die Galiläer freundlich auf, weil sie in Jerusalem während des Festes gewesen waren und dort alle seine Taten gesehen hatten. 
[4:46] Er kam dann wieder nach Kana in Galiläa, wo er das Wasser in Wein verwandelt hatte. 
[4:47] Nun wohnte in Kapernaum ein königlicher Hofbeamter, dessen Sohn an einer (schweren) Krankheit litt. Als dieser Mann erfuhr, Jesus sei aus Judäa nach Galiläa gekommen, da ging er zu ihm und bat ihn, herzukommen und seinen Sohn zu heilen. Denn er lag im Sterben. 
[4:48] Jesus aber sprach zu dem Mann: "Wenn ihr nicht Zeichen und Wunder seht, so glaubt ihr nicht." 
[4:49] Der Beamte bat ihn: "Herr, komm doch, ehe mein Kind stirbt!" 
[4:50] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Geh nur heim, dein Sohn bleibt am Leben!" Der Mann glaubte diesem Wort, das Jesus zu ihm sprach, und ging weg. 
[4:51] Er war noch auf dem Heimweg, als ihm seine Knechte entgegenkamen mit der Nachricht, daß sein Sohn am Leben sei. 
[4:52] Da fragte er sie, in welcher Stunde sich sein Zustand gebessert habe. Sie antworteten ihm: "Gestern in der siebenten Stunde hat ihn das Fieber verlassen." 
[4:53] Da erkannte der Vater, daß es genau die Stunde war, wo Jesus zu ihm gesagt hatte: "Dein Sohn bleibt am Leben!" Und er wurde mit seinem ganzen Haus gläubig. 
[4:54] Dies ist das zweite Wunderzeichen, das Jesus in Galiläa nach seiner Rückkehr aus Judäa tat. 
[5:1] Darauf war ein Fest der Juden, und Jesus zog hinauf nach Jerusalem. 
[5:2] In Jerusalem liegt dicht bei dem Schaftor ein Teich, der heißt auf hebräisch Bethzatha und hat fünf Hallen. 
[5:3] Darin lagen viele Kranke: Blinde, Lahme und Schwindsüchtige. 
[5:4]  
[5:5] Nun war ein Mann da, der schon achtunddreißig Jahre an seiner Krankheit gelitten hatte. 
[5:6] Als Jesus den daliegen sah und erfuhr, daß er schon so lange leidend gewesen war, fragte er ihn: "Willst du gesund werden?" 
[5:7] Der Kranke antwortete ihm: "Herr, ich habe keinen Menschen, der mich, wenn das Wasser in Bewegung kommt, schnell in den Teich hineinbringt. Während ich dann hingehe, steigt schon ein anderer vor mir hinab." 
[5:8] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Steh auf, nimm dein Bett und geh!" 
[5:9] Sofort ward der Mann gesund: er nahm sein Bett und konnte gehen. Dies geschah an einem Sabbat. 
[5:10] Da sprachen die Juden zu dem Geheilten: "Heute ist Sabbat; da darfst du nicht dein Bett tragen!" 
[5:11] Er aber antwortete ihnen: "Der Mann, der mich gesund gemacht hat, der hat zu mir gesagt: 'Nimm dein Bett und geh!'" 
[5:12] Da fragten sie ihn: "Wer ist der Mann, der zu dir gesagt hat: 'Nimm dein Bett und geh?'" 
[5:13] Der Geheilte aber wußte nicht, wer es war. Denn Jesus hatte sich damals (um Aufsehen zu vermeiden) unbemerkt entfernt, weil viele Leute an dem Ort waren. 
[5:14] Später traf ihn Jesus im Tempel und sprach zu ihm: "Du bist jetzt gesund geworden; sündige nun nicht wieder, damit dir nicht noch Schlimmeres widerfahre!" 
[5:15] Da ging der Mann hin und teilte den Juden mit, Jesus habe ihn gesund gemacht. 
[5:16] Weil Jesus solche Werke am Sabbat tat, begannen ihn die Juden zu verfolgen. 
[5:17] Jesus aber sprach zu ihnen: "Mein Vater wirkt unaufhörlich, und ebenso wirke ich." 
[5:18] Deshalb trachteten ihm die Juden noch viel mehr nach dem Leben, weil er nicht nur den Sabbat brach, sondern auch behauptete, Gott sei in besonderem Sinn sein Vater, und sich damit Gott gleichstelle. 
[5:19] Da nahm Jesus das Wort und sprach zu ihnen: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Der Sohn kann nichts aus eigener Vollmacht tun; er tut nur das, was er den Vater tun sieht. Denn was der tut, das tut der Sohn in gleicher Weise. 
[5:20] Denn der Vater hat den Sohn lieb und zeigt ihm alles, was er selber tut. Ja größere Werke noch als diese wird er ihm zeigen, daß ihr euch wundern sollt. 
[5:21] Denn wie der Vater die Toten auferweckt und sie lebendig macht, so auch der Sohn: er macht lebendig, wen er will. 
[5:22] Denn nicht der Vater ist's, der jemand richtet, er hat vielmehr das Richten ganz dem Sohn übertragen, 
[5:23] damit alle ihn, den Sohn, so ehren, wie sie den Vater ehren. Wer den Sohn nicht ehrt, der ehrt auch nicht den Vater, der den Sohn gesandt. 
[5:24] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer meinem Wort gehorcht und glaubt dem, der mich gesandt, der hat das ewige Leben und kommt in kein Gericht, er ist vielmehr vom Tod durchgedrungen in das Leben. 
[5:25] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Es kommt die Stunde, ja sie ist schon da, wo die Toten des Gottessohnes Stimme hören, und alle, die ihr folgen, sollen leben. 
[5:26] Denn wie der Vater Leben in sich trägt, so hat er auch dem Sohn verliehen, Leben in sich zu tragen. 
[5:27] Ja, er hat ihm die Macht gegeben, Gericht zu halten; denn er ist Menschensohn. 
[5:28] Seid nicht darob verwundert, daß die Stunde kommt, da alle in den Gräbern seine Stimme hören. 
[5:29] Dann werden sie hervorgehen: Die da gut gehandelt haben, zu einer Auferstehung, die das Leben bringt, und die das Böse ausgeführt, zur Auferstehung des Gerichts. 
[5:30] Ich kann nichts eigenmächtig tun. So wie ich höre, richte ich, und dies mein Urteil ist gerecht, weil ich nicht meinen Willen auszuführen suche, vielmehr den Willen des, der mich gesandt. 
[5:31] Wenn ich nur zeugen wollte für mich selbst, mein Zeugnis hätte keine Gültigkeit. 
[5:32] Ein anderer ist's, der für mich zeugt. Ich weiß auch, daß das Zeugnis wahr ist, das er für mich ablegt. 
[5:33] Ihr sandtet zu Johannes, der hat gezeugt für die Wahrheit. 
[5:34] Ich aber nehme nicht von einem Menschen Zeugnis an. Ich rede nur davon, damit ihr Rettung findet. 
[5:35] Er war die Leuchte, die mit hellem Schein brannte, ihr aber wolltet euch nur eine Weile freuen an jenem Lichterglanz, den er strahlen ließ. 
[5:36] Das Zeugnis aber, das ich habe, steht höher als das Zeugnis des Johannes: Denn die Werke, die ich in meines Vaters Auftrag auszurichten habe, — die Werke, die ich tue —, die legen Zeugnis ab, daß mich der Vater hat gesandt. 
[5:37] Und auch der Vater selbst, der mich gesandt, hat Zeugnis für mich abgelegt. Des Vaters Stimme habt ihr nie gehört, sein Aussehen habt ihr nie geschaut. 
[5:38] Sein Wort habt ihr nicht in euch wohnen; denn dem, den er gesandt, dem glaubt ihr nicht. 
[5:39] Ihr forscht wohl in den Schriften; denn ihr meint, schon darin hättet ihr das ewige Leben, und sie sind's auch, die von mir zeugen. 
[5:40] Trotzdem wollt ihr nicht zu mir kommen, damit ihr Leben habt. 
[5:41] Ehre, die von Menschen kommt, die weise ich zurück. 
[5:42] Euch aber kenne ich genau und weiß, daß ihr die Gottesliebe nicht in euern Herzen habt. 
[5:43] Ich bin in meines Vaters Namen aufgetreten, doch ihr nehmt mich nicht an. Tritt einst ein anderer auf in seinem eigenen Namen, den werdet ihr annehmen. 
[5:44] Wie könnt ihr zum Glauben kommen, wenn ihr euch ehren laßt von euresgleichen und nicht nach jener Ehre trachtet, die von dem einen Gott kommt? 
[5:45] Denkt nicht, ich wolle euch verklagen bei dem Vater. Es ist schon einer da, der euch verklagt: Mose, auf den ihr eure Hoffnung setzt. 
[5:46] Denn wenn ihr Mose glaubtet, so glaubtet ihr auch mir. Von mir hat jener ja geschrieben. 
[5:47] Glaubt ihr nun aber Moses Schriften nicht, wie werdet ihr da meinen Worten glauben?" 
[6:1] Hierauf begab sich Jesus auf die andere Seite des Sees von Galiläa oder von Tiberias. 
[6:2] Eine große Volksmenge begleitete ihn dorthin, weil sie die Zeichen sahen, die er an den Kranken tat. 
[6:3] Jesus ging dann auf die Berghöhe und blieb dort mit seinen Jüngern. 
[6:4] Das jüdische Passahfest aber stand nahe bevor. 
[6:5] Als nun Jesus seine Augen aufhob und eine große Volksmenge zu sich kommen sah, sprach er zu Philippus: "Woher sollen wir Brot kaufen, damit diese alle zu essen haben?" 
[6:6] - So fragte er aber nur, um ihn zu prüfen; denn er selbst wußte schon, was er tun wollte. — 
[6:7] Philippus antwortete ihm: "Für zweihundert Silberlinge Brot wäre nicht genug für sie; da würde jeder nur ein kleines Stück bekommen." 
[6:8] Einer seiner Jünger, Andreas, der Bruder des Simon Petrus, sprach zu ihm: 
[6:9] "Hier ist ein Knabe, der hat fünf Gerstenbrote und zwei Fische. Doch was ist das für so viele?" 
[6:10] Jesus aber gebot: "Laßt die Leute sich auf den Boden lagern!" Es war dort nämlich reicher Graswuchs. Da lagerten sich an Männern ungefähr fünftausend. 
[6:11] Nun nahm Jesus die Brote, sprach das Dankgebet und ließ sie den Gelagerten austeilen. Ebenso verfuhr er mit den Fischen; und jeder nahm davon, soviel er wollte. 
[6:12] Als sie gesättigt waren, sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Sammelt die übriggebliebenen Brocken, damit nichts umkomme!" 
[6:13] Das taten sie und füllten von den fünf Gerstenbroten zwölf große Körbe mit Brocken, die beim Essen übriggeblieben waren. 
[6:14] Als die Leute erfuhren, welches Zeichen er getan hatte, da sprachen sie: "Dies ist wahrhaftig der Prophet, der in die Welt kommen soll!" 
[6:15] Da aber Jesus merkte, daß sie kommen und ihn mit Gewalt wegführen wollten, um ihn zum König zu machen, zog er sich ganz allein aufs neue ins Gebirge zurück. 
[6:16] Am späten Abend gingen seine Jünger an den See hinab. 
[6:17] Sie stiegen in ein Boot und machten sich auf die Fahrt nach Kapernaum, das am anderen Ufer des Sees lag. Es war schon dunkel geworden, und Jesus war noch immer nicht zu ihnen zurückgekehrt. 
[6:18] Der See aber wurde durch einen starken Wind heftig aufgeregt. 
[6:19] Als sie nun etwa zweieinhalb bis drei Seemeilen gefahren waren, sahen sie, wie Jesus auf dem See wandelte und sich ihrem Boot näherte. Da erschraken sie. 
[6:20] Er aber rief ihnen zu: "Ich bin's, fürchtet euch nicht!" 
[6:21] Nun wollten sie ihn in das Boot aufnehmen. Da war das Boot mit einemmal am Land und zwar an der Stelle, wohin sie fahren wollten. 
[6:22] Tags darauf erfuhren die Leute, die am jenseitigen Ufer des Sees geblieben waren, es sei nur ein einziges Fahrzeug dagewesen, Jesus aber habe es nicht zugleich mit seinen Jüngern bestiegen, sondern seine Jünger seien allein abgefahren. 
[6:23] Andere Boote kamen unterdes aus Tiberias; die landeten nahe bei der Stätte, wo die Leute nach dem Dankgebet des Herrn das Brot gegessen hatten. 
[6:24] Da nun die Menge sah, daß weder Jesus noch seine Jünger dort waren, bestiegen sie auch die Boote und fuhren nach Kapernaum, um Jesus dort zu suchen. 
[6:25] Als sie ihn hier auf der anderen Seite des Sees fanden, fragten sie ihn: "Meister, wann bist du hier angekommen?" 
[6:26] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ihr sucht mich nicht deshalb auf, weil ihr Wunderzeichen gesehen, sondern weil ihr von den Broten gegessen habt und satt geworden seid. 
[6:27] Müht euch nicht um vergängliche Speise, sondern um die Speise, die bis ins ewige Leben vorhält und die der Menschensohn euch geben wird! Denn ihn hat Gott der Vater dazu beglaubigt." 
[6:28] Da fragten sie ihn: "Was müssen wir denn tun, um die von Gott gewollten Werke zu verrichten?" 
[6:29] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Dies ist das von Gott gewollte Werk, daß ihr glauben sollt an den, den er gesandt hat." 
[6:30] Da fragten sie ihn: "Was für ein Zeichen tust du denn, damit wir's sehen und an dich gläubig werden? Wie weist du dich aus? 
[6:31] Unsere Väter haben in der Wüste das Manna gegessen, wie geschrieben steht: Er gab ihnen Himmelsbrot zu essen." 
[6:32] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Nicht Mose hat euch das Himmelsbrot gegeben, sondern mein Vater gibt euch das wahre Himmelsbrot. 
[6:33] Denn Gottes Brot kommt vom Himmel herab und gibt der Welt das Leben." 
[6:34] Da sprachen sie zu ihm: "Herr, gib uns stets solches Brot!" 
[6:35] Jesus entgegnete ihnen: "Ich bin das Brot des Lebens. Wer zu mir kommt, den wird nie hungern, und wer an mich glaubt, den wird niemals dürsten. 
[6:36] Aber ich habe euch schon gesagt: Obwohl ihr mich gesehen habt, glaubt ihr doch nicht. 
[6:37] Alles, was mir der Vater gibt, das wird zu mir kommen; und wer zu mir kommt, den will ich nicht hinausstoßen. 
[6:38] Denn ich bin vom Himmel herabgekommen, nicht um zu tun, was mir beliebt, sondern um den Willen dessen auszuführen, der mich gesandt hat. 
[6:39] Das aber ist der Wille des, der mich gesandt, daß ich nichts verlorengehen lasse von allem, was er mir gegeben hat, sondern es am Jüngsten Tag auferwecke. 
[6:40] Denn dies ist meines Vaters Wille, daß jeder, der auf den Sohn schaut und an ihn glaubt, das ewige Leben habe und ich ihn am Jüngsten Tag auferwecke." 
[6:41] Da murrten die Juden über ihn, weil er gesagt hatte: "Ich bin das Brot, das vom Himmel herabgekommen ist." 
[6:42] Sie sprachen: "Ist dieser Mann nicht Josefs Sohn, dessen Vater und Mutter wir kennen? Wie kann er denn jetzt sagen: 'Ich bin vom Himmel herabgekommen'?" 
[6:43] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Murrt nicht untereinander! 
[6:44] Niemand kann zu mir kommen, wenn ihn nicht zieht der Vater, der mich gesandt hat, und ich will ihn dann am Jüngsten Tag auferwecken. 
[6:45] In den Schriften der Propheten findet sich die Stelle: Sie werden alle von Gott unterwiesen sein. Wer auf des Vaters Worte hört und von ihm lernt, der kommt zu mir. 
[6:46] Damit will ich nicht sagen, daß jemand den Vater gesehen hätte. Nur der eine, der von Gott gekommen ist, nur der hat den Vater gesehen. 
[6:47] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer glaubt, der hat ewiges Leben. 
[6:48] Ich bin das Brot des Lebens. 
[6:49] Eure Väter haben einst in der Wüste das Manna gegessen und sind trotzdem gestorben. 
[6:50] Hier ist das Brot, das vom Himmel herabkommt, damit man davon esse und nicht sterbe. 
[6:51] Ich bin das lebendige Brot, das vom Himmel herabgekommen ist. Wer von diesem Brot ißt, wird ewig leben. Das Brot aber, das ich geben werde, ist mein Fleisch: dies Brot gereicht der Welt zum Leben." 
[6:52] Da gerieten die Juden in Aufregung. "Wie", so fragten sie, "kann uns dieser Mann sein Fleisch zu essen geben?" 
[6:53] Jesus antwortete: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Eßt ihr nicht das Fleisch des Menschensohnes und trinkt ihr nicht sein Blut, so habt ihr kein Leben in euch. 
[6:54] Wer mein Fleisch ißt und mein Blut trinkt, der hat ewiges Leben, und den werde ich am Jüngsten Tag auferwecken. 
[6:55] Denn mein Fleisch ist wirklich Speise, und mein Blut ist wirklich Trank. 
[6:56] Wer mein Fleisch ißt und mein Blut trinkt, der bleibt in mir, und ich bleibe in ihm. 
[6:57] Wie mich der lebendige Vater gesandt hat und ich lebe, weil der Vater lebt, ebenso wird auch der, der mich ißt, leben, weil ich lebe. 
[6:58] So ist das Brot beschaffen, das vom Himmel herabgekommen ist. Dies Brot ist anders als das Manna, das eure Väter gegessen haben: sie sind trotzdem gestorben. Wer aber dies mein Brot ißt, der wird ewig leben." 
[6:59] Diese Worte sprach er, als er in dem Versammlungshaus zu Kapernaum lehrte. 
[6:60] Viele nun von seinen Jüngern, die dies hörten, sagten: "Das ist eine unerträgliche Rede; wer kann die mit anhören?" 
[6:61] Jesus merkte, daß seine Jünger mit seinen Worten unzufrieden waren, und er fragte sie: "Daran nehmt ihr Anstoß? 
[6:62] Was werdet ihr dann erst sagen, wenn ihr mit euern Augen seht, wie der Menschensohn dorthin emporsteigt, wo er einst gewesen ist? 
[6:63] Der Geist ist's, der lebendig macht. Das Fleisch hat keinen Wert. Die Worte, die ich zu euch geredet habe, sind Geist und Leben. 
[6:64] Aber es gibt einige unter euch, die glauben nicht." — Denn Jesus wußte von Anfang an, wer nicht zum Glauben kommen und auch, wer ihn verraten würde. — 
[6:65] Dann fuhr er fort: "Aus diesem Grund habe ich euch gesagt: Niemand kann zu mir kommen, wenn ihm der Vater nicht die Fähigkeit dazu verleiht." 
[6:66] Dieser Rede wegen verließen ihn viele seiner Jünger und begleiteten ihn nicht mehr auf seinen Wanderungen. 
[6:67] Da fragte Jesus die Zwölf: "Ihr wollt doch nicht auch weggehen?" 
[6:68] Simon Petrus antwortete ihm: "Herr, zu wem sollten wir gehen? Du hast Worte des ewigen Lebens; 
[6:69] und wir haben geglaubt und erkannt, daß du der Heilige Gottes bist." 
[6:70] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Habe ich nicht euch, die Zwölf, mir auserkoren? Und doch ist einer von euch ein Teufel!" 
[6:71] Damit meinte er den Judas, den Simons Sohn aus Kariot. Denn der sollte sein Verräter werden, und er war doch einer von den Zwölf. 
[7:1] Danach zog Jesus weiter in Galiläa umher. Denn in Judäa wollte er (zunächst) nicht wirken, weil ihm die Juden (dort) nach dem Leben trachteten. 
[7:2] Nun war das jüdische Laubhüttenfest vor der Tür. 
[7:3] Da sprachen seine Brüder zu ihm: "Verlaß diese Gegend und geh nach Judäa, damit auch deine Jünger (dort) solche Wunderwerke schauen, wie du sie hier tust. 
[7:4] Denn niemand zieht sich mit seinem Wirken ins Verborgene zurück, wenn er öffentliche Anerkennung sucht. Da du ja solche Werke tust, so zeige dich vor aller Welt!" 
[7:5] - Denn nicht einmal seine Brüder glaubten an ihn. — 
[7:6] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Meine Zeit ist noch nicht da; aber für euch ist jede Zeit gelegen. 
[7:7] Euch kann die Welt nicht hassen, mich aber haßt sie; denn ich gebe von ihr Zeugnis, daß ihre Werke böse sind. 
[7:8] Geht ihr nur hin zum Fest; ich gehe noch nicht zu diesem Fest, denn meine Zeit ist noch nicht erfüllt." 
[7:9] So sagte er und blieb in Galiläa. 
[7:10] Als aber seine Brüder zu dem Fest gegangen waren, da zog auch er (nach Jerusalem) hinauf, jedoch nicht öffentlich, sondern gleichsam heimlich. 
[7:11] Die Juden suchten ihn am Fest und fragten: "Wo ist er denn?" 
[7:12] Auch im Volk wurde viel von ihm gesprochen. Die einen meinten: "Er ist ein wackerer Mann." Andere sagten: "Nein, er verführt die Leute." 
[7:13] Niemand aber wagte frei und offen von ihm zu reden, weil sich alle vor den Juden fürchteten. 
[7:14] Das Fest war schon halb zu Ende, als Jesus in den Tempel ging und lehrte. 
[7:15] Darüber waren die Juden erstaunt. "Wie ist's möglich", so fragten sie, "daß dieser Mann, der keine Schule besucht hat, in der Schriftgelehrsamkeit so gut bewandert ist?" 
[7:16] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Was ich lehre, das habe ich nicht von mir selbst, sondern von dem, der mich gesandt hat. 
[7:17] Wer dessen Willen zu tun entschlossen ist, der wird auch zu der Erkenntnis kommen, ob das, was ich lehre, von Gott stammt, oder ob ich aus mir selber rede. 
[7:18] Wer aus sich selber redet, der sucht seine eigene Ehre. Wer aber die Ehre dessen sucht, der ihn gesandt hat, der ist wahrhaftig, und in dem ist keine Ungerechtigkeit. 
[7:19] Hat euch nicht Mose das Gesetz gegeben? Und doch erfüllt es niemand unter euch! Mit welchem Recht sucht ihr mich zu töten?" 
[7:20] Das Volk gab ihm zur Antwort: "Du bist von einem bösen Geist besessen; wer sucht dich denn zu töten?" 
[7:21] Jesus erwiderte: "Ein einzig Wunderwerk, das ich hier getan, hat euch alle mit Staunen erfüllt. 
[7:22] Bedenkt nun: Mose hat euch die Beschneidung gegeben — nicht als hätte sie erst Mose vorgeschrieben, sie stammt schon von den Erzvätern —, und auch am Sabbat vollzieht ihr die Beschneidung. 
[7:23] Wenn man nun, um nicht Moses Gesetz zu übertreten, am Sabbat einen Menschen beschneidet: wollt ihr mir da zürnen, daß ich am Sabbat einen Menschen am ganzen Leib gesund gemacht habe? 
[7:24] Urteilt nicht nach dem bloßen Augenschein, urteilt vielmehr, wie es recht und billig ist!" 
[7:25] Da sagten einige Leute aus Jerusalem: "Ist das nicht der Mann, den man zu töten sucht? 
[7:26] Und doch redet er hier ganz öffentlich, und man sagt ihm nichts! Sollten etwa die Männer im Hohen Rat wirklich zu der Erkenntnis gekommen sein, daß dies der Messias ist? 
[7:27] Doch (das ist ganz unmöglich, denn) von diesem Mann wissen wir ja, woher er stammt; des Messias Herkunft aber kennt niemand, wenn er auftritt." 
[7:28] Als nun Jesus im Tempel lehrte, rief er mit lauter Stimme: "Ja, ihr kennt mich und wißt, woher ich stamme. Und doch bin ich nicht nach eigener Meinung aufgetreten, sondern es ist wirklich einer da, der mich gesandt hat. Den kennt ihr freilich nicht. 
[7:29] Ich aber kenne ihn, denn ich komme von ihm, und er hat mich gesandt." 
[7:30] Da suchten sie ihn festzunehmen. Trotzdem legte niemand Hand an ihn, denn seine Stunde war noch nicht gekommen. 
[7:31] Aus dem Volk aber wurden viele an ihn gläubig und sprachen: "Wenn der Messias kommt, wird der dann wohl mehr Wunderzeichen tun, als dieser Mann getan hat?" 
[7:32] Die Pharisäer hörten von diesen Reden, die im Volk über ihn umgingen. Darum sandten sie im Einvernehmen mit den Hohenpriestern einige Diener des Hohen Rates ab, die ihn gefangennehmen sollten. 
[7:33] Da sprach Jesus: "Nur noch kurze Zeit bin ich bei euch. Dann gehe ich hin zu dem, der mich gesandt hat. 
[7:34] Ihr werdet (hilfsverlangend) nach mir suchen, aber mich nicht finden; denn wo ich dann bin, dorthin könnt ihr nicht kommen." 
[7:35] Da sprachen die Juden zueinander: "Wohin will er denn gehen, daß wir ihn nicht finden sollen? Will er etwa zu den Juden gehen, die unter den Heiden zerstreut leben, und die Heiden lehren? 
[7:36] Was meint er wohl mit diesem Wort: 'Ihr werdet (hilfsverlangend) nach mir suchen, aber mich nicht finden; denn wo ich dann bin, dorthin könnt ihr nicht kommen'?" 
[7:37] Am letzten Tag des Festes aber, der besonders feierlich war, stand Jesus da und rief mit lauter Stimme: "Wen da dürstet, der komme zu mir und trinke! 
[7:38] Wer an mich glaubt, aus dessen Leib werden, wie die Schrift sagt, Ströme lebendigen Wassers fließen." 
[7:39] Damit wies er auf den Geist hin, den seine Gläubigen empfangen sollten. Denn damals war der Heilige Geist noch nicht gegeben, weil Jesus noch nicht zur Herrlichkeit erhoben war. 
[7:40] Manche aus dem Volk sagten, als sie diese Worte hörten: "Das ist wahrhaftig der Prophet!" 
[7:41] Andere meinten: "Er ist der Messias." Wieder andere sprachen: "Der Messias kommt doch nicht aus Galiläa? 
[7:42] Heißt's nicht in der Schrift: Der Messias kommt aus dem Geschlecht Davids und aus der Ortschaft Bethlehem, wo David wohnte?" 
[7:43] So war die Meinung im Volk über ihn geteilt. 
[7:44] Einige aber aus der Menge hatten Lust, ihn festzunehmen; doch niemand legte Hand an ihn. 
[7:45] Die Diener kamen zu den Hohenpriestern und den Pharisäern zurück. Die fragten sie: "Warum habt ihr ihn nicht mitgebracht?" 
[7:46] Die Diener erwiderten: "So wie der hat noch nie ein Mensch geredet." 
[7:47] Da entgegneten ihnen die Pharisäer: "Habt ihr euch auch vielleicht verführen lassen? 
[7:48] Ist denn einer aus dem Hohen Rat oder von den Pharisäern zum Glauben an ihn gekommen? 
[7:49] Nein, nur dieser verfluchte Pöbel, der das Gesetz nicht kennt!" 
[7:50] Da fragte sie Nikodemus, einer aus ihrem Kreis, derselbe, der vordem zu Jesus gekommen war: 
[7:51] "Verurteilt denn unser Gesetz einen Menschen, ohne daß man ihn zuvor verhört und seine Schuld erwiesen hat?" 
[7:52] Sie antworteten ihm: "Bist du auch aus Galiläa?" Forsche nach, und du wirst sehen, daß kein Prophet aus Galiläa stammt!" 
[7:53] Dann gingen sie weg, ein jeder in sein Haus. 
[8:1] Jesus aber ging auf den Ölberg. 
[8:2] Frühmorgens erschien er wieder im Tempel, und alles Volk kam zu ihm. Da setzte er sich nieder und lehrte sie. 
[8:3] Die Schriftgelehrten aber und die Pharisäer brachten eine Frau zu ihm, die beim Ehebruch ertappt war, und stellten sie mitten auf den Platz. 
[8:4] Dann sprachen sie zu ihm: "Meister, diese Frau ist auf frischer Tat beim Ehebruch ertappt. 
[8:5] Nun hat uns Moses im Gesetz befohlen, eine solche Frau zu steinigen. Was sagst du dazu?" 
[8:6] Mit dieser Frage wollten sie ihm eine Falle stellen, damit sie einen Grund zur Anklage gegen ihn hätten. Jesus aber bückte sich nieder und schrieb mit seinem Finger auf die Erde. 
[8:7] Als sie dann ihre Frage mehrfach wiederholten, sah er auf und sprach zu ihnen: "Wer von euch ohne Sünde ist, der werfe den ersten Stein auf sie!" 
[8:8] Dann bückte er sich wieder und schrieb auf die Erde. 
[8:9] Sie aber gingen nach dieser Antwort einer nach dem anderen weg, die Ältesten zuerst. Nur Jesus allein blieb da mit der Frau, die mitten auf dem Platz stand. 
[8:10] Da blickte Jesus auf und sprach zu ihr: "Wo sind deine Ankläger? Hat dich keiner verurteilt?" 
[8:11] Sie antwortete: "Nein, Herr!" Da sprach er zu ihr: "Auch ich verurteile dich nicht. Geh, sündige hinfort nicht mehr!" 
[8:12] Dann redete Jesus abermals zu ihnen und sprach: "Ich bin das Licht der Welt. Wer mir folgt, der wird nicht in der Finsternis wandeln, sondern er wird das Licht des Lebens haben." 
[8:13] Da sprachen die Pharisäer zu ihm: "Du legst für dich selbst Zeugnis ab. Darum gilt dein Zeugnis nicht." 
[8:14] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Auch wenn ich für mich selbst Zeugnis ablege, so ist mein Zeugnis gültig; denn ich weiß, woher ich gekommen bin oder wohin ich gehe. Ihr aber wißt nicht, woher ich komme oder wohin ich gehe. 
[8:15] Ihr richtet nach dem äußeren Schein, ich richte niemand. 
[8:16] Wenn ich aber richte, so ist mein Urteil recht. Denn ich bin's nicht allein, der richtet, sondern mit mir richtet auch der Vater, der mich gesandt hat. 
[8:17] Nun steht aber auch in euerm Gesetz geschrieben, daß das Zeugnis zweier gültig ist. 
[8:18] Ich lege Zeugnis für mich ab, und auch der Vater, der mich gesandt, legt Zeugnis für mich ab." 
[8:19] Da sprachen sie zu ihm: "Wo ist denn dein Vater?" Jesus antwortete: "Ihr kennt meinen Vater so wenig wie mich. Kenntet ihr mich, so kenntet ihr auch meinen Vater." 
[8:20] Diese Worte sprach er in der Nähe des Opferstockes, als er im Tempel lehrte. Doch niemand legte Hand an ihn, denn seine Stunde war noch nicht gekommen. 
[8:21] Noch einmal sprach er dann zu ihnen: "Ich will nun weggehen. Ihr werdet mich dann (hilfsverlangend) suchen; doch ihr sollt in eurer Sünde sterben. Wohin ich gehe, dorthin könnt ihr nicht kommen." 
[8:22] Da fragten die Juden: "Will er sich etwa das Leben nehmen, weil er sagt: 'Wohin ich gehe, dorthin könnt ihr nicht kommen?" 
[8:23] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ihr stammt von unten her; ich stamme von oben her. Ihr gehört zu dieser Welt, ich gehöre nicht zu dieser Welt. 
[8:24] Darum habe ich euch gesagt, daß ihr in euern Sünden sterben sollt. Denn glaubt ihr nicht, daß ich es bin, so werdet ihr in euern Sünden sterben." 
[8:25] Da fragten sie ihn: "Wer bist du denn?" Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Überhaupt — warum rede ich nur noch zu euch? 
[8:26] Viel habe ich freilich über euch zu reden und zu richten. Doch er, der mich gesandt hat, ist zuverlässig; und was ich von ihm gehört habe, das rede ich nun in der Welt." 
[8:27] Sie verstanden aber nicht, daß er zu ihnen von dem Vater redete. 
[8:28] Darum fuhr Jesus fort: "Wenn ihr den Menschensohn erhöht habt, dann werdet ihr verstehen, daß ich (der Messias) bin. Aus eigener Befugnis tue ich nichts, sondern nach der Unterweisung meines Vaters trage ich meine Lehre vor. 
[8:29] Und er, der mich gesandt, steht mir zur Seite. Er hat mich nie allein gelassen; denn ich tue allezeit, was ihm gefällt." 
[8:30] Als er so redete, wurden viele an ihn gläubig. 
[8:31] Jesus sprach dann zu diesen Juden, die nun an ihn glaubten: "Haltet ihr an meiner Lehre fest, so seid ihr wirklich meine Jünger. 
[8:32] Dann werdet ihr auch die Wahrheit erkennen, und die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen." 
[8:33] Da antworteten sie ihm: "Wir sind Abrahams Nachkommen und haben niemals jemand als leibeigene Knechte gedient. Wie kannst du da sagen: 'Ihr sollt frei werden?'" 
[8:34] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer Sünde tut, der ist der Sünde Knecht. 
[8:35] Nun hat ein Knecht im Haus (seines Herrn) keine bleibende Wohnstatt; ein Sohn dagegen hat im Vaterhaus bleibend Recht. 
[8:36] Macht euch also der Sohn frei, so werdet ihr wirklich frei sein. 
[8:37] Ihr seid Abrahams Nachkommen, das weiß ich wohl. Doch ihr steht mir nach dem Leben, weil mein Wort in euern Herzen keinen Boden findet. 
[8:38] Was ich bei meinem Vater gesehen habe, das verkünde ich. Ebenso stimmt euer Tun mit dem, was ihr von euerm Vater gehört habt." 
[8:39] "Unser Vater", so erwiderten sie ihm, "ist Abraham." Jesus entgegnete ihnen: "Wäret ihr Abrahams Kinder, so tätet ihr auch Abrahams Werke. 
[8:40] Nun aber sucht ihr mich zu töten, obwohl ich euch die Wahrheit, die ich von Gott gehört, verkündigt habe. So etwas hat Abraham nicht getan. 
[8:41] Ihr handelt ganz wie euer Vater." Da sprachen sie zu ihm: "Wir sind doch nicht aus Hurerei entsprossen; Gott allein ist unser Vater." 
[8:42] Jesus erwiderte ihnen: "Wäre Gott euer Vater, so hättet ihr mich lieb. Denn ich bin von Gott ausgegangen und gekommen. Ich bin auch nicht eigenmächtig aufgetreten, sondern er hat mich gesandt. 
[8:43] Warum versteht ihr denn meine Redeweise nicht? Weil ihr nicht fähig seid, meinen Worten voll Empfänglichkeit zu lauschen. 
[8:44] Ihr habt den Teufel zum Vater, und eure Lust ist, das zu tun, was euerm Vater Freude macht. Der ist von Anfang an ein Mörder gewesen, und er steht nicht in der Wahrheit, weil keine Wahrheit in ihm ist. Wenn er die Lüge redet, so redet er aus seinem eigensten Wesen; denn er ist ein Lügner und der Lüge Vater. 
[8:45] Ich aber finde keinen Glauben bei euch, weil ich die Wahrheit rede. 
[8:46] Wer von euch vermag mir eine Sünde nachzuweisen? Wenn ich die Wahrheit rede, warum glaubt ihr mir dann nicht? 
[8:47] Wer aus Gott ist, der hat ein Ohr für Gottes Worte. Ihr habt kein Ohr dafür, denn ihr seid nicht aus Gott." 
[8:48] Da antworteten ihm die Juden: "Haben wir nicht recht, wenn wir behaupten: du bist ein Samariter und von einem bösen Geist besessen?" 
[8:49] Jesus erwiderte: "Ich bin von keinem bösen Geist besessen, sondern ich ehre meinen Vater, und was tut ihr? Ihr entehrt mich. 
[8:50] Ich trete nicht für meine Ehre ein; es tritt aber einer dafür ein, und der spricht auch das Urteil. 
[8:51] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer mein Wort befolgt, der wird den Tod in Ewigkeit nicht sehen." 
[8:52] Da sprachen die Juden zu ihm: "Nun wissen wir bestimmt, daß du von einem bösen Geist besessen bist. Abraham ist gestorben und ebenso die Propheten, und du sagst: 'Wer mein Wort befolgt, der wird den Tod in Ewigkeit nicht schmecken.' 
[8:53] Bist du denn größer als unser Vater Abraham? Der hat doch sterben müssen. Und auch die Propheten sind gestorben. Was willst du denn sein?" 
[8:54] Jesus erwiderte: "Wollte ich mich selbst verherrlichen, so wäre es nichts mit meiner Herrlichkeit. Nun ist es aber mein Vater, der mich verherrlicht. Der ist, wie ihr behauptet, euer Gott. 
[8:55] Und doch kennt ihr ihn nicht. Ich aber kenne ihn. Und wollte ich sagen: 'ich kenne ihn nicht', so wäre ich ein Lügner ebenso wie ihr. Aber ich kenne ihn und folge seinem Wort. 
[8:56] Euer Vater Abraham frohlockte in der Hoffnung, meinen Tag zu sehen; er hat ihn auch gesehen und sich gefreut." 
[8:57] Da sprachen die Juden zu ihm: "Du bist noch nicht fünfzig Jahre alt und willst Abraham gesehen haben?" 
[8:58] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ehe Abraham ward, bin ich!" 
[8:59] Da hoben sie Steine auf, um sie auf ihn zu werfen. Jesus aber entzog sich ihren Blicken und verließ den Tempel. 
[9:1] Als er (eines Tages) seines Weges ging, sah er einen Menschen, der von Geburt an blind war. 
[9:2] Da fragten ihn seine Jünger: "Meister, wer ist durch seine Sünde schuld daran, daß dieser Mann blind geboren ist: er selbst oder seine Eltern?" 
[9:3] Jesus antwortete: "Weder er ist daran schuld noch seine Eltern; sondern es sollten sich an ihm die Werke Gottes offenbaren. 
[9:4] Wir müssen, solange es Tag ist, die Werke dessen wirken, der mich gesandt hat; es kommt die Nacht, wo niemand wirken kann. 
[9:5] Solange ich in der Welt bin, bin ich das Licht der Welt." 
[9:6] Nach diesen Worten spie er auf die Erde, machte aus dem Speichel einen Teig, strich dem Blinden den Teig auf die Augen 
[9:7] und sprach zu ihm: "Geh hin und wasche dich im Teich Siloah!" — dies Wort bedeutet: Gesandter. — Da ging er hin und wusch sich und kam sehend wieder. 
[9:8] Die Nachbarn und die anderen Leute, die ihn früher hatten betteln sehen, fragten nun: "Ist das nicht der Mann, der einst dasaß und bettelte?" 
[9:9] Die einen meinten: "Ja, er ist es!" Andere sagten: "Nein, er sieht ihm nur ähnlich." Er selbst aber sprach: "Ich bin's!" 
[9:10] Nun fragte man ihn: "Wie sind dir denn die Augen aufgetan worden?" 
[9:11] Er antwortete: "Der Mann, der Jesus heißt, machte einen Teig, bestrich mir damit die Augen und sprach zu mir: 'Geh nach Siloah und wasche dich!' Da ging ich hin, wusch mich und konnte sehen." 
[9:12] Nun fragten sie ihn: "Wo ist denn der Mann?" Er antwortete: "Das weiß ich nicht." 
[9:13] Man brachte dann den früher Blinden zu den Pharisäern. 
[9:14] Es war aber gerade Sabbat, als Jesus den Teig machte und dem Blinden die Augen auftat. 
[9:15] Da fragten ihn auch die Pharisäer, wie er sehend geworden sei. Er antwortete ihnen: "Er legte mir einen Teig auf die Augen, dann wusch ich mich und kann nun sehen." 
[9:16] Da sagten einige Pharisäer: "Dieser Mensch ist nicht von Gott gesandt, denn er hält den Sabbat nicht." Andere meinten: "Wie kann ein sündiger Mensch solche Zeichen tun?" So waren sie verschiedener Ansicht. 
[9:17] Nun fragten sie von neuem den früher Blinden: "Was denkst du denn von ihm? Er hat dir ja die Augen aufgetan." Er antwortete: "Der Mann ist ein Prophet!" 
[9:18] Die Juden aber wollten von dem Mann nicht glauben, daß er blind gewesen und sehend geworden sei. Darum ließen sie schließlich seine Eltern rufen 
[9:19] und fragten sie: "Ist dies euer Sohn, der, wie ihr behauptet, blind geboren ist? Wie kommt es denn, daß er jetzt sehen kann?" 
[9:20] Seine Eltern antworteten: "Wir wissen, daß dies unser Sohn ist, und daß er blind geboren ist. 
[9:21] Wie es aber kommt, daß er jetzt sehen kann, das wissen wir nicht, und ebensowenig wissen wir, wer ihm die Augen aufgetan hat. Fragt ihn selbst, er ist alt genug; er wird schon allein über sich Auskunft geben." 
[9:22] So redeten seine Eltern, weil sie sich vor den Juden fürchteten. Denn die Juden hatten schon beschlossen, jeden, der Jesus als Messias anerkenne, in den Bann zu tun. 
[9:23] Deshalb sagten seine Eltern: "Er ist alt genug; fragt ihn selbst!" 
[9:24] Sie ließen nun den Menschen, der blind gewesen war, zum zweiten Mal rufen und sprachen zu ihm: "Gib Gott die Ehre (und sag die volle Wahrheit)! Wir wissen, daß dieser Mensch ein Sünder ist." 
[9:25] Der Mann erwiderte: "Ob er ein Sünder ist, das weiß ich nicht; ich weiß nur eins: ich bin blind gewesen und kann nun sehen." 
[9:26] Da fragten sie ihn: "Was hat er denn mit dir gemacht? Wie hat er dir die Augen aufgetan?" 
[9:27] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ich habe es euch ja schon gesagt, aber ihr habt nicht darauf gehört. Warum wollt ihr's denn noch einmal hören? Ihr wollt doch nicht auch seine Jünger werden?" 
[9:28] Da schmähten sie ihn und sprachen: "Du bist sein Jünger; wir aber sind Moses Jünger. 
[9:29] Wir wissen, daß Gott mit Mose geredet hat. Von diesem aber wissen wir nicht, woher er ist." 
[9:30] Darauf entgegnete ihnen der Mann: "Das ist doch sonderbar! Ihr wißt nicht, woher er ist, und er hat mir doch die Augen aufgetan. 
[9:31] Wir wissen, daß Gott sündige Menschen nicht erhört; sondern wer Gott fürchtet und seinen Willen tut, den erhört er. 
[9:32] Solange die Welt steht, hat man nicht davon gehört, daß jemand einem Blindgeborenen die Augen aufgetan hätte. 
[9:33] Wäre dieser Mann nicht von Gott gesandt, so könnte er nichts ausrichten." 
[9:34] Da antworteten sie ihm: "Du bist ganz und gar in Sünden geboren und willst uns belehren?" Und sie stießen ihn aus der Gemeinde. 
[9:35] Jesus erfuhr, daß sie ihn ausgestoßen hatten. Als er ihn dann traf, fragte er ihn: "Glaubst du an den Menschensohn?" 
[9:36] Er antwortete: "Wer ist das, Herr? Ich möchte an ihn glauben." 
[9:37] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Du hast ihn schon gesehen: der mit dir redet, der ist es." 
[9:38] Da sprach er: "Ich glaube, Herr", und warf sich vor ihm nieder. 
[9:39] Jesus fuhr fort: "Ich bin in diese Welt gekommen, um ein Urteil zu vollziehen: die nicht sehen können, sollen sehend werden, und die da sehen, sollen blind werden." 
[9:40] Das hörten einige Pharisäer, die bei ihm waren, und sie fragten ihn: "Sind wir denn auch blind?" 
[9:41] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Wäret ihr blind, so hättet ihr keine Sünde. Nun aber behauptet ihr: 'Wir können sehen.' Darum bleibt eure Sünde. 
[10:1] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer nicht durch die Tür in die Schafhürde geht, sondern anderswo hineinsteigt, der ist ein Dieb und Räuber. 
[10:2] Wer aber durch die Tür eingeht, der ist der Hirte der Schafe. 
[10:3] Dem öffnet der Türhüter, und die Schafe vernehmen seine Stimme. Er ruft die Schafe seiner Herde mit Namen und führt sie hinaus. 
[10:4] Hat er dann seine Schafe alle hinausgebracht, so geht er vor ihnen her, und die Schafe folgen ihm; denn sie kennen seine Stimme. 
[10:5] Einem Fremden aber würden sie nimmermehr folgen, sondern sie würden vor ihm fliehen; denn sie kennen des Fremden Stimme nicht." 
[10:6] Dies Gleichnis trug ihnen Jesus vor; sie aber verstanden den Sinn seiner Worte nicht. 
[10:7] Jesus fuhr dann fort: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ich bin die Tür zu den Schafen. 
[10:8] Alle, die an meiner Statt aufgetreten sind, sind Diebe und Räuber. Aber die Schafe haben nicht auf sie gehört. 
[10:9] Ich bin die Tür. Wer durch mich eingeht, der wird gerettet werden; er wird ein- und ausgehen und Weide finden. 
[10:10] Der Dieb kommt nur, um (die Schafe) zu stehlen, zu töten und zu verderben. 
[10:11] Ich bin gekommen, damit die Schafe Leben und reiche Nahrung haben. 
[10:12] Ich bin der Gute Hirte. Der Gute Hirte gibt sein Leben für die Schafe hin. Der Mietling, der nicht Hirte ist, und dem die Schafe nicht gehören, verläßt die Schafe und flieht, wenn er den Wolf kommen sieht. Dann raubt der Wolf sich von den Schafen und zersprengt die Herde. 
[10:13] Das geschieht bei einem Mietling, dem nichts an den Schafen liegt. 
[10:14] Ich bin der Gute Hirte. Ich kenne meine Schafe, und sie kennen mich, 
[10:15] ganz ebenso wie mich mein Vater kennt und ich ihn kenne. Ich lasse auch mein Leben für die Schafe. 
[10:16] Ich habe auch noch andere Schafe, die nicht zu dieser Hürde zählen. Auch die muß ich herführen, und sie sollen meinem Ruf folgen: so wird sich eine Herde bilden unter Einem Hirten. 
[10:17] Darum liebt mich mein Vater, weil ich mein Leben lasse, um es wiederzuempfangen. 
[10:18] Niemand nimmt es (mit Gewalt) von mir, sondern ich gebe es ganz freiwillig hin. Es steht mir frei, es hinzugeben, und es steht mir frei, es wieder zurückzunehmen. Diesen Auftrag habe ich erhalten von meinem Vater." 
[10:19] Wegen dieser Worte entstand aufs neue eine Meinungsverschiedenheit unter den Juden. 
[10:20] Viele von ihnen sagten: "Er ist von einem bösen Geist besessen und von Sinnen. Warum hört ihr ihm zu?" 
[10:21] Andere meinten: "So redet keiner, der von einem bösen Geist besessen ist. Kann denn ein böser Geist der Blinden Augen öffnen?" 
[10:22] Zu der Zeit feierte man in Jerusalem das Fest der Tempelweihe. Es war Winter. 
[10:23] Jesus ging auf dem Tempelplatz in der Halle Salomos umher. 
[10:24] Da umringten ihn die Juden und sprachen zu ihm: "Wie lange läßt du uns im ungewissen? Bist du der Messias, so sag es uns frei heraus!" 
[10:25] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Ich habe es euch gesagt, aber ihr wollt nicht glauben. Die Werke, die ich in meines Vaters Namen tue, die legen Zeugnis für mich ab. 
[10:26] Ihr glaubt aber nicht, denn ihr gehört nicht zu meinen Schafen. 
[10:27] Meine Schafe hören meine Stimme; ich kenne sie, und sie folgen mir. 
[10:28] Ich gebe ihnen das ewige Leben; sie sollen nicht verlorengehen in alle Ewigkeit; und niemand wird sie meiner Hand entreißen. 
[10:29] Mein Vater, der sie mir gegeben hat, ist stärker als alle anderen Mächte; und niemand kann sie meines Vaters Hand entreißen. 
[10:30] Ich und der Vater sind eins." 
[10:31] Da holten die Juden aufs neue Steine herbei, um ihn zu steinigen. 
[10:32] Jesus aber sprach zu ihnen: "Viel herrliche Werke, die der Vater durch mich gewirkt, habe ich euch sehen lassen; welches dieser Werke ist denn schuld daran, daß ihr mich steinigen wollt?" 
[10:33] Die Juden erwiderten ihm: "Nicht ein trefflich Werk, das du getan, veranlaßt uns, daß wir dich steinigen wollen, sondern deine Gotteslästerung: obwohl du nur ein Mensch bist, willst du doch Gott sein." 
[10:34] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Steht nicht in euerm Gesetz geschrieben: 'Ich habe gesagt: ihr seid Götter?" 
[10:35] Das Gesetz hat also die Männer, an die dieser Gottesspruch ergangen ist, Götter genannt, und die Schrift muß doch gültig bleiben —: 
[10:36] wollt ihr nun den, den der Vater geweiht und in die Welt gesandt hat, der Lästerung beschuldigen, weil ich gesagt habe: 'Ich bin Gottes Sohn?' 
[10:37] Tue ich nicht meines Vaters Werke, dann glaubt mir nicht! 
[10:38] Tue ich sie aber, und ihr wollt mir nicht glauben, dann glaubt doch wenigstens meinen Werken, damit ihr einseht und erkennt, daß der Vater in mir ist und ich im Vater bin." 
[10:39] Da suchten sie ihn abermals festzunehmen, doch er entging ihren Händen. A| 
[10:40] Er kehrte dann in das Ostjordanland zurück an den Ort, wo Johannes zuerst getauft hatte, und nahm dort Aufenthalt. 
[10:41] Viele kamen zu ihm, und man sagte: "Johannes hat freilich kein Zeichen getan; doch alles, was Johannes von diesem Mann gesagt hat, ist wahr gewesen." 
[10:42] Und viele wurden dort an ihn gläubig. 
[11:1] Ein Mann, mit Namen Lazarus, lag krank. Der wohnte in Bethanien, dem Dorf der Maria und ihrer Schwester Martha. — 
[11:2] Es war aber die Maria, die (später) den Herrn mit Öl salbte und seine Füße mit ihren Haaren abtrocknete; deren Bruder Lazarus lag krank. — 
[11:3] Da sandten seine Schwestern zu Jesus und ließen ihm sagen: "Herr, den du liebhast, der liegt jetzt krank." 
[11:4] Als Jesus das vernahm, sprach er: "Diese Krankheit soll nicht dem Tod eine Beute geben, sondern sie dient zur Ehre Gottes: der Sohn Gottes soll dadurch verherrlicht werden." 
[11:5] Jesus liebte Martha und ihre Schwester und Lazarus. 
[11:6] Zunächst blieb er trotz der Nachricht von des Lazarus Krankheit noch zwei Tage an dem Ort, wo er sich aufhielt. 
[11:7] Dann erst sprach er zu seinen Jüngern: "Wir wollen wieder nach Judäa ziehen!" 
[11:8] Seine Jünger erwiderten ihm: "Meister, eben erst haben dich die Juden steinigen wollen, und nun willst du wieder dorthin gehen?" 
[11:9] Darauf sagte Jesus: "Hat der Tag nicht zwölf Stunden? Wer bei Tag umhergeht, der stößt sich nicht; denn er sieht das Licht der Welt. 
[11:10] Wer aber des Nachts umhergeht, der stößt sich; denn da hat die Welt kein Licht." 
[11:11] So sprach er. Dann fuhr er fort: "Unser Freund Lazarus schläft; aber ich will hingehen, um ihn aufzuwecken." 
[11:12] Da entgegneten ihm die Jünger: "Herr, wenn er schläft, so wird er wieder gesund." 
[11:13] Jesus aber hatte des Lazarus Tod gemeint, während sie dachten, er rede von der Ruhe des Schlafes. 
[11:14] Da sagte ihnen Jesus frei heraus: 
[11:15] Lazarus ist tot; und euretwegen bin ich froh, daß ich nicht dagewesen bin, damit ihr glaubt. Nun aber laßt uns zu ihm gehen!" 
[11:16] Da sprach Thomas mit dem Beinamen "Zwilling" zu seinen Mitjüngern: "Ja, laßt auch uns hingehen, daß wir mit ihm sterben!" 
[11:17] Bei Jesu Ankunft lag Lazarus schon vier Tage im Grab. 
[11:18] Da Bethanien kaum eine halbe Meile von Jerusalem entfernt war, 
[11:19] hatten sich viele Juden bei Martha und Maria eingefunden, um sie über den Tod ihres Bruders zu trösten. 
[11:20] Bei der Nachricht: "Jesus kommt!" ging Martha ihm entgegen, während Maria im Haus sitzen blieb. 
[11:21] Martha sprach zu Jesus: "Herr, wärst du hier gewesen, mein Bruder wäre nicht gestorben! 
[11:22] Doch auch jetzt noch weiß ich, daß Gott dir geben wird, was du von ihm erbittest." 
[11:23] Jesus antwortete ihr: "Dein Bruder wird auferstehen." 
[11:24] Martha entgegnete ihm: "Ich weiß, daß er auferstehen wird bei der Auferstehung am Jüngsten Tag." 
[11:25] Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Ich bin die Auferstehung und das Leben. Wer an mich glaubt, der soll auch nach dem Tod leben. 
[11:26] Und wer in seinem Leben an mich glaubt, der soll nun und nimmer sterben. Glaubst du das?" 
[11:27] "Ja, Herr", versetzte sie, "ich glaube fest, daß du bist der Messias, der Sohn Gottes, der in der Welt erscheinen soll." 
[11:28] Nach diesen Worten ging sie weg und rief ihre Schwester Maria, indem sie ihr heimlich zuflüsterte: "Der Meister ist da und ruft dich." 
[11:29] Bei dieser Kunde stand Maria eilig auf und begab sich zu ihm. 
[11:30] Jesus war nämlich noch nicht in das Dorf gekommen, sondern er war noch an der Stelle, wo ihn Martha getroffen hatte. 
[11:31] Als nun die Juden, die bei Maria im Haus waren und sie zu trösten suchten, sie aufstehen und eilig hinausgehen sahen, da folgten sie ihr; denn sie meinten, sie gehe zum Grab, um dort zu weinen. 
[11:32] Maria kam an den Ort, wo Jesus war. Als sie ihn sah, fiel sie ihm zu Füßen und sprach zu ihm: "Herr, wärst du hier gewesen, mein Bruder wäre nicht gestorben!" 
[11:33] Als Jesus sie und auch die Juden, die sie begleiteten, laut weinen sah, ergrimmte er in seinem Geist, so daß ihn schauderte. 
[11:34] Dann fragte er: "Wo habt ihr ihn beigesetzt?" Sie erwiderten ihm: "Herr, komm und sieh!" 
[11:35] Jesus weinte still. 
[11:36] Da sprachen die Juden: "Wie hat er ihn so liebgehabt!" 
[11:37] Doch einige von ihnen sagten: "Konnte der Mann, der des Blinden Augen aufgetan hat, nicht auch verhindern, daß dieser starb?" 
[11:38] Jesus, abermals ergrimmt in seinem Inneren, trat an das Grab. Das war in einer Höhle; vor ihrem Eingang lag ein Stein. 
[11:39] Jesus gebot: "Entfernt den Stein!" Martha, des Verstorbenen Schwester, sprach zu ihm: "Herr, er riecht schon nach Verwesung; er ist ja schon vier Tage tot." 
[11:40] Jesus erwiderte ihr: "Habe ich dir nicht gesagt, du sollst, wenn du glaubst, die Herrlichkeit Gottes sehen?" 
[11:41] Da entfernte man den Stein. Jesus aber hob seine Augen auf zum Himmel und sprach: 
[11:42] "Vater, ich danke dir, daß du mich allezeit erhört hast. Ich wußte zwar, daß du mich allezeit erhörst. Doch um der Leute willen, die hier stehen, spreche ich dies offen aus, damit sie glauben, daß du mich gesandt hast." 
[11:43] Nach diesen Worten rief er mit lauter Stimme: "Lazarus, komm heraus!" 
[11:44] Da kam der Tote heraus, Füße und Hände mit Binden umwickelt und das Gesicht mit einem Schweißtuch verhüllt. Jesus sprach zu den Umstehenden: "Nehmt ihm die Binden ab und laßt ihn gehen!" 
[11:45] Viele nun von den Juden, die zu Maria gekommen waren und Jesu Tat gesehen hatten, wurden an ihn gläubig. 
[11:46] Aber einige von ihnen gingen zu den Pharisäern und erzählten ihnen, was Jesus getan hatte. 
[11:47] Da beriefen die Hohenpriester und die Pharisäer eine Versammlung des Hohen Rates und sprachen: "Was ist zu tun? Dies Menschen tut viele Wunderzeichen. 
[11:48] Wenn wir ihn noch weiter gewähren lassen, so werden alle an ihn glauben. Dann aber kommen die Römer und räumen auf mit unserer Stadt und unserem Volk." 
[11:49] Einer aber aus ihrem Kreis, Kaiphas, der in jenem Jahr Hoherpriester war, sprach zu ihnen: "Euch fehlt's an Einsicht. 
[11:50] Darum bedenkt ihr auch nicht, daß es besser für euch ist, wenn ein Mensch für das Volk stirbt, als wenn das ganze Volk zugrunde geht." 
[11:51] So redete er aber nicht aus eigener Überlegung; sondern weil er in jenem Jahr Hoherpriester war, weissagte er (unbewußt), Jesus solle sterben für das (jüdische) Volk, 
[11:52] doch nicht allein für dieses Volk, sondern auch, um die (in der Heidenwelt) zerstreuten Kinder Gottes zu einer Einheit zu verbinden. 
[11:53] Seit jenem Tag berieten sie darüber, ihn zu töten. 
[11:54] Jesus zeigte sich deshalb nicht mehr frei und offen unter den Juden, sondern er zog sich von da in die Gegend nahe bei der Wüste zurück und begab sich in eine Stadt, mit Namen Ephraim; dort hielt er sich mit seinen Jüngern auf. 
[11:55] Es war aber kurz vor dem jüdischen Passahfest. Viele aus jener Gegend zogen noch vor dem Passah nach Jerusalem, um sich dort zu reinigen. 
[11:56] Die forschten auch nach Jesus, und als sie auf dem Tempelplatz zusammenstanden, fragten sie einander: "Was meint ihr? Er wird wohl nicht zum Fest kommen?" 
[11:57] Die Hohenpriester und die Pharisäer hatten nämlich den Befehl gegeben: wer wisse, wo er sich aufhalte, der solle davon Anzeige machen; denn sie wollten ihn gefangennehmen lassen. 
[12:1] Sechs Tage vor dem Passahfest kam Jesus nach Bethanien, wo Lazarus wohnte, den er von den Toten auferweckt hatte. 
[12:2] Dort richtete man ihm zu Ehren ein Mahl aus. Martha wartete dabei auf, während Lazarus mit ihm einer der Tischgäste war. 
[12:3] Maria aber nahm ein Pfund kostbaren Salböls aus echter Narde, salbte damit Jesu Füße und trocknete sie mit ihren Haaren ab. Von diesem Salböl duftete das ganze Haus. 
[12:4] Da sagte einer von seinen Jüngern, Judas aus Kariot, der sein Verräter werden sollte: 
[12:5] "Warum hat man dieses Salböl nicht für dreihundert Silberlinge verkauft und das Geld den Armen gegeben?" 
[12:6] So sprach er aber nicht, weil er ein Herz für die Armen hatte, sondern weil er ein Dieb war: er hatte die Geldkasse und entwandte von dem, was hineingelegt wurde. 
[12:7] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Laß sie gewähren! Sie hat das Salböl für meinen Begräbnistag aufbewahren wollen. 
[12:8] Denn Arme habt ihr allezeit bei euch, doch mich habt ihr nicht allezeit." 
[12:9] Eine große Menge Juden kam (nach Bethanien), als sie erfuhren, Jesus sei dort. Sie fanden sich aber nicht nur Jesu wegen ein, sondern sie wollten auch Lazarus sehen, den er von den Toten auferweckt hatte. 
[12:10] Die Hohenpriester aber berieten darüber, auch Lazarus zu töten, 
[12:11] weil seinetwegen viele Juden sie verließen und an Jesus glaubten. 
[12:12] Tags darauf ging eine große Schar von Festpilgern auf die Kunde, Jesus sei auf dem Weg nach Jerusalem, 
[12:13] mit Palmzweigen ihm entgegen unter dem lauten Ruf: "Heil! Gesegnet sei, der da kommt im Namen des Herrn — er, der König Israels!" 
[12:14] Jesus fand einen jungen Esel und setzte sich darauf. So erfüllte sich das Schriftwort: 
[12:15] Fürchte dich nicht, Tochter Zion! Sieh, dein König kommt und reitet auf einem Eselfüllen! 
[12:16] - Damals freilich verstanden seine Jünger die Bedeutung dieser Worte noch nicht. Erst als Jesus zur Herrlichkeit erhoben war, erinnerten sie sich, daß dies von ihm geschrieben stand und sie es so für ihn ausgeführt hatten —. 
[12:17] Die Volksmenge, die bei ihm war, als er Lazarus aus dem Grab rief und ihn von den Toten auferweckte, machte diese Tat bekannt. 
[12:18] Deshalb ging ihm auch jene Schar entgegen, weil sie erfahren hatte, er habe dieses Wunderzeichen getan. 
[12:19] Die Pharisäer aber sprachen untereinander: "Ihr seht nun deutlich, daß ihr nichts erreicht. Der ganze Pöbel läuft ihm nach!" 
[12:20] Unter den Festpilgern waren auch einige Griechen. 
[12:21] Diese kamen zu Philippus, der aus Bethsaida in Galiläa stammte, und trugen ihm die Bitte vor: "Herr, wir möchten Jesus kennenlernen." 
[12:22] Philippus ging hin und sagte es Andreas. Andreas und Philippus kamen dann und teilten es Jesus mit. 
[12:23] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Die Stunde ist gekommen, wo der Menschensohn verherrlicht werden soll. 
[12:24] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ein Weizenkorn, das nicht in die Erde eingesenkt wird und dann abstirbt, bleibt, was es ist: ein einzelnes Korn. Ist es aber abgestorben, so bringt es reiche Frucht. 
[12:25] Sein Leben lieben heißt: es verlieren; sein Leben opfern in dieser Welt heißt: es erhalten fürs ewige Leben. 
[12:26] Wer mir dienen will, der folge mir; und wo ich bin, da soll auch mein Diener sein. Wer mir dient, den wird der Vater ehren. 
[12:27] Jetzt ist meine Seele voller Schauder, und was soll ich sagen? Soll ich beten: Vater, bewahre mich vor dieser Stunde? Nein, denn gerade deshalb bin ich ja bei dieser Stunde angekommen. 
[12:28] Vater, verherrliche deinen Namen!" Da kam eine Stimme vom Himmel: "Ich habe ihn schon verherrlicht und will ihn noch weiter verherrlichen!" 
[12:29] Das Volk, das dastand und dies hörte, sprach: "Es hat gedonnert." Andere meinten: "Ein Engel hat mit ihm geredet." 
[12:30] Da nahm Jesus das Wort und sagte: "Nicht meinetwegen ist diese Stimme ertönt, sondern euretwegen. 
[12:31] Jetzt ergeht ein Urteil über diese Welt. Jetzt soll der Beherrscher dieser Welt aus ihr hinausgetrieben werden. 
[12:32] Und bin ich erst erhöht von der Erde, so will ich alle Menschen zu mir ziehen." 
[12:33] - Mit diesen Worten wollte er andeuten, welches Todes er sterben sollte. — 
[12:34] Da antwortete ihm das Volk: "Wir haben aus dem Gesetz gelernt, daß der Messias ewig am Leben bleibt. Was soll es da bedeuten, wenn du behauptest: der Menschensohn muß erhöht werden? Wer ist denn dieser Menschensohn?" 
[12:35] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "Nur noch eine kleine Weile ist das Licht unter euch. Wandelt im Licht, weil ihr's noch habt, damit euch nicht die Finsternis überfalle. Denn wer in der Finsternis wandelt, der weiß nicht, wohin er geht. 
[12:36] Weil ihr das Licht noch habt, glaubt an das Licht, damit ihr Lichteskinder werdet." 
[12:37] Nach diesen Worten ging Jesus weg und verbarg sich vor ihnen. Obwohl er aber so viele Wunderzeichen vor ihnen getan hatte, glaubten sie doch nicht an ihn. 
[12:38] Denn es sollte sich das Wort des Propheten Jesaja erfüllen: Herr, wer hat unserer Botschaft geglaubt? Und wem ist der Arm des Herrn offenbar geworden? 
[12:39] Darum waren sie unfähig zu glauben, weil Jesaja weiterhin gesagt hat: 
[12:40] Er hat ihre Augen geblendet und ihr Herz verstockt. Denn sie sollen mit ihren Augen nicht sehen und mit ihren Herzen nicht verstehen, so daß sie sich bekehren und ich sie heile. 
[12:41] So sprach Jesaja, weil er seine Herrlichkeit (im Geist) sah und (deshalb) von ihm redete. 
[12:42] Gleichwohl aber wurden sogar viele von den Mitgliedern des Hohen Rates an ihn gläubig. Doch der Pharisäer wegen legten sie kein offenes Bekenntnis ab, damit sie nicht in den Bann getan würden. 
[12:43] Denn sie wollten lieber bei den Menschen als bei Gott in Ehren stehen. 
[12:44] Jesus aber hat laut verkündigt: "Wer an mich glaubt, der glaubt ja nicht an mich, sondern an den, der mich gesandt. 
[12:45] Und wer mich schaut, der schaut den, der mich gesandt. 
[12:46] Ich bin als Licht gekommen in die Welt, damit keiner, der an mich glaubt, in der Finsternis bleibe. 
[12:47] Wer meine Worte hört und nicht bewahrt, über den bin ich kein Richter. Denn ich bin nicht gekommen, um die Welt zu richten, sondern um die Welt zu retten. 
[12:48] Wer mich verwirft und meine Worte nicht annimmt, der hat schon seinen Richter: Das Wort, das ich geredet habe, das wird sein Richter sein am Jüngsten Tag. 
[12:49] Denn ich habe nicht eigenmächtig geredet, sondern der Vater, der mich gesandt, der hat mir aufgetragen, was ich sagen und was ich reden soll. 
[12:50] Und ich weiß: Sein Auftrag bringt das ewige Leben. Was ich nun rede, das rede ich genau so, wie es der Vater mir gesagt hat." 
[13:1] Es war vor dem Passahfest. Jesus wußte, daß seine Stunde gekommen war, da er diese Welt verlassen und zum Vater gehen sollte. Er liebte seine Jünger, die er in der Welt zurückließ. Jetzt aber gab er ihnen den herrlichsten Beweis seiner Liebe. 
[13:2] Ein Mahl fand statt. Schon hatte es der Teufel dem Judas aus Kariot, Simons Sohn, ins Herz gegeben, ihn zu verraten. 
[13:3] Obwohl Jesus wußte, daß ihm der Vater alle Macht gegeben hatte, und daß er von Gott ausgegangen war und nun zu Gott ging, 
[13:4] erhob er sich vom Mahl, legte sein Oberkleid ab und nahm ein leinenes Tuch, womit er sich umgürtete. 
[13:5] Dann goß er Wasser in das Becken, das dastand, und begann seinen Jüngern die Füße zu waschen und sie mit dem Tuch, womit er umgürtet war, abzutrocknen. 
[13:6] So kam er zu Simon Petrus. Der sprach zu ihm: "Herr, du willst mir die Füße waschen?" 
[13:7] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Mein Tun ist dir jetzt rätselhaft, später aber wirst du es verstehen." 
[13:8] Petrus erwiderte: "Nun und nimmer sollst du mir die Füße waschen!" Jesus entgegnete ihm: "Wenn ich dich nicht wasche, so hast du keine Gemeinschaft mit mir." 
[13:9] Da sprach Simon Petrus zu ihm: "Herr, dann wasche mir nicht allein die Füße, sondern auch die Hände und das Haupt!" 
[13:10] Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Wer ein Bad genommen hat, der braucht sich nur die Füße zu waschen; sonst ist er am ganzen Leib rein. Auch ihr seid rein, jedoch nicht alle." 
[13:11] Denn er kannte seinen Verräter; darum sagte er: "Ihr seid nicht alle rein." 
[13:12] Als er ihnen nun die Füße gewaschen hatte, zog er sein Oberkleid wieder an und nahm seinen Platz am Tisch wieder ein. Dann sagte er zu ihnen: "Versteht ihr, was ich euch getan? 
[13:13] Ihr redet mich an mit 'Meister' und 'Herr', und das ist in der Ordnung, denn ich bin's. 
[13:14] Habe nun ich, der Herr und Meister, euch die Füße gewaschen, so ist's auch eure Pflicht, einander die Füße zu waschen. 
[13:15] Denn ein Beispiel habe ich euch gegeben, damit auch ihr tut, wie ich euch getan. 
[13:16] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ein Diener steht nicht höher als sein Herr, und ein Gesandter steht nicht höher als sein Auftraggeber. — 
[13:17] Wenn ihr dies wißt, Heil euch, wenn ihr danach tut! 
[13:18] Nicht von euch allen rede ich: ich kenne die, die ich mir auserkoren. Doch es muß das Schriftwort in Erfüllung gehen: Der mein Brot ißt, hat seine Ferse gegen mich erhoben. 
[13:19] Schon jetzt will ich davon zu euch reden, ehe es geschieht, damit ihr, wenn es eintrifft, glaubt, daß ich es bin. — 
[13:20] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer einen, den ich sende, aufnimmt, der nimmt mich auf; und wer mich aufnimmt, der nimmt damit den auf, der mich gesandt." 
[13:21] Nach diesen Worten empfand Jesus in seinem Geist einen Schauder, und er sprach voll tiefen Ernstes: "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Einer unter euch wird mich verraten!" 
[13:22] Da sahen die Jünger einander (fragend) an; denn sie wußten nicht, von wem er redete. 
[13:23] Nun hatte einer von den Jüngern an der Tafel seinen Platz dicht an Jesu Seite; das war der Jünger, den Jesus liebte. 
[13:24] Dem winkte Simon Petrus und sprach zu ihm: "Sag, wen meint er?" 
[13:25] Da neigte er sich gegen Jesu Brust und fragte ihn: "Herr, wer ist's?" 
[13:26] Jesus erwiderte: "Der ist's, dem ich dies Stückchen Brot hier in die Schüssel tauche und reiche." Dann tauchte er den Bissen ein und reichte ihn dem Judas, Simons Sohn, aus Kariot. 
[13:27] Als der den Bissen genommen hatte, fuhr der Satan in ihn. Da sprach Jesus zu ihm: "Was du tun willst, das tu sofort!" 
[13:28] Keiner aber von den Tischgenossen verstand, was er ihm damit sagen wollte. 
[13:29] Einige meinten, weil Judas die Kasse hatte, fordere ihn Jesus auf: "Kaufe ein, was wir zum Fest nötig haben!" oder: er solle den Armen etwas geben. 
[13:30] Als Judas den Bissen genommen hatte, ging er sofort hinaus. Und es war Nacht. 
[13:31] Als er hinausgegangen war, sprach Jesus: "Jetzt ist der Menschensohn verherrlicht, und Gott ist verherrlicht in ihm. 
[13:32] Nun wird Gott ihn auch in seine Herrlichkeit aufnehmen, ja das wird bald geschehen! 
[13:33] Liebe Kinder, nur noch kurze Zeit bin ich bei euch. Ihr werdet nach mir suchen; doch was ich einst den Juden gesagt: 'Wohin ich gehe, dorthin könnt ihr nicht kommen', das sage ich jetzt auch euch. 
[13:34] Ein neues Gebot gebe ich euch: Liebt einander! Wie ich euch geliebt habe, so liebt auch ihr einander! 
[13:35] Daran sollen alle erkennen, daß ihr meine Jünger seid, wenn ihr Liebe zueinander habt." 
[13:36] Simon Petrus fragte ihn: "Herr, wohin gehst du?" Jesus erwiderte: "Wohin ich gehe, dorthin kannst du mir jetzt nicht folgen; du wirst mir aber später folgen." 
[13:37] Petrus sprach zu ihm: "Herr, warum kann ich dir jetzt nicht folgen? Ich will mein Leben für dich lassen." 
[13:38] Jesus antwortete: "Du willst dein Leben für mich lassen? Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage dir: Der Hahn soll nicht krähen, ehe du mich dreimal verleugnet hast!" 
[14:1] "Euer Herz sei ohne Bangen! Traut auf Gott und traut auf mich! 
[14:2] In meines Vaters Haus sind viele Wohnungen. Wenn es nicht so wäre, so hätte ich's euch gesagt; denn ich gehe hin, euch die Stätte zu bereiten. 
[14:3] Und wenn ich hingegangen bin und euch eine Stätte bereitet habe, dann komme ich wieder und will euch zu mir holen, damit auch ihr dort seid, wo ich bin. 
[14:4] Den Weg zu jenem Ort, dahin ich gehe, kennt ihr ja." 
[14:5] Da sprach Thomas zu ihm: "Herr, wir wissen nicht, wohin du gehst; wie kann uns da der Weg bekannt sein?" 
[14:6] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Ich bin der Weg, weil ich die Wahrheit und das Leben bin; niemand kommt zum Vater als durch mich. 
[14:7] Hättet ihr mich voll erkannt, so würdet ihr auch meinen Vater kennen. Von nun an aber kennt ihr ihn und habt ihn schon gesehen." 
[14:8] Philippus sprach zu ihm: "Herr, zeige uns den Vater; dann sind wir befriedigt!" 
[14:9] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "So lange bin ich bei euch, und du kennst mich noch nicht, Philippus? Wer mich gesehen hat, der hat auch den Vater gesehen. Wie kannst du da sagen: 'Zeige uns den Vater?' 
[14:10] Glaubst du nicht, daß ich im Vater bin und der Vater in mir ist? Die Worte, die ich zu euch rede, die spreche ich nicht aus eigener Vollmacht. Sondern der Vater, der bleibend in mir wohnt, der und kein anderer ist wirksam. 
[14:11] Glaubt mir, daß ich im Vater bin und der Vater in mir ist! Wo nicht, so glaubt doch gerade um der Werke willen, die ich tue! 
[14:12] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wer an mich glaubt, der wird die Werke auch tun, die ich tue; ja er wird noch größere tun als diese, weil ich zum Vater gehe. 
[14:13] Um was ihr dann in meinem Namen bittet, das will ich tun, damit der Vater verherrlicht werde in dem Sohn! 
[14:14] Wenn ihr in meinem Namen mich um etwas bittet, so will ich's tun. 
[14:15] Liebt ihr mich, so haltet meine Gebote! 
[14:16] Dann will ich den Vater bitten, und er wird euch einen anderen Helfer geben, damit er ewig bei euch bleibe: 
[14:17] den Geist der Wahrheit. Den kann die Welt nicht empfangen, denn sie hat für ihn kein Auge und erkennt ihn nicht. Ihr erkennt ihn, denn er bleibt bei euch und wird in euch sein. 
[14:18] Ich will euch nicht verwaist lassen, ich komme zu euch. 
[14:19] In Kürze schaut die Welt mich nicht mehr. Ihr aber sollt mich schauen: weil ich lebe, werdet ihr auch leben. 
[14:20] An jenem Tag werdet ihr erkennen, daß ich in meinem Vater bin, daß ihr in mir seid, und daß ich in euch bin. 
[14:21] Wer meine Gebote hat und sie befolgt, der hat mich lieb. Wer aber mich liebt, der wird von meinem Vater geliebt werden, und ich werde ihn lieben und mich ihm offenbaren." 
[14:22] Da fragte ihn Judas, nicht der aus Kariot: "Herr, wie kommt es, daß du nur uns dich offenbaren willst und nicht auch der Welt?" 
[14:23] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Wer mich liebt, der wird mein Wort befolgen, und mein Vater wird ihn lieben, und wir werden zu ihm kommen und Wohnung bei ihm nehmen. 
[14:24] Wer mich nicht liebt, der befolgt auch meine Worte nicht. Und doch stammt das Wort, das ihr vernehmt, nicht von mir, sondern von dem Vater, der mich gesandt. 
[14:25] Dies habe ich zu euch geredet, während ich noch bei euch bin. 
[14:26] Der Helfer aber, der Heilige Geist, den der Vater senden wird in meinem Namen, der wird euch alles lehren und euch erinnern an alles, was ich euch gesagt. 
[14:27] Frieden hinterlasse ich euch, meinen Frieden gebe ich euch. Ich gebe euch keinen Frieden, wie die Welt ihn gibt. Euer Herz sei ohne Bangen und ohne Furcht! 
[14:28] Ihr habt vernommen, daß ich euch gesagt: 'Ich gehe und komme zu euch.' Hättet ihr mich lieb, so würdet ihr euch freuen, daß ich zum Vater gehe; denn der Vater ist größer als ich. 
[14:29] Und nun habe ich's euch gesagt, ehe es geschehen ist, damit ihr glaubt, wenn es nun geschieht. 
[14:30] Ich werde nicht mehr viel mit euch reden; denn der Weltbeherrscher naht. Er hat zwar kein Recht an mich. 
[14:31] Aber die Welt soll erkennen, daß ich den Vater liebe und so handle, wie mir der Vater geboten hat. Steht auf und laßt uns von hier gehen! 
[15:1] Ich bin der wahre Weinstock, und mein Vater ist der Weingärtner. 
[15:2] Jede Rebe an mir, die keine Frucht bringt, schneidet er weg, und jede, die Frucht bringt, reinigt er, damit sie noch mehr Frucht bringe. 
[15:3] Schon an euch zeigt sich, daß ihr rein seid, weil ihr das Wort, das ich zu euch geredet, aufgenommen habt. 
[15:4] Bleibt ihr in mir, dann bleibe ich auch in euch. Wie die Rebe für sich allein und aus eigener Kraft keine Frucht bringen kann, sondern nur, wenn sie in Verbindung mit dem Weinstock bleibt: ganz ebenso ist's auch mit euch, wenn ihr nicht in Gemeinschaft mit mir bleibt. 
[15:5] Ich bin der Weinstock, ihr seid die Reben. Wer in mir bleibt, und in wem ich bleibe, nur der bringt reiche Frucht; denn getrennt von mir könnt ihr nichts vollbringen. 
[15:6] Wer nicht in mir bleibt, dem geht es wie der (unfruchtbaren) Rebe: die wird hinausgeworfen und verdorrt; ja man sammelt solche Reben, wirft sie ins Feuer und verbrennt sie. 
[15:7] Bleibt ihr in mir und bleiben meine Worte in euch, so könnt ihr um alles bitten, was ihr wollt, und es soll euch zuteil werden. 
[15:8] Dadurch wird mein Vater verherrlicht, daß ihr reiche Frucht bringt: so werdet ihr auch meine rechten Jünger. 
[15:9] Wie mich der Vater geliebt hat, so habe ich euch auch geliebt. Bleibt in meiner Liebe! 
[15:10] Wenn ihr meine Gebote haltet, so werdet ihr in meiner Liebe bleiben, wie ich meines Vaters Gebote gehalten habe und in seiner Liebe bleibe. 
[15:11] So habe ich zu euch geredet, damit meine Freude in euch wohne, und eure Freude vollkommen werde. 
[15:12] Dies ist mein Gebot: Liebt einander, wie ich euch geliebt! 
[15:13] Niemand kann größere Liebe beweisen, als wenn er sein Leben opfert für seine Freunde. 
[15:14] Ihr seid meine Freunde, wenn ihr tut, was ich euch heiße. 
[15:15] Ich nenne euch nicht länger Diener; denn ein Diener hat keine Einsicht in das Wirken seines Herrn. Euch habe ich vielmehr (meine vertrauten) Freunde genannt; denn alles, was ich von meinem Vater vernommen, das habe ich euch kundgetan. 
[15:16] Nicht ihr habt mich erkoren; nein, ich habe euch erkoren und euch an euern Platz gesetzt; ihr sollt nun hingehen und Frucht bringen, und eure Frucht soll bleiben. Dabei wird euch der Vater geben, um was ihr ihn in meinem Namen bittet. 
[15:17] Dies gebiete ich euch: Liebt einander! 
[15:18] Haßt euch die Welt, so denkt daran: mich hat sie noch eher gehaßt als euch. 
[15:19] Gehört ihr zur Welt, so hätte euch die Welt lieb als ihresgleichen. Ihr gehört aber nicht zur Welt, sondern ich habe euch der Welt entnommen, und mir auserkoren; darum haßt euch nun die Welt. 
[15:20] Gedenkt des Wortes, das ich euch gesagt: 'Ein Diener steht nicht höher als sein Herr.' Haben sie mich verfolgt, so werden sie euch auch verfolgen; haben sie mein Wort gehalten, so werden sie auch das eure halten. 
[15:21] Dies alles aber werden sie euch antun, weil ihr von meinem Namen Zeugnis gebt; denn den, der mich gesandt hat, kennen sie nicht. 
[15:22] Wäre ich nicht gekommen und hätte ich nicht zu ihnen geredet, so hätten sie keine Sünde. Nun aber haben sie für ihre Sünde keine Entschuldigung. 
[15:23] Wer mich haßt, der haßt auch meinen Vater. 
[15:24] Hätte ich unter ihnen nicht die Werke getan, die kein anderer getan, so hätten sie keine Sünde. Nun aber haben sie mich und meinen Vater geschaut, und trotzdem sind sie voller Haß. 
[15:25] Doch so muß sich das Wort erfüllen, das in ihrem Gesetz geschrieben steht: Sie haben mich ohne Grund gehaßt. 
[15:26] Wenn aber der Helfer kommt, den ich euch von dem Vater senden will, der Geist der Wahrheit, der vom Vater ausgeht, so wird er von mir Zeugnis geben. 
[15:27] Und auch ihr seid meine Zeugen, weil ihr von Anfang an bei mir gewesen seid. 
[16:1] So rede ich zu euch, damit ihr später keinen Anstoß nehmt. 
[16:2] Man wird euch in den Bann tun. Ja die Stunde kommt, wo jeder, der euch tötet, damit Gott ein Opfer darzubringen glaubt. 
[16:3] So wird man gegen euch verfahren, weil man nicht den Vater kennt noch mich. 
[16:4] Aber ich rede so zu euch, damit, wenn nun die Stunde kommt, wo sich's erfüllt, ihr daran denkt, daß ich es euch gesagt. Hierüber habe ich anfangs nicht zu euch gesprochen, weil ich ja bei euch war. 
[16:5] Nun aber gehe ich zu dem, der mich gesandt hat, und keiner von euch fragt mich: 'Wohin gehst du?' 
[16:6] Doch weil ich so zu euch geredet habe, ist euer Herz voll Traurigkeit. 
[16:7] Aber es ist volle Wahrheit, wenn ich euch jetzt sage: es dient zu euerm Heil, daß ich weggehe. Denn gehe ich nicht weg, so kommt der Helfer nicht zu euch. Wenn ich aber gehe, will ich ihn zu euch senden. 
[16:8] Und wenn er kommt, wird er der Welt Klarheit geben, wie sich's verhält mit Sünde, mit Gerechtigkeit und mit Gericht. 
[16:9] Die Sünde kommt ans Licht, weil sie nicht an mich glauben; 
[16:10] die Gerechtigkeit, weil ich zu meinem Vater gehe und ihr mich dann nicht länger seht; 
[16:11] das Gericht, weil der Beherrscher dieser Welt verurteilt ist. 
[16:12] Ich hätte euch noch viel zu sagen; doch jetzt könnt ihr's nicht tragen. 
[16:13] Wenn aber er, der Geist der Wahrheit, kommt, so wird er euch im Bereich der vollen Wahrheit Führer sein. Denn er wird nicht aus eigener Vollmacht reden; sondern was er hört, das wird er reden, und das Zukünftige wird er euch verkünden. 
[16:14] Er wird mich verherrlichen; denn von dem Meinen wird er nehmen und es euch verkünden. 
[16:15] Alles, was der Vater hat, ist mein. Darum sage ich: von dem Meinen nimmt er und wird's euch verkünden. 
[16:16] Noch eine kleine Weile, und ihr schaut mich nicht mehr; dann nochmals eine kleine Weile, und ihr sollt mich wiedersehen." 
[16:17] Da sprachen einige seiner Jünger zueinander: "Was mag er damit meinen, wenn er zu uns sagt: 'Noch eine kleine Weile, und ihr schaut mich nicht; dann nochmals eine kleine Weile, und ihr sollt mich wiedersehen', und weiter: 'Ich gehe hin zum Vater?'" 
[16:18] "Was meint er nur", so sprachen sie, "mit diesem Ausdruck: 'eine kleine Weile'? Wir verstehen seine Worte nicht." 
[16:19] Jesus merkte, daß sie ihn fragen wollten, und er sprach zu ihnen: "Redet ihr darüber miteinander, daß ich gesagt: 'Noch eine kleine Weile, und ihr schaut mich nicht; dann nochmals eine kleine Weile, und ihr sollt mich wiedersehen?' 
[16:20] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Ihr werdet weinen und klagen, die Welt aber wird sich freuen. Ihr werdet traurig sein, doch eure Traurigkeit soll sich in Freude wandeln. 
[16:21] Ist eine Frau in Kindesnöten, so hat sie Traurigkeit, denn ihre schwere Stunde ist gekommen. Hat sie aber das Kind geboren, so denkt sie nicht mehr an die Schmerzen, die sie durchgemacht: so groß ist ihre Freude, daß ein Mensch zur Welt gekommen ist. 
[16:22] So sollt auch ihr jetzt Trauer haben. Doch ich will euch wiedersehen; dann sollen eure Herzen voller Freude sein, und eure Freude soll euch niemand rauben. 
[16:23] An jenem Tag werdet ihr mich nach nichts mehr fragen. Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Wenn ihr den Vater um etwas bittet, so wird er's euch in meinem Namen geben. 
[16:24] Bisher habt ihr noch nichts in meinem Namen erbeten. Bittet, und ihr sollt empfangen, damit eure Freude vollkommen sei! 
[16:25] So rede ich zu euch in Bildern. Doch die Stunde kommt, wo ich nicht mehr in Bildern zu euch rede, sondern euch klar und deutlich von dem Vater Kunde gebe. 
[16:26] An jenem Tag werdet ihr in meinem Namen bitten. Ich sage euch nicht, daß ich den Vater für euch bitten werde. 
[16:27] Denn der Vater hat euch aus eigenem Antrieb lieb, weil ihr mich lieb gehabt und geglaubt habt, daß ich von Gott ausgegangen bin. 
[16:28] Ich bin vom Vater ausgegangen und in die Welt gekommen. Jetzt verlasse ich die Welt und gehe hin zum Vater." 
[16:29] Da sprachen seine Jünger: "Ja, nun redest du klar und deutlich und sprichst nicht mehr in Bildern. 
[16:30] Nun ist uns sicher, daß du alles weißt und nicht erst gefragt zu werden brauchst. Darum glauben wir, daß du von Gott ausgegangen bist." 
[16:31] Jesus antwortete ihnen: "So? Ihr glaubt nun? 
[16:32] Seht, es kommt die Stunde, ja sie ist schon da, wo ihr euch zerstreut, daß jeder seines Weges geht und ihr mich allein laßt. Aber ich bin nicht allein; denn der Vater ist bei mir. 
[16:33] Ich habe alles dies zu euch geredet, damit ihr in mir Frieden habt. In der Welt habt ihr Trübsal; doch seid getrost: ich habe die Welt überwunden!" 
[17:1] Nach diesen Worten hob Jesus seine Augen auf zum Himmel und sprach: "Vater, die Stunde ist nun da! Verherrliche deinen Sohn, auf daß der Sohn dich auch verherrliche! 
[17:2] Du hast ihm ja die Macht verliehen über alle Menschen, damit er allen, die du ihm gegeben, das ewige Leben schenke. 
[17:3] Dies aber ist ja das ewige Leben: daß man erkenne dich, den einen wahren Gott, und ihn, den du gesandt hast, Jesus Christus. 
[17:4] Ich habe dich verherrlicht hier auf Erden: Das Werk habe ich vollendet, das du mir hast zu tun gegeben. 
[17:5] Und jetzt verherrliche mich du, o Vater: Nimm mich zu dir in jene Herrlichkeit, die ich schon, eh die Welt war, bei dir hatte! 
[17:6] Ich habe deinen Namen kundgetan den Menschen, die du mir aus der Welt gegeben hast. Dein waren sie, mir hast du sie gegeben, und dein Wort haben sie befolgt. 
[17:7] Nun haben sie erkannt, daß alles, was du mir gegeben, von dir kommt. 
[17:8] Denn die Worte, die du mir vertraut, die habe ich ihnen mitgeteilt. Die haben sie auch angenommen: Sie haben in der Tat erkannt, daß ich von dir bin ausgegangen, und haben auch geglaubt, daß du mich hast gesandt. 
[17:9] Ich bitte nun für sie. Nicht für die Welt will ich jetzt bitten, sondern nur für sie, die du mir hast gegeben; denn sie sind dein. 
[17:10] Was mein ist, ist ja alles dein, und das, was dein, ist mein. So bin ich denn in ihnen auch verherrlicht. 
[17:11] Ich bleibe nun nicht länger in der Welt, sie bleiben noch hier in der Welt, ich aber gehe hin zu dir. Heiliger Vater, erhalte sie in deinem Namen, den kundzutun du mir verliehen hast, damit sie eins sein können, gleichwie wir eins sind. 
[17:12] Solange ich in ihrer Mitte weilte, erhielt ich sie in deinem Namen; sie, die du mir gegeben hast, die habe ich behütet, und keiner ist aus ihrem Kreis verloren als 'der Verlorene' allein, daß sich die Schrift erfülle. 
[17:13] Jetzt aber gehe ich zu dir; und dieses rede ich noch in der Welt, daß meine Freude ihre Herzen ganz erfülle. 
[17:14] Ich habe ihnen dein Wort mitgeteilt, die Welt jedoch ist gegen sie voll Haß. Denn sie gehören nicht zur Welt, wie ich nicht zur Welt gehöre. 
[17:15] Ich bitte nicht: Nimm sie aus dieser Welt, bewahre sie vielmehr, daß sie nicht in des Bösen Macht geraten! 
[17:16] Sie gehören nicht zur Welt, wie ich nicht zur Welt gehöre. 
[17:17] Weihe sie mit deiner Wahrheit: Dein Wort ist ja die Wahrheit. 
[17:18] Gleichwie du mich gesandt hast in die Welt, so habe auch ich sie in die Welt gesandt. 
[17:19] Zu ihrem Heil weihe ich mich als Opfer, damit auch sie wahrhaft Geweihte seien. 
[17:20] Ich bitte aber nicht für sie allein. Ich bitte auch für jene, die durch ihr Zeugnis an mich glauben. 
[17:21] Laß sie alle eins sein, wie du, Vater, in mir und ich in dir! Laß auch sie in uns eins sein, damit die Welt es glaube, daß du mich gesandt! 
[17:22] Darum habe ich die Herrlichkeit, die du mir gegeben, auch ihnen mitgeteilt, damit sie eins sein können, gleichwie wir eins sind. 
[17:23] Ich bin in ihnen, und du bist in mir; so laß auch sie nun eng verbunden sein in eins, damit die Welt erkenne, daß du mich gesandt und sie geliebt hast, wie du mich geliebt. 
[17:24] Vater, mein Verlangen ist, daß alle, die du mir gegeben hast, dort mit mir weilen, wo ich bin, damit sie schauen meine Herrlichkeit, die ich von dir empfangen; denn du hast mich geliebt vor Grundlegung der Welt. 
[17:25] Gerechter Vater, hat auch die Welt dich nicht erkannt, ich habe dich erkannt, und diese hier, sie haben es erkannt, daß du mich hast gesandt. 
[17:26] Und deinen Namen habe ich ihnen kundgetan und will ihn weiter kundtun, damit die Liebe, die du mir bewiesen, auch in ihnen sei, und ich in ihnen." 
[18:1] Nach diesen Worten ging Jesus mit seinen Jüngern hinaus über den Kidronbach. Dort war ein Garten. In den trat Jesus mit seinen Jüngern. 
[18:2] Auch Judas, sein Verräter, kannte diesen Ort; denn Jesus hatte sich oft mit seinen Jüngern dorthin begeben. 
[18:3] Judas nahm nun eine Abteilung Soldaten nebst der Mannschaft, die die Hohenpriester und die Pharisäer stellten, unter sein Geleit und kam mit dieser Schar, die Fackeln, Lampen und Waffen trugen, an jenen Ort. 
[18:4] Jesus wußte alles, was über ihn kommen sollte. So trat er denn hinaus und fragte sie: "Wen sucht ihr?" 
[18:5] Sie antworteten ihm: "Jesus von Nazaret." Jesus sprach zu ihnen: "Ich bin's!" Judas, sein Verräter, stand auch bei ihnen. 
[18:6] Als nun Jesus zu ihnen sprach: "Ich bin's", da prallten sie zurück und fielen zu Boden. 
[18:7] Dann fragte er sie nochmals: "Wen sucht ihr?" Sie sprachen: "Jesus von Nazaret." 
[18:8] Jesus erwiderte: "Ich habe euch gesagt, daß ich es bin. Sucht ihr nun mich, so laßt diese ihres Weges gehen!" 
[18:9] Das sagte er, damit sein Ausspruch sich erfülle: "Von denen, die du mir gegeben, habe ich keinen verloren." 
[18:10] Simon Petrus trug ein Schwert. Das zog er, schlug nach des Hohenpriesters Knecht und hieb ihm das rechte Ohr ab. Der Knecht hieß Malchus. 
[18:11] Jesus aber sprach zu Petrus: "Stecke das Schwert in die Scheide! Soll ich den Kelch nicht trinken, den mir der Vater gereicht hat?" 
[18:12] Die Soldatentruppe mit ihrem Oberhauptmann und die Mannschaft des Hohen Rates ergriffen Jesus und banden ihn. 
[18:13] Man führte ihn zuerst zu Hannas. Dies war der Schwiegervater des Kaiphas, der in jenem Jahr Hoherpriester war. 
[18:14] Kaiphas aber war es, der den Juden geraten hatte: "Es ist gut, daß ein Mensch für das Volk zugrunde gehe." 
[18:15] Simon Petrus aber und ein anderer Jünger folgten Jesus. Dieser Jünger war mit dem Hohenpriester bekannt und trat darum mit Jesus in den Hof des hohenpriesterlichen Palastes, 
[18:16] während Petrus draußen an der Pforte stehen blieb. Da ging der andere Jünger, der mit dem Hohenpriester bekannt war, hinaus, redete mit der Pförtnerin und führte Petrus in den Hof. 
[18:17] Da sprach die Magd, die den Dienst als Pförtnerin versah, zu Petrus: "Bist du nicht auch ein Jünger dieses Menschen?" Er sagte: "Nein!" 
[18:18] Die Knechte und die Mannschaft standen um ein Kohlenfeuer, das sie der Kälte wegen angezündet hatten, und wärmten sich. Auch Petrus stand bei ihnen und wärmte sich. 
[18:19] Der Hohepriester fragte nun Jesus wegen seiner Jünger und seiner Lehre. 
[18:20] Jesus antwortete ihm: "Ich habe ja frei und offen zu aller Welt geredet. Ich habe stets gelehrt in den Versammlungshäusern und im Tempel, wo sich alle Juden einzufinden pflegen, und im geheimen habe ich nichts verkündigt. 
[18:21] Warum fragst du mich? Frage meine Hörer, was ich zu ihnen geredet habe; sie wissen ja, was ich gesagt." 
[18:22] Als Jesus dies entgegnete, gab ihm einer von den Dienern, der bei ihm stand, einen Schlag ins Gesicht, indem er sprach: "So antwortest du dem Hohenpriester?" 
[18:23] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Habe ich unrecht geredet, so beweise mir das Unrecht! Ist meine Antwort aber recht, warum schlägst du mich?" 
[18:24] Hannas sandte ihn dann gefesselt zu dem Hohenpriester Kaiphas. 
[18:25] Simon Petrus stand inzwischen da und wärmte sich. Da fragte man ihn: "Gehörst du nicht auch zu seinen Jüngern?" Er leugnete aber und sagte: "Nein!" 
[18:26] Da sprach einer von des Hohenpriesters Knechten, ein Verwandter dessen, dem Petrus das Ohr abgehauen hatte: "Habe ich dich nicht im Garten bei ihm gesehen?" 
[18:27] Petrus leugnete abermals. Plötzlich krähte ein Hahn. 
[18:28] Von Kaiphas führte man Jesus in die Statthalterei. Der Tag begann zu grauen. Die Juden selbst betraten den Statthalterpalast nicht, damit sie vor Verunreinigung bewahrt blieben und das Passah essen könnten. 
[18:29] So ging denn Pilatus zu ihnen hinaus und fragte sie: "Welche Anklage erhebt ihr gegen diesen Menschen?" 
[18:30] Sie antworteten ihm: "Wäre der Mann nicht ein Verbrecher, wir hätten ihn dir nicht ausgeliefert." 
[18:31] Da sprach Pilatus zu ihnen: "Dann nehmt ihr ihn hin und sprecht ihm nach euerm Gesetz das Urteil!" Die Juden aber erwiderten ihm: "Wir haben nicht das Recht, ein Todesurteil zu vollstrecken." 
[18:32] So mußte sich jener Ausspruch Jesu erfüllen, worin er darauf hinwies, welches Todes er sterben sollte. 
[18:33] Pilatus ging in den Palast zurück, ließ Jesus rufen und fragte ihn: "Du bist der Juden König?" 
[18:34] Jesus antwortete: "Meinst du das selbst, oder haben es dir andere von mir gesagt?" 
[18:35] Pilatus entgegnete: "Bin ich denn ein Jude? Dein eigen Volk und namentlich die Hohenpriester haben dich mir überliefert. Was hast du getan?" 
[18:36] Jesus erwiderte: "Mein Königtum stammt nicht aus dieser Welt. Stammte mein Königtum aus dieser Welt, meine Mannen hätten sich voll Mut zur Wehr gesetzt, daß ich nicht den Juden preisgegeben wäre. Nun aber stammt mein Königtum nicht von dieser Erde." 
[18:37] "Also bist du doch ein König?" fragte ihn Pilatus. "Ja, du hast recht, ich bin ein König", war Jesu Antwort. "Dazu bin ich geboren, und dazu bin ich aufgetreten in der Welt, um Zeugnis für die Wahrheit abzulegen. Wer ein Freund der Wahrheit ist, der hört auf meine Stimme." 
[18:38] "Was ist Wahrheit?" entgegnete ihm Pilatus. Nach dieser Antwort ging er wieder zu den Juden hinaus und sprach zu ihnen: 
[18:39] "Ich finde keine Schuld an ihm. Es ist aber Brauch bei euch, daß ich euch am Passahfest einen Gefangenen losgebe. Soll ich euch nun den Judenkönig losgeben?" 
[18:40] Da fingen sie wieder an zu schreien: "Nein, nicht den, sondern Barabbas!" Barabbas aber war ein Räuber. 
[19:1] Pilatus ließ nun Jesus ergreifen und geißeln. 
[19:2] Die Kriegsknechte aber flochten aus Dornen eine Krone und setzten sie ihm aufs Haupt und legten ihm einen Purpurmantel an. 
[19:3] Dann gingen sie auf ihn zu und riefen: "Heil dir, Judenkönig!" Dabei schlugen sie ihn ins Angesicht. 
[19:4] Dann ging Pilatus wieder hinaus und sprach zu ihnen: "Ich führe ihn euch vor, damit ihr seht: ich finde keine Schuld an ihm." 
[19:5] Jesus trat hervor mit der Dornenkrone und dem Purpurmantel. Pilatus sprach zu ihnen: "Seht, da ist der Mensch!" 
[19:6] Sobald ihn aber die Hohenpriester und ihre Diener erblickten, begannen sie zu schreien: "Ans Kreuz mit ihm, ans Kreuz!" Pilatus sprach zu ihnen: "Nehmt ihr ihn hin und kreuzigt ihn, denn ich finde keine Schuld an ihm." 
[19:7] Die Juden antworteten ihm: "Wir haben ein Gesetz, und nach dem Gesetz muß er sterben; denn er hat sich für Gottes Sohn erklärt." 
[19:8] Als Pilatus diese Worte hörte, erschrak er noch mehr. 
[19:9] Er ging in den Palast zurück und fragte Jesus: "Woher bist du?" Jesus aber gab ihm keine Antwort. 
[19:10] "Willst du mir nicht Rede stehen?" herrschte ihn Pilatus an. "Weißt du nicht, daß ich die Macht habe, dich kreuzigen zu lassen, und auch die Macht, dich freizugeben?" 
[19:11] "Du hättest keine Macht über mich", erwiderte ihm Jesus, "wenn sie dir nicht von oben her verliehen wäre. Darum ist jener Mann, der mich dir ausgeliefert hat, schuldiger als du." 
[19:12] Dieser Antwort wegen wollte ihn Pilatus freilassen. Die Juden aber schrien: "Gibst du den Mann los, so meinst du es nicht redlich mit dem Kaiser. Wer sich zum König erklärt, der ist ein Feind des Kaisers." 
[19:13] Als Pilatus eine solche Sprache hörte, ließ er Jesus hinausführen. Dann setzte er sich auf den Richterstuhl, der an einem Platz stand, den man "Steinpflaster" nannte — auf hebräisch Gabbatha. 
[19:14] Es war am Freitag in der Passahwoche, etwa um die sechste Stunde. Pilatus sprach zu den Juden: "Seht, da ist euer König!" 
[19:15] Sie aber schrien: "Weg, weg! Ans Kreuz mit ihm!" Pilatus fragte sie: "Soll ich denn euern König kreuzigen?" Die Hohenpriester erwiderten: "Wir haben keinen König als den Kaiser." 
[19:16] Da übergab er ihnen Jesus zur Kreuzigung. Nun ergriff man Jesus. 
[19:17] Indem er selbst sein Kreuz trug, ging er hinaus nach der sogenannten Schädelstätte — auf hebräisch heißt sie Golgatha —. 
[19:18] Dort kreuzigte man ihn und außerdem zwei andere, den einen rechts von ihm, den anderen links. Jesus aber in der Mitte. 
[19:19] Pilatus ließ auch eine Inschrift schreiben und sie oben auf das Kreuz setzen; die lautete: Jesus von Nazaret, der Juden König. 
[19:20] Diese Inschrift lasen viele Juden; denn die Stätte, wo Jesus gekreuzigt wurde, lag nahe bei der Stadt. Und die Inschrift war abgefaßt in hebräischer, lateinischer und griechischer Sprache. 
[19:21] Da sagten die jüdischen Hohenpriester zu Pilatus: "Schreibe nicht: 'Der Juden König', sondern: 'Dieser Mann hat behauptet: Ich bin der Juden König.'" 
[19:22] Pilatus aber erwiderte: "Was ich geschrieben habe, das bleibt!" 
[19:23] Als die Soldaten Jesus gekreuzigt hatten, nahmen sie seine Kleider und teilten sie in vier Teile, für jeden Soldaten einen Teil. Nun war das Unterkleid noch übrig. Das war ohne Naht, von oben an in einem Stück gewebt. 
[19:24] Da sprachen sie zueinander: "Wir wollen es nicht zerschneiden, sondern durchs Los entscheiden, wer es haben soll." Denn es mußte das Schriftwort in Erfüllung gehen: Sie haben meine Kleider unter sich geteilt und über mein Gewand das Los geworfen. Das taten die Soldaten. 
[19:25] Es standen aber bei Jesu Kreuz seine Mutter, seiner Mutter Schwester, Maria, die Frau des Kleopas, und Maria aus Magdala. 
[19:26] Als nun Jesus seine Mutter sah und neben ihr den Jünger, den er liebhatte, sprach er zu seiner Mutter: "Das ist jetzt dein Sohn!" 
[19:27] Dann sprach er zu dem Jünger: "Das ist jetzt deine Mutter!" Von dieser Stunde an nahm sie der Jünger zu sich in sein Haus. 
[19:28] Jesus wußte, daß nun sein Werk vollbracht war. Darum sprach er, damit die Schrift ganz in Erfüllung gehe: "Mich dürstet." 
[19:29] Es stand dort ein Gefäß voll Essig. Darin tränkte man einen Schwamm, den man dann auf einen Ysopstengel steckte und ihm zum Mund führte. 
[19:30] Als Jesus den Essig genommen hatte, sprach er: "Es ist vollbracht!" Dann neigte er das Haupt und gab den Geist auf. 
[19:31] Es war Freitag. Damit nun die Leichname nicht den Sabbat über am Kreuz blieben — denn jener Sabbat war ein besonders hoher Feiertag —, deshalb baten die Juden Pilatus, er möge den Gekreuzigten die Beine zerschmettern und sie vom Kreuz nehmen lassen. 
[19:32] So kamen die Soldaten und zerschmetterten die Beine des ersten, dann die des anderen jener beiden, die mit Jesus gekreuzigt worden waren. 
[19:33] Als sie aber zu Jesus kamen und bemerkten, daß der Tod bei ihm schon eingetreten war, da zerschmetterten sie ihm die Beine nicht. 
[19:34] Doch einer der Soldaten durchbohrte ihm die Seite mit der Lanze: sofort floß Blut und Wasser heraus. 
[19:35] Der dies gesehen hat, tritt als Zeuge dafür ein, und sein Zeugnis ist zuverlässig. Er weiß, daß er die Wahrheit spricht, damit auch ihr glaubt. 
[19:36] Denn dies ist geschehen, damit sich das Schriftwort erfülle: Kein Knochen soll an ihm gebrochen werden. 
[19:37] Ferner sagt ein anderes Schriftwort: Sie sollen schauen auf ihn, den sie durchbohrt. 
[19:38] Danach richtete Josef von Arimathäa — ein Jünger Jesu, doch aus Furcht vor den Juden nur im geheimen — die Bitte an Pilatus, daß er Jesu Leichnam vom Kreuz nehmen dürfe. Pilatus gab die Erlaubnis. So kam er und nahm den Leichnam ab. 
[19:39] Auch Nikodemus fand sich ein — derselbe, der Jesus bei Nacht besucht hatte — und brachte eine Mischung aus Myrrhenharz und Aloeholz, gegen hundert Pfund. 
[19:40] Nun nahmen sie den Leichnam Jesu und hüllten ihn samt den wohlriechenden Gewürzen in leinene Binden ein, wie es nach jüdischer Begräbnissitte üblich war. 
[19:41] Nahe bei der Stätte aber, wo Jesus gekreuzigt ward, lag ein Garten, und in dem Garten war ein neues Grab, worin noch niemand beigesetzt war. 
[19:42] Dort betteten sie Jesus, weil das Grab ganz in der Nähe lag; denn wegen des jüdischen Sabbats, der am nächsten Tag war, hatten sie es eilig. 
[20:1] Am ersten Wochentag früh, als es noch dunkel war, ging Maria von Magdala zum Grab. Da sah sie, daß der Stein vom Grab weggenommen war. 
[20:2] Eilend lief sie nun zu Simon Petrus und zu dem anderen Jünger, den Jesus liebhatte, und sprach zu ihnen: "Man hat den Herrn aus dem Grab weggenommen; und wir wissen nicht, wohin man ihn gelegt hat." 
[20:3] Da machte sich Petrus mit den anderen Jüngern auf den Weg zum Grab. 
[20:4] Beide liefen miteinander. Doch der andere Jünger, der schneller war als Petrus, eilte ihm voraus und kam zuerst zum Grab. 
[20:5] Dort bückte er sich nieder und sah die leinenen Binden liegen, ging aber nicht hinein. 
[20:6] Nun kam auch Simon Petrus nach. Der betrat das Grab. Er sah dort die leinenen Binden liegen; 
[20:7] das Schweißtuch aber, das Jesu Haupt verhüllt hatte, lag nicht bei den Binden, sondern besonders aufgerollt an einer anderen Stelle. 
[20:8] Nun ging auch der andere Jünger hinein, der zuerst zum Grab gekommen war: er sah und glaubte. 
[20:9] Denn damals verstanden sie die Schrift noch nicht, worin gesagt wird, daß er von den Toten auferstehen müsse. 
[20:10] Dann kehrten die Jünger wieder nach Hause zurück. 
[20:11] Maria aber blieb draußen bei dem Grab stehen und schluchzte laut. Wie sie nun so weinte, beugte sie sich vor und sah ins Grab hinein. 
[20:12] Da nahm sie wahr, wie zwei Engel in weißen Gewändern dasaßen; der eine an dem Kopfende, der andere an dem Fußende der Stelle, wo Jesu Leichnam gelegen hatte. 
[20:13] Die Engel fragten sie: "Warum weinst du?" Sie antwortete: "Man hat meinen Herrn weggenommen, und ich weiß nicht, wohin man ihn gelegt hat." 
[20:14] Nach diesen Worten wandte sie sich um und sah Jesus dastehen. — Sie wußte aber nicht, daß es Jesus war. — 
[20:15] Jesus fragte sie: "Warum weinst du? Wen suchst du?" In der Meinung, es sei der Gärtner, sprach sie zu ihm: "Herr, hast du ihn weggetragen, so sage mir, wohin du ihn gelegt hast? Dann will ich ihn holen." 
[20:16] Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Maria!" Da wandte sie sich ganz zu ihm und rief auf hebräisch "Rabbuni!" — das heißt: Meister —. 
[20:17] Jesus sprach zu ihr: "Klammere dich nicht an mich! Denn ich bin noch nicht zum Vater aufgefahren. Geh aber hin zu meinen Brüdern und sage ihnen: 'Ich fahre auf zu meinem Vater und zu euerm Vater, zu meinem Gott und zu euerm Gott.'" 
[20:18] Da brachte Maria von Magdala den Jüngern die Botschaft, daß sie den Herrn gesehen und daß er dies zu ihr geredet habe. 
[20:19] Am Abend jenes ersten Wochentages, als die Jünger aus Furcht vor den Juden bei verschlossenen Türen versammelt waren, kam Jesus und trat in ihren Kreis mit den Worten: "Friede sei mit euch!" 
[20:20] Als er dies gesagt hatte, zeigte er ihnen seine Hände und seine Seite. Da freuten sich die Jünger, als sie den Herrn sahen. 
[20:21] Dann sprach er abermals zu ihnen: "Friede sei mit euch! Wie mich der Vater ausgesandt hat, so sende ich nun euch." 
[20:22] Nach diesen Worten hauchte er sie an und sprach zu ihnen: "Nehmt hin den Heiligen Geist! 
[20:23] Wem ihr die Sünden vergebt, dem sind sie auch vergeben; wem ihr sie behaltet, dem bleiben sie behalten." 
[20:24] Thomas, einer von den Zwölf, mit dem Beinamen "Zwilling", war nicht dabei, als Jesus kam. 
[20:25] Da erzählten ihm die anderen Jünger: "Wir haben den Herrn gesehen." Er aber erwiderte ihnen: "Erst will ich in seinen Händen die Nägelmale sehen, erst will ich mit meinen Fingern die Nägelmale betasten und meine Hand in seine Seite legen: — sonst glaube ich nun und nimmer!" 
[20:26] Acht Tage später waren seine Jünger wieder in demselben Haus. Auch Thomas war bei ihnen. Da kam Jesus bei verschlossenen Türen und trat in ihren Kreis mit den Worten: "Friede sei mit euch!" 
[20:27] Dann sprach er zu Thomas: "Leg deinen Finger hier auf diese Stelle und sieh dir meine Hände an! Dann reiche deine Hand her und lege sie in meine Seite und werde nicht ungläubig, sondern gläubig!" 
[20:28] Da antwortete ihm Thomas: "Mein Herr und mein Gott!" 
[20:29] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Weil du mich gesehen hast, bist du nun gläubig? Selig sind, die nicht gesehen haben und doch glauben!" 
[20:30] Noch viele andere Wunderzeichen hat Jesus vor den Augen seiner Jünger getan, die nicht in diesem Buch aufgezeichnet stehen. 
[20:31] Diese aber sind verzeichnet, damit ihr glaubt, Jesus sei der Messias, der Sohn Gottes, und damit ihr durch diesen Glauben Leben habt in seinem Namen. 
[21:1] Danach offenbarte sich Jesus nochmals seinen Jüngern. Das geschah an dem See Tiberias. Er offenbarte sich aber so: 
[21:2] Simon Petrus, Thomas, mit dem Beinamen "Zwilling", Nathanael aus Kana in Galiläa, die Söhne des Zebedäus und zwei andere seiner Jünger waren beisammen. 
[21:3] Da sprach Simon Petrus zu ihnen: "Ich will fischen gehen." Die anderen sagten: "Wir kommen mit." Sie gingen hinaus (an den See) und stiegen in ihr Boot. Aber in jener Nacht fingen sie nichts. 
[21:4] Bei Tagesanbruch stand Jesus am Ufer. Doch die Jünger wußten nicht, daß es Jesus war. 
[21:5] Da fragte sie Jesus: "Kinder, habt ihr nichts zu essen?" "Nein!" war ihre Antwort. 
[21:6] Da fuhr er fort: "Werft euer Netz rechts vom Boot aus, dann macht ihr einen Fang!" Sie warfen es aus und konnten es nicht mehr emporziehen, so voll war es von Fischen. 
[21:7] Da sprach der Jünger, den Jesus liebte, zu Petrus: "Es ist der Herr!" Als Simon Petrus hörte, es sei der Herr, da warf er, weil er nackt war, sein kurzes Hemd über und sprang ins Wasser. 
[21:8] Die anderen Jünger kamen in dem kleinen Boot — denn sie waren nur noch etwa zweihundert Ellen vom Land entfernt — und schleppten das Netz mit den Fischen hinter sich her. 
[21:9] Wie sie nun ans Land stiegen, sahen sie ein Kohlenfeuer brennen; darauf briet Fisch, und es lag Brot dabei. 
[21:10] Jesus sprach zu ihnen: "Bringt von den Fischen, die ihr eben gefangen habt!" 
[21:11] Da stieg Petrus in das Boot und zog das Netz ans Land: es war voll großer Fische, im ganzen einhundertunddreiundfünfzig. Aber trotz dieser großen Menge war das Netz nicht zerrissen. 
[21:12] Nun forderte sie Jesus auf: "Kommt her und eßt!" Keiner aber von den Jüngern wagte ihn zu fragen: "Wer bist du?" Denn sie wußten, es war der Herr. 
[21:13] Jesus kam nun, nahm das Brot und gab es ihnen, ebenso auch die Fische. 
[21:14] Dies war nun schon das dritte Mal, daß sich Jesus nach seiner Auferstehung von den Toten seinen Jüngern offenbarte. 
[21:15] Nach diesem Mahl sprach Jesus zu Simon Petrus: "Simon, des Johannes Sohn, liebst du mich mehr als diese hier?" Er antwortete ihm: "Ja, Herr, du weißt, daß ich dich liebhabe." Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Weide meine Lämmer!" 
[21:16] Dann fragte er ihn zum zweitenmal: "Simon, des Johannes Sohn, liebst du mich?" Er antwortete ihm: "Ja, Herr, du weißt, daß ich dich liebhabe." Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Leite meine Schafe!" 
[21:17] Dann fragte er ihn zum drittenmal: "Simon, des Johannes Sohn, hast du mich lieb?" Petrus war betrübt, daß er ihn zum drittenmal fragte: "Hast du mich lieb?" und er antwortete ihm: "Herr, du weißt alles; du siehst: ich habe dich lieb!" Jesus sprach zu ihm: "Weide meine Schafe! 
[21:18] Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage dir: Als du noch jünger warst, pflegtest du dich selbst zu gürten und nach eigener Wahl umherzugehen. Doch bist du einst ein alter Mann, so wirst du deine Hände ausstrecken, und andere werden dich gürten und dich zu einer Stätte führen, die du dir nicht gewählt hast." 
[21:19] - Mit diesen Worten wollte er andeuten, durch welchen Tod er Gott verherrlichen sollte. — Dann fuhr er fort: "Komm mit mir!" 
[21:20] Petrus wandte sich um und sah, wie auch der Jünger mitkam, den Jesus liebhatte — derselbe, der sich auch bei dem bekannten Mahl an seine Brust gelehnt und ihn gefragt hatte: "Herr, wer ist denn dein Verräter?" — 
[21:21] Als Petrus ihn erblickte, sprach er zu Jesus: "Herr, wie wird es ihm ergehen?" 
[21:22] Jesus erwiderte ihm: "Wenn es mein Wille ist, daß er am Leben bleibe, bis ich komme, was geht es dich an? Komm du jetzt mit mir!" 
[21:23] Daher verbreitete sich unter den Brüdern das Gerücht: Dieser Jünger stirbt nicht. Aber Jesus hat nicht zu ihm gesagt: "Er stirbt nicht", sondern: "Wenn es mein Wille ist, daß er am Leben bleibe, bis ich komme..." 
[21:24] Dies ist der Jünger, der das, was hier berichtet wird, bezeugt, und der auch dieses Buch geschrieben hat. Und wir wissen, daß sein Zeugnis wahr ist. 
[21:25] Es gibt aber noch vieles andere, was Jesus getan hat. Wollte man das alles einzeln niederschreiben, ich glaube, nicht einmal die ganze Welt hätte für die Bücher Raum, die dann geschrieben werden müßten. 

### Acts

[1:1] In meinem ersten Buch, lieber Theophilus, habe ich einen Bericht über Jesu gesamtes Wirken und Lehren gegeben, 
[1:2] und zwar von seinem ersten Auftreten an bis zu dem Tag seiner Himmelfahrt. Vorher erteilte er seinen Aposteln, die er sich durch den Heiligen Geist auserwählt hatte, bestimmte Aufträge. 
[1:3] Schon gleich nach seinem Leiden stellte er sich ihnen lebendig dar und gab ihnen viele untrügliche Beweise von seiner Auferstehung; denn vierzig Tage hindurch erschien er ihnen und belehrte sie über Gottes Königreich. 
[1:4] Als er nun einst mit ihnen aß, gebot er ihnen, Jerusalem nicht zu verlassen, sondern dort auf die vom Vater verheißene Gabe zu warten. "Darüber", so fuhr er fort, "habt ihr ja schon von mir gehört. 
[1:5] Denn Johannes hat mit Wasser getauft, ihr aber sollt mit dem Heiligen Geist getauft werden: und bis dahin sind nur noch wenig Tage." 
[1:6] Als sie wieder versammelt waren, fragten sie ihn: "Herr, stellst du jetzt in dieser Zeit das Königreich für Israel von neuem her?" 
[1:7] Er antwortete ihnen: "Ihr braucht nicht Zeit oder Stunde zu kennen, die der Vater in seiner Machtvollkommenheit bestimmt hat. 
[1:8] Aber ihr sollt Kraft empfangen, wenn der Heilige Geist auf euch herabkommt, und dann sollt ihr meine Zeugen sein in Jerusalem und in ganz Judäa und Samaria, ja bis ans Ende der Erde." 
[1:9] Nach diesen Worten ward er vor ihren Augen aufgehoben, und eine Wolke entzog ihn ihren Blicken. 
[1:10] Wie sie nun bei seinem Weggang unverwandt zum Himmel sahen, standen plötzlich zwei Männer in weißen Gewändern bei ihnen, 
[1:11] die sprachen: "Ihr Galiläer, was steht ihr da und seht zum Himmel? Dieser selbe Jesus, der jetzt aus eurer Mitte in den Himmel aufgenommen ist, wird ganz in der gleichen Weise wiederkommen, wie ihr ihn habt in den Himmel fahren sehen." 
[1:12] Danach kehrten sie von dem sogenannten Ölberg nach Jerusalem zurück. Dieser Berg ist nur einen Sabbatweg von der Stadt entfernt. 
[1:13] Nach ihrer Ankunft in der Stadt begaben sie sich in den Obersaal, wo sie sich zu versammeln pflegten. Es waren aber da: Petrus und Johannes, Jakobus und Andreas, Philippus und Thomas, Bartholomäus und Matthäus, Jakobus, des Alphäus Sohn, und Simon der Eiferer und Judas, des Jakobus Sohn. 
[1:14] Diese alle waren einmütig und beharrlich zum Gebet vereinigt; auch waren noch zugegen einige Frauen, namentlich Maria, die Mutter Jesu, und ferner seine Brüder. 
[1:15] An einem dieser Tage erhob sich Petrus inmitten der Brüder — es waren etwa 120 versammelt — und sprach: 
[1:16] "Ihr Männer, liebe Brüder, erfüllen mußte sich die Weissagung in dem Schriftwort, das der Heilige Geist durch Davids Mund geredet hat von Judas, der Jesu Häschern ein Führer gewesen ist; 
[1:17] er gehörte ja zu unserer Zahl und hatte dasselbe Amt empfangen wie wir. 
[1:18] Der hat sich für seinen Verbrecherlohn ein Grundstück erworben; aber er ist kopfüber gefallen und mitten entzweigeborsten, so daß alle seine Eingeweide herausgetreten sind. 
[1:19] Dies ist allen Bewohnern Jerusalems so gut bekannt, daß jenes Grundstück in ihrer Sprache den Namen Akeldamach trägt, das heißt, Blutacker. 
[1:20] Im Psalmbuch steht nämlich geschrieben: Sein Gehöft werde wüste, und niemand wohne dort! und: Seinen Dienst übernehme ein anderer! 
[1:21] Darum muß nun einer von den Männern, die mit uns zusammengewesen sind während der ganzen Zeit, wo der Herr Jesus bei uns ein- und ausgegangen ist, 
[1:22] und zwar von der Taufe des Johannes an bis zu dem Tag, da er von uns schied und (in den Himmel) aufgenommen wurde, dazu erwählt werden, seine Auferstehung mit uns zu bezeugen." 
[1:23] Nun stellten sie zwei auf: Josef, genannt Barsabbas, mit dem Beinamen Justus, und Matthias. 
[1:24] Dann beteten sie: "Herr, der du aller Herzen kennst, mache du kund, wen du dir von diesen beiden auserkoren hast, 
[1:25] um die Stelle in diesem Dienst und Apostelamt einzunehmen, die Judas freventlich verlassen hat, damit er an die Stätte gehe, die ihm gebührt." 
[1:26] Darauf warf man das Los über sie. Es fiel auf Matthias, und der wurde nun den elf Aposteln zugezählt. 
[2:1] Als der Pfingsttag endlich kam, waren sie alle miteinander beisammen. 
[2:2] Da kam plötzlich vom Himmel her ein Brausen, als wenn ein gewaltiger Windsturm wehte. 29 oder 30 n.Chr. Dies Rauschen durchdrang das ganze Haus, in dem sie saßen. 
[2:3] Dann erschienen ihnen feuerähnliche Zungen, die sich über die Versammelten verteilten, und auf einen jeden unter ihnen setzte sich ein Zünglein. 
[2:4] So wurden alle vom Heiligen Geist erfüllt und begannen in anderen Sprachen zu reden, je wie der Geist ihnen die Worte dazu verlieh. 
[2:5] Nun weilten damals fromme Juden in Jerusalem, die von allen Himmelsgegenden gekommen waren. 
[2:6] Die eilten, als der Schall ertönte, in großer Zahl herbei und waren fassungslos, weil jeder seine Landessprache reden hörte. 
[2:7] Ja alle waren außer sich und riefen verwundert: "All die Männer, die hier reden, sind doch Galiläer! 
[2:8] Wie kommt es denn, daß jeder von uns seine Muttersprache hört? 
[2:9] Einige von uns sind Parther, Meder und Elamiter. Andere wohnen in dem Judenland Mesopotamien und in Kappadozien, in Pontus und Asien, 
[2:10] in Phrygien und Pamphylien, in Ägypten oder in dem Teil Libyens, der bei Kyrene liegt; andere sind in Rom ansässig. 
[2:11] Die einen sind geborene Juden, andere waren Heiden und haben sich zum Judentum bekehrt. Da sind auch Kreter unter uns und Araber. Und wir alle hören diese Männer in unseren Sprachen von den großen Taten Gottes reden!" 
[2:12] Alle waren voll Staunen und Bestürzung, und einer sprach zum anderen: "Was hat das zu bedeuten?" 
[2:13] Andere aber riefen spöttisch lachend: "Sie haben sicher zuviel süßen Wein getrunken!" 
[2:14] Da erhob sich Petrus mit den Elf und sprach mit lauter Stimme: "Ihr Juden, die ihr hier im Lande wohnt, und ihr anderen alle, die ihr jetzt vorübergehend in Jerusalem verweilt, dies soll euch kund sein, hört darum auf meine Worte! 
[2:15] Nicht sind die Männer hier, wie ihr vermutet, trunken; es ist ja erst die dritte Tagesstunde. 
[2:16] Vielmehr erfüllt sich nun, was Joel, der Prophet, gesagt hat: 
[2:17] Es soll geschehen in den letzten Tagen — so spricht Gott —, daß ich von meinem Geist ausgießen will auf alle Menschen, dann sollen eure Söhne und eure Töchter weissagen, eure Jünglinge sollen Gesichte schauen, und eure Greise sollen Träume haben. 
[2:18] Sogar auf die leibeigenen Knechte und Mägde, die mir dienen, will ich in jenen Tagen von meinem Geist ausgießen, und sie sollen weissagen. 
[2:19] Und Wunder will ich tun am Himmel oben und Zeichen unten auf der Erde: Blut, Feuersbrunst und Rauch. 
[2:20] Die Sonne soll sich verfinstern, und der Mond soll blutig scheinen, bevor der Tag des Herrn kommt, der große Tag, den alle schauen sollen. 
[2:21] Wer aber des Herrn Namen anruft, soll errettet werden. 
[2:22] Ihr Israeliten, hört diese Worte! Den Mann Jesus von Nazaret hat Gott bei euch beglaubigt. Denn mächtige Taten, Wunder und Zeichen hat Gott, wie ihr ja wißt, in eurer Mitte durch ihn gewirkt. 
[2:23] Der ist euch ausgeliefert worden durch Verrat — wie Gott in seinem Ratschluß es vorherbestimmt und auch vorhergewußt hat —, und mit der Heiden Hilfe habt ihr ihn ans Kreuz genagelt und getötet. 
[2:24] Gott aber hat ihn auferweckt und den Wehen des Todes ein Ende gemacht, weil er unmöglich in der Gewalt des Todes bleiben konnte. 
[2:25] Denn David sagt von ihm: Der Herr ist mir allzeit vor Augen, denn er steht mir zur Seite, damit ich nicht wanke. 
[2:26] Darum freut sich mein Herz, und meine Zunge jauchzt, ja auch mein Leib wird voller Hoffnung ruhen. 
[2:27] Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht im Totenreich lassen noch dulden, daß dein Heiliger verwese. 
[2:28] Du tust mir kund die Wege, die zum Leben führen; erfüllen wirst du mich mit der Freude vor deinem Angesicht. 
[2:29] Ihr Männer, liebe Brüder, laßt mich frei und offen zu euch reden: Der Erzvater David ist gestorben und begraben, und sein Grabmal steht noch heute in unserer Mitte. 
[2:30] Doch wie er ein Prophet war und auch wußte, daß Gott ihm eidlich zugeschworen hatte, es solle einer seiner Nachkommen auf seinem Thron sitzen, 
[2:31] darum hat er mit Seherblick von des Messias Auferstehung geredet. Denn der ist nicht im Totenreich geblieben, und sein Leib ist nicht verwest. 
[2:32] Diesen Jesus hat Gott auferweckt: dafür sind wir alle Zeugen. 
[2:33] Nachdem er dann durch Gottes rechte Hand erhöht worden ist, hat er den Heiligen Geist, der ihm verheißen war, vom Vater empfangen und ihn nun ausgegossen, wie ihr selbst seht und hört. 
[2:34] Denn David ist ja nicht zum Himmel aufgefahren; wohl aber spricht er: Der Herr hat gesagt zu meinem Herrn: Sitze du zu meiner Rechten, 
[2:35] bis ich dir deine Feinde zu Füßen lege. 
[2:36] Das ganze Haus Israel erkenne darum deutlich: Gott hat keinen anderen zum Herrn und Messias erwählt als eben diesen Jesus, den ihr gekreuzigt habt!" 
[2:37] Bei diesen Worten ging es den Hörern wie ein Stich durchs Herz, und sie sprachen zu Petrus und den anderen Aposteln: "Ihr Männer, liebe Brüder, was sollen wir denn tun?" 
[2:38] Petrus antwortete ihnen: "Ändert euern Sinn, und im Vertrauen auf den Namen Jesu Christi laßt euch alle taufen, damit euch eure Sünden vergeben werden: dann sollt ihr auch die Gabe des Heiligen Geistes empfangen. 
[2:39] Denn euch und euern Kindern gilt die Verheißung und allen, die noch fern stehen, soviel der Herr unser Gott von ihnen herzurufen wird." 
[2:40] Auch sonst noch griff er ihnen in seiner Rede mannigfach ins Herz, und er ermahnte sie: "Macht euch los von diesem verkehrten Geschlecht!" 
[2:41] Alle nun, die sein Wort gläubig aufnahmen, empfingen die Taufe, und an dem Tag wurden ungefähr dreitausend Seelen der Gemeinde zugeführt. 
[2:42] Sie hielten treulich fest an der Apostel Lehre und der brüderlichen Gemeinschaft, die bei dem Brotbrechen und den Gebetsversammlungen zutage trat. 
[2:43] Alle Leute (in Jerusalem) waren voller Furcht, denn viele Wunder und Zeichen geschahen durch die Apostel. 
[2:44] Die Gläubigen waren alle eng verbunden und lebten in Gütergemeinschaft: 
[2:45] solche, die Grundstücke oder andere Habe hatten, verkauften sie, und den Erlös verteilte man an alle, die bedürftig waren. 
[2:46] Sie besuchten auch täglich fleißig und einmütig den Tempel. — Außerdem versammelten sie sich in den Häusern: dort brachen sie das Brot und hielten ihr Mahl mit freudigem, lauterem Herzen. 
[2:47] Sie lobten Gott und waren bei dem ganzen Volk wohlgelitten. Der Herr führte auch täglich der Gemeinde neue Glieder zu, die dadurch zum Heil gelangten. 
[3:1] Eines Tages gingen Petrus und Johannes hinauf in den Tempel: sie wollten dort um die neunte Stunde am Gebet teilnehmen. 
[3:2] Gerade da trug man einen Mann herbei, der von Geburt an lahm war: den brachte man täglich an das sogenannte Schöne Tor des Tempels, damit er die Tempelbesucher um Almosen bitte. 
[3:3] Als der Mann sah, wie Petrus und Johannes in den Tempel gehen wollten, sprach er sie um eine Gabe an. 
[3:4] Petrus aber ließ sein Auge auf ihm ruhen, ebenso wie Johannes, und sprach zu ihm: "Sieh uns an!" 
[3:5] Da starrte er sie an in der Erwartung, etwas von ihnen zu bekommen. 
[3:6] Petrus aber sprach: "Silber und Gold habe ich nicht; doch was ich habe, das gebe ich dir; im Namen Jesu Christi von Nazaret — geh umher!" 
[3:7] Zugleich ergriff er ihn bei seiner rechten Hand und richtete ihn auf. Sofort wurden seine Füße und Knöchel fest; 
[3:8] mit einem Sprung stand er aufrecht da, begann umherzugehen und betrat mit ihnen den Tempel, fortwährend springend und Gott preisend. 
[3:9] Und alle Leute sahen, wie er umherging und Gott lobte. 
[3:10] Sie erkannten ihn auch wieder: es war ja jener Mann, der sonst als Bettler an dem Schönen Tor des Tempels gesessen hatte! Alle waren voller Staunen und Verwunderung über das, was ihm geschehen war. 
[3:11] Während der Mann nicht von Petrus und Johannes wich, sammelte sich das ganze Volk, sprachlos vor Erstaunen, in der sogenannten Halle Salomos um sie. 
[3:12] Als Petrus die Menge sah, nahm er das Wort und sprach: "Ihr Israeliten, was wundert ihr euch über diesen Mann? Oder warum staunt ihr uns an, als hätten wir mit eigener Kraft oder mit unserer Frömmigkeit erreicht, daß er nun gehen kann? 
[3:13] Der Gott Abrahams, der Gott Isaaks und der Gott Jakobs, unserer Väter Gott, hat seinen Knecht Jesus verherrlicht, den ihr preisgegeben und verleugnet habt vor Pilatus, als der entschlossen war, ihn freizulassen. 
[3:14] Ja ihr habt den Heiligen und Gerechten verleugnet und euch einen Mörder losgebeten. 
[3:15] Ihn aber, der zum Leben führt, habt ihr getötet. Den hat Gott von den Toten auferweckt: dafür sind wir Zeugen. 
[3:16] Auf Grund des Glaubens, den sein Name wirkt, hat er nun diesen Mann hier, den ihr seht und kennt, gesund gemacht. Ja der Glaube, der durch Jesus kommt, hat ihm vor euer aller Augen die volle Heilung geschenkt. 
[3:17] Nun, liebe Brüder, ich weiß, ihr habt in Unwissenheit gehandelt, ebenso wie eure Oberen. 
[3:18] Gott aber hat dadurch die Weissagung erfüllt, daß sein Gesalbter leiden müsse, was er durch aller Propheten Mund vorausverkündigt hat. 
[3:19] So ändert denn euern Sinn und bekehrt euch, damit eure Sünden ausgetilgt werden! 
[3:20] Dann können auch Erquickungszeiten kommen vom Angesicht des Herrn, und er kann euch den Messias senden, den er euch bestimmt hat: Jesus. 
[3:21] Den muß freilich der Himmel aufnehmen bis auf die Zeiten, da alles neugeordnet werden soll, wovon Gott durch seiner heiligen Propheten Mund von alters her geredet hat. 
[3:22] Schon Mose hat davon gesprochen in den Worten: Einen Propheten wie mich wird euch zum Heil der Herr, unser Gott, aus eurer Brüder Kreis auftreten lassen; auf den sollt ihr hören in allem, was er zu euch reden wird. 
[3:23] Wer aber nicht auf diesen Propheten hört, der soll unnachsichtig aus dem Volk vertilgt werden. 
[3:24] Auch alle anderen Propheten, Samuel und die folgenden — alle, die geredet haben — sie haben ebenfalls das Kommen jener Zeit verkündigt. 
[3:25] Euch gelten die Worte der Propheten und der Segen der Verordnung, die Gott getroffen hat mit euern Vätern, als er zu Abraham sprach: Durch deinen Nachkommen sollen alle Völker der Erde gesegnet werden. 
[3:26] Zuerst euch zum Heil hat Gott auftreten lassen seinen Knecht und ihn gesandt, um euch zu segnen, indem er einen jeden unter euch von seiner Ungerechtigkeit bekehrt." 
[4:1] Während sie noch zu dem Volk redeten, traten die Priester und der Tempelhauptmann an sie heran, dazu die Sadduzäer; 
[4:2] denn diese waren darüber entrüstet, daß sie das Volk belehrten und bei ihrer Predigt von Jesus die Auferstehung aus den Toten verkündigten. 
[4:3] Sie ließen deshalb die beiden Apostel verhaften und bis zum nächsten Tag gefangensetzen; denn es war mittlerweile Abend geworden. 
[4:4] Viele aber von denen, die die Predigt des Petrus gehört hatten, wurden gläubig, und die Zahl der erwachsenen Männer stieg nun auf fünftausend. 
[4:5] Tags darauf fand eine Sitzung des Hohen Rates in Jerusalem statt. Daran nahmen teil die Oberen, die Ältesten und die Schriftgelehrten, 
[4:6] der Hohepriester Hannas, Kaiphas, Johannes, Alexander und alle, die aus hohenpriesterlichem Geschlecht waren. 
[4:7] Petrus und Johannes wurden vorgeführt, und man fragte sie: "Durch welche Kraft oder in wessen Namen habt ihr diese Tat vollbracht?" 
[4:8] Da antwortete Petrus, erfüllt mit dem Heiligen Geist: "Ihr Oberen des Volkes und ihr Ältesten Israels! 
[4:9] Wenn wir heute vor Gericht gestellt werden, weil wir einem Kranken geholfen haben, und wenn man uns nun fragt, wie der Mann hier gesund geworden ist, 
[4:10] so sollt ihr alle und das ganze Volk Israel wissen: Durch den Namen Jesu Christi von Nazaret, den ihr gekreuzigt habt, und den Gott von den Toten auferweckt hat, — dadurch steht dieser Mann gesund vor euren Augen da! 
[4:11] Dieser Jesus ist der Stein, den ihr Bauleute verworfen habt, und der nun zum Eckstein geworden ist. 
[4:12] In keinem anderen ist das Heil zu finden; denn wahrlich, keinen zweiten Namen gibt's unter dem Himmel für die Menschen, wodurch wir das Heil erlangen sollen." 
[4:13] Als sie wahrnahmen, wie unerschrocken Petrus und Johannes redeten, und außerdem entdeckten, daß sie Männer ohne schriftgelehrte Bildung und aus geringem Stand waren, da wunderten sie sich. Nun erkannten sie die beiden auch als Jünger Jesu wieder. 
[4:14] Zugleich sahen sie den Geheilten bei ihnen stehen. So wußten sie nichts zu erwidern. 
[4:15] Sie ließen daher die beiden aus dem Sitzungssaal führen und berieten miteinander. 
[4:16] "Was sollen wir mit diesen Menschen machen?" so fragten sie. "Denn daß sie ein auffälliges Wunderzeichen vollbracht haben, ist offenkundig für alle Bewohner Jerusalems, und wir können es nicht leugnen. 
[4:17] Damit nun aber die Sache nicht noch mehr unter das Volk komme, so wollen wir ihnen streng verbieten, in Zukunft über diesen Namen irgendwie zu reden." 
[4:18] Darauf ließen sie die Apostel wieder hereinrufen und geboten ihnen, durchaus nicht mehr in Jesu Namen zu reden und zu lehren. 
[4:19] Doch Petrus und Johannes antworteten ihnen: "Ob es recht ist vor Gott, daß wir euch mehr gehorchen als Gott, das sagt euch selbst! 
[4:20] Wir können ja unmöglich schweigen über das, was wir gesehen und gehört haben." 
[4:21] Trotzdem entließ sie der Hohe Rat: er wiederholte nur sein Verbot und verschärfte es durch Drohungen. Denn er fand keine Möglichkeit, sie zu bestrafen. Davor scheute er sich mit Rücksicht auf das Volk. Denn alle priesen Gott des Wunders wegen, 
[4:22] zumal der Mensch, an dem dies Heilungswunder geschehen war, schon über vierzig Jahre zählte. 
[4:23] Nach ihrer Freilassung gingen Petrus und Johannes zu den anderen Aposteln und teilten ihnen mit, was ihnen die Hohenpriester und die Ältesten gesagt hatten. 
[4:24] Als sie das hörten, erhoben sie einmütig ihre Stimme zu Gott und sprachen: "Herr, du hast den Himmel, die Erde und das Meer mit allem, was darinnen ist, geschaffen; 
[4:25] du hast durch den Heiligen Geist durch den Mund unseres Vaters David, deines Knechtes, gesprochen: Warum haben die Heiden vor Zorn geschnaubt und die Völker nichtige Pläne ersonnen? 
[4:26] Die Könige der Erde sind herangezogen, und die Herrscher haben sich zusammengerottet gegen den Herrn und gegen den Gesalbten. 
[4:27] Ja wahrlich, zusammengerottet haben sich in dieser Stadt Herodes und Pontius Pilatus im Bunde mit den Heiden und den Stämmen Israels gegen deinen heiligen Knecht Jesus, den du gesalbt, 
[4:28] damit sie ausführten, was dein mächtiger Wille schon vorher bestimmt hatte. 
[4:29] Nun, Herr, mache ihr Drohen zuschanden und hilf deinen Knechten, dein Wort mit allem Freimut zu verkündigen! 
[4:30] Laß dabei deine Macht wirksam sein, daß Heilungen, Zeichen und Wunder geschehen durch den Namen deines heiligen Knechtes Jesus!" 
[4:31] Nach diesem Gebet erzitterte die Stätte, wo sie versammelt waren, und sie wurden alle mit dem Heiligen Geist erfüllt und verkündigten mit freudigem Vertrauen Gottes Wort. 
[4:32] Die ganze Schar der Gläubigen aber war ein Herz und eine Seele. Niemand nahm von seiner Habe etwas als sein ausschließliches Eigentum in Anspruch; sondern alles, was sie hatten, war Allgemeinbesitz. 
[4:33] Und mit großer Kraft legten die Apostel Zeugnis ab von der Auferstehung des Herrn Jesus. Auch bei dem Volk stand die ganze Gemeinde in hoher Gunst. 
[4:34] Denn keines ihrer Glieder brauchte Not zu leiden. Alle nämlich, die Grundstücke und Häuser hatten, pflegten diese zu verkaufen. Dann brachten sie den Erlös aus dem Verkauf 
[4:35] und legten ihn zu den Füßen der Apostel nieder. Aus diesen Mitteln erhielt jeder, was er nötig hatte. 
[4:36] Josef zum Beispiel, den die Apostel Barnabas nannten — das heißt: Tröster und Ermahner —, ein Levit, der aus Zypern stammte, 
[4:37] verkaufte ein Stück Land, das er besaß, brachte das Geld und legte es zu der Apostel Füßen nieder. 
[5:1] Auch ein Mann, mit Namen Ananias, verkaufte im Einverständnis mit seiner Frau Saphira ein Grundstück. 
[5:2] Aber mit Wissen seiner Frau unterschlug er etwas von dem Kaufpreis und brachte nur einen Teil davon und legte ihn zu der Apostel Füßen nieder. 
[5:3] Doch Petrus sprach: "Ananias, warum hat der Satan dein Herz erfüllt, so daß du den Heiligen Geist belogen und einen Teil von dem Erlös deines Feldes zurückbehalten hast? 
[5:4] Konntest du das Land nicht als dein Eigentum behalten? Und als du es verkauft hattest, konntest du da nicht auch noch über den Erlös nach deinem Willen verfügen? Warum hast du dir denn eine solche Tat in deinem Herzen vorgenommen? Du hast nicht Menschen, sondern Gott belogen." 
[5:5] Beim Hören dieser Worte fiel Ananias tot zu Boden. Und großer Schrecken kam über alle Anwesenden. 
[5:6] Die jüngeren Gemeindeglieder aber erhoben sich, umwickelten den Leichnam mit leinenen Tüchern und trugen ihn hinaus zum Begräbnis. 
[5:7] Nach ungefähr drei Stunden kam des Ananias Frau in die Versammlung, ohne daß sie wußte, was vorgefallen war. 
[5:8] Petrus richtete sogleich das Wort an sie. "Sage mir", so fragte er, "ist dies der Kaufpreis eures Landes?" "Ja", versetzte sie, "das ist der Kaufpreis." 
[5:9] "Warum", so fuhr nun Petrus fort, "seid ihr denn beide eins geworden, den Geist des Herrn herauszufordern? Die deinen Mann begraben haben, die kommen jetzt gerade zurück, um auch dich hinauszutragen." 
[5:10] Sofort fiel sie zu seinen Füßen nieder und gab den Geist auf. Die Jünglinge fanden sie bei ihrem Eintritt tot und trugen sie hinaus, um sie bei ihrem Mann zu begraben. 
[5:11] Dieser Vorfall erfüllte die ganze Gemeinde und alle, die davon hörten, mit großem Schrecken. 
[5:12] Im Volk geschahen damals viele Zeichen und Wunder durch die Hände der Apostel. Alle Gläubigen pflegten sich einmütig in der Halle Salomos zu versammeln. 
[5:13] Von den feindseligen Juden aber wagte keiner, sie zu beunruhigen. Die große Menge jedoch hielt hoch von ihnen. 
[5:14] Und immer mehr schlossen sich ihnen an, die an den Herrn gläubig wurden, ganze Scharen von Männern und Frauen. 
[5:15] Ja, es kam so weit, daß man die Kranken auf die Straße trug und sie dort auf Betten und Tragbahren niedersetzte, damit, wenn Petrus vorüberkäme, wenigstens sein Schatten auf den einen oder anderen fiele. 
[5:16] Sogar aus den Städten rings um Jerusalem kamen die Leute in Scharen herbei: sie brachten Kranke und solche, die von unreinen Geistern gequält wurden. Und alle diese Leidenden wurden gesund. 
[5:17] Das brachte den Hohenpriester auf. Er und sein ganzer Anhang — die Partei der Sadduzäer — ließen neiderfüllt 
[5:18] die Apostel festnehmen und in das öffentliche Gefängnis werfen. 
[5:19] Ein Engel des Herrn aber öffnete nachts die Kerkertüren, führte sie hinaus und sprach zu ihnen: 
[5:20] "Geht in den Tempel und verkündigt dort dem Volk öffentlich alle Worte dieser Lebensbotschaft!" 
[5:21] Diesem Befehl gehorsam gingen sie gegen Morgen in den Tempel und lehrten dort. Mittlerweile versammelten sich der Hohepriester und sein Anhang. Sie beriefen den Hohen Rat und alle Ältesten der Kinder Israels und sandten ins Gefängnis, um die Apostel vorzuführen. 
[5:22] Als aber die Diener hinkamen, fanden sie sie nicht im Gefängnis. Da kehrten sie zurück und meldeten: 
[5:23] "Das Gefängnis fanden wir sorgfältig und fest verschlossen und die Wachen vor den Türen stehen; doch als wir öffneten, fanden wir niemand darin." 
[5:24] Als der Tempelhauptmann und die Hohenpriester diese Worte hörten, waren sie ganz bestürzt und fragten sich, was daraus werden solle. 
[5:25] Da kam einer mit der Meldung: "Die Männer, die ihr habt gefangensetzen lassen, die stehen schon wieder im Tempel und lehren das Volk!" 
[5:26] Nun ging der Hauptmann mit der Mannschaft hin und führte sie herbei, doch ohne Anwendung von Gewalt; denn sie fürchteten, das Volk könne sie sonst steinigen. 
[5:27] So brachten sie sie her und führten sie in den Sitzungssaal. Hier nahm sie der Hohepriester ins Verhör. 
[5:28] "Haben wir euch", so sprach er, "nicht aufs allerstrengste verboten, in jenem Namen zu lehren? Und doch habt ihr Jerusalem mit eurer Lehre erfüllt; ja ihr wollt dieses Menschen Blut über uns bringen." 
[5:29] Petrus aber und die anderen Apostel antworteten: "Man muß Gott mehr gehorchen als den Menschen. 
[5:30] Der Gott unserer Väter hat Jesus auferweckt, den ihr ans Kreuzesholz gehängt und hingemordet habt. 
[5:31] Den hat Gott durch seine rechte Hand zur Würde eines Herrschers und Befreiers erhoben, um Israel Sinnesänderung und Sündenvergebung zu schenken. 
[5:32] Dafür sind wir Zeugen und der Heilige Geist, den Gott allen gegeben hat, die ihm gehorchen." 
[5:33] Bei dieser Antwort wurden sie mit Wut erfüllt, und sie dachten schon daran, die Apostel zu töten. 
[5:34] Da erhob sich in der Versammlung ein Pharisäer, mit Namen Gamaliel, ein von dem ganzen Volk verehrter Gesetzeslehrer, und befahl, die Apostel für eine Weile hinauszuführen. 
[5:35] Dann sprach er zu den Männern des Hohen Rates: "Ihr Israeliten, überlegt euch wohl, wie ihr mit diesen Leuten verfahren wollt! 
[5:36] Einst hat sich Theudas erhoben. Der wollte eine Rolle spielen, und an vierhundert Männer sind ihm auch gefolgt. Aber er fand den Tod, und alle seine Anhänger wurden auseinandergetrieben und vernichtet. 
[5:37] Nach ihm trat zur Zeit der bekannten Schätzung der Galiläer Judas auf und zog viele Leute an sich. Auch der ist umgekommen, und alle seine Anhänger haben sich zerstreut. 
[5:38] Nun rate ich euch: Laßt diese Leute in Ruhe und bekümmert euch nicht um sie! Denn stammt dies Beginnen oder dieses Werk von Menschen, so geht es von selbst zugrunde. 
[5:39] Ist's aber wirklich aus Gott, so könnt ihr diese Leute nicht zum Schweigen bringen. Ja, ihr kommt noch in Gefahr, gegen Gott zu kämpfen." 
[5:40] Diesem Rat folgten sie. Sie riefen die Apostel wieder herein, ließen sie geißeln und verboten ihnen, im Namen Jesu zu reden. Dann durften die Apostel gehen. 
[5:41] Sie verließen aber den Hohen Rat voller Freude, weil sie gewürdigt worden waren, um des Namens willen Schmach zu leiden. 
[5:42] Im Tempel sowohl wie in häuslichen Versammlungen lehrten sie unaufhörlich Tag für Tag und verkündigten die Frohe Botschaft, daß Jesus der Messias sei. 
[6:1] Um diese Zeit, als die Zahl der Jünger wuchs, beschwerten sich die griechisch redenden Gemeindemitglieder bei den aramäisch sprechenden darüber, daß ihre Witwen bei der täglichen Speiseausteilung übersehen würden. 
[6:2] Da beriefen die Zwölf die ganze Schar der Jünger und sprachen: "Es ist nicht recht, daß wir die Verkündigung des Wortes Gottes unterlassen, um bei Tische aufzuwarten. 
[6:3] So wählt denn, liebe Brüder, aus eurer Mitte sieben Männer von gutem Ruf, die voll Geist und Weisheit sind, damit wir sie für diese Dienstleistung bestellen! 
[6:4] Wir selbst aber wollen uns nach wie vor dem Gebet und dem Dienst des Wortes widmen." 
[6:5] Dieser Vorschlag fand allgemeinen Beifall, und die Gemeinde wählte: Stephanus, einen Mann voll Glaubens und Heiligen Geistes, ferner Philippus, Prochorus, Nikanor, Timon, Parmenas und Nikolaus, einen zum Judentum übergetretenen Heiden aus Antiochia. 
[6:6] Diese Männer stellte man vor die Apostel, die ihnen mit Gebet die Hände auflegten. 
[6:7] Das Wort Gottes verbreitete sich nun immer weiter, und die Zahl der Jünger nahm in Jerusalem bedeutend zu; ja auch eine große Schar von jüdischen Priestern wurde dem Glauben gehorsam. 
[6:8] Stephanus aber, voll Gnade und Kraft, tat Wunder und große Zeichen unter dem Volk. 
[6:9] Doch einige aus der sogenannten (jüdischen) 'Gemeinde der Freigelassenen' im Bunde mit Juden aus Kyrene, Alexandria, Zilizien und Asien traten auf und führten Streitgespräche mit Stephanus. 
[6:10] Gegen seine Weisheit aber und den Geist, durch den er redete, vermochten sie nichts auszurichten. 
[6:11] Da stifteten sie Leute an, die sagten: "Wir haben ihn Lästerworte reden hören gegen Mose und gegen Gott." 
[6:12] So brachten sie das Volk samt den Ältesten und den Schriftgelehrten in Aufregung. Dann überfielen sie ihn unversehens, schleppten ihn mit Gewalt weg und führten ihn vor den Hohen Rat. 
[6:13] Dort ließen sie falsche Zeugen auftreten, die aussagten: "Dieser Mensch redet unaufhörlich gegen diese heilige Stätte und das Gesetz. 
[6:14] Denn wir haben ihn behaupten hören: 'Jesus von Nazaret, der wird diese Stätte zerstören und die Gebräuche ändern, die uns Mose überliefert hat.'" 
[6:15] Alle aber, die im Hohen Rat saßen, blickten ihn gespannt an, und sie sahen, wie sein Antlitz einem Engelsangesicht glich. 
[7:1] Da fragte ihn der Hohepriester: "Ist dem so?" 
[7:2] Er antwortete: "Liebe Brüder und Väter, hört! Der Gott der Herrlichkeit ist unserem Vater Abraham in Mesopotamien erschienen, noch ehe er in Haran wohnte, 
[7:3] und sprach zu ihm: 'Verlaß dein Vaterland und deine Verwandten und ziehe in das Land, das ich dir zeigen will!' 
[7:4] Darauf verließ er das Chaldäerland und nahm in Haran Wohnung. Von dort ließ ihn Gott nach seines Vaters Tod wandern in dies Land, wo ihr jetzt wohnt. 
[7:5] Doch gab er ihm darin nicht einen Fußbreit Erbteil. Aber er verhieß es ihm und seinen Nachkommen zum Besitz, obwohl Abraham noch keine Kinder hatte. 
[7:6] Und zwar sprach Gott: 'Seine Nachkommen werden in einem fremden Land heimatlos sein, und man wird sie vierhundert Jahre knechten und plagen. 
[7:7] Aber das Volk, dem sie dienen werden, will ich strafen', sprach Gott; 'dann sollen sie ausziehen und mir an dieser Stätte dienen'. 
[7:8] Darauf schloß Gott mit Abraham einen Bund, dessen Zeichen die Beschneidung war. So wurde Abraham der Vater Isaaks, den er am achten Tag beschnitt; Isaaks Sohn war Jakob, und Jakobs Söhne waren die zwölf Erzväter. 
[7:9] Die Erzväter aber verkauften Josef aus Neid nach Ägypten. Doch Gott war mit ihm: 
[7:10] er errettete ihn aus allen seinen Trübsalen, verlieh ihm Weisheit und ließ ihn Gunst finden vor Pharao, dem König von Ägypten. Der setzte ihn als Gebieter über Ägypten und über sein ganzes Haus. 
[7:11] Da kam eine Hungersnot über ganz Ägyptenland und Kanaan; und das Elend war groß, daß unsere Väter keine Nahrung finden konnten. 
[7:12] Als nun Jakob hörte, in Ägypten sei Getreide zu haben, sandte er unsere Väter dorthin: das war ihre erste Reise. 
[7:13] Bei ihrer zweiten Reise aber gab sich Josef seinen Brüdern zu erkennen: so erfuhr Pharao Josefs Herkunft. 
[7:14] Dann ließ Josef seinen Vater Jakob und alle seine Blutsverwandten holen, im ganzen fünfundsiebzig Seelen. 
[7:15] So zog Jakob nach Ägypten. Dort starben er und unsere Väter. 
[7:16] Man brachte sie nach Sichem und bestattete sie in dem Grab, das Abraham um Geld von den Söhnen Hemors in Sichem gekauft hatte. 
[7:17] Als aber die Zeit herankam, wo sich die Verheißung erfüllen sollte, die Gott dem Abraham gegeben hatte, da mehrte sich das Volk in Ägypten und ward sehr zahlreich. 
[7:18] Das dauerte so lange, bis sich ein fremder König, der Josef nicht gekannt hatte, zum Herrscher über Ägypten erhob. 
[7:19] Der war voll Arglist gegen unser Volk und bedrückte unsere Väter so entsetzlich, daß er sie zwang, ihre neugeborenen Kinder auszusetzen, damit sie nicht am Leben blieben. 
[7:20] In der Zeit wurde Mose geboren: ein wunderbar schönes Kind. Der ward drei Monate lang in seines Vaters Haus aufgezogen. 
[7:21] Dann setzte man ihn aus. Aber Pharaos Tochter nahm ihn an Kindes Statt an und erzog ihn wie ihren eigenen Sohn. 
[7:22] So wurde Mose in aller Weisheit der Ägypter unterrichtet, und durch seine Rede und seine Taten war er ein einflußreicher Mann. 
[7:23] Als er vierzig Jahre alt war, kam es ihm in den Sinn, sich nach seinen Brüdern, den Kindern Israel, umzusehen. 
[7:24] Da war er Zeuge, wie einer von ihnen ungerecht behandelt wurde. Für den trat er ein und rächte seine Mißhandlung, indem er den Ägypter erschlug. 
[7:25] Er glaubte aber, seine Brüder würden erkennen, daß ihnen Gott durch seine Hand Befreiung bringen wolle. Doch sie erkannten es nicht. 
[7:26] Am folgenden Tag sah er, wie sich zwei von ihnen stritten. Da wollte er Frieden zwischen ihnen stiften und sprach: 'Ihr seid doch Stammesbrüder; warum tut ihr denn einander unrecht?' 
[7:27] Aber der Mann, der seinen Nächsten schlug, wies ihn zurück und sagte: 'Wer hat dich zum Oberhaupt und Richter über uns gesetzt? 
[7:28] Möchtest du mich auch töten, wie du gestern den Ägypter getötet hast?' 
[7:29] Das Wort erschreckte Mose, und er flüchtete. Er lebte als Fremdling in dem Lande Midian, wo er zwei Söhne bekam. 
[7:30] Nach vierzig Jahren aber erschien ihm in der Wüste des Berges Sinai ein Engel in einer Feuerflamme in einem Dornbusch. 
[7:31] Als Mose das sah, wunderte er sich über die Erscheinung. Wie er nun hinzutrat, um sie näher zu betrachten, da rief die Stimme des Herrn: 
[7:32] 'Ich bin der Gott deiner Väter, der Gott Abrahams, Isaaks und Jakobs.' Darüber war Mose so erschrocken, daß er nicht wagte, weiter hinzusehen. 
[7:33] Da sprach der Herr zu ihm: 'Ziehe deine Schuhe von deinen Füßen! Denn die Stätte, worauf du stehst, ist heiliges Land. 
[7:34] Ich habe das Elend deines Volkes in Ägypten gesehen und habe ihr Seufzen gehört; darum bin ich herabgekommen, um sie zu befreien. Komm nun her, ich will dich nach Ägypten senden!' 
[7:35] Diesen Mose, den sie verleugnet hatten mit den Worten: 'Wer hat dich zum Oberhaupt und Richter eingesetzt?' — den hat Gott als Führer und Befreier gesandt, und der Engel, der ihm in dem Dornbusch erschienen war, begleitete ihn mit seiner Hilfe. 
[7:36] Dieser Mose hat sie weggeführt und dabei Wunder und Zeichen getan in Ägypten und am Roten Meer, dann weiter vierzig Jahre in der Wüste. 
[7:37] Dieser Mose hat den Kindern Israel gesagt: 'Einen Propheten wie mich wird Gott euch zum Heil aus eurer Brüder Kreis auftreten lassen.' 
[7:38] Dieser Mose ist es, der bei der Volksversammlung in der Wüste mit dem Engel, der am Berg Sinai zu ihm geredet hatte, und mit unseren Vätern verkehrt hat. Er empfing Lebensworte, um sie uns mitzuteilen. 
[7:39] Unsere Väter aber wollten ihm nicht gehorchen, sondern stießen ihn von sich und wandten sich mit ihrem Herzen nach Ägypten. 
[7:40] Denn sie sprachen zu Aaron: 'Mache uns Götter, damit sie vor uns hergehen! Wir wissen ja nicht, was diesem Mose widerfahren ist, der uns aus Ägyptenland geführt hat.' 
[7:41] Sie machten damals einen Stier, brachten diesem Götzenbild Opfer dar und erfreuten sich an den Werken ihrer Hände. 
[7:42] Da wandte sich Gott ab von ihnen und gab sie preis, dem Himmelsheer zu dienen, wie in dem Buch der Propheten geschrieben steht: Habt ihr mir denn Schlachtopfer und Speisopfer dargebracht dort in der Wüste vierzig Jahre lang, ihr vom Haus Israel? 
[7:43] Nein, ihr habt vielmehr das Zelt des Molochs mitgeführt und das Sternbild eures Gottes Rephan — die Götzenbilder, die ihr selbst gemacht habt, um sie zu verehren. Zur Strafe dafür will ich euch wegführen lassen, noch über Babylon hinaus! 
[7:44] Unsere Väter hatten in der Wüste das Zelt des Zeugnisses. Das war erbaut nach dem Befehl dessen, der Mose geboten hatte, es nach dem Bild herzustellen, das er gesehen. 
[7:45] Dieses Zelt ging dann über auf das folgende Geschlecht, und unter Josua führten es unsere Väter mit hinein (nach Kanaan), als sie das Land der Heiden in Besitz nahmen, die Gott vor ihnen vertrieb. So blieb es mit dem Zelt bis zu den Tagen Davids. 
[7:46] Der fand Gnade vor Gott, und darum bat er ihn, dem Gott Jakobs eine Wohnstatt errichten zu dürfen. 
[7:47] Aber erst Salomo erbaute ihm ein Haus. 
[7:48] Doch der Höchste wohnt nicht in Gebäuden von Menschenhand, wie der Prophet spricht: 
[7:49] Der Himmel ist mein Thron, und die Erde ist der Schemel meiner Füße. Was für ein Haus wollt ihr mir da bauen, spricht der Herr, oder an welcher Stätte soll ich ruhen? 
[7:50] Hat meine Hand nicht alles dies geschaffen? 
[7:51] Ihr Halsstarrigen, die ihr an Herz und Ohren unbeschnitten seid! Ebenso wie eure Väter widersteht auch ihr fort und fort dem Heiligen Geist. 
[7:52] Wen von den Propheten haben eure Väter nicht verfolgt! Hingemordet haben sie alle, die das Kommen des Gerechten vorausverkündigt haben. Seine Verräter und Mörder seid ihr jetzt geworden! 
[7:53] Ihr habt das Gesetzt, weil es durch Engel verordnet wurde, angenommen; aber ihr habt es nicht gehalten...!" 
[7:54] Als sie dies hörten, wurden sie in ihrem Herzen mit Wut erfüllt, und sie knirschten mit den Zähnen gegen ihn. 
[7:55] Er aber blickte voll Heiligen Geistes zum Himmel auf und sah Gottes Herrlichkeit und Jesus zur Rechten Gottes stehen. Da rief er: "Ich sehe jetzt den Himmel offen und den Menschensohn zur Rechten Gottes stehen!" 
[7:56] Sie aber schrien laut auf, hielten sich die Ohren zu, stürmten wie ein Mann auf ihn los, schleiften ihn zur Stadt hinaus und steinigten ihn. 
[7:57] Die Zeugen legten ihre Oberkleider ab und gaben sie einem Jüngling, mit Namen Saulus, in Verwahrung. 
[7:58] 
[7:59] 
[7:60] 
[8:1] Saulus billigte die Ermordung des Stephanus. An jenem Tag brach eine große Verfolgung los gegen die Gemeinde in Jerusalem; und alle, mit Ausnahme der Apostel, zerstreuten sich über ganz Judäa und Samaria. 
[8:2] Einige fromme Heiden, die zum Judentum übergetreten waren, bestatteten Stephanus und hielten ihm zu Ehren eine große Totenklage. 
[8:3] Saulus aber wütete gegen die Gemeinde: er drang in die Häuser ein, schleppte Männer und Weiber weg und ließ sie ins Gefängnis werfen. 
[8:4] Die Zerstreuten zogen im Land umher und verkündigten das Wort. 
[8:5] So kam Philippus in die Stadt Samaria und predigte dort von Christus. 
[8:6] Die Bewohner zeigten einmütig Teilnahme für die Worte des Philippus, als sie ihm zuhörten und die Wunderzeichen sah, die er tat. 
[8:7] Denn mit lautem Geschrei fuhren unreine Geister von vielen Besessenen aus, auch zahlreiche Gelähmte und Krüppel wurden gesund. 
[8:8] Darüber herrschte große Freude in jener Stadt. 
[8:9] Nun hatte schon länger ein Mann, mit Namen Simon, in der Stadt Zauberei getrieben und die Einwohner Samarias in Staunen versetzt; denn er gab sich für etwas Großes aus. 
[8:10] Alle, klein und groß, hielten ihn hoch und sprachen: "Der Mann ist Gottes Kraft, ja die Kraft, die man die große nennt." 
[8:11] Sein Einfluß auf die Leute war deshalb so groß, weil er sie lange Zeit mit seinen Zauberkünsten betört hatte. 
[8:12] Als nun Philippus die Frohe Botschaft von Gottes Königreich und dem Namen Jesu Christi verkündigte, wurden die Leute gläubig, und Männer und Weiber ließen sich taufen. 
[8:13] Auch Simon ward gläubig und empfing die Taufe. Von da an war er ein steter Begleiter des Philippus, und als er die Zeichen und großen Wunder sah, die da geschahen, war er vor Staunen außer sich. 
[8:14] Als die Apostel in Jerusalem erfuhren, Samaria habe das Wort Gottes angenommen, da sandten sie Petrus und Johannes dorthin. 
[8:15] Diese kamen und beteten für die Gläubigen, daß sie den Heiligen Geist empfingen. 
[8:16] Denn er war noch auf keinen einzigen von ihnen gefallen, sondern sie waren nur in den Namen des Herrn Jesus getauft. 
[8:17] Da legten ihnen die beiden Apostel die Hände auf, und sie empfingen den Heiligen Geist. 
[8:18] Als Simon sah, daß durch die Handauflegung der Apostel der Heilige Geist gegeben wurde, bot er ihnen Geld an 
[8:19] und sprach: "Gebt mir auch diese Macht, daß jeder, dem ich die Hände auflege, den Heiligen Geist empfange!" 
[8:20] Petrus antwortete ihm: "Dein Geld fahre mit dir ins Verderben, weil du gemeint hast, Gottes Gabe lasse sich mit Geld erkaufen! 
[8:21] Du hast daran nicht Teil noch Erbe. Denn dein Herz ist nicht aufrichtig vor Gott. 
[8:22] Bekehre dich nun von dieser deiner Bosheit und bete zum Herrn: vielleicht findest du Vergebung für das, was du in deinem Herzen vorhast. 
[8:23] Denn ich sehe, du bist voll Gift und Galle und von den Ketten der Ungerechtigkeit gebunden." 
[8:24] Da antwortete Simon: "Betet ihr für mich zum Herrn, daß nichts von dem mich treffe, was ihr geredet habt!" 
[8:25] Als die beiden Apostel ein feierliches Zeugnis abgelegt und das Wort des Herrn verkündigt hatten, kehrten sie nach Jerusalem zurück und predigten (auf dem Weg dahin) in vielen samaritischen Orten die Frohe Botschaft. 
[8:26] Unterdes sprach ein Engel des Herrn zu Philippus: "Mache dich auf und gehe um die Mittagszeit auf die Straße, die von Jerusalem nach Gaza hinabführt!" — Der Weg ist einsam. — 
[8:27] Philippus machte sich auf und ging hin. Nun hatte gerade ein Mann aus Äthiopien, der als Großschatzmeister ein hoher Würdenträger der äthiopischen Königin Kandaze war, Jerusalem besucht, um dort anzubeten. 
[8:28] Der war jetzt auf dem Heimweg: er saß in seinem Wagen und las den Propheten Jesaja. 
[8:29] Da sprach der Geist zu Philippus: "Geh hin und mache dich heran an diesen Wagen!" 
[8:30] Als Philippus hin eilte, hörte er, wie der Äthiopier den Propheten Jesaja las. Da fragte er ihn: "Verstehst du denn auch, was du liest?" 
[8:31] Er antwortete: "Wie sollte ich das können, ohne daß es mir einer erklärt?" Dann lud er Philippus ein, sich zu ihm in den Wagen zu setzen. 
[8:32] Er las aber gerade den Schriftabschnitt: Man hat ihn wie ein Schaf zur Schlachtbank hingeführt; und wie ein Lamm vor seinem Scherer stumm ist, so hat er seinen Mund nicht aufgetan. 
[8:33] In seiner Niedrigkeit ward ihm gerechter Urteilsspruch versagt. Wer kann seine Zeitgenossen (in ihrer Bosheit) schildern? Denn man hat sein Leben von der Erde ausgerottet. 
[8:34] Der Schatzmeister fragte Philippus: "Ich bitte dich, sage mir, von wem redet der Prophet diese Worte: von sich selbst oder von einem anderen?" 
[8:35] Da tat Philippus seinen Mund auf und, ausgehend von dieser Schriftstelle, verkündigte er ihm die Frohe Botschaft von Jesus. 
[8:36] Als sie die Straße weiterfuhren, kamen sie zu einem Wasser. Da sagte der Schatzmeister: "Hier ist ja Wasser, was steht meiner Taufe im Weg?" 
[8:37]  
[8:38] Er ließ nun den Wagen halten, und beide, Philippus und der Schatzmeister, stiegen hinein in das Wasser, und Philippus taufte ihn. 
[8:39] Als sie wieder aus dem Wasser gestiegen waren, entrückte des Herrn Geist den Philippus. Der Schatzmeister sah ihn nicht mehr. Doch freudig zog er seines Weges weiter. 
[8:40] Philippus aber trat in Asdod auf. Von dort zog er von Stadt zu Stadt und verkündigte überall die Frohe Botschaft. So kam er nach Cäsarea. 
[9:1] Inzwischen schnaubte Saulus noch immer Drohung und Mord gegen die Jünger des Herrn. Er ging zu dem Hohenpriester 
[9:2] und bat ihn um Vollmachtsbriefe an die jüdischen Gemeinden in Damaskus, damit er die Anhänger Jesu, die er dort etwa fände, Männer und Weiber, in Ketten nach Jerusalem führen könne. Anf. 35 n.Chr. 
[9:3] Als er auf seiner Reise in die Nähe von Damaskus kam, umleuchtete ihn plötzlich vom Himmel her ein Lichtglanz. 
[9:4] Er fiel zu Boden und hörte eine Stimme, die sprach zu ihm: "Saul, Saul, warum verfolgst du mich?" 
[9:5] Er fragte: "Wer bist du, Herr?" Der antwortete: "Ich bin Jesus, den du verfolgst. 
[9:6] Nun steh auf und geh in die Stadt! Dort wird man dir sagen, was du tun sollst." 
[9:7] Die Männer, die mit ihm reisten, standen sprachlos da; denn sie hörten wohl die Stimme, sahen aber niemand. 
[9:8] Als sich Saulus vom Erdboden erhob und seine Augen wieder öffnete, konnte er nichts sehen. Da mußte man ihn bei der Hand nehmen und nach Damaskus führen. 
[9:9] Er blieb drei Tage blind und nahm weder Speise noch Trank zu sich. 
[9:10] Nun wohnte in Damaskus ein Jünger mit Namen Ananias. Zu dem sprach der Herr in einem Gesichte: "Ananias!" Er antwortete: "Hier bin ich, Herr!" 
[9:11] Der Herr fuhr fort: "Steh auf, geh in die sogenannte 'Gerade Straße' und frage dort in dem Haus des Judas nach einem Mann aus Tarsus, mit dem Namen Saulus! Der betet jetzt 
[9:12] und hat in einem Gesicht gesehen, wie ein Mann, mit Namen Ananias, bei ihm eintrat und ihm die Hände auflegte, damit er wieder sehend werde." 
[9:13] Ananias antwortete: "Herr, ich habe manche erzählen hören, wieviel Böses dieser Mann deinen Heiligen in Jerusalem zugefügt hat. 
[9:14] Und hier hat er Vollmacht von den Hohenpriestern, alle, die deinen Namen anrufen, in Fesseln zu schlagen." 
[9:15] Der Herr aber sprach zu ihm: "Geh hin! Denn dieser Mann ist ein Werkzeug, das ich mir erkoren habe, um meinen Namen zu den Heiden, zu Königen und zu den Kindern Israel zu bringen. 
[9:16] Denn ich selbst will ihm kundtun, wieviel er um meines Namens willen leiden muß." 
[9:17] Da ging Ananias hin. Er kam in das Haus, legte Saulus die Hände auf und sprach: "Bruder Saul, der Herr — Jesus, der dir auf deiner Wanderung erschienen ist — hat mich gesandt, damit du dein Augenlicht wiedererlangst und mit dem Heiligen Geist erfüllt werdest." 
[9:18] Sofort fiel es von seinen Augen ab wie Schuppen, und er konnte wieder sehen. Dann stand er auf und ließ sich taufen. 
[9:19] Er nahm auch Nahrung zu sich und erlangte seine Kräfte wieder. Als er einige Tage mit den Jüngern in Damaskus verkehrt hatte, 
[9:20] begann er sofort in den jüdischen Versammlungshäusern aufzutreten und zu verkündigen, daß Jesus der Sohn Gottes sei. 
[9:21] Alle Hörer waren außer sich vor Staunen und sprachen: "Ist das nicht der Mann, der in Jerusalem alle, die diesen Namen anrufen, zu vernichten suchte und der auch hierhergekommen ist in der Absicht, sie in Ketten zu den Hohenpriestern zu führen?" 
[9:22] Saulus aber erstarkte immer mehr (im Glauben) und brachte die Juden, die in Damaskus wohnten, außer Fassung, indem er nachwies, daß Jesus der Messias sei. 
[9:23] Nach geraumer Zeit beratschlagten die Juden, ihn zu töten. 
[9:24] Ihr Anschlag wurde Saulus kund. Da sie nun Tag und Nacht an den Toren Wache hielten, um ihn zu ermorden, nahmen ihn seine Schüler eines Nachts 
[9:25] und ließen ihn in einem Korb durch eine Öffnung der Stadtmauer hinunter. 
[9:26] So kam er nach Jerusalem. Dort versuchte er sich den Jüngern anzuschließen. Aber alle fürchteten sich vor ihm und wollten nicht glauben, daß er wirklich ein Jünger sei. 
[9:27] Da nahm sich Barnabas sein an: er führte ihn zu den Aposteln und erzählte ihnen, wie er auf seiner Reise den Herrn gesehen, daß dieser mit ihm geredet, und wie er in Damaskus in Jesu Namen freimütig gelehrt habe. 
[9:28] Seitdem stand er mit den Jüngern in Jerusalem in innigem Verkehr und trat im Namen des Herrn furchtlos auf. 
[9:29] Auch führte er Streitgespräche mit den griechisch redenden Juden. Die aber suchten ihn aus dem Weg zu räumen. 
[9:30] Als die Brüder das erfuhren, geleiteten sie ihn nach Cäsarea und entließen ihn von da nach Tarsus. 
[9:31] So lebte die Kirche in ganz Judäa, Galiläa und Samaria in Ruhe und Frieden. Sie erstarkte innerlich und wandelte in der Furcht des Herrn; dazu wuchs sie auch äußerlich durch den Beistand des Heiligen Geistes. 
[9:32] Als Petrus einst alle Heiligen besuchte, kam er auch zu denen, die in Lydda wohnten. 
[9:33] Dort fand er einen Mann mit Namen Äneas, der schon acht Jahre gelähmt zu Bett lag. 
[9:34] Zu dem sprach Petrus: "Äneas, Jesus der Messias macht dich gesund; steh auf und bringe dir dein Lager selbst in Ordnung!" Sofort erhob er sich. 
[9:35] Alle Leute in Lydda und Saron sahen ihn und bekehrten sich zum Herrn. 
[9:36] In Joppe wohnte eine Jüngerin mit Namen Tabitha — dies Wort bedeutet Gazelle —. Die widmete sich ganz der Liebestätigkeit und gab reichlich Almosen. 
[9:37] Gerade damals erkrankte sie und starb. Da wusch man ihre Leiche und bahrte sie in dem Obergemach des Hauses auf. 
[9:38] Die Jünger in Joppe, das nahe bei Lydda liegt, hatten erfahren, Petrus sei in Lydda. Darum sandten sie zwei Männer zu ihm mit der dringenden Bitte: "Komm ohne Säumen zu uns!" 
[9:39] Petrus machte sich auf und ging mit ihnen. Nach seiner Ankunft führte man ihn in das Obergemach. Da umringten ihn alle Witwen und zeigten ihm unter Tränen die Unterkleider und Obergewänder, wie sie "die Gazelle" zu machen pflegte, als sie noch bei ihnen war. 
[9:40] Petrus ließ alle aus dem Zimmer gehen, kniete nieder und betete. Dann wandte er sich zu dem Leichnam und sprach: "Tabitha, steh auf!" Da öffnete sie ihre Augen, und als sie Petrus erblickte, setzte sie sich aufrecht hin. 
[9:41] Er aber reichte ihr die Hand und half ihr, sich von ihrem Lager zu erheben. Dann rief er die Heiligen und die Witwen herein und gab sie ihnen lebendig wieder. 
[9:42] Dieser Vorfall ward in ganz Joppe bekannt, und viele wurden an den Herrn gläubig. 
[9:43] Petrus hielt sich dann noch längere Zeit in Joppe auf und wohnte bei einem Gerber namens Simon. 
[10:1] In Cäsarea lebte damals ein Mann, der hieß Kornelius. Er diente als Hauptmann in der sogenannten Italischen Schar. 
[10:2] Er war mit allen seinen Hausgenossen fromm und gottesfürchtig, tat dem (jüdischen) Volk viel Gutes und betete unablässig zu Gott. 
[10:3] Dieser Mann hatte eine himmlische Erscheinung. Um die neunte Tagesstunde sah er deutlich, wie ein Engel Gottes bei ihm eintrat, der ihm zurief: "Kornelius!" 
[10:4] Er starrte den Engel an und fragte voller Furcht: "Was wünschst du, Herr?" Der Engel antwortete ihm: "Deine Gebete und Liebeswerke sind zu Gott emporgestiegen, und er hat ihrer gnädig gedacht. 
[10:5] So sende nun Männer nach Joppe und laß einen gewissen Simon, mit dem Zunamen Petrus, holen! 
[10:6] Der ist zu Gast bei einem Gerber Simon, der ein Haus am Meer hat." 
[10:7] Als der Engel, der mit ihm geredet hatte, weggegangen war, rief Kornelius zwei von seinen Dienern und einen frommen Soldaten, der ihm treu ergeben war. 
[10:8] Er erzählte ihnen alles und sandte sie nach Joppe. 
[10:9] Am folgenden Tag, als diese auf dem Weg waren und sich schon der Stadt näherten, ging Petrus um die Mittagszeit auf das flache Dach des Hauses, um dort zu beten. 
[10:10] Er wurde sehr hungrig und wünschte etwas zu genießen. Während man ihm ein Mahl bereitete, kam eine Verzückung über ihn: 
[10:11] Er sah den Himmel offen und eine Art Gefäß daraus herabkommen, das einem großen Linnentuch glich und sich an vier Enden auf die Erde niederließ. 
[10:12] Darin waren alle Arten vierfüßiger und kriechender Tiere der Erde und Vögel des Himmels. 
[10:13] Zugleich rief ihm eine Stimme zu: "Steh auf, Petrus, schlachte und iß!" 
[10:14] Petrus aber antwortete: "Nun und nimmer, Herr! Denn ich habe nie etwas Gemeines und Unreines gegessen." 
[10:15] Da sprach eine Stimme zum zweitenmal zu ihm: "Was Gott gereinigt hat, das sieh du nicht als unrein an!" 
[10:16] Dies wiederholte sich dreimal. Dann wurde das Gefäß sogleich wieder zum Himmel emporgehoben. 
[10:17] Als Petrus über die Bedeutung des Gesichts, das er gehabt, noch bei sich im Zweifel war, in dem Augenblick standen die von Kornelius gesandten Männer, die sich nach Simons Haus durchgefragt hatten, an dem Toreingang, 
[10:18] riefen und erkundigten sich, ob Simon, mit dem Zunamen Petrus, da zu Gast sei. 
[10:19] Während Petrus noch immer über das Gesicht nachdachte, sprach der Geist zu ihm: "Sieh, drei Männer fragen nach dir. 
[10:20] So steh nun auf, geh hinab und zieh ohne Bedenken mit ihnen; denn ich habe sie gesandt!" 
[10:21] Da ging Petrus hinab und sprach zu den Männern: "Seht, ich bin es, den ihr sucht; was führt euch her?" 
[10:22] Sie erwiderten: "Der Hauptmann Kornelius, ein gerechter und gottesfürchtiger Mann, dem das ganze jüdische Volk ein gutes Zeugnis gibt, hat von einem heiligen Engel den göttlichen Befehl empfangen, dich in sein Haus holen zu lassen und zu hören, was du ihm zu sagen hast." 
[10:23] Da ließ sie Petrus eintreten und beherbergte sie. Tags darauf machte er sich mit ihnen auf den Weg, und einige Brüder aus Joppe begleiteten ihn. 
[10:24] Am folgenden Tag kamen sie in Cäsarea an. Kornelius wartete schon auf sie und hatte seine Verwandten und nächsten Freunde zu sich eingeladen. 
[10:25] Als Petrus in das Haus eintreten wollte, ging ihm Kornelius entgegen und fiel ihm ehrfurchtsvoll zu Füßen. 
[10:26] Petrus aber richtete ihn auf mit den Worten: "Steh auf, auch ich bin nur ein Mensch wie du!" 
[10:27] Dann ging er im Gespräch mit ihm ins Zimmer hinein. Dort fand er viele beisammen 
[10:28] und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr wißt ganz genau, wie streng es einem Juden verboten ist, mit einem Heiden zu verkehren oder ihn zu besuchen. Mir aber hat Gott gezeigt, keinen Menschen als unheilig oder unrein anzusehen. 
[10:29] Deshalb bin ich auch ohne Widerrede gekommen, als ich gerufen wurde. Ich frage nun: Warum habt ihr mich holen lassen?" 
[10:30] Da antwortete Kornelius: "Jetzt genau vor vier Tagen um die neunte Stunde betete ich in meinem Haus, als plötzlich ein Mann in glänzendem Gewand vor mir stand 
[10:31] und sprach: 'Kornelius, dein Gebet ist erhört, und deiner Almosen ist vor Gott gedacht worden. 
[10:32] So sende denn nach Joppe und laß Simon, mit dem Zunamen Petrus, zu dir bitten. Der hält sich auf im Haus des Gerbers Simon nahe dem Meer: er soll kommen und mit dir reden.' 
[10:33] Sofort sandte ich zu dir, und du hast recht getan, daß du gekommen bist. Jetzt sind wir alle hier vor Gottes Angesicht versammelt, um alles zu hören, was du in des Herrn Auftrag zu uns reden sollst." 
[10:34] Da tat Petrus seinen Mund auf und sprach: "Nun sehe ich deutlich ein, daß Gott kein Volk dem anderen vorzieht, 
[10:35] sondern daß ihm in jedem Volk alle, die ihn fürchten und Gerechtigkeit üben, willkommen sind. 
[10:36] Er hat seine Botschaft den Kindern Israel gesandt und Heil verkünden lassen durch Jesus Christus. Der ist ein Herr über alle. 
[10:37] Ihr wißt, was in ganz Judäa geschehen und ausgegangen ist von Galiläa nach der Taufe, die Johannes verkündigt hat: 
[10:38] Jesus von Nazaret, von Gott mit der Kraft des Heiligen Geistes gesalbt, ist von Ort zu Ort gezogen. Er hat Gutes getan und alle geheilt, die unter des Teufels Herrschaft standen; denn Gott war mit ihm. — 
[10:39] Und wir sind Zeugen all der Taten, die er im Land der Juden und in Jerusalem vollbracht hat. — Den haben sie ans Kreuz geschlagen und getötet. 
[10:40] Gott aber hat ihn am dritten Tag auferweckt 
[10:41] und ihn dann nicht dem ganzen Volk erscheinen lassen, sondern nur den Zeugen, die er vorher erwählt hatte. Diese Zeugen sind wir. Wir haben auch mit ihm gegessen und getrunken nach seiner Auferstehung von den Toten. 
[10:42] Und er hat uns geboten, dem Volk zu predigen und zu bezeugen, daß er von Gott bestimmt ist zum Richter der Lebendigen und der Toten. 
[10:43] Auf ihn weisen alle Propheten hin und bezeugen, daß durch seinen Namen alle, die an ihn glauben, Vergebung der Sünden empfangen sollen." 
[10:44] Während Petrus noch diese Worte sprach, fiel der Heilige Geist auf alle, die seiner Rede zuhörten. 
[10:45] Die Gläubigen jüdischer Herkunft aber, die mit Petrus gekommen waren, gerieten außer sich vor Staunen, als sie wahrnahmen, daß auch über die Heiden die Gabe des Heiligen Geistes ausgegossen wurde. 
[10:46] Denn sie hörten sie in Zungen reden und Gott preisen. Da sprach Petrus: 
[10:47] "Kann man das Wasser der Taufe diesen hier verweigern, die den Heiligen Geist empfangen haben ebenso wie wir?" 
[10:48] Und er befahl, sie in dem Namen Jesu Christi zu taufen. Dann bat man ihn, noch einige Tage dazubleiben. 
[11:1] Die Apostel und die Brüder in Judäa erfuhren, auch die Heiden hätten das Wort Gottes angenommen. 
[11:2] Als nun Petrus nach Jerusalem zurückkehrte, stellten ihn die Gläubigen jüdischer Herkunft zur Rede 
[11:3] und warfen ihm vor: "Du bist zu Heiden gegangen und hast sogar mit ihnen gegessen." 
[11:4] Da erzählte ihnen Petrus der Reihe nach alles, was sich zugetragen hatte. 
[11:5] "Ich war", so sagte er, "in der Stadt Joppe. Da hatte ich beim Gebet im Zustand der Verzückung ein Gesicht: Eine Art Gefäß, das einer großen Leinwand glich, ließ sich an vier Enden aus dem Himmel nieder und kam dicht zu mir. 
[11:6] Als ich in die Leinwand schaute und das Innere betrachtete, sah ich darin die vierfüßigen Tiere der Erde, die wilden Tiere, die kriechenden Tiere und die Vögel des Himmels. 
[11:7] Dann hörte ich eine Stimme zu mir sagen: 'Steh auf, Petrus, schlachte und iß!' 
[11:8] Ich antwortete: 'Nun und nimmer, Herr! Denn in meinen Mund ist nie etwas Gemeines oder Unreines gekommen.' 
[11:9] Da sprach eine Stimme vom Himmel zum zweitenmal: 'Was Gott gereinigt hat, das sieh du nicht als unrein an!' 
[11:10] Dies wiederholte sich dreimal. Dann wurde alles wieder zum Himmel emporgezogen. 
[11:11] Gerade in dem Augenblick standen vor dem Haus, wo ich war, drei Männer, die von Cäsarea zu mir gesandt waren. 
[11:12] Da befahl mir der Geist, ohne Zaudern mit ihnen zu gehen. Es begleiteten mich auch diese sechs Brüder hier, und so kamen wir in jenes Mannes Haus. 
[11:13] Der erzählte uns, wie er in seinem Haus den Engel hatte stehen sehen, der zu ihm sprach: 'Sende nach Joppe und laß Simon, mit dem Zunamen Petrus, holen! 
[11:14] Der wird dir Dinge sagen, wodurch du mit allen deinen Hausgenossen das Heil erlangen wirst.' 
[11:15] Als ich dann zu reden begann, fiel der Heilige Geist auf sie, gleichwie auf uns am Anfang. 
[11:16] Da dachte ich an das Wort des Herrn, wie er öfter sagte: 'Johannes hat mit Wasser getauft, ihr aber sollt mit dem Heiligen Geist getauft werden.' 
[11:17] Hat ihnen Gott nun auf Grund des Glaubens an den Herrn Jesus Christus dieselbe Gabe geschenkt wie uns, konnte ich da Gott in seinem Tun hindern?" 
[11:18] Als sie das hörten, schwiegen sie. Sie gaben Gott die Ehre und sprachen: "So hat Gott auch den Heiden die Sinnesänderung verliehen, die zum Leben führt." 
[11:19] Die sich bei der Verfolgung nach dem Tod des Stephanus zerstreut hatten, zogen bis Phönizien, Zypern und Antiochia. Sie wandten sich mit ihrer Verkündigung nur an die Juden. 
[11:20] Doch einige von ihnen, die aus Zypern und Kyrene stammten, redeten nach ihrer Ankunft in Antiochia auch zu den Heiden und verkündigten ihnen den Herrn Jesus. 
[11:21] Dabei war des Herrn Hand mit ihnen: eine große Zahl ward gläubig und bekehrte sich zum Herrn. 
[11:22] Die Kunde von diesen Vorgängen kam zu den Ohren der Gemeinde in Jerusalem, und Barnabas wurde von dort nach Antiochia gesandt. 
[11:23] Als er hinkam und die Gnade Gottes sah, freute er sich und ermahnte sie alle, mit ganzem Herzen dem Herrn treu zu bleiben. 
[11:24] Denn er war ein trefflicher Mann, voll Heiligen Geistes und Glaubens. Und eine große Schar wurde für den Herrn gewonnen. 
[11:25] Barnabas begab sich dann nach Tarsus, um Saulus aufzusuchen. 
[11:26] Als er ihn gefunden hatte, führte er ihn nach Antiochia. Dort brachten sie ein ganzes Jahr in der Gemeinde zu und unterwiesen viele. In Antiochia gab man auch den Jüngern zum erstenmal den Namen "Christen". 
[11:27] Damals kamen Propheten von Jerusalem nach Antiochia. 
[11:28] Einer von ihnen, mit Namen Agabus, erhob sich (in der Gemeindeversammlung) und machte durch den Geist kund, es werde eine große Hungersnot über den ganzen Erdkreis kommen, die dann auch unter der Regierung Klaudius eintrat. 
[11:29] Die Jünger beschlossen nun, ein jeder nach seinen Mitteln, den Brüdern, die in Judäa wohnten, Hilfe zu senden. 
[11:30] Das taten sie auch und schickten (diese Liebesgabe) an die Ältesten durch Barnabas und Saulus. 
[12:1] Um jene Zeit richtete der König Herodes eine Verfolgung gegen einige Glieder der Gemeinde. 
[12:2] Er ließ Jakobus, den Bruder des Johannes, mit dem Schwert enthaupten. 
[12:3] Als er sah, daß dies den Juden gefiel, ließ er auch Petrus gefangennehmen. 42 n.Chr. — Es waren gerade die Tage der ungesäuerten Brote. — 
[12:4] Als Petrus ergriffen war, ließ ihn Herodes ins Gefängnis werfen und von sechzehn Soldaten bewachen. Nach dem Passahfest wollte er in Gegenwart des Volkes das Urteil über ihn sprechen. 
[12:5] So ward denn Petrus im Kerker verwahrt. Die Gemeinde aber betete unablässig für ihn zu Gott. 
[12:6] In der Nacht vor dem Tag, wo Herodes die Gerichtsverhandlung halten wollte, schlief Petrus, mit zwei Ketten gebunden, zwischen zwei Soldaten, während draußen vor der Tür eine Wache stand. 
[12:7] Plötzlich erschien ein Engel des Herrn, und ein Licht erglänzte in der Zelle. Der Engel berührte die Seite des Petrus, weckte ihn und sprach: "Steh eilig auf!" Sofort fielen ihm die Ketten von seinen Händen. 
[12:8] Dann fuhr der Engel fort: "Gürte dich und zieh deine Schuhe an!" Das tat er. Nun sprach er weiter: "Wirf dir deinen Mantel um und folge mir!" 
[12:9] Petrus ging hinaus und folgte ihm. Er hielt aber des Engels Tun nicht für volle Wirklichkeit, sondern meinte, ein Traumgesicht zu haben. 
[12:10] Als sie an der ersten und der zweiten Wache vorbeigegangen waren, kamen sie an das eiserne Tor, das zur Stadt führte. Dies tat sich ihnen von selbst auf. Nun waren sie im Freien und bogen in eine Straße ein. Da mit einem Mal schied der Engel von ihm. 
[12:11] Jetzt kam Petrus zu sich selbst und sprach: "Nun weiß ich wirklich, daß der Herr seinen Engel gesandt und mich errettet hat von der Hand des Herodes und dem, was das jüdische Volk mit Ungeduld erwartet." 
[12:12] Nach einigem Nachdenken ging dann Petrus zu dem Haus der Maria, der Mutter des Johannes, mit dem Zunamen Markus, wo viele zum Gebet versammelt waren. 
[12:13] Als er an die Eingangspforte klopfte, erschien eine Magd, mit Namen Rhode, um zu hören, wer da sei. 
[12:14] Als sie des Petrus Stimme erkannte, vergaß sie vor lauter Freude, die Tür zu öffnen, sondern lief ins Haus und meldete, Petrus stehe an der Pforte. 
[12:15] Man antwortete ihr: "Du bist von Sinnen!" Sie aber behauptete bestimmt, es wäre so. Da sagte man: "Es ist sein Schutzengel." 
[12:16] Indes fuhr Petrus fort zu klopfen. Endlich öffneten sie. Sie sahen ihn und waren außer sich vor Freude. 
[12:17] Da gab er ihnen mit der Hand ein Zeichen, sie möchten schweigen, und erzählte ihnen, wie ihn der Herr aus dem Gefängnis geführt habe. Dann fügte er hinzu: "Verkündigt dies Jakobus und den Brüdern!" Damit verließ er sie und zog an einen anderen Ort. 
[12:18] Bei Tagesanbruch war der Schrecken der Soldaten nicht gering; sie fragten sich, was mit Petrus geschehen sein könne. 
[12:19] Herodes ließ ihn suchen, fand ihn aber nicht. Da verhörte er die Wächter und befahl, sie hinzurichten. Dann ging er von Judäa nach Cäsarea und nahm dort Aufenthalt. Anf. 44 
[12:20] Nun war er den Bewohnern von Tyrus und Sidon bitter feind. Sie schickten jetzt gemeinsam Gesandte an ihn. Diese gewannen Blastus, des Königs Kammerherrn, für sich und baten, alle schädigenden Maßregeln einzustellen, weil ihr Land aus dem des Königs Lebensmittel bezog. 
[12:21] An einem bestimmten Tag hielt Herodes eine Ansprache an die Gesandten, während er im königlichen Prachtgewand auf dem Thron saß. 
[12:22] Da rief das Volk, das zugegen war: "Das ist ein Gott, der hier redet, und kein Mensch!" 
[12:23] Sofort schlug ihn ein Engel des Herrn, weil er Gott nicht die Ehre gegeben hatte: er erkrankte am Wurmfraß und verschied. 
[12:24] Das Wort Gottes aber breitete sich immer weiter aus, und die Zahl seiner Bekenner mehrte sich. 
[12:25] Als Barnabas und Saulus ihren Auftrag ausgerichtet hatten, kehrten sie aus Jerusalem zurück; Johannes, mit dem Zunamen Markus, begleitete sie. 
[13:1] Damals dienten in Antiochia bei der dortigen Gemeinde als Propheten und Lehrer: Barnabas, Symeon, genannt Niger, Luzius aus Kyrene, Manaen, ein Jugendgefährte des Vierfürsten Herodes, und Saulus. 
[13:2] Als sie eines Tages dem Herrn dienten und fasteten, sprach der Heilige Geist: "Sondert mir Barnabas und Saulus aus für das Werk, wozu ich sie berufen habe!" 
[13:3] Dann legten sie ihnen nach Fasten und Gebet die Hände auf und ließen sie ziehen. Okt. 46 n.Chr. 
[13:4] So von dem Heiligen Geist ausgesandt, gingen sie nach Seleuzia. Von dort fuhren sie zu Schiff nach Zypern. 
[13:5] Nach ihrer Ankunft in Salamis verkündigten sie in den jüdischen Versammlungshäusern Gottes Wort. Sie hatten Johannes als Gehilfen bei sich. 
[13:6] Sie durchzogen die ganze Insel bis nach Paphos. Da trafen sie einen jüdischen Zauberer und falschen Propheten, der hieß Barjesus. 
[13:7] Er war befreundet mit dem Statthalter Sergius Paulus, einem einsichtsvollen Mann. Dieser entbot Barnabas und Saulus zu sich und wünschte Gottes Wort zu hören. 
[13:8] Aber Elymas oder der Zauberer — denn dies bedeutet der Name — widerstand ihnen und suchte zu verhindern, daß der Statthalter den Glauben annahm. 
[13:9] Da blickte Saulus, der auch Paulus heißt, vom Heiligen Geist erfüllt, dem Zauberer ins Antlitz 
[13:10] und sprach zu ihm: "Du Mensch voll aller List und aller Tücke, du Teufelssohn und Feind aller Gerechtigkeit, willst du denn nicht aufhören, die geraden Wege des Herrn zu verkehren? 
[13:11] Nun aber soll des Herrn Hand dich schlagen: du wirst erblinden und das Sonnenlicht eine Zeitlang nicht sehen." Sofort fiel Dunkelheit und Finsternis auf ihn, und als er hinauswankte, bat er die Leute, ihn an der Hand zu führen. 
[13:12] Als der Statthalter dies sah, wurde er gläubig, und er staunte ob der Lehre des Herrn. 
[13:13] Paulus und seine Begleiter schifften sich dann in Paphos ein und kamen nach Perge in Pamphylien. Dort verließ sie Johannes und kehrte nach Jerusalem zurück. 
[13:14] Sie aber zogen von Perge weiter und kamen nach Antiochia in Pisidien. Am Sabbat gingen sie in das jüdische Versammlungshaus und nahmen dort Platz. 
[13:15] Nach der Vorlesung des Gesetzes und der Propheten ließen ihnen die gottesdienstlichen Vorsteher sagen: "Liebe Brüder, wenn ihr etwas zur Erbauung der Gemeinde zu sagen habt, so redet!" 
[13:16] Da stand Paulus auf, winkte mit der Hand und sprach: "Ihr Israeliten und ihr Gottesfürchtigen, hört zu! 
[13:17] Der Gott dieses Volkes Israel hat unsere Väter auserwählt. Er hat das Volk gemehrt bei seinem Aufenthalt in Ägypten, und mit wunderbarer Macht hat er sie aus dem Land geführt. 
[13:18] Etwa vierzig Jahre ertrug er ihr Gebaren in der Wüste. 
[13:19] Dann vertilgte er sieben Völker im Land Kanaan und schenkte ihnen deren Land zum Erbe. 
[13:20] Das alles dauerte etwa 450 Jahre. Darauf gab er ihnen Richter bis auf den Propheten Samuel. 
[13:21] Da baten sie um einen König. Und Gott gab ihnen für vierzig Jahre Saul, den Sohn des Kis, einen Mann aus dem Stamm Benjamin. 
[13:22] Als er den verworfen hatte, erweckte er ihnen David zum König. Dem gab er auch ein gutes Zeugnis, indem er sprach: 'Gefunden habe ich David, Isais Sohn, einen Mann nach meinem Herzen; der wird alles tun, was ich gebiete.' 
[13:23] Aus dem Geschlecht dieses Mannes hat Gott nun, wie er verheißen, für Israel in Jesus einen Retter kommen lassen. 
[13:24] Doch ehe dieser auftrat, hat Johannes dem ganzen Volk Israel eine Taufe verkündigt, die von einer Sinnesänderung begleitet sein mußte. 
[13:25] Als dann Johannes am Ende seiner Laufbahn stand, sprach er: 'Wofür ihr mich haltet, das bin ich nicht; doch seht, nach mir kommt einer, dem ich nicht wert bin, die Schuhe von seinen Füßen loszubinden.' 
[13:26] Liebe Brüder, ihr, die ihr aus Abrahams Geschlecht stammt, und ihr Gottesfürchtigen, uns ist diese Heilsbotschaft gesandt worden. 
[13:27] Denn die Bewohner Jerusalems und ihre Obersten haben diesen Jesus nicht erkannt. Doch gerade dadurch, daß sie ihm das Urteil sprachen, haben sie die Worte der Propheten, die jeden Sabbat vorgelesen werden, zur Erfüllung gebracht. 
[13:28] Und obwohl sie keine Todesursache an ihm fanden, baten sie trotzdem Pilatus um seine Hinrichtung. 
[13:29] Als sie so alles, was von ihm geschrieben stand, vollendet hatten, nahmen sie ihn vom Kreuz herab und legten ihn ins Grab. 
[13:30] Gott aber hat ihn von den Toten auferweckt, 
[13:31] und viele Tage hindurch ist er denen, die mit ihm von Galiläa nach Jerusalem hinaufgezogen waren, erschienen: die sind nun seine Zeugen an das Volk. 
[13:32] Und wir verkünden euch die Frohe Botschaft: Die Verheißung, die Gott den Vätern einst gegeben, 
[13:33] hat er durch Jesu Auferweckung uns, ihren Kindern, nun erfüllt, wie es ja auch im zweiten Psalm heißt: 'Du bist mein Sohn, heute habe ich dich gezeugt.' 
[13:34] Daß er aber nach seiner Auferweckung von den Toten nicht mehr der Verwesung anheimfallen wird, dies hat Gott in diesen Worten ausgesprochen: 'Ich will euch die dem David zugesagten heiligen, unwandelbaren Güter geben.' 
[13:35] Deshalb heißt es auch an einer anderen Stelle: 'Du wirst nicht zugeben, daß dein Heiliger verwese.' 
[13:36] Nun, David ist entschlafen, als er nach Gottes Willen seinen Zeitgenossen zum Segen gedient hatte; er ist zu seinen Vätern versammelt worden und verwest. 
[13:37] Den aber Gott auferweckt hat, der ist nicht verwest. 
[13:38] So wißt denn, ihr Brüder, daß euch durch diesen Jesus Vergebung der Sünden verkündigt wird. 
[13:39] Durch ihn wird jeder, der da glaubt, von allem losgesprochen, wovon ihr unter dem Gesetz Moses nicht befreit werden konntet. 
[13:40] Seht nun zu, daß euch nicht treffe, was in dem Buch des Propheten geschrieben steht: 
[13:41] Schaut, ihr Verächter, verwundert euch und werdet ganz zunichte; denn ich tue ein Werk in euern Tagen, ein Werk, das ihr nicht glauben würdet, wenn man's euch erzählte." 
[13:42] Als Paulus und Barnabas den Gottesdienst verließen, bat man sie, am nächsten Sabbat über dieselben Dinge abermals zu reden. 
[13:43] Nach dem Schluß der Versammlung folgten viele Juden und gottesfürchtige Heiden Paulus und Barnabas. Diese redeten zu ihnen und ermahnten sie, fest bei der Gnade Gottes zu beharren. 
[13:44] Am kommenden Sabbat versammelte sich fast die ganze Stadt, um des Herrn Wort zu hören. 
[13:45] Als die Juden die vielen Menschen sahen, wurden sie von Neid erfüllt und widersprachen des Paulus Rede unter Lästerungen. 
[13:46] Da erklärten ihnen Paulus und Barnabas frei und offen: "Euch mußte zuerst Gottes Wort verkündigt werden. Weil ihr es aber von euch weist und euch selbst des ewigen Lebens nicht wert achtet, nun, so wenden wir uns zu den Heiden. 
[13:47] Denn so hat uns der Herr geboten: Ich habe dich gesetzt zum Licht für die Heiden, damit du Heil verbreitest bis ans Ende der Erde." 
[13:48] Als die Heiden dies hörten, freuten sie sich und priesen das Wort des Herrn, und alle, die zum ewigen Leben bestimmt waren, wurden gläubig. 
[13:49] Das Wort des Herrn verbreitete sich dann in der ganzen Gegend. 
[13:50] Die Juden aber reizten die vornehmen Frauen der Stadt, die sich zu ihrem Gottesdienst hielten, und die einflußreichsten Bürger auf. So erregten sie eine Verfolgung gegen Paulus und Barnabas und vertrieben sie aus ihrem Gebiet. 
[13:51] Da schüttelten diese den Staub von ihren Füßen gegen sie und zogen nach Ikonium. 
[13:52] Die Jünger aber wurden mehr und mehr mit Freude und Heiligem Geist erfüllt. 
[14:1] In Ikonium besuchten sie zusammen das jüdische Versammlungshaus und redeten dort mit solchem Erfolg, daß Juden und Heiden in großer Anzahl gläubig wurden. 
[14:2] Die Juden aber, die ungläubig blieben, regten die heidnische Bevölkerung auf und machten sie gehässig gegen die Brüder. 
[14:3] Paulus und Barnabas blieben geraume Zeit dort und wirkten unerschrocken im Vertrauen auf den Herrn, der für das Wort von seiner Gnade Zeugnis gab, indem er Zeichen und Wunder durch ihre Hände geschehen ließ. 
[14:4] Endlich spaltete sich die Bevölkerung der Stadt in zwei Parteien: die einen hielten es mit den Juden, die anderen mit den Aposteln. 
[14:5] Als diese erfuhren, daß die Heiden und die Juden im Einverständnis mit ihrer Obrigkeit damit umgingen, sie zu mißhandeln und zu steinigen, 
[14:6] da entflohen sie in die lykaonischen Städte Lystra und Derbe und deren Nachbarschaft. 
[14:7] Dort fuhren sie fort, die Frohe Botschaft zu verkünden. 
[14:8] In Lystra lebte damals ein Mann, der hatte keine Kraft in seinen Füßen; er war von Geburt lahm, mußte immer stillsitzen und hatte noch nie umhergehen können. 
[14:9] Da hörte er Paulus reden. Paulus sah ihn scharf an, und da er merkte, daß der Mann Vertrauen hatte, geheilt zu werden, 
[14:10] rief er ihm mit lauter Stimme zu: "Tritt aufrecht auf deine Füße!" Da sprang er auf und ging umher. 
[14:11] Als die Leute sahen, was Paulus getan, da riefen sie in ihrer Landessprache: "Die Götter sind in menschlicher Gestalt zu uns herabgekommen!" 
[14:12] Sie nannten Barnabas "Zeus" und Paulus "Hermes", weil er das Wort führte. 
[14:13] Der Priester des Zeus, der am Eingang der Stadt einen Tempel hatte, brachte Stiere und Kränze zu dem Stadttor und schickte sich an, zusammen mit dem Volk ein Opfer darzubringen. 
[14:14] Sobald die Apostel Paulus und Barnabas dies erfuhren, zerrissen sie ihre Kleider, eilten aus ihrem Haus, sprangen unter die Menge 
[14:15] und riefen: "Ihr Männer, warum tut ihr das? Auch wir sind Menschen ganz ebenso wie ihr. Wir bringen euch die Botschaft, daß ihr euch von diesen nichtigen Göttern zu dem lebendigen Gott wenden sollt, der den Himmel, die Erde und das Meer mit allem, was darinnen ist, geschaffen hat. 
[14:16] In den vergangenen Zeiten hat er alle Völker ihre eigenen Wege gehen lassen. 
[14:17] Trotzdem aber hat er euch durch seine Wohltaten von seinem Dasein Zeugnis gegeben: Er sendet euch vom Himmel Regen und fruchtbare Zeiten; so schenkt er euch reichlich Nahrung und erfüllt eure Herzen mit Freude." 
[14:18] Nur mit Mühe konnten sie durch diese Worte das Volk davon abbringen, ihnen zu opfern. 
[14:19] Später kamen Juden von Antiochia und Ikonium nach Lystra. Die verhetzten das Volk, steinigten Paulus und schleiften ihn zur Stadt hinaus, in der Meinung, er sei tot. 
[14:20] Als ihn aber die Jünger umringten, erhob er sich und kehrte in die Stadt zurück. Am folgenden Tag ging er mit Barnabas nach Derbe. 
[14:21] Als sie in dieser Stadt die Frohe Botschaft verkündigt und viele Jünger gewonnen hatten, kehrten sie nach Lystra, Ikonium und Antiochia zurück. Sommer 48 n.Chr. 
[14:22] Überall stärkten sie die Seelen der Jünger, ermahnten sie, fest im Glauben zu beharren, und fügten hinzu: "Wir müssen durch viele Trübsale in Gottes Königreich eingehen." 
[14:23] Sie setzten auch in jeder Gemeinde Älteste ein und befahlen die Jünger unter Gebet und Fasten dem Herrn, an den sie gläubig geworden waren. 
[14:24] Dann zogen sie durch Pisidien und kamen nach Pamphylien. 
[14:25] Als sie in Perge das Wort des Herrn verkündigt hatten, gingen sie nach Attilia hinab. 
[14:26] Von da fuhren sie zu Schiff nach Antiochia. Dort waren sie ja einst der Gnade Gottes befohlen für die Arbeit, die sie nun vollendet hatten. 
[14:27] Nach ihrer Ankunft versammelten sie die Gemeinde und berichteten, wie Großes Gott durch sie gewirkt und daß er den Heiden die Tür des Glaubens aufgetan habe. 
[14:28] Sie blieben dann geraume Zeit bei den Jüngern in Antiochia. 
[15:1] Es kamen aber Leute aus Judäa dorthin, die lehrten die Brüder: "Wenn ihr euch nicht nach mosaischer Sitte beschneiden laßt, so könnt ihr nicht selig werden." 
[15:2] Mit diesen Leuten kamen Paulus und Barnabas in einen lebhaften Streit und Wortwechsel. Die Brüder bestimmten endlich, Paulus und Barnabas sollten mit einigen anderen aus der Gemeinde wegen dieser Streitfrage zu den Aposteln und Ältesten nach Jerusalem hinaufgehen. 
[15:3] Sie traten ihre Reise an, von einigen Gemeindegliedern (eine Strecke weit) geleitet. Anf. 49 n.Chr. Sie zogen durch Phönizien und Samaria, erzählten dort den Brüdern ausführlich von der Bekehrung der Heiden und machten ihnen allen damit eine große Freude. 
[15:4] Bei ihrer Ankunft in Jerusalem wurden sie von der Gemeinde, den Aposteln und den Ältesten herzlich empfangen; und sie erzählten, wie Großes Gott durch sie getan hatte. 
[15:5] Einige aber, die früher der pharisäischen Richtung angehört hatten und nun gläubig geworden waren, traten mit der Forderung auf: "Man muß die Heidenchristen beschneiden und von ihnen verlangen, daß sie das Gesetz Moses halten." 
[15:6] Da versammelten sich die Apostel und die Ältesten, um diese Frage zu erwägen. 
[15:7] Es wurde viel hin und her geredet. Endlich erhob sich Petrus und sprach zu ihnen: "Liebe Brüder, wie ihr selbst wißt, hat Gott mich schon vor langer Zeit unter euch dazu erwählt, daß die Heiden durch meinen Mund das Wort der Heilsbotschaft vernähmen und zum Glauben kämen. 
[15:8] Und Gott, der Herzenskündiger, hat sich zu ihnen bekannt und ihnen den Heiligen Geist gegeben ebenso wie uns. 
[15:9] So hat er zwischen uns und ihnen keinen Unterschied gemacht, als er durch den Glauben ihre Herzen gereinigt hatte. 
[15:10] Warum wollt ihr denn nun Gott versuchen und den Jüngern ein Joch auf den Hals legen, das weder unsere Väter noch wir haben tragen können? 
[15:11] Nein, durch die Gnade des Herrn Jesus glauben wir das Heil zu erlangen ganz ebenso wie sie." 
[15:12] Da schwiegen alle still, und man hörte nun dem Bericht zu, den Barnabas und Paulus von allen ihren Zeichen und Wundern gaben, die Gott unter den Heiden durch sie getan hatte. 
[15:13] Nach ihrem Bericht nahm Jakobus das Wort. "Liebe Brüder", so begann er, "hört mir zu! 
[15:14] Symeon hat erzählt, wie Gott den ersten Schritt getan, um aus den Heiden ein Volk zu gewinnen, das seinen Namen trägt. 
[15:15] Und dies stimmt mit den Worten der Propheten überein. Denn es steht geschrieben: 
[15:16] Später will ich wiederkehren und Davids zerfallene Hütte wiederherstellen. Ihre Trümmer will ich wieder aufbauen und sie wieder aufrichten, 
[15:17] damit die übrigen Menschen den Herrn suchen, nämlich alle Heiden, die nach meinem Namen genannt sind, spricht der Herr, der dieses tut. 
[15:18] Diese Weissagung ist von altersher bekannt. 
[15:19] Ich meine deshalb: Man soll den Heiden, die sich zu Gott bekehren, nicht unnötige Lasten aufbürden. 
[15:20] Wir wollen ihnen nur schreiben, sie sollen meiden: den Genuß von Götzenopferfleisch, die Ehe mit Heiden, das Fleisch von Tieren, die man in Schlingen fängt, und das Essen des Blutes geschlachteter Tiere. 
[15:21] Denn Mose hat seit unvordenklichen Zeiten in jeder Stadt seine eigenen Verkündiger, weil er in den Versammlungshäusern jeden Sabbat vorgelesen wird." 
[15:22] Da beschlossen die Apostel und die Ältesten im Einverständnis mit der ganzen Gemeinde, aus ihrer Mitte geeignete Männer zu wählen und sie mit Paulus und Barnabas nach Antiochia zu senden. Judas, mit dem Beinamen Barsabbas, und Silas, die bei den Brüdern in hohem Ansehen standen, wurden dazu bestimmt. 
[15:23] Ihnen gab man folgenden Brief mit: "Die Apostel und die Ältesten entbieten als Brüder den in Antiochia, Syrien und Zilizien wohnenden Brüdern aus den Heiden ihren Gruß. 
[15:24] Es ist uns kundgeworden, daß einige aus unserer Mitte, ohne daß sie Auftrag von uns empfangen hätten, auf eigene Hand ausgezogen sind und euch mit ihren Reden in euerm Gemüt aufs höchste beunruhigt haben. 
[15:25] Deshalb haben wir einmütig beschlossen, geeignete Männer auszuwählen und sie zu euch zu senden im Verein mit unseren lieben Freunden Barnabas und Paulus, 
[15:26] die ihr Leben für die Sache unseres Herrn Jesus Christus aufs Spiel gesetzt haben. 
[15:27] Wir senden euch nun Judas und Silas, die euch mündlich dieselbe Botschaft bringen werden. 
[15:28] Denn der Heilige Geist und wir haben es für gut befunden, euch weiter keine Last aufzulegen als diese notwendigen Bestimmungen: 
[15:29] ihr habt zu meiden den Genuß von Götzenopferfleisch, das Blut geschlachteter Tiere, das Fleisch von Tieren, die man in Schlingen fängt, und die Ehen mit Heiden. Wenn ihr euch davor hütet, so wird's gut mit euch stehen. Lebt wohl!" 
[15:30] Die Abgesandten wurden von der Gemeinde entlassen und kamen nach Antiochia, wo sie die Schar der Jünger versammelten und das Schreiben übergaben. 
[15:31] Die Gemeinde las es und freute sich über den tröstlichen Zuspruch, den es enthielt. 
[15:32] Judas und Silas, die Propheten waren, trösteten auch ihrerseits die Brüder durch mannigfaltigen Zuspruch und stärkten sie im Glauben. 
[15:33] Nach einiger Zeit wurden sie von den Brüdern unter Segenswünschen verabschiedet, um zu denen, die sie gesandt hatten, zurückzukehren. 
[15:34]  
[15:35] Paulus aber und Barnabas blieben in Antiochia: sie lehrten und verkündigten noch mit vielen anderen das Wort des Herrn. 
[15:36] Nach einiger Zeit sprach Paulus zu Barnabas: "Laß uns doch die Brüder in allen Städten, wo wir das Wort des Herrn verkündigt haben, wieder besuchen, um zu sehen, wie es ihnen geht!" 
[15:37] Barnabas wollte auch Johannes, mit dem Beinamen Markus, mitnehmen. 
[15:38] Paulus aber hielt es nicht für richtig, ihn mitzunehmen, weil er sie einst in Pamphylien verlassen und sie nicht bei ihrer Arbeit begleitet hatte. 
[15:39] Über diese Frage kamen sie in einen heftigen Wortwechsel, so daß sie sich voneinander trennten. Während Barnabas mit Markus nach Zypern hinüberfuhr, 
[15:40] erkor sich Paulus den Silas zum Gefährten und, von den Brüdern der Gnade des Herrn befohlen, trat er seine Reise an. Frühling 49 n.Chr. 
[15:41] Er zog zunächst durch Syrien und Zilizien und stärkte dort die Gemeinden. 
[16:1] Dann kam er nach Derbe und nach Lystra. In Lystra war ein Jünger, mit Namen Timotheus; seine Mutter war eine (an Christus) gläubige Jüdin, sein Vater ein Heide. 
[16:2] Die Brüder in Lystra und Ikonium hatten eine gute Meinung von Timotheus. 
[16:3] Paulus wünschte ihn zum Reisebegleiter. Darum nahm er ihn und beschnitt ihn mit Rücksicht auf die Juden, die in jener Gegend wohnten. Denn sie wußten alle, daß sein Vater ein Heide war. 
[16:4] In allen Städten, wohin sie kamen, übergaben sie den Gläubigen die Verordnungen der Apostel und Ältesten in Jerusalem zur Befolgung. 
[16:5] So wurden die Gemeinden im Glauben gestärkt und wuchsen täglich an Zahl. 
[16:6] Sie durchzogen das phrygische und das galatische Land, weil ihnen der Heilige Geist verboten hatte, das Wort in Asien zu verkündigen. 
[16:7] An der Grenze Mysiens suchten sie nach Bithynien zu gelangen, aber der Geist Jesu erlaubte es ihnen nicht. 
[16:8] So zogen sie eilig durch Mysien und kamen an die Küste nach Troas. 
[16:9] Hier hatte Paulus des Nachts ein Traumgesicht: Ein Mazedonier stand vor ihm und bat ihn: "Komm nach Mazedonien und hilf uns!" 
[16:10] Als er dies Gesicht gehabt hatte, suchten wir sofort Gelegenheit, nach Mazedonien zu fahren; denn wir waren sicher, Gott habe uns dorthin gerufen, um den Leuten die Heilsbotschaft zu verkündigen. 
[16:11] So fuhren wir von Troas ab und schifften geradewegs nach Samothrake, tags darauf nach Neapolis. 
[16:12] Von da gingen wir nach Philippi, einer bedeutenden Römerstadt in jenem Bezirk Mazedoniens. In dieser Stadt blieben wir einige Tage. 
[16:13] Am Sabbat gingen wir aus dem Tor an einen Fluß, wo man sich zum Gebet zu versammeln pflegte. Wir setzten uns da nieder und redeten zu den Frauen, die sich eingefunden hatten. 
[16:14] Unter den Zuhörerinnen war eine mit Namen Lydia, eine Purpurhändlerin aus der Stadt Thyatira, eine Heidin, die am jüdischen Gottesdienst teilnahm. Ihr öffnete der Herr das Herz, so daß sie auf des Paulus Worte achtgab. 
[16:15] Als sie mit ihren Hausgenossen getauft worden war, lud sie uns ein und sprach: "Wenn ich nach euerm Urteil eine treue Jüngerin des Herrn bin, so kommt und wohnt in meinem Haus!" Wir gaben endlich ihrem Drängen nach. 
[16:16] Als wir eines Tages zu der Gebetsstätte gingen, begegnete uns eine Sklavin, die von einem Wahrsagergeist besessen war und ihren Herren durch das Voraussagen der Zukunft viel Geld einbrachte. 
[16:17] Die lief immer hinter Paulus und uns her und rief: "Diese Menschen sind Diener des höchsten Gottes, sie verkündigen euch den Weg zur Seligkeit." 
[16:18] Das tat sie viele Tage lang. Endlich aber wandte sich Paulus entrüstet zu ihr und sprach zu dem Geist: "Ich gebiete dir in dem Namen Jesu Christi, von ihr auszufahren!" Und auf der Stelle fuhr er aus. 
[16:19] Als nun ihre Herren sahen, daß sie keine Aussicht auf Gewinn mehr hatten, ergriffen sie Paulus und Silas und schleppten sie auf den Marktplatz vor die Obrigkeit. 
[16:20] Sie führten sie dort den beiden höchsten Stadtbeamten vor und sprachen: "Die Menschen hier bringen unsere Stadt in Aufregung. Sie sind Juden 
[16:21] und verkündigen Sitten und Gebräuche, die wir als Römer nicht annehmen und befolgen dürfen." 
[16:22] Auch die Volksmenge erhob sich gegen sie. Da ließen ihnen die Beamten die Kleider vom Leib reißen und befahlen, sie mit Ruten zu peitschen. 
[16:23] Als sie viele Geißelhiebe empfangen hatten, wurden sie ins Gefängnis geworfen, und der Gefängniswärter erhielt Befehl, sie an einem sicheren Ort zu verwahren. 
[16:24] Um diesen Befehl auszuführen, brachte er sie in den innersten Teil des Gefängnisses und spannte ihre Füße in den Block. 
[16:25] Um Mitternacht beteten Paulus und Silas und priesen Gott in Lobgesängen, und die Gefangenen hörten ihnen zu. 
[16:26] Plötzlich entstand ein so gewaltiges Erdbeben, daß das Gefängnis in seinen Grundfesten wankte. Sofort sprangen alle Türen auf, und die Ketten aller Gefangenen lösten sich. 
[16:27] Als der Gefangenenwärter aus dem Schlaf erwachte und die Gefängnistüren offenstehen sah, zog er sein Schwert und wollte sich das Leben nehmen; denn er meinte, die Gefangenen seien entflohen. 
[16:28] Da rief Paulus mit lauter Stimme: "Tue dir kein Leid an; denn wir sind noch alle hier!" 
[16:29] Jetzt ließ er sich Licht bringen, sprang in die Kerkerzelle und warf sich Paulus und Silas zitternd zu Füßen. 
[16:30] Dann führte er sie hinaus und sprach: "Ihr Herren, was muß ich tun, damit ich das Heil erlange?" 
[16:31] Sie antworteten ihm: "Glaube an den Herrn Jesus Christus, dann wirst du samt deinen Hausgenossen errettet werden!" 
[16:32] Nun verkündigten sie ihm und allen, die in seinem Haus waren, das Wort des Herrn. 
[16:33] Er aber nahm sie noch in derselben Nachtstunde mit sich und wusch ihre Wunden. Dann ließ er sich sofort mit all den Seinen taufen. 
[16:34] Danach führte er sie hinauf in seine Wohnung und bewirtete sie. Er freute sich mit seinem ganzen Haus, weil er an Gott gläubig geworden war. 
[16:35] Als es Tag ward, sandten die Stadtbeamten die Gerichtsdiener zu dem Gefangenenwärter mit dem Befehl: "Laß die beiden Leute frei!" 
[16:36] Der Gefangenenwärter teilte dies Paulus mit, indem er sagte: "Die Stadtbeamten haben Botschaft gesandt, daß ihr freigelassen werden sollt. So geht nun hin und zieht in Frieden!" 
[16:37] Paulus aber antwortete den Gerichtsdienern: "Die Stadtbeamten haben uns, die wir doch römische Bürger sind, ohne richterliches Urteil öffentlich geißeln und ins Gefängnis werfen lassen, und nun wollen sie uns ganz in der Stille ausweisen?, nein, sie sollen selbst kommen und uns hinausgeleiten!" 
[16:38] Die Gerichtsdiener meldeten diese Antwort den Stadtbeamten. Die erschraken, als sie hörten, es handle sich um römische Bürger. 
[16:39] Sie kamen nun und gaben ihnen gute Worte, führten sie aus dem Gefängnis und baten sie, die Stadt zu verlassen. 
[16:40] Als Paulus und Silas aus dem Kerker gegangen waren, begaben sie sich in das Haus der Lydia. Dort sahen sie die Brüder und ermunterten sie (zur Glaubenstreue). Dann verließen sie die Stadt. 
[17:1] Sie zogen die Straße über Amphipolis und Apollonia und kamen nach Thessalonich. Hier hatten die Juden ein Versammlungshaus. 
[17:2] Nach seiner Gewohnheit besuchte es Paulus, und an drei aufeinanderfolgenden Sabbaten hielt er Vorträge, 
[17:3] indem er auf Grund der Schrift darlegte und bewies, daß der Messias leiden und von den Toten auferstehen mußte, und "der Messias" — so betonte er — "ist der Jesus, den ich euch verkündige." 
[17:4] Einige Juden ließen sich überzeugen und schlossen sich Paulus und Silas an, dazu eine große Zahl gottesfürchtiger Heiden und viele vornehme Frauen. 
[17:5] Voll Neid darüber erkauften die Juden einige verworfene Gesellen aus dem Straßengesindel, rotteten mit ihrer Hilfe den Pöbel zusammen und brachten die Stadt in Aufregung. Dann zogen sie vor Jasons Haus und suchten dort nach Paulus und Silas, um sie zu dem versammelten Volk hinauszuführen. 
[17:6] Als sie beide nicht fanden, schleppten sie Jason und einige andere Brüder vor die Stadtoberen und schrien: "Diese Menschen, die das ganze Reich aufgewiegelt haben, sind nun auch hier bei uns, 
[17:7] und Jason hat sie aufgenommen! Alle diese Leute handeln des Kaisers Verordnungen zuwider; sie behaupten, ein anderer sei König: ein gewisser Jesus!" 
[17:8] Bei diesen Anklagen gerieten die Volksmenge und die Stadtoberen in große Unruhe; 
[17:9] und die Oberen ließen Jason und die anderen nicht eher gehen, als bis sie eine bestimmte Bürgschaft von ihnen empfangen hatten. 
[17:10] Sofort in der folgenden Nacht wurden Paulus und Silas von den Brüdern nach Beröa gesandt. Sie besuchten dort nach ihrer Ankunft das Versammlungshaus der Juden. 
[17:11] Die Juden in Beröa waren von edlerer Sinnesart als die in Thessalonich. Sie nahmen das Wort sehr willig auf und forschten täglich in der Schrift, um sich zu überzeugen, ob das, was sie gehört, damit auch wirklich übereinstimmte. 
[17:12] Viele von ihnen wurden gläubig, außerdem nicht wenige Heiden: Frauen der besseren Stände und Männer. 
[17:13] Als aber die Juden in Thessalonich erfuhren, daß Paulus Gottes Wort auch in Beröa verkündigt habe, kamen sie auch dorthin und hetzten den Pöbel zu Ruhestörungen auf. 
[17:14] Da sandten die Brüder Paulus sofort aus der Stadt und ließen ihn einen Weg einschlagen, als strebe er dem Meer zu. Silas und Timotheus blieben in Beröa zurück. 
[17:15] Die Brüder aber, die Paulus zu seiner Sicherheit begleiteten, blieben bei ihm, bis er nach Athen kam. Anf. 50 n.Chr. Von da kehrten sie (nach Beröa) zurück und nahmen den Auftrag an Silas und Timotheus mit, sie möchten so bald als möglich zu ihm kommen. 
[17:16] Während Paulus in Athen auf sie wartete, ergrimmte er in seinem Geiste, als er sah, wie die Stadt voll Götterbilder war. 
[17:17] Er sprach in dem jüdischen Versammlungshaus zu den Juden und auch zu den Heiden, die dort am Gottesdienst teilnahmen, und auf dem Markt redete er täglich mit denen, die er dort traf. 
[17:18] Auch einige epikureische und stoische Philosophen ließen sich mit ihm ein. Die einen sprachen: "Was will denn dieser Schwätzer sagen?" Andere meinten: "Er scheint ein Verkündiger ausländischer Gottheiten zu sein." Denn er verkündigte ihnen Jesus und die Auferstehung. 
[17:19] Eines Tages nahmen sie ihn freundlich bei der Hand, führten ihn auf den Areshügel und sprachen: "Dürfen wir erfahren, was das für eine neue Lehre ist, die du verkündigst? 
[17:20] Denn du erzählst da Dinge, die uns seltsam klingen. Wir möchten deshalb wissen, um was es sich hier handelt." 
[17:21] - Alle Athener nämlich und die in der Stadt ansässigen Fremden waren stets nur darauf aus, das Neueste zu erzählen oder zu hören. — 
[17:22] Da trat Paulus mitten auf den Areshügel und sprach: "Ihr Männer von Athen, ich finde, daß ihr in euerm Gottesdienst in jeder Hinsicht sehr eifrig seid. 
[17:23] Denn als ich umherging und eure Heiligtümer ansah, entdeckte ich auch einen Altar mit der Inschrift: 'Dem unbekannten Gott.' Diese Gottheit nun, die ihr verehrt, ohne sie zu kennen, die verkündige ich euch. 
[17:24] Der Gott, der die Welt mit allem, was darinnen ist, geschaffen hat, er, des Himmels und der Erde Herr, wohnt nicht in Tempeln, die mit Händen erbaut sind. 
[17:25] Er läßt sich auch nicht von Menschenhänden bedienen, als habe er irgend etwas nötig: er gibt ja allen Leben und Odem und alles, dessen sie bedürfen. 
[17:26] Er hat von einem Menschen alle Völker kommen und sie auf der ganzen Erde wohnen lassen; dazu hat er bestimmt, wie lange jedes Volk bestehen und wie weit sich sein Gebiet erstrecken soll. 
[17:27] Dies hat er getan, damit sie Gott suchen sollten, ob sie ihn vielleicht fühlen und finden möchten, da er ja nicht fern ist von jedem unter uns. 
[17:28] Denn nur weil wir so eng mit ihm verbunden sind, erfreuen wir uns des Lebens, können wir uns regen und bewegen und haben wir das Dasein. Darum haben auch einige eurer Dichter gesagt: Wir sind seines Geschlechts. 
[17:29] Da wir nun von dem Geschlecht Gottes sind, sollen wir nicht meinen, die Gottheit gleiche dem Gold, Silber oder Stein, woraus die Kunst und der Erfindergeist des Menschen Götterbilder herstellt. 
[17:30] Diese Zeiten der Unwissenheit hat Gott in seiner Gnade übersehen. Jetzt aber ruft er alle Menschen überall zur Sinnesänderung. 
[17:31] Denn er hat einen Tag bestimmt, wo er den Erdkreis richten will in Gerechtigkeit, und zwar durch einen Mann, den er dazu verordnet hat, und an den zu glauben er allen möglich macht, weil er ihn auferweckt hat von den Toten..." 
[17:32] Als sie aber von einer Auferstehung der Toten hörten, da begannen die einen zu spotten, während andere sagten: "Darüber wollen wir dich ein andermal hören." 
[17:33] So ging Paulus aus ihrer Mitte weg. 
[17:34] Einige aber schlossen sich ihm an und wurden gläubig, darunter Dionysius, ein Mitglied der obersten Gerichtsbehörde, eine Frau, mit Namen Damaris, und andere mit ihnen. 
[18:1] Darauf verließ Paulus Athen und kam nach Korinth. 
[18:2] Dort traf er einen Juden aus Pontus, namens Aquila, der mit seiner Frau Priszilla erst vor kurzem aus Italien gekommen war, weil (der Kaiser) Klaudius alle Juden aus Rom ausgewiesen hatte. Paulus trat mit beiden in Verkehr. 
[18:3] Da er dasselbe Handwerk hatte wie sie — das Zeltmachergewerbe —, so nahm er bei ihnen Wohnung und arbeitete mit ihnen. 
[18:4] Jeden Sabbat redete er in dem jüdischen Versammlungshaus und suchte Juden und Heiden zu gewinnen. 
[18:5] Als dann Silas und Timotheus aus Mazedonien eingetroffen waren, gab sich Paulus ganz der Verkündigung des Wortes hin und bezeugte den Juden eindringlich, daß Jesus der Messias sei. 
[18:6] Da sie aber widerstrebten und lästerten, schüttelte er den Staub seiner Kleider ab und sprach zu ihnen: "Euer Blut komme über euer Haupt! Ich trage keine Schuld. Von nun an wende ich mich an die Heiden." 
[18:7] Damit verließ er die jüdische Gemeinde und ging in das Haus eines gottesfürchtigen Heiden, namens Titus Justus, das ganz nahe bei dem jüdischen Versammlungshaus lag. 
[18:8] Krispus aber, der Vorsteher der jüdischen Gemeinde, wurde mit seinem ganzen Haus an den Herrn gläubig. Auch sonst kamen noch viele Korinther, die Paulus hörten, zum Glauben und ließen sich taufen. 
[18:9] In einem nächtlichen Traumgesicht sprach der Herr zu Paulus: "Fürchte dich nicht, sondern rede frei und schweige nicht! 
[18:10] Denn ich bin mit dir, und niemand soll seine Hand an dich legen, um dir ein Leid zu tun; denn ich habe ein großes Volk in dieser Stadt." 
[18:11] Paulus blieb ein Jahr und sechs Monate in Korinth und lehrte dort das Wort Gottes. 
[18:12] Als aber Gallio Statthalter von Achaja war, traten die Juden einmütig gegen Paulus auf, führten ihn vor den Richterstuhl und sprachen: 
[18:13] "Dieser Mann verleitet die Leute, Gott zu dienen im Widerspruch mit unserem Gesetz." 
[18:14] Als sich nun Paulus verteidigen wollte, antwortete Gallio den Juden: "Wenn es sich um ein Verbrechen oder grobes Vergehen handelte, ihr Juden, so hätte ich einen vernünftigen Grund, auf eure Klage einzugehen. 
[18:15] Da es sich aber um Streitigkeiten handelt über eine Lehre, über besondere Namen und über euer Gesetz, so seht selbst zu, wie ihr damit fertig werdet! Ich will über diese Fragen nicht entscheiden." 
[18:16] Damit wies er sie von seinem Richterstuhl. 
[18:17] Da fielen sie alle über Sosthenes, den Vorsteher der jüdischen Gemeinde, her und schlugen ihn vor dem Richterstuhl, ohne daß Gallio dagegen einschritt. 
[18:18] Paulus blieb noch ziemlich lange in Korinth. Dann nahm er Abschied von den Brüdern und schiffte sich mit Priszilla und Aquila nach Syrien ein. Sept. 51 n.Chr. Zuvor aber ließ er sich in Kenchreä sein Haupt scheren, denn er hatte ein Gelübde getan. 
[18:19] Nach der Landung in Ephesus ließ Paulus Priszilla und Aquila dort zurück. Er selbst besuchte die gottesdienstliche Versammlung der Juden und redete mit ihnen. 
[18:20] Sie baten ihn, noch länger dazubleiben. Aber darauf ging er nicht ein, 
[18:21] sondern er sagte ihnen Lebewohl und sprach: "Ich muß auf jeden Fall das kommende Fest in Jerusalem verleben; doch wenn es Gottes Wille ist, so kehre ich ein andermal zu euch zurück." So fuhr er ab von Ephesus. 
[18:22] Nach der Landung in Cäsarea ging er (nach Jerusalem) hinauf, begrüßte dort die Gemeinde und zog dann nach Antiochia hinab. 
[18:23] Nach einem kurzen Aufenthalt daselbst trat er eine neue Wanderung an: er durchzog das galatische Land und Phrygien von einem Ende bis zum anderen und stärkte alle Jünger im Glauben. Herbst 51 n.Chr. 
[18:24] Inzwischen war ein Jude, namens Apollos, aus Alexandria gebürtig, ein beredter Mann und wohlbewandert in der Schrift, nach Ephesus gekommen. 
[18:25] Der war über den "Weg des Herrn" unterrichtet, und glühend im Geist redete und lehrte er gründlich von Jesus, obwohl er nur die Taufe des Johannes kannte. 
[18:26] Dieser Mann begann in dem jüdischen Versammlungshaus mit Freimut zu predigen. Aquila und Priszilla, die ihn dort hörten, traten in Verkehr mit ihm und setzten ihm "Gottes Weg" noch gründlicher auseinander. 
[18:27] Als er dann die Absicht hatte, nach Achaja zu reisen, ermunterten ihn die Brüder (in Ephesus) dazu und schrieben den Jüngern (in Korinth), sie möchten ihn freundlich aufnehmen. Nach seiner Ankunft war er den Gläubigen durch Gottes Gnade zum großen Segen. 
[18:28] Denn in öffentlichen Unterredungen widerlegte er durch sein kräftiges Zeugnis die Einwürfe der Juden und wies aus der Schrift nach, daß Jesus der Messias sei. 
[19:1] Während sich Apollos in Korinth aufhielt, durchwanderte Paulus zunächst das gebirgige Binnenland (Kleinasiens) und kam dann an die Küste nach Ephesus. Dort fand er einige Jünger. Anf. 52 n.Chr. 
[19:2] Die fragte er: "Habt ihr den Heiligen Geist empfangen, nachdem ihr gläubig geworden seid?" Sie antworteten ihm: "Wir haben überhaupt noch nicht gehört, ob der Heilige Geist gekommen ist." 
[19:3] Da fragte er sie weiter: "Welche Taufe habt ihr denn empfangen?" Sie erwiderten: "Des Johannes Taufe." 
[19:4] Paulus sprach: "Johannes hat getauft mit einer Taufe, die von einer Sinnesänderung begleitet sein mußte, und er sagte dem Volk, sie sollten glauben an den, der nach ihm käme: an Jesus." 
[19:5] Als sie das hörten, ließen sie sich taufen in den Namen des Herrn Jesus. 
[19:6] Als ihnen dann Paulus die Hände auflegte, kam der Heilige Geist auf sie, und sie redeten in Zungen und weissagten. 
[19:7] Es waren ihrer im ganzen ungefähr zwölf Männer. 
[19:8] Paulus ging dann in das jüdische Versammlungshaus und predigte dort mit allem Freimut über Gottes Königreich. Drei Monate lang suchte er die Juden durch seine Reden zu überzeugen. 
[19:9] Als sich aber manche dagegen verstockten und, anstatt zu glauben, "den Weg" (des Herrn) vor der versammelten Gemeinde schmähten, da trennte er sich von ihnen. Er sonderte die Jünger (von der jüdischen Gemeinde) ab und hielt nun täglich (von der fünften bis zur zehnten Stunde) seine Lehrvorträge in dem Hörsaal eines gewissen Tyrannus. 
[19:10] Das dauerte zwei Jahre, so daß alle Bewohner Asiens, Juden sowohl wie Heiden, des Herrn Wort vernahmen. 
[19:11] Gott tat auch durch des Paulus Hände ganz ungewöhnliche Wunder: 
[19:12] sogar die Tücher, womit sich Paulus den Schweiß abgewischt, oder die Schürzen, die er bei der Arbeit getragen hatte, legte man auf die Kranken, die dann von ihren Leiden geheilt und von bösen Geistern befreit wurden. 
[19:13] Auch einige umherziehende jüdische Teufelsaustreiber versuchten bei solchen, die von bösen Geistern besessen waren, den Namen des Herrn Jesus anzurufen; sie gebrauchten dabei die Worte: "Ich beschwöre euch bei dem Jesus, den Paulus verkündigt." 
[19:14] So trieben es unter anderen die sieben Söhne eines Juden aus hohenpriesterlichem Geschlecht namens Skeuas. 
[19:15] Aber der böse Geist antwortete ihnen: "Jesus kenne ich, und von Paulus habe ich gehört; doch wer seid ihr?" 
[19:16] Damit sprang der Mensch, in dem der böse Geist war, auf sie los, überwältigte zwei von ihnen und mißhandelte sie so, daß sie ohne Kleider und voller Wunden aus dem Haus fliehen mußten. 
[19:17] Von diesem Vorfall hörten alle Juden und Heiden, die in Ephesus wohnten. Sie alle wurden von Schrecken ergriffen, und man fing an, den Namen des Herrn Jesus hoch zu ehren. 
[19:18] Nun kamen auch viele von denen, die schon früher gläubig geworden waren, und bekannten offen, was sie einst getrieben hatten. 
[19:19] Ja, nicht wenige von denen, die mit Zauberkünsten umgegangen waren, brachten ihre Zauberbücher herbei und verbrannten sie öffentlich. Als man ihren Wert berechnete, ergab sich der Betrag von fünfzigtausend Silberstücken. 
[19:20] In solcher Weise wuchs das Wort des Herrn mit Macht und erwies sich kräftig. 
[19:21] Nach diesen Ereignissen beschloß Paulus, über Mazedonien und Achaja nach Jerusalem zu reisen. "Wenn ich dort gewesen bin", so sprach er, "dann muß ich auch Rom sehen." 
[19:22] Er sandte zwei seiner Mitarbeiter, Timotheus und Erastus, nach Mazedonien voraus, während er selbst noch eine Zeitlang in Asien blieb. 
[19:23] Gerade damals entstand wegen der Lehre des Herrn ein großer Aufruhr. 
[19:24] Ein Silberschmied, mit Namen Demetrius, der in Silber kleine Nachbildungen des Tempels der Artemis verfertigte, verschaffte allen, die in diesem Erwerbszweig beschäftigt waren, einen nicht geringen Verdienst. 
[19:25] Eines Tages versammelte er diese Künstler und ihre Gehilfen und sprach zu ihnen: "Ihr wißt genau, wie einträglich unser Gewerbe ist. 
[19:26] Nun seht und hört ihr aber, wie dieser Paulus nicht nur in Ephesus, sondern fast in ganz Asien viele Leute durch seine Überredungskünste verführt hat, indem er behauptet: 'Das sind keine Götter, die man mit Händen macht!' 
[19:27] Doch nicht nur unser Gewerbe droht in Mißachtung zu kommen, sondern auch das Heiligtum der großen Göttin Artemis ist in Gefahr, sein ganzes Ansehen zu verlieren; ja die Herrlichkeit dieser Göttin, die ganz Asien und der Erdkreis mit Anbetung ehren, droht bald in den Staub zu sinken." 
[19:28] Bei diesen Worten gerieten sie in Wut und fingen an zu schreien: "Groß ist die Artemis der Epheser!" 
[19:29] Ja, die ganze Stadt geriet in Aufregung, und alles stürmte in die Schauburg. Dorthin wurden auch die Mazedonier Gajus und Aristarchus, des Paulus Reisegefährten, mitgeschleppt. 
[19:30] Auch Paulus selbst wollte sich unter das Volk begeben, aber die Jünger ließen ihn nicht gehen. 
[19:31] Sogar einige hohe Beamte, die ihm gewogen waren, sandten zu ihm und ließen ihn dringend bitten, sich nicht in die Schauburg zu wagen. 
[19:32] Die Menge schrie indessen weiter, der eine dies, der andere das; denn die Versammlung war ganz in Aufregung, und die meisten wußten überhaupt nicht, warum man zusammengekommen war. 
[19:33] Da ließ man aus der Volksmenge einen gewissen Alexander, den die Juden vorgeschoben hatten, auf die Bühne der Schauburg hinuntergehen. Alexander winkte mit der Hand und schickte sich an, seine Glaubensgenossen vor dem Volk zu verteidigen. 
[19:34] Als man aber merkte, daß er ein Jude war, da schrien alle aus einem Munde etwa zwei Stunden lang: "Groß ist die Artemis der Epheser!" 
[19:35] Der Stadtkanzler brachte endlich die Menge zur Ruhe und sprach: "Ihr Männer von Ephesus, wer in aller Welt wüßte nicht, daß die Stadt Ephesus die Hüterin des Tempels der großen Artemis und ihres vom Himmel gefallenen Bildes ist? 
[19:36] Das kann doch niemand bestreiten. Deshalb solltet ihr ruhig bleiben und nichts Unbedachtes tun. 
[19:37] Ihr habt diese Männer da hergeführt, die doch weder Tempelräuber sind noch unsere Göttin lästern. 
[19:38] Haben aber Demetrius und seine Berufsgenossen wider jemand eine Beschwerde, nun, so gibt's Gerichtstage und Statthalter: da mögen sie einander verklagen! 
[19:39] Und habt ihr sonst noch Anträge, so sollen die in der gesetzlichen Volksversammlung erledigt werden. 
[19:40] Wir laufen nämlich Gefahr, daß man uns des heutigen Vorfalls wegen als Aufrührer anklagt; denn es liegt kein Grund vor, womit wir diesen Auflauf rechtfertigen könnten." Mit diesen Worten löste er die Versammlung auf. 
[19:41] 
[20:1] Als sich die Unruhe gelegt hatte, rief Paulus die Jünger zusammen; er hielt eine Ansprache an sie, sagte ihnen Lebewohl und zog aus nach Mazedonien. Anf. Sommer 54 n.Chr. 
[20:2] Er reiste durch dieses Land und ermunterte die Jünger mit reichem Zuspruch. Dann begab er sich nach Griechenland Dezbr. 54 n.Chr. 
[20:3] und hielt sich dort drei Monate auf. Weil aber die Juden, als er sich nach Syrien einschiffen wollte, einen Anschlag auf sein Leben vorhatten, beschloß er, den Rückweg durch Mazedonien zu nehmen. 
[20:4] Bis Asien begleiteten ihn (durch Mazedonien) Sopater, der Sohn des Pyrrhus, aus Beröa, Aristarchus und Sekundus aus Thessalonich, Gajus aus Derbe und Timotheus, sowie Tychikus und Trophimus aus Asien. 
[20:5] Die beiden letzten kamen erst später hinzu und erwarteten uns in Troas. 
[20:6] Wir anderen fuhren nach den Tagen der ungesäuerten Brote von Philippi ab und trafen sie nach einer fünftägigen Fahrt in Troas, wo wir uns sieben Tage aufhielten. Gleich nach Ostern 55 n.Chr. 
[20:7] Am ersten Wochentag kamen wir zusammen, um das Brot zu brechen. Vorher hielt Paulus, der am nächsten Morgen abreisen wollte, eine Ansprache an die Jünger und dehnte seine Rede bis Mitternacht aus. 
[20:8] In dem Obersaal, wo wir versammelt waren, brannten viele Lampen. 
[20:9] Ein Jüngling mit Namen Eutychus saß auf der Fensterbank und fiel während der langen Predigt des Paulus in tiefen Schlaf. Dabei verlor er das Gleichgewicht und stürzte aus dem dritten Stockwerk in die Tiefe. Als man ihn aufhob, hielt man ihn für tot. 
[20:10] Paulus eilte hinab, beugte sich über ihn, nahm ihn in seine Arme und sprach: "Seid unbesorgt, seine Seele ist noch in ihm." 
[20:11] Dann ging er wieder hinauf und brach das Brot (bei dem Mahl des Herrn). Hierauf nahm er einen Imbiß und unterhielt sich noch lange mit den Brüdern bis zur Morgendämmerung. Da nahm er Abschied. 
[20:12] Den Jüngling aber brachte man jetzt lebendig nach Hause. Das war für alle ein großer Trost. 
[20:13] Wir anderen waren schon vorher auf das Schiff gegangen und fuhren nun ab nach Assus, wo wir auch Paulus an Bord nehmen sollten; denn so hatte er es bestimmt, weil er selbst den Weg zu Fuß machen wollte. 
[20:14] Als er uns in Assus traf, nahmen wir ihn an Bord und fuhren nach Mitylene. 
[20:15] Von da ging die Reise weiter. Am folgenden Tag ankerten wir Chios gegenüber, tags darauf erreichten wir Samos, und am nächsten Tag kamen wir nach Milet. 
[20:16] Paulus hatte sich nämlich entschlossen, an Ephesus vorbeizufahren, um keine Zeit in Asien zu verlieren. Denn er eilte, um wo möglich am Pfingsttag in Jerusalem zu sein. 
[20:17] Von Milet sandte er Botschaft nach Ephesus und berief die Ältesten der dortigen Gemeinde zu sich. 
[20:18] Als sie bei ihm versammelt waren, sprach er zu ihnen: "Ihr wißt, wie ich seit dem ersten Tag, wo ich nach Asien gekommen bin, und während meines ganzen Aufenthaltes daselbst unter euch gelebt habe: 
[20:19] Ich habe dem Herrn gedient in aller Demut, ja unter Tränen und Anfechtungen, die mir durch die Anschläge der Juden widerfahren sind. 
[20:20] Nichts von dem, was euch nützlich sein konnte, habe ich verschwiegen, wenn ich euch öffentlich und einzeln in den Häusern predigte und euch unterwies. 
[20:21] Juden und Heiden habe ich dringend ermahnt, sich zu Gott zu bekehren und an unseren Herrn Jesus Christus zu glauben. 
[20:22] Nun bin ich, in meinem Geist dazu getrieben, auf dem Weg nach Jerusalem. Ich weiß nicht, was mir dort begegnen wird. 
[20:23] Nur soviel ist gewiß: der Heilige Geist weist mich in allen Städten eindringlich darauf hin, daß Gefangenschaft und Leiden mich erwarten. 
[20:24] Doch selbst an meinem Leben liegt mir nichts, wenn ich nur meinen Lauf (mit Freuden) vollenden und jenen Dienst zum Abschluß bringen kann, den ich empfangen habe von dem Herrn Jesus: die Heilsbotschaft der Gnade Gottes zu bezeugen. 
[20:25] Und nun, ich weiß: ihr alle, bei denen ich mit der Verkündigung des Königreichs geweilt, ihr sollt mein Angesicht nicht länger sehen. 
[20:26] Darum erkläre ich euch heute feierlich: Ich bin ganz rein von euer aller Blut. 
[20:27] Denn ich habe euch in meiner Predigt nichts verschwiegen, sondern euch den Ratschluß Gottes in seinem ganzen Umfang kundgemacht. 
[20:28] So habt denn acht auf euch und auf die ganze Herde, über die euch der Heilige Geist als Bischöfe gesetzt hat, daß ihr des Herrn Kirche weidet, die er sich durch sein eigen Blut erworben hat! 
[20:29] (Denn) ich weiß: nach meinem Weggang werden reißende Wölfe unter euch einbrechen, die die Herde nicht verschonen. 
[20:30] Ja, aus eurer eigenen Mitte werden Männer auftreten, die verkehrte Dinge lehren, um die Jünger für sich zu gewinnen. 
[20:31] Darum wacht und denkt daran, daß ich drei Jahre Tag und Nacht nicht abgelassen habe, jeden einzelnen von euch unter Tränen zu vermahnen! 
[20:32] Und nun befehle ich euch Gott und dem Wort seiner Gnade: er vermag euch zu erbauen und euch das Erbteil zu verleihen zugleich mit allen, die geheiligt sind. 
[20:33] Silber, Gold und Kleider habe ich mir von niemand geben lassen. 
[20:34] Ihr wißt ja selbst, daß diese meine Hände für meinen und meiner Mitarbeiter Unterhalt gesorgt haben. 
[20:35] Mein Beispiel hat euch stets gezeigt, wie man durch solche Arbeit im Schweiß seines Angesichts auch noch die Mittel haben muß, die Hilfsbedürftigen zu unterstützen, eingedenk der Worte des Herrn Jesus, der ja selbst gesagt hat: 'Geben ist beglückender als Nehmen.'" 
[20:36] Nach diesen Worten kniete er mit ihnen allen zum Gebet nieder. 
[20:37] Unter lautem Weinen fielen alle Paulus um den Hals und küßten ihn. 
[20:38] Am meisten betrübte sie sein Wort, sie würden sein Angesicht nicht weiter sehen. Dann brachten sie ihn auf das Schiff. 
[21:1] Als wir uns endlich von ihnen losgerissen hatten und in See gegangen waren, fuhren wir geradewegs nach Kos. Tags darauf kamen wir nach Rhodus und von da nach Patara. 
[21:2] Hier fanden wir ein Schiff, das nach Phönizien fahren wollte; da gingen wir an Bord und segelten ab. 
[21:3] Als wir Zypern zu Gesicht bekamen, ließen wir es links liegen, fuhren auf Syrien zu und gingen in Tyrus vor Anker. Denn dort sollte das Schiff seine Ladung löschen. 
[21:4] Wir suchten in Tyrus die Jünger auf und blieben sieben Tage bei ihnen. Die Jünger warnten Paulus durch den Geist, wiederholt vor der Reise nach Jerusalem. 
[21:5] Als die sieben Tage des Aufenthaltes zu Ende waren, schickten wir uns zur Weiterreise an. Alle Jünger mit Weib und Kind begleiteten uns bis vor die Stadt. Am Strand knieten wir nieder zum Gebet. 
[21:6] Dann nahmen wir Abschied voneinander und bestiegen unser Schiff, während die Jünger nach Hause zurückkehrten. 
[21:7] Unsere Seereise war zu Ende, als wir von Tyrus aus in Ptolemais landeten. Dort begrüßten wir die Brüder und blieben einen Tag bei ihnen. 
[21:8] Tags darauf machten wir uns auf den Weg nach Cäsarea. Dort gingen wir in das Haus des Evangelisten Philippus, eines von den Sieben, und blieben bei ihm. 
[21:9] Der hatte vier Töchter; die waren Jungfrauen und hatten die Gabe der Weissagung. 
[21:10] Wir waren schon einige Tage in Cäsarea, als von Judäa ein Prophet, mit Namen Agabus, dort ankam. 
[21:11] Der besuchte uns und ergriff bei dieser Gelegenheit den Gürtel des Paulus, band sich damit Füße und Hände und sprach dabei die Worte: "Dies sagt der Heilige Geist: 'So werden die Juden in Jerusalem den Eigentümer dieses Gürtels binden und ihn den Heiden überliefern.'" 
[21:12] Als wir dies hörten, baten wir und die Brüder in Cäsarea Paulus dringend, er möge nicht nach Jerusalem hinaufziehen. 
[21:13] Da antwortete er: "Was weint ihr denn und brecht mir das Herz? Ich bin bereit, mich in Jerusalem für den Namen des Herrn Jesus nicht nur binden zu lassen, sondern sogar zu sterben." 
[21:14] Weil er sich nicht umstimmen lassen wollte, redeten wir ihm nicht weiter zu und sprachen: "Des Herrn Wille geschehe!" 
[21:15] Einige Tage später machten wir uns reisefertig und traten die Wanderung nach Jerusalem an. 
[21:16] Auch einige Jünger aus Cäsarea zogen mit uns. Die brachten uns zu einem alten Jünger aus Zypern, namens Mnason, bei dem wir wohnen sollten. 
[21:17] Bei unserer Ankunft in Jerusalem hießen uns die Brüder herzlich willkommen. 
[21:18] Tags darauf ging Paulus mit uns zu Jakobus, bei dem sich alle Ältesten versammelt hatten. 
[21:19] Paulus begrüßte sie und erzählte ihnen ausführlich und genau, was Gott durch seinen Dienst unter den Heiden gewirkt habe. 
[21:20] Als die Ältesten das hörten, priesen sie Gott. Dann aber sprachen sie zu Paulus: "Du siehst, Bruder: die gläubiggewordenen Juden zählen nach Zehntausenden; aber alle eifern noch für das Gesetz. 
[21:21] Nun hat man ihnen von dir erzählt, du fordertest alle Juden, die unter den Heiden leben, zum Abfall von Mose auf und rietest ihnen, sie sollten ihre Kinder nicht beschneiden und nicht nach den Vorschriften des Gesetzes leben. 
[21:22] Was ist da zu tun? Es wird ja sicher ruchbar, daß du hier bist. 
[21:23] Tu deshalb, was wir dir raten: Wir haben hier vier Männer, die ein Gelübde einlösen müssen. 
[21:24] Denen schließe du dich an, nimm auch ein Gelübde auf dich und trage die Kosten für sie, damit sie sich das Haupthaar scheren lassen können! Dann werden alle einsehen, daß an dem, was sie von dir gehört, nichts Wahres ist, sondern daß auch du gewissenhaft nach dem Gesetz wandelst. 
[21:25] Was aber die gläubig gewordenen Heiden betrifft, so haben wir ja bestimmt und ihnen dies schriftlich mitgeteilt, daß sie meiden sollen den Genuß von Götzenopferfleisch, das Blut geschlachteter Tiere, das Fleisch von Tieren, die man in Schlingen fängt, und die Ehen mit Heiden." 
[21:26] Da ließ Paulus die Männer zu sich kommen und schloß sich ihrem Gelübde an. Tags darauf ging er in den Tempel und ließ dort anmelden, daß die Tage ihres Gelübdes zu Ende seien, und er blieb im Tempel, bis das vorgeschriebene Opfer für jeden von ihnen dargebracht war. 
[21:27] Als die sieben Tage ihrem Ende nahten, erblickten die Juden aus Asien Paulus im Tempel. Da brachten sie die ganze Volksmenge in Aufruhr, legten die Hände an ihn 
[21:28] und riefen laut: "Zu Hilfe, ihr Männer Israels! Dies ist der Mensch, der überall vor aller Welt gegen unser Volk und Gesetz und gegen diese Stätte redet. Und obendrein hat er noch Heiden in den Tempel gebracht und diese heilige Stätte entweiht." 
[21:29] Sie hatten nämlich Trophimus aus Ephesus vorher mit ihm in der Stadt gesehen und meinten nun, Paulus habe ihn in den Tempel geführt. 
[21:30] Die ganze Stadt geriet in Aufregung, und es entstand ein Volksauflauf. Paulus ward ergriffen, und man schleppte ihn aus dem Tempel, dessen Türen sofort geschlossen wurden. 
[21:31] Schon wollten sie Paulus töten, als dem Obersten der römischen Truppe gemeldet wurde, ganz Jerusalem sei in Aufruhr. 
[21:32] Der Oberst eilte sofort mit einer Abteilung Soldaten und einigen Hauptleuten zu dem Tempelplatz hinab. Bei dem Anblick des Befehlshabers und seiner Soldaten hörte die Menge auf, Paulus zu schlagen. 
[21:33] Der Oberst kam herbei, ließ Paulus ergreifen und befahl, ihn mit zwei Ketten zu binden. Zugleich fragte er, wer er sei und was er getan habe. 
[21:34] Die einen im Volk riefen dies, die anderen das. Weil er bei dem Lärm nichts Sicheres erfahren konnte, befahl er, ihn in das Lager zu führen. 
[21:35] Als Paulus an die Stufen kam, drang das Volk so wütend auf ihn ein, daß er von den Soldaten getragen werden mußte. 
[21:36] Denn die Menge folgte und schrie: "Er soll sterben!" 
[21:37] In dem Augenblick, wo Paulus in das Lager geführt werden sollte, sprach er (auf griechisch) zu dem Obersten: "Darf ich ein Wort zu dir reden?" Der antwortete (voll Erstaunen): "Du kannst Griechisch? 
[21:38] Du bist also nicht der Jude aus Ägypten, der vor einiger Zeit den Aufstand erregt und die viertausend Dolchmänner in die Wüste hinausgeführt hat?" 
[21:39] Paulus erwiderte: "Nein, ich bin ein Jude aus Tarsus, ein Bürger dieser bekannten Stadt Ziliziens. Erlaube mir, bitte, zu dem Volk zu reden!" 
[21:40] Als der Befehlshaber dies gestattete, trat Paulus oben auf die Stufen und winkte dem Volk mit der Hand. Da trat ein lautloses Schweigen ein, und er redete nun zu ihnen in der aramäischen Landessprache. 
[22:1] "Liebe Brüder und Väter", so begann er, "vernehmt, was ich euch jetzt zu meiner Verteidigung zu sagen habe!" 
[22:2] Als sie hörten, daß er aramäisch zu ihnen redete, wurden sie noch stiller. Dann fuhr er fort: 
[22:3] "Ich bin ein Jude, geboren zu Tarsus in Zilizien; aber erzogen bin ich hier in dieser Stadt und habe zu den Füßen Gamaliels streng nach dem Gesetz unserer Väter meine Ausbildung empfangen, so daß ich voll Eifer war für Gott, wie ihr es alle heute seid. 
[22:4] Darum habe ich auch diese Richtung bis auf den Tod verfolgt, so daß ich Männer und Frauen in Ketten schlagen und ins Gefängnis werfen ließ. 
[22:5] Das können mir der Hohepriester und der ganze Hohe Rat bezeugen. Denn von ihnen habe ich auch Briefe an unsere Brüder in Damaskus empfangen; und so begab ich mich dorthin, um auch alle die in jener Stadt wohnten, in Ketten zur Bestrafung nach Jerusalem zu führen. 
[22:6] Als ich mich nun auf meiner Reise Damaskus näherte, da umstrahlte mich plötzlich gegen Mittag vom Himmel ein helles Licht. 
[22:7] Ich fiel zu Boden und hörte eine Stimme zu mir sagen: 'Saul, Saul, warum verfolgst du mich?' 
[22:8] 'Wer bist du, Herr?', so fragte ich. Er antwortete mir: 'Ich bin Jesus von Nazaret, den du verfolgst.' 
[22:9] Meine Begleiter sahen zwar das Licht, aber die Worte dessen, der zu mir redete, hörten sie nicht. 
[22:10] Da fragte ich: 'Herr, was soll ich tun?' Der Herr antwortete mir: 'Steh auf und gehe nach Damaskus! Da wird man dir alles sagen, was dir zu tun bestimmt ist.' 
[22:11] Weil ich nun nicht sehen konnte, da mich das Licht geblendet hatte, nahmen mich meine Gefährten bei der Hand, und so kam ich nach Damaskus. 
[22:12] Dort lebte ein gewisser Ananias, ein frommer Mann, der das Gesetz treu erfüllte und von allen Juden in der Stadt hoch geachtet wurde. 
[22:13] Der kam zu mir, trat an mich heran und sprach zu mir: 'Bruder Saul, sieh mich an!' In demselben Augenblick konnte ich wieder sehen und blickte ihn an. 
[22:14] Er aber fuhr fort: 'Der Gott unserer Väter hat dich dazu erwählt, seinen Willen zu erkennen, den Gerechten zu sehen und die Worte seines Mundes zu vernehmen. 
[22:15] Denn du sollst in seinem Auftrag allen Menschen Zeugnis geben von dem, was du gesehen und gehört. 
[22:16] Und nun, was zögerst du? Steh auf, laß dich taufen und dich dadurch von deinen Sünden rein waschen, indem du seinen Namen anrufst!' 
[22:17] Als ich dann nach Jerusalem zurückgekehrt war und im Tempel betete, geriet ich in Verzückung. 
[22:18] Da sah ich ihn, und er sprach zu mir: 'Eile und verlaß Jerusalem so schnell als möglich! Denn sie werden von dir kein Zeugnis über mich annehmen.' 
[22:19] Ich antwortete: 'Herr, sie wissen doch, daß gerade ich deine Gläubigen habe ins Gefängnis werfen und sie in den Versammlungshäusern habe geißeln lassen. 
[22:20] Und als das Blut deines Zeugen Stephanus vergossen wurde, war ich auch dabei zugegen; ich hatte daran Wohlgefallen und verwahrte die Kleider derer, die ihn töteten.' 
[22:21] Da sprach er zu mir: 'Zieh hin, ich will dich in die Ferne zu den Heiden senden...'" 
[22:22] Bis dahin hatten sie ihn ruhig angehört. Bei den letzten Worten aber fingen sie an zu rufen: "Weg mit solchem Menschen von der Erde; er darf nicht länger leben!" 
[22:23] Als sie so schrien und dabei ihre Oberkleider auszogen und Staub in die Luft warfen, 
[22:24] ließ der Oberst Paulus in das Lager führen. Zugleich gebot er, ihn peinlich zu verhören; denn er wollte wissen, warum die Menge so wütend gegen ihn geschrien hatte. 
[22:25] Als Paulus schon festgebunden war und die Geißelung beginnen sollte, fragte er den aufsichtführenden Hauptmann: "Dürft ihr denn einen römischen Bürger geißeln, und noch dazu ohne richterliches Verhör?" 
[22:26] Auf diese Worte hin eilte der Hauptmann zu dem Obersten, um ihm zu berichten, und sprach zu ihm: "Was willst du tun? Dieser Mann ist ja römischer Bürger." 
[22:27] Da kam der Oberst und sprach zu Paulus: "Sage mir, bist du römischer Bürger?" 
[22:28] Er antwortete: "Ja." Der Oberst fuhr fort: "Ich habe mir das Bürgerrecht für viel Geld erworben." Paulus erwiderte: "Und ich bin römischer Bürger durch Geburt." 
[22:29] Die Soldaten, die ihn hatten geißeln wollen, traten jetzt sofort von ihm zurück. Auch der Oberst war in Sorge, weil er nun wußte, daß er einen römischen Bürger zur Geißelung hatte binden lassen. 
[22:30] Da er aber genau erfahren wollte, welche Anklagen die Juden gegen ihn vorzubringen hätten, ließ er ihm tags darauf die Fesseln abnehmen und gebot, die Hohenpriester und der ganze Hohe Rat sollten sich versammeln. Dann ließ er Paulus hinabführen und in ihrer Mitte erscheinen. 
[23:1] Paulus sah den Hohen Rat mit festem Blick an und sprach: "Liebe Brüder, bis heute bin ich stets mit reinem Gewissen vor Gott gewandelt." 
[23:2] Bei diesen Worten befahl der Hohepriester Ananias den anwesenden Dienern, Paulus auf den Mund zu schlagen. 
[23:3] Da sprach Paulus zu ihm: "Gott wird dich schlagen, du getünchte Wand! Du sitzt da, um mich nach dem Gesetz zu richten, und läßt mich schlagen im Widerspruch mit dem Gesetz?" 
[23:4] "Was? Du schmähst den Hohenpriester Gottes?", so fragen ihn die Diener. 
[23:5] "Brüder", versetzte Paulus, "ich habe nicht gewußt, daß hier ein Hoherpriester ist; steht doch geschrieben: Gegen einen Oberen deines Volkes sollst du nicht übel reden." 
[23:6] Da nun Paulus wußte, daß der Hohe Rat teils aus Sadduzäern, teils aus Pharisäern bestand, rief er laut: "Brüder, ich bin ein Pharisäer, und auch meine Ahnen waren Pharisäer. Wegen meiner Hoffnung auf die Totenauferstehung stehe ich hier vor Gericht." 
[23:7] Diese Worte erregten einen heftigen Zwist zwischen den Pharisäern und den Sadduzäern, so daß sich die Versammlung spaltete. 
[23:8] - Die Sadduzäer leugnen nämlich die Auferstehung und das Dasein von Engeln und Geistern, während die Pharisäer beides anerkennen. — 
[23:9] Es erhob sich ein lautes Geschrei. Endlich standen einige Schriftgelehrte der pharisäischen Partei von ihren Sitzen auf und sagten in scharfem Ton: "Wir finden an diesem Menschen nichts Böses. Hat aber ein Geist oder ein Engel mit ihm geredet (nun, was läßt sich dann dagegen sagen?)." 
[23:10] Da der Oberst fürchtete, Paulus könne von den Versammelten bei dem heftigen Streit zerrissen werden, ließ er eine Abteilung Soldaten von der Burg kommen, die Paulus mit Gewalt aus ihrer Mitte führen und in das Lager bringen mußten. 
[23:11] Die Nacht darauf trat der Herr zu ihm und sprach: "Sei getrost! Denn wie du in Jerusalem von mir Zeugnis abgelegt hast, so mußt du auch in Rom mein Zeuge sein." 
[23:12] Am anderen Morgen taten sich einige Juden zusammen und verpflichteten sich mit schrecklichen Eiden, sie wollten nichts essen und trinken, bis sie Paulus getötet hätten. 
[23:13] Ihrer waren mehr als vierzig, die sich so verschworen. 
[23:14] Diese Männer gingen zu den Hohenpriestern und Ältesten und sprachen: "Wir haben uns feierlich verschworen, nichts zu genießen, bis wir Paulus getötet haben. 
[23:15] Werdet ihr nun zusammen mit dem Hohen Rat bei dem Obersten vorstellig, daß er ihn zu euch führen lasse, als wolltet ihr seinen Fall noch genauer untersuchen! Dann werden wir bereitstehen und ihn töten, noch ehe er hierher kommt." 
[23:16] Des Paulus Schwestersohn hörte von diesem Anschlag. Er begab sich in das Lager, trat ein und teilte Paulus alles mit. 
[23:17] Da ließ Paulus einen der Hauptleute rufen und sprach zu ihm: "Führe diesen Jüngling zu dem Obersten; denn er hat ihm etwas mitzuteilen." 
[23:18] Der brachte ihn zu dem Obersten und meldete: "Der Gefangene Paulus hat mich zu sich rufen lassen und mich gebeten, diesen Jüngling hier zu dir zu bringen, da er dir etwas zu sagen habe." 
[23:19] Der Oberst nahm den Jüngling bei der Hand, zog ihn beiseite und fragte ihn: "Was hast du mir zu melden?" 
[23:20] Er antwortete: "Die Juden sind übereingekommen, dich zu bitten, Paulus morgen vor dem Hohen Rat erscheinen zu lassen, als wollte der seinen Fall noch genauer prüfen. 
[23:21] Geh aber nicht darauf ein! Denn über vierzig Männer aus ihrer Mitte wollen ihm auflauern. Sie haben sich feierlich verschworen, nichts zu essen und zu trinken, bis sie ihn ermordet haben. Sie stehen jetzt schon dazu bereit und warten nur noch auf deine Zustimmung." 
[23:22] Der Oberst entließ den Jüngling und schärfte ihm ein: "Plaudere es nirgends aus, daß du mir diese Anzeige gemacht hast!" 
[23:23] Dann ließ er zwei Hauptleute rufen und befahl ihnen: "Haltet von der dritten Nachtstunde an Soldaten für einen Marsch nach Cäsarea bereit, und zwar siebzig Reiter und zweihundert Lanzenträger!" 
[23:24] Auch stellte er Reittiere für Paulus, damit er wohlbehalten zu dem Statthalter Felix käme. 
[23:25] Zugleich schrieb er diesem einen Brief folgenden Inhalts: 
[23:26] "Klaudius Lysias entbietet dem hochedlen Statthalter Felix seinen Gruß. 
[23:27] Der Mann, den ich hier sende, ist von den Juden festgenommen worden; und gerade in dem Augenblick, wo sie ihn töten wollten, erschien ich mit meiner Truppe und entriß ihn ihren Händen, weil ich erfahren hatte, daß er ein römischer Bürger sei. 
[23:28] Da ich nun genau wissen wollte, was sie ihm Schuld gaben, so ließ ich ihn in ihre Ratsversammlung führen. 
[23:29] Da fand ich denn: die Anklage gegen ihn hing mit Fragen ihres Gesetzes zusammen; doch wurde ihm nichts zur Last gelegt, was den Tod oder Gefängnis verdiente. 
[23:30] Weil mir nun aber angezeigt worden ist, daß sie einen Anschlag gegen den Mann vorhaben, so habe ich ihn aus ihrer Mitte entfernt und sende ihn dir zu. Ich habe auch seinen Anklägern befohlen, ihre Beschuldigungen gegen ihn bei dir vorzubringen. Lebe wohl!" 
[23:31] Die Soldaten führten den Befehl aus: sie nahmen Paulus mit sich und brachten ihn noch in derselben Nacht bis Antipatris. 
[23:32] Am nächsten Tag ließen sie die Reiter allein mit ihm weiterziehen, während sie selbst in das Lager zurückkehrten. 
[23:33] Die Reiter übergaben nach ihrer Ankunft in Cäsarea dem Statthalter das Schreiben und führten ihm auch Paulus vor. 
[23:34] Der Statthalter las das Schreiben und fragte Paulus, aus welcher Provinz er stamme. Als er hörte: "Aus Zilizien", 
[23:35] sagte er: "Ich will dich genau verhören, wenn auch deine Ankläger erschienen sind." Dann befahl er, Paulus solle in dem Palast des Herodes in Haft gehalten werden. 
[24:1] Fünf Tage später kam der Hohepriester Ananias mit einigen Gliedern des Hohen Rates und einem Anwalt, namens Tertullus, nach Cäsarea, um vor dem Statthalter die Anklage gegen Paulus zu erheben. Bald nach Pfingsten 55 
[24:2] Als Paulus vorgeführt war, begann Tertullus seine Anklagerede. 
[24:3] "Daß wir durch deine Fürsorge in tiefem Frieden leben", so sprach er, "und daß durch deine Umsicht bei diesem Volk immer und überall Verbesserungen eingeführt werden, dies, hochedler Felix, erkennen wir mit aufrichtiger Dankbarkeit an. 
[24:4] Um dich aber nicht lange zu belästigen, bitte ich dich: Schenke uns nur einen Augenblick geneigtes Gehör! 
[24:5] Dieser Mann hier — so haben wir erkannt — ist eine Pest; er ist ein Friedenstörer unter allen Juden überall im Reich und ein Hauptführer der Partei der Nazarener. 
[24:6] Er hat sogar versucht, den Tempel zu entweihen; doch dabei haben wir ihn festgenommen. 
[24:7]  
[24:8] Wenn du ihn jetzt verhörst, so kannst du auch aus seinem Mund alles dies erfahren, dessen wir ihn beschuldigen." 
[24:9] Dieser Anklage schlossen sich auch die Juden an und versicherten, daß es sich so verhalte. 
[24:10] Auf einen Wink des Statthalters ergriff dann Paulus das Wort. "Da ich weiß", so hob er an, "daß du seit vielen Jahren Richter bist für dieses Volk, so habe ich guten Mut, mich zu verteidigen. 
[24:11] Du kannst dich davon überzeugen, daß nicht mehr als zwölf Tage vergangen sind, seit ich in Jerusalem angekommen bin, um dort anzubeten. 
[24:12] Weder im Tempel noch in den jüdischen Versammlungshäusern noch in der Stadt hat man mich mit irgend jemand einen Wortstreit führen oder einen Volksauflauf erregen sehen. 
[24:13] Auch sind sie nicht imstande, dir das zu beweisen, dessen sie mich jetzt beschuldigen. 
[24:14] Doch dies gebe ich zu: Nach einer Lehre, die sie als Ketzerei bezeichnen, diene ich dem Gott meiner Väter. Dabei glaube ich alles, was im Gesetz und in den Propheten geschrieben steht, 
[24:15] und habe im Vertrauen auf Gott dieselbe Hoffnung wie auch sie: daß die Gerechten und die Ungerechten auferstehen werden. 
[24:16] Darum bemühe ich mich auch, vor Gott und Menschen allezeit ein unbeflecktes Gewissen zu haben. 
[24:17] Nach Ablauf mehrerer Jahre bin ich nun gekommen, um meinem Volk Liebesgaben zu bringen und Opfer zu verrichten. 
[24:18] Als ich dann nach einem Gelübde, das ich übernommen hatte, mit den Opfern im Tempel beschäftigt war, und zwar ohne Auflauf zu erregen oder Lärm, da sahen mich einige Juden aus Asien. 
[24:19] Die hätten hier vor dir erscheinen und mich verklagen sollen, wenn sie etwas gegen mich vorzubringen hätten. 
[24:20] Oder es mögen auch die Männer selbst, die hier gegenwärtig sind, sich äußern, welch Vergehen sie bei mir ermittelt haben, während ich als Angeklagter vor dem Hohen Rat stand. 
[24:21] Es könnte sich hier nur um das eine Wort handeln, das ich in der Versammlung ausgerufen habe: 'Wegen der Auferstehung der Toten stehe ich heute vor euerm Gericht.'" 
[24:22] Hier brach Felix, der ganz genau wußte, was es mit der (christlichen) Lehre auf sich hatte, die Verhandlung ab und vertagte die Entscheidung, indem er zu den Anklägern sagte: "Wenn der Oberst Lysias herkommt, so will ich eure Sache untersuchen." 
[24:23] Zugleich gab er dem Hauptmann den Befehl, Paulus solle in Haft gehalten werden, aber keine Fesseln tragen, und seinen Freunden solle es nicht verboten sein, ihm Liebesdienste zu erweisen. 
[24:24] Einige Tage später kam Felix mit seiner Frau Drusilla, einer Jüdin, (in das Gefängnis). Er ließ Paulus rufen und hörte ihn über den Glauben an Christus Jesus reden. 
[24:25] Als aber Paulus auf Gerechtigkeit und Enthaltsamkeit und das zukünftige Gericht zu sprechen kam, da geriet Felix in Schrecken und sagte: "Für diesmal kannst du gehen; bei passender Gelegenheit will ich dich wieder entbieten." 
[24:26] Zugleich hoffte er, Paulus würde ihm Geld geben. Deshalb entbot er ihn auch öfter zu sich und unterhielt sich mit ihm. 
[24:27] Nach Ablauf von zwei Jahren erhielt Felix den Porcius Festus zum Nachfolger. Da sich Felix die Juden zu Dank verpflichten wollte, so ließ er Paulus in Ketten im Gefängnis. Sommer 57 n.Chr. 
[25:1] Drei Tage nach der Ankunft in seiner Provinz begab sich Festus von Cäsarea nach Jerusalem. 
[25:2] Dort trugen ihm die Hohenpriester und die angesehenen Juden ihre Klage gegen Paulus vor. 
[25:3] In feindlicher Gesinnung gegen Paulus baten sie dann Festus um die Gunst, er möge ihn wieder nach Jerusalem senden. Denn sie wollten ihn unterwegs überfallen und ermorden lassen. 
[25:4] Festus antwortete darauf, Paulus sei in Haft zu Cäsarea, und er selbst müsse bald dahin zurückkehren. 
[25:5] "Dann können", fuhr er fort, "die Einflußreichsten unter euch mit mir ziehen, und wenn der Mann etwas Ungehöriges begangen hat, so mögen sie die Klage gegen ihn erheben." 
[25:6] Als er sich höchstens acht bis zehn Tage in Jerusalem aufgehalten hatte, kehrte er nach Cäsarea zurück. Tags darauf setzte er sich auf den Richterstuhl und ließ Paulus vorführen. 
[25:7] Als dieser eintrat, umringten ihn die Juden, die von Jerusalem gekommen waren, und erhoben viele schwere Beschuldigungen, die sie nicht beweisen konnten. 
[25:8] Dagegen verteidigte sich Paulus; er erklärte: "Weder gegen das Gesetz der Juden noch gegen den Tempel noch gegen den Kaiser habe ich mich vergangen." 
[25:9] Festus, der sich die Juden zu Dank verpflichten wollte, fragte Paulus: "Willst du nach Jerusalem gehen und dort in meiner Gegenwart in bezug auf diese Klagepunkte abgeurteilt werden?" 
[25:10] Paulus erwiderte: "Ich gehöre vor des Kaisers Richterstuhl; da muß ich abgeurteilt werden. Den Juden habe ich kein Unrecht zugefügt, das weißt du auch sehr gut. 
[25:11] Bin ich nun wirklich schuldig, und habe ich eine Tat begangen, die den Tod verdient, so will ich auch gern diese Strafe leiden. Wenn mich aber diese Männer hier ungerecht beschuldigen, so darf mich niemand nur aus Gefälligkeit gegen sie ihnen preisgeben. Ich lege Berufung an den Kaiser ein." 
[25:12] Als sich Festus mit seinen Ratgebern besprochen hatte, entschied er: "Auf den Kaiser hast du dich berufen, zum Kaiser sollst du ziehen!" 
[25:13] Einige Tage später kamen der König Agrippa und Bernike nach Cäsarea, um Festus ihre Aufwartung zu machen. 
[25:14] Da sie sich einige Zeit dort aufhielten, setzte Festus dem König den Fall des Paulus auseinander. "Ich habe hier", so sprach er, "einen Mann, den Felix als Gefangenen zurückgelassen hat. 
[25:15] Bei meinem Aufenthalt in Jerusalem führten die Hohenpriester und die Ältesten der Juden Klage gegen ihn und verlangten seine Verurteilung. 
[25:16] Ich erwiderte ihnen, es sei nicht Sitte bei den Römern, jemand nur aus Gefälligkeit gegen andere zu bestrafen, ohne daß der Beklagte seinen Klägern gegenübergestellt worden sei und Gelegenheit gehabt habe, sich gegen die Anklage zu verteidigen. 
[25:17] Sie sind dann mit hierhergekommen; und da habe ich mich ohne Aufschub schon am nächsten Tag auf den Richterstuhl gesetzt und den Mann vorführen lassen. 
[25:18] Die Ankläger aber, die gegen ihn auftraten, gaben ihm keine Freveltat schuld, wie ich vermutet hatte, 
[25:19] sondern sie stritten nur mit ihm über einige Fragen ihres besonderen Glaubens und über einen gewissen Jesus, der gestorben ist, und von dem Paulus behauptete, er lebe. 
[25:20] Weil ich mir nun keinen Rat wußte, wie ich die Angelegenheit entscheiden sollte, so fragte ich Paulus, ob er nach Jerusalem gehen und sich dort in dieser Sache aburteilen lassen wolle. 
[25:21] Da forderte er, daß seine Angelegenheit der Entscheidung der kaiserlichen Majestät vorbehalten bleibe, und so habe ich denn befohlen, ihn in Haft zu lassen, bis ich ihn zum Kaiser senden kann." 
[25:22] Agrippa sprach zu Festus: "Ich möchte auch den Mann einmal hören." Festus erwiderte: "Du sollst ihn morgen hören." 
[25:23] Tags darauf erschienen Agrippa und Bernike mit glänzendem Gefolge und begaben sich mit den Obersten und den vornehmsten Männern der Stadt in den Gerichtssaal. Auf den Befehl des Festus wurde Paulus vorgeführt. 
[25:24] Da nahm Festus das Wort und sprach: "König Agrippa und ihr alle, die ihr mit uns hier versammelt seid! Hier seht ihr den Mann, den die ganze Schar der Juden in Jerusalem und hier bei mir verklagt hat, indem sie stürmisch forderten, er dürfe nicht länger leben. 
[25:25] Ich aber habe nicht entdecken können, daß er ein todeswürdiges Verbrechen begangen hat. Weil er sich nun auf die kaiserliche Majestät berufen hat, so habe ich beschlossen, ihn (nach Rom) zu senden. 
[25:26] Ich kann jedoch dem Herrn nichts Genaueres über ihn berichten. Deshalb habe ich ihn euch vorgeführt, und ganz besonders dir, König Agrippa, damit ich dann nach dem Verhör weiß, was ich zu schreiben habe. 
[25:27] Denn ich halte es für widersinnig, einen Gefangenen (nach Rom) zu senden, ohne deutlich anzugeben, was gegen ihn vorliegt." 
[26:1] Agrippa sprach zu Paulus: "Ich gebe dir hiermit das Wort, dich zu verteidigen." Da streckte Paulus seine Hand aus und begann seine Verteidigungsrede. 
[26:2] "König Agrippa", so hob er an, "ich schätze mich glücklich, daß ich mich heute gegen alle Anklagen der Juden vor dir verteidigen darf, 
[26:3] besonders deshalb, weil dir alle jüdischen Gebräuche und Streitfragen bekannt sind. Darum bitte ich dich: höre mich geduldig an! 
[26:4] Wie ich von Anfang an seit meinen Jugendjahren unter meinem Volk in Jerusalem gelebt habe, das wissen alle Juden. 
[26:5] Denn sie kennen mich seit langer Zeit und wissen, wenn sie nur der Wahrheit die Ehre geben wollten, daß ich der strengsten Richtung unseres Glaubens angehörte und ein Pharisäer war. 
[26:6] Nun stehe ich hier vor Gericht, weil ich auf die Erfüllung der Verheißung hoffe, die unseren Vätern einst von Gott gegeben worden ist, 
[26:7] und die auch die zwölf Stämme unseres Volkes zu erlangen hoffen, indem sie Gott bei Tag und Nacht mit angestrengtem Eifer dienen. Um dieser Hoffnung willen, o König, verklagen mich die Juden. 
[26:8] Warum haltet ihr's denn für unglaublich, daß Gott Tote auferweckt? 
[26:9] Ich dachte einst, ich müsse mit aller Macht der Sache Jesu von Nazaret entgegenarbeiten. 
[26:10] Das habe ich denn auch in Jerusalem getan: Mit hohenpriesterlicher Vollmacht ausgerüstet, warf ich viele Heilige ins Gefängnis, und wenn sie hingerichtet werden sollten, stimmte ich dafür. 
[26:11] In allen jüdischen Versammlungshäusern suchte ich sie oft durch Strafe zur Lästerung (Jesu) zu bringen. Ja in meiner wilden Wut verfolgte ich sie sogar bis in die Städte außerhalb des Landes. 
[26:12] So zog ich denn zu gleichem Tun mit einer Vollmacht und Befugnis von den Hohenpriestern nach Damaskus. 
[26:13] Als ich auf dem Weg dorthin war, sah ich, o König, gegen Mittag vom Himmel her ein Licht, heller als die Sonne, mich und meine Begleiter umstrahlen. 
[26:14] Wir fielen alle zu Boden, und ich hörte eine Stimme auf hebräisch zu mir sagen: 'Saul, Saul, warum verfolgst du mich? Es ist dir schwer, gegen den Stachel auszuschlagen.' 
[26:15] Ich sprach: 'Wer bist du, Herr?' Der Herr erwiderte: 'Ich bin Jesus, den du verfolgst. 
[26:16] Doch stehe auf und stelle dich auf deine Füße! Denn dazu bin ich dir erschienen, um dich zu meinem Diener zu erwählen und zu meinem Zeugen von dem, was du gesehen hast, und was ich dich noch schauen lassen werden. 
[26:17] Dabei will ich dich schützen vor dem Volk (Israel) und vor den Heiden, zu denen ich dich sende, 
[26:18] um ihre Augen aufzutun, daß sie sich von der Finsternis zum Licht wenden und von des Satans Macht zu Gott, damit sie durch den Glauben an mich Vergebung der Sünden empfangen und ein Erbteil unter denen, die geheiligt sind.' 
[26:19] Darum, o König Agrippa, bin ich der himmlischen Erscheinung nicht ungehorsam gewesen. 
[26:20] Sondern ich habe zuerst den Bewohnern von Damaskus und Jerusalem, dann der ganzen Landschaft Judäa und weiterhin den Heiden verkündigt, daß sie ihren Sinn ändern, sich zu Gott bekehren und Werke vollbringen müssen, die der Sinnesänderung entsprechen. 
[26:21] Deshalb haben mich die Juden im Tempel ergriffen und zu töten versucht. 
[26:22] Durch Gottes Beistand lebe ich heute noch und lege hoch und niedrig Zeugnis ab, indem ich nur das lehre, was die Propheten und auch Mose vorausverkündigt haben: 
[26:23] daß der Messias leiden und dann als Erstling der vom Tod Auferstandenen nicht nur dem Volk (Israel), sondern auch den Heiden Licht verkünden müsse..." 
[26:24] Als sich Paulus so verteidigte, unterbrach ihn Festus mit dem lauten Ruf: "Du bist von Sinnen, Paulus! Deine große Gelehrsamkeit hat dich um den Verstand gebracht!" 
[26:25] Paulus erwiderte: "Ich bin nicht von Sinnen, hochedler Festus, sondern die Worte, die ich rede, sind wahr und vernünftig. 
[26:26] Der König, an den ich mich voll Freimut wende, weiß um diese Dinge. Denn ich glaube nicht, daß ihm etwas von dem allen unbekannt geblieben ist. Es hat sich ja auch nicht in einem abgelegenen Winkel abgespielt. 
[26:27] Glaubst du, König Agrippa, den Propheten? Ich weiß, du glaubst." 
[26:28] Da sprach Agrippa zu Paulus: "Es fehlt nur wenig, so überredest du mich, ein Christ zu werden." 
[26:29] Paulus antwortete: "Wollte Gott, es würden, mag nun wenig oder viel daran fehlen, nicht allein du, sondern alle, die mich heute hören, ganz ebenso wie ich — nur ausgenommen diese Ketten." 
[26:30] Da erhoben sich der König, der Statthalter, Bernike und die übrige Versammlung. 
[26:31] Sie zogen sich zurück, redeten miteinander und sagten: "Dieser Mensch treibt nichts, was Tod oder Gefängnis verdient." 
[26:32] Agrippa aber sprach zu Festus: "Dieser Mensch könnte freigelassen werden, wenn er sich nicht auf den Kaiser berufen hätte." 
[27:1] Als unsere Abfahrt nach Italien beschlossen war, übergab man Paulus mit einigen anderen Gefangenen einem Hauptmann, namens Julius, der einer kaiserlichen Truppe angehörte. 
[27:2] Wir gingen an Bord eines Schiffes aus Adramyttium, das die Häfen der Provinz Asien anlaufen wollte, und fuhren ab; der Mazedonier Aristarch aus Thessalonich begleitete uns. Sept. 57 n.Chr. 
[27:3] Tags darauf legten wir in Sidon an, und Julius, der Paulus gütig behandelte, erlaubte ihm, seine Freunde zu besuchen und ihre liebevolle Pflege zu genießen. 
[27:4] Dann gingen wir wieder in See und fuhren an der Küste von Zypern vorbei, weil wir Gegenwind hatten. 
[27:5] Als wir das Meer längs der Küste Ziliziens und Pamphyliens durchfahren hatten, kamen wir nach Myra in Lyzien. 
[27:6] Dort fand der Hauptmann ein Schiff aus Alexandria, das auf der Fahrt nach Italien war, und ließ uns da an Bord gehen. 
[27:7] Mehrere Tage hindurch ging die Fahrt nur langsam vorwärts, und mit Mühe kamen wir in die Nähe von Knidus. Da uns der Gegenwind nicht in gerader Richtung weiterfahren ließ, steuerten wir an der Küste Kretas hin auf Salmone zu. 
[27:8] Als wir mit Schwierigkeiten an der Küste vorbeigekommen waren, gelangten wir in eine Bucht, namens Schönhafen, nahe bei der Stadt Lasäa. 
[27:9] Unsere Reise dauerte nun schon ziemlich lange, und die Schiffahrt war bereits gefährlich, wie auch die Zeit des großen Fastens schon vorüber war. Darum warnte Paulus (vor der Weiterfahrt). 
[27:10] "Ihr Männer", sprach er, "ich sehe voraus, daß die Fahrt nicht nur für unser Leben Gefahr und großen Schaden bringen wird." 
[27:11] Der Hauptmann aber glaubte dem Steuermann und dem Schiffseigentümer mehr als dem, was Paulus sagte. 
[27:12] Weil überdies der Hafen zum Überwintern nicht geeignet war, so fand es die Mehrzahl geraten, weiterzufahren und zu versuchen, ob man nicht Phönix — einen Hafen an der Küste von Kreta, der gegen den Südwest- und Nordwestwind geschützt ist — erreichen könne, um da zu überwintern. 
[27:13] Da nur ein schwacher Südwind wehte, so glaubten sie, ihr Vorhaben sicher ausführen zu können. Sie lichteten die Anker und fuhren ganz dicht an der Küste von Kreta hin. 
[27:14] Bald darauf aber brauste von dem Hochgebirge der Insel ein furchtbarer Nordoststurm daher. 
[27:15] Der riß das Schiff mit fort, und da es dem Wind nicht widerstehen konnte, so gaben wir es den Wogen preis und wurden dahingetrieben. 
[27:16] Als wir unter einer kleinen Insel, namens Klauda, hinliefen, gelang es uns nur mit größter Mühe, das Rettungsboot zu bergen. 
[27:17] Als sie es glücklich an Bord gezogen hatten, griffen sie zu einem Notbehelf und banden Taue um das Schiff. Aus Furcht, auf die Sandbänke der Syrte zu geraten, ließen sie das Geschirr nieder und wurden so vom Wind getrieben. 
[27:18] Weil wir aber vom Sturm schwer zu leiden hatten, so warfen sie am nächsten Tag einen Teil der Ladung über Bord. 
[27:19] Am dritten Tag warfen sie mit eigener Hand das Schiffsgerät ins Wasser. 
[27:20] Mehrere Tage waren weder Sonne noch Sterne sichtbar, und der Sturm umtobte uns so heftig, daß uns endlich jeder Hoffnungsstrahl auf Rettung schwand. 
[27:21] Da die Leute auf dem Schiff schon seit langer Zeit fast nichts gegessen hatten, trat Paulus mitten unter sie und sprach: "Ihr Männer, man hätte auf mich hören und nicht von Kreta weiterfahren sollen; dann wäre uns diese Gefahr und dieser Schade erspart geblieben. 
[27:22] Doch nun ermuntere ich euch: Seid guten Mutes! Denn keiner von euch wird ums Leben kommen; nur das Schiff geht verloren. 
[27:23] Vergangene Nacht ist ein Bote des Gottes, dem ich angehöre und diene, zu mir getreten 
[27:24] mit den Worten: 'Sei ohne Furcht, Paulus! Du mußt vor dem Kaiser erscheinen! Und sieh, Gott hat dir das Leben aller, die mit dir fahren, geschenkt.' 
[27:25] Darum seid getrost, ihr Männer! Denn ich vertraue Gott, daß es so kommt, wie mir gesagt ist. 
[27:26] Wir müssen aber an irgendeiner Insel stranden." 
[27:27] So kam die vierzehnte Nacht, seit wir im Adriatischen Meer umhertrieben. Da, um Mitternacht, vermuteten die Matrosen, daß Land in der Nähe sei. 
[27:28] Sie warfen das Senkblei aus und fanden das Wasser zwanzig Klafter tief. Bald darauf maßen sie wieder und fanden fünfzehn Klafter. 
[27:29] Weil sie fürchteten, wir könnten irgendwo auf Klippen stoßen, warfen sie von dem Heck des Schiffes vier Anker aus und warteten voll Sehnsucht auf den Tagesanbruch. 
[27:30] Da die Matrosen aus dem Schiff zu entfliehen suchten und unter dem Vorgeben, sie wollten vom Vorderteil des Schiffes Anker werfen, das Rettungsboot ins Meer hinunterließen, 
[27:31] sprach Paulus zu dem Hauptmann und den Soldaten: "Wenn diese Leute nicht im Schiff bleiben, so gibt's für euch keine Rettung." 
[27:32] Da kappten die Soldaten die Taue, womit das Boot befestigt war, und ließen es ins Meer fallen. In der Zeit vor Tagesanbruch redete Paulus allen zu, 
[27:33] sie möchten Nahrung zu sich nehmen. "Heute sind es vierzehn Tage", sprach er, "daß ihr fortwährend, ohne zu essen, in Angst schwebt und nichts Rechtes zu euch genommen habt. 
[27:34] Darum rate ich euch dringend, jetzt etwas zu genießen. Das ist mit zu eurer Rettung nötig. Denn keinem von euch wird ein Haar von seinem Haupt fallen." 
[27:35] Nach diesen Worten nahm er Brot, dankte Gott in aller Gegenwart, brach es und begann zu essen. 
[27:36] Da wurden sie alle gutes Mutes und aßen auch. 
[27:37] Wir waren im ganzen 276 Menschen an Bord. 
[27:38] Als sie sich satt gegessen hatten, warfen sie die Getreideladung ins Meer, um das Schiff zu erleichtern. 
[27:39] Bei Tagesanbruch konnte man das Land nicht erkennen. Man bemerkte aber eine Bucht mit einem flachen Ufer und beschloß, das Schiff womöglich dort auf den Strand laufen zu lassen. 
[27:40] So kappte man die Ankertaue und ließ die Anker im Meer. Zugleich löste man die Taue, mit denen die beiden Steuerruder (während des Treibens) festgebunden waren. Dann hißten sie das Focksegel gegen den Wind und steuerten auf den Strand zu. 
[27:41] Dabei gerieten sie aber auf eine Sandbank und ließen nun das Schiff auflaufen. Doch nur das Vorderteil stemmte sich fest und blieb unbeweglich, während das Heck des Schiffes durch den Anprall der Wogen mehr und mehr zertrümmert wurde. 
[27:42] Die Soldaten waren willens, die Gefangenen zu töten, damit keiner von ihnen ans Land schwimmen und entfliehen könne. 
[27:43] Der Hauptmann aber wollte Paulus retten und verhinderte das Vorhaben. Er befahl, alle, die schwimmen könnten, sollten zuerst über Bord springen, um ans Land zu kommen. 
[27:44] Die anderen sollten folgen, teils auf Planken, teils auf anderen Stücken von dem Wrack des Schiffes. So gelang es allen, sich ans Land zu retten. 
[28:1] Als wir sicher geborgen waren, erfuhren wir, daß die Insel Malta hieß. 
[28:2] Die Bewohner waren außerordentlich menschenfreundlich gegen uns. Sie zündeten ein großes Feuer an und sorgten für uns alle; denn es regnete und war kalt. 
[28:3] Als nun Paulus einen Haufen Reisig zusammenraffte und aufs Feuer warf, da kroch, von der Hitze herausgetrieben, eine Natter aus dem Reisighaufen hervor und schlängelte sich Paulus um die Hand. 
[28:4] Sobald die Leute das Tier an seiner Hand hangen sahen, sprachen sie zueinander: "Dieser Mensch ist sicher ein Mörder, den die Rachegöttin trotz seiner Rettung aus dem Meer nicht am Leben lassen will." 
[28:5] Doch er schleuderte das Tier ins Feuer und nahm weiter keinen Schaden. 
[28:6] Die Leute warteten darauf, daß er anschwelle oder plötzlich tot zu Boden falle. So warteten sie lange. Als sie aber sahen, daß ihm nichts Besonderes widerfuhr, da schlug ihre Meinung um, und sie behaupteten, er sei ein Gott. 
[28:7] Nun hatte in jener Gegend der angesehenste Mann der Insel, namens Publius, Grundbesitz. Der nahm uns auf in seinem Haus und beherbergte uns drei Tage in liebevoller Weise. 
[28:8] Gerade damals lag des Publius Vater krank an Fieber und Ruhr. Paulus besuchte ihn, legte ihm unter Gebet die Hände auf und machte ihn gesund. 
[28:9] Nun kamen auch alle anderen Kranken auf der Insel herbei und fanden Heilung. 
[28:10] Sie erwiesen uns deshalb viel Ehre, und später bei der Abfahrt brachten sie uns alles an Bord, dessen wir bedurften. 
[28:11] Nach dreimonatigem Aufenthalt fuhren wir weiter mit einem Schiff, das auf der Insel überwintert hatte; es gehörte nach Alexandria und trug als Schiffswappen das Bild der Zwillingsbrüder. Febr. 58 n.Chr. 
[28:12] Wir landeten in Syrakus und blieben dort drei Tage. 
[28:13] Von da fuhren wir rund um die Küste und kamen nach Rhegium. Tags darauf erhob sich der Wind aus Süden, und so erreichten wir schon am zweiten Tag Putéoli. 
[28:14] Da fanden wir Brüder. Die luden uns ein, sieben Tage bei ihnen zu bleiben. Dann machten wir uns auf den Weg nach Rom. 
[28:15] Da die dortigen Brüder Näheres über uns gehört hatten, kamen sie uns bis zu dem "Marktflecken des Appius" und den "Drei Schenken" entgegen. Bei ihrem Anblick dankte Paulus Gott und schöpfte neuen Mut. 
[28:16] Nach unserer Ankunft in Rom erhielt Paulus die Erlaubnis, mit dem Soldaten, der ihn bewachen mußte, eine eigene Wohnung zu beziehen. 
[28:17] Drei Tage später lud Paulus die Häupter der jüdischen Gemeinde in Rom zu sich ein. Als sie sich versammelt hatten, sprach er zu ihnen: "Obwohl ich, liebe Brüder, nichts Feindliches gegen unser Volk oder die Sitten unserer Väter begangen habe, so bin ich doch in Jerusalem gefangengenommen und in der Römer Hände überliefert worden. 
[28:18] Die haben mich verhört, und sie wollten mich freilassen, weil ich kein todeswürdiges Verbrechen begangen hatte. 
[28:19] Da sich aber die Juden dem widersetzten, so sah ich mich genötigt, Berufung an den Kaiser einzulegen. Ich will (mich hiermit nur verteidigen,) aber keine Klage gegen mein Volk erheben. 
[28:20] Deshalb ist es mein Wunsch gewesen, euch zu sehen und zu sprechen. Denn wegen der Hoffnung Israels trage ich diese Kette." 
[28:21] Sie antworteten ihm: "Wir haben keine schriftliche Nachricht über dich empfangen aus Judäa, und es ist auch keiner unserer Brüder hier erschienen, um uns mündlich zu berichten oder etwas Übles von dir zu erzählen. 
[28:22] Wir möchten aber gern von dir erfahren, was du denkst. Denn von der Richtung, der du angehörst, ist uns nur bekannt, daß man ihr allenthalben widerspricht." 
[28:23] An einem bestimmten Tag, den sie mit ihm vereinbart hatten, kamen sie noch in größerer Anzahl als das erste Mal zu ihm in seine Wohnung. Er redete zu ihnen mit feierlichem Ernst von dem Königreich Gottes und suchte sie, ausgehend vom Gesetz Moses und von den Propheten, vom frühen Morgen bis zum Abend von Jesu Sache zu überzeugen. 
[28:24] Die einen ließen sich auch durch seine Worte gewinnen, die anderen aber blieben ungläubig. 
[28:25] Weil sie sich untereinander nicht einigen konnten, gingen sie endlich weg. Beim Abschied aber sprach Paulus zu ihnen dies ernste Wort: "Treffend ist, was einst der Heilige Geist durch den Propheten Jesaja zu euern Vätern geredet hat: 
[28:26] Geh hin zu diesem Volk und sprich zu ihm: Hören sollt ihr und nicht verstehen, sehen und nicht erkennen. 
[28:27] Denn das Herz dieses Volkes ist verstockt. Ihre Ohren hören schwer, und ihre Augen haben sie verschlossen. Sie können sie nicht sehen mit ihren Augen, mit ihren Ohren können sie nicht hören, mit ihrem Herzen nicht verstehen und sich bekehren, daß ich sie heile. 
[28:28] So wisset denn: Den Heiden ist dies Gottesheil gesandt worden. Bei ihnen findet's auch Gehör." 
[28:29]  
[28:30] Paulus blieb dann zwei volle Jahre in einer Wohnung, die er sich auf seine Kosten gemietet hatte, und durfte dort alle empfangen, die ihn besuchen wollten. 50 — 60 n.Chr. 
[28:31] Er verkündigte das Königreich Gottes und lehrte von dem Herrn Jesus Christus mit aller Offenheit und ohne jedes Hindernis. 

### Romans

[1:1] Paulus, ein Knecht Jesu Christ, berufen zum Apostel und auserkoren, um Gottes Frohe Botschaft zu verkünden. — 
[1:2] Die hat Gott in den heiligen Schriften durch seine Propheten zuvor verheißen 
[1:3] über seinen Sohn. Der ist dem Fleisch nach aus Davids Geschlecht hervorgegangen, 
[1:4] nach dem Geist der Heiligkeit aber ist er durch seine Auferstehung von den Toten zu der Machtfülle des Sohnes Gottes erhoben worden. 
[1:5] Durch ihn, unseren Herrn Jesus Christus, haben wir die Gnadengabe des Apostelamtes empfangen, um zu seines Namens Ehre unter allen Völkern solche zu sammeln, die dem Glauben gehorsam werden. 
[1:6] Inmitten dieser Völkerwelt seid auch ihr von Jesus Christus berufen. — 
[1:7] Euch allen, als Geliebten Gottes und berufenen Heiligen in Rom, entbiete ich meinen Gruß. Gnade und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:8] Besonders danke ich meinem Gott durch Jesus Christus für euch alle, daß von euerm Glauben in der ganzen Welt die Rede ist. 
[1:9] Denn Gott, dem ich in meinem Geist diene, indem ich die Frohe Botschaft seines Sohnes verkündige, — der ist mein Zeuge, wie unablässig ich euer gedenke. 
[1:10] Stets flehe ich in meinen Gebeten zu Gott, er möge mir, wenn es sein Wille ist, nun endlich die Wege bahnen, daß ich zu euch kommen könne. 
[1:11] Denn mich verlangt danach, euch zu sehen, um euch diese und jene geistliche Gabe zu eurer Stärkung mitzuteilen, 
[1:12] oder richtiger gesagt: wir — ihr und ich — wollen uns, wenn ich bei euch bin, durch unseren Glauben gegenseitig ermuntern. 
[1:13] Es drängt mich, euch zu sagen, Brüder, daß ich mir schon oft vorgenommen habe, euch zu besuchen. Bis jetzt aber bin ich immer wieder daran gehindert worden. Denn auch unter euch möchte ich ebenso wie in den Ländern anderer Völker etwas Frucht einsammeln. 
[1:14] Griechen und Nichtgriechen, Gebildeten und Ungebildeten bin ich ja zu dienen verpflichtet. 
[1:15] Daher bin ich, soviel an mir liegt, gern bereit, auch euch in Rom die Frohe Botschaft zu verkünden. 
[1:16] Wahrlich, ich schäme mich der Frohen Botschaft nicht. Sie ist ja eine Gotteskraft, die allen, die da glauben, Rettung bringt: zuerst den Juden, dann auch den Griechen. 
[1:17] Denn Gottes Gerechtigkeit wird darin offenbar: sie kommt aus Glauben, und sie führt zum Glauben, wie geschrieben steht: Der Gerechte wird durch den Glauben das Leben erlangen. 
[1:18] Denn Gottes Zorn wird fort und fort vom Himmel offenbar über alle Gottlosigkeit und Ungerechtigkeit solcher Menschen, die die Wahrheit durch Ungerechtigkeit zu unterdrücken suchen. 
[1:19] Denn was man von Gott erkennen kann, das ist unter ihnen wohlbekannt. Gott selbst hat es ihnen kundgemacht. 
[1:20] Sein unsichtbares Wesen — seine ewige Macht und göttliche Größe — läßt sich ja seit der Erschaffung der Welt in seinen Werken deutlich wahrnehmen. Darum sind die Menschen auch ohne Entschuldigung, 
[1:21] wenn sie trotz ihrer Erkenntnis Gottes ihm nicht als Gott Ehre und Dank dargebracht haben, sondern auf nichtige Gedanken verfallen und mit ihrem unverständigen Herzen in Finsternis geraten sind. 
[1:22] In ihrem Weisheitsstolz sind sie zu Narren geworden: 
[1:23] die Herrlichkeit des unvergänglichen Gottes haben sie vertauscht mit armseligen Bildern von vergänglichen Menschen, Vögeln, vierfüßigen Tieren und kriechendem Gewürm. 
[1:24] Deshalb hat sie Gott in den bösen Begierden ihrer Herzen der Unreinigkeit preisgegeben, daß sie ihre eigenen Leiber schändeten, 
[1:25] weil sie die Wahrheit Gottes mit der Lüge vertauscht und dem Geschöpf mehr Verehrung und Dienst erwiesen haben als dem Schöpfer, der da gepriesen sei in Ewigkeit. Amen. 
[1:26] Darum hat sie Gott schändlichen Leidenschaften preisgegeben. Ihre Weiber haben statt des natürlichen Geschlechtsverkehrs widernatürlichen Umgang gepflogen. 
[1:27] Ebenso haben die Männer den natürlichen Verkehr mit dem Weib aufgegeben und sind in ihrer Begierde gegeneinander entbrannt: Männer haben mit Männern Unzucht getrieben und die gebührende Strafe für ihre Verirrung an ihrem eigenen Leib empfangen. 
[1:28] Weil ihnen nichts daran lag, die Erkenntnis Gottes festzuhalten, hat sie Gott einer verwerflichen Sinnesweise preisgegeben, so daß sie schmähliche Dinge treiben. 
[1:29] Sie sind erfüllt mit aller Ungerechtigkeit, Bosheit, Habsucht und Schlechtigkeit. Sie sind voller Neid, Mord, Streit, Trug und Tücke. 
[1:30] Sie verleumden heimlich und öffentlich. Sie sind gottlose Frevler, übermütige Prahler, erfinderisch im Bösen. Sie sind den Eltern ungehorsam, 
[1:31] sie sind unverständig, wortbrüchig, lieblos und unbarmherzig. 
[1:32] Sie wissen ganz genau, daß nach dem Gesetz Gottes alle solche Frevler den Tod verdienen. Trotzdem aber begnügen sie sich nicht damit, selbst dergleichen Sünden zu begehen; nein, sie rühmen auch noch ganz offen die anderen, die solche schändlichen Dinge treiben. 
[2:1] Darum gibt es keine Entschuldigung für dich, oh Mensch, wer du auch seist, wenn du dich zum Richter über andere aufwirfst. Indem du nämlich einem anderen das Urteil sprichst, verurteilst du dich selbst. Denn du, sein Richter, begehst ja ganz dieselben Sünden. 
[2:2] Anderseits wissen wir: Gottes Urteilsspruch richtet sich wirklich gegen alle, die solche Sünden tun. 
[2:3] Wenn du nun dergleichen Sünden verurteilst und selbst in solchen Sünden lebst, kannst du dann vielleicht darauf rechnen, o Mensch, daß du dem Gericht Gottes entrinnen werdest? 
[2:4] Oder verachtest du den Reichtum seiner Güte, Geduld und Langmut? Willst du nicht anerkennen, daß dich Gottes Güte zur Sinnesänderung zu leiten sucht? 
[2:5] Bist du aber hartnäckig, und ist dein Herz unbußfertig, so sammelst du dir einen Schatz von Zorn, (der dir ausbezahlt werden soll) an jenem Tag, wo sich Gottes Zorn entlädt und sein gerechtes Gericht offenbar wird. 
[2:6] Denn Gott wird einem jeden vergelten nach seinen Werken. 
[2:7] Den einen, die nach dem ewigen Leben trachten, wird, wenn sie im Guten standhaft bleiben, Herrlichkeit, Ehre und Unvergänglichkeit zuteil. 
[2:8] Die anderen aber, die in Widerspenstigkeit der Wahrheit nicht gehorchen, sondern der Ungerechtigkeit folgen, trifft Zorn und Grimm. 
[2:9] Trübsal und Angst erleiden alle, die Böses tun, zuerst die Juden, dann auch die Griechen. 
[2:10] Doch Herrlichkeit, Ehre und Friede wird denen zuteil, die Gutes tun, zuerst den Juden, dann auch den Griechen. 
[2:11] Denn Gott urteilt nicht nach äußeren Unterschieden. 
[2:12] Alle, die, ohne das Gesetz zu kennen, gesündigt haben, werden auch ohne den Richterspruch des Gesetzes dem Verderben anheimfallen. Und alle, die gesündigt haben, während sie unter dem Gesetz standen, werden durch das Gesetz ihr Urteil empfangen. 
[2:13] Denn nicht solche, die das Gesetz nur hören, sind gerecht in Gottes Augen, sondern die das Gesetz erfüllen, die sollen gerechtgesprochen werden. 
[2:14] Sooft nämlich Heiden, die doch kein Gesetz haben, aus innerem Trieb des Gesetzes Forderungen erfüllen, so sind sie, ohne ein Gesetz zu haben, sich selbst ein Gesetz. 
[2:15] Denn durch ihr Verhalten beweisen sie, daß die Kenntnis jenes Tuns, das vom Gesetz gefordert wird, in ihrem Herzen eingeschrieben steht. Dafür zeugt auch ihr sittliches Bewußtsein: ihre Gedanken verklagen sich untereinander und suchen sich auch wohl zu rechtfertigen. 
[2:16] Das wird sich zeigen an dem Tag, wo Gott — nach der Heilsbotschaft, die ich verkündige — die verborgenen Gedanken der Menschen durch Jesus Christus richten wird. 
[2:17] Du bist stolz auf den Namen Jude, du betrachtest das Gesetz als ein Ruhekissen, du rühmst dich deines Gottes 
[2:18] und kennst seinen Willen. Durch die Belehrung im Gesetz hast du Klarheit über den Unterschied von gut und böse. 
[2:19] Du traust dir zu, ein Führer der Blinden zu sein, ein Licht derer, die im Finsteren wandeln, 
[2:20] ein Erzieher der Unverständigen, ein Lehrer der Unmündigen. Denn im Gesetz hast du ja den klaren Ausdruck der Erkenntnis und der Wahrheit. 
[2:21] Belehrst du nun aber andere und folgst selbst deiner Lehre nicht, predigst du: nicht stehlen! und stiehlst, 
[2:22] gebietest du: nicht ehebrechen! und brichst die Ehe, verabscheust du die Götzen und beraubst doch ihre Tempel: 
[2:23] machst du da nicht trotzdem deines Prahlens mit dem Gesetz durch deine Gesetzesübertretung deinem Gott Schande? 
[2:24] Denn: Um euretwillen wird der Name Gottes unter den Heidenvölkern verlästert —, so steht ja geschrieben. 
[2:25] Gewiß: die Beschneidung ist heilsam, wenn du das Gesetz erfüllst. Übertrittst du aber das Gesetz, so bist du nicht besser als ein unbeschnittener Heide. 
[2:26] Wenn anderseits ein Unbeschnittener die Verordnungen des Gesetzes beobachtet, wird er da nicht, obwohl unbeschnitten, als ein Beschnittener angesehen werden? 
[2:27] Ja, der von Haus aus Unbeschnittene, der das Gesetz erfüllt, wird dich verurteilen, der du trotz deines geschriebenen Gesetzes und deiner Beschneidung ein Gesetzesübertreter bist. 
[2:28] Denn das ist kein rechter Jude, der es nur äußerlich ist; und das ist keine wahre Beschneidung, die nur äußerlich am Fleisch vollzogen wird. 
[2:29] Das ist vielmehr ein rechter Jude, der es nach seiner inneren Gesinnung ist; und die wahre Beschneidung ist die Beschneidung des Herzens: da waltet der Geist, nicht der Buchstabe. Und da folgt auch Anerkennung, zwar nicht von Menschen, aber von Gott. 
[3:1] Haben denn da die Juden (vor den Heiden) überhaupt noch etwas voraus? Oder bringt die Beschneidung irgendeinen Nutzen? 
[3:2] O ja, die Juden haben in jeder Hinsicht viel voraus: vor allem deshalb, weil ihnen Gottes Offenbarungsworte anvertraut worden sind. 
[3:3] Denn was tut's, daß manche untreu geworden sind? Hebt etwa ihre Untreue Gottes Treue auf? 
[3:4] Nimmermehr! Im Gegenteil: es soll sich zeigen, daß Gott (treu und) wahrhaftig ist, während alle Menschen Lügner sind, wie geschrieben steht: Du sollst recht behalten mit deinem Richterspruch und als Sieger dastehen, wenn man mit dir streitet. 
[3:5] Wenn aber so unsere Ungerechtigkeit Gottes Gerechtigkeit ins helle Licht stellt, was dann? Ist dann Gott — menschlich gesprochen — nicht ungerecht, wenn er sein Zorngericht verhängt? 
[3:6] Nimmermehr! Denn wie könnte Gott sonst der Weltenrichter sein? 
[3:7] Wenn sich ferner Gottes Wahrheit durch meine "Lügenpredigt" um so herrlicher erwiesen hat zu seinem Ruhm, warum werde auch ich dann noch immer als Sünder angesehen? 
[3:8] Ja, warum sollten wir dann nicht alle nach jenem Grundsatz handeln, den uns gewisse Leute lästerlich in den Mund legen: "Laßt uns das Böse tun, damit Gutes daraus komme"? Leute, die so denken, trifft Gottes Strafurteil mit Recht. 
[3:9] Wie steht es nun? Zeichnen wir (Juden) uns durch unser Verhalten wirklich (vor den Heiden) aus? Nicht im geringsten. Wir haben ja im vorigen gegen Juden und Heiden dieselbe Anklage erheben müssen, daß sie alle unter der Herrschaft der Sünde stehen. 
[3:10] Es heißt ja in der Schrift: 
[3:11] Keiner ist gerecht, auch nicht einer; keiner ist verständig, keiner fragt nach Gott. 
[3:12] Sie alle sind abgewichen, allesamt verderbt. Keiner ist da, der Gutes tut, auch nicht einer. 
[3:13] Ihre Kehle ist ein offenes Grab, mit ihren Zungen reden sie Betrug. Otterngift ist unter ihren Lippen. 
[3:14] Ihr Mund ist voller Fluch und Bitterkeit. 
[3:15] Ihre Füße eilen, um Blut zu vergießen; 
[3:16] Zerstörung und Jammer sind auf ihren Wegen, 
[3:17] und den Weg des Heils kennen sie nicht. 
[3:18] Es ist keine Gottesfurcht vor ihren Augen. 
[3:19] Nun wissen wir, daß sich die Worte des Gesetzes zunächst an die richten, die unter dem Gesetz stehen. Schließlich aber kommt dadurch doch jedes Menschen Mund zum Schweigen, und die ganze Welt steht schuldig da vor Gott. 
[3:20] Denn aus Gesetzeswerken wird kein Mensch vor ihm gerechtfertigt. Das Gesetz wirkt ja nur Erkenntnis der Sünde. 
[3:21] Nun ist aber, ganz unabhängig von irgendeinem Gesetz, eine Gerechtigkeit Gottes offenbar geworden, auf die schon das Gesetz und die Propheten hingewiesen haben, 
[3:22] nämlich Gottes Gerechtigkeit durch den Glauben Jesu Christi, die zuteil wird allen, die da glauben. 
[3:23] Denn hier gibt's keinen Unterschied: alle (die zum Glauben kommen) sind früher Sünder gewesen und haben nichts aufzuweisen, was Gott gefallen könnte. 
[3:24] Sie empfangen vielmehr die Gerechtigkeit von ihm als unverdientes Gnadengeschenk durch die Befreiung in Christus Jesus. 
[3:25] Den hat Gott öffentlich zur Schau gestellt als Gnadenstuhl durch seinen blutigen Tod, den er im Glauben erduldet hat. Damit wollte Gott zunächst seine (richterliche) Gerechtigkeit erweisen, weil er die vorher begangenen Sünden in seiner Langmut ungestraft hat hingehen lassen. 
[3:26] Dann aber wollte er auch seine (gnadenspendende) Gerechtigkeit erweisen für die gegenwärtige Zeit. So sollte offenbar werden, daß er selbst (als Richter) gerecht ist, und daß er auch (aus Gnaden) den rechtfertigt, der Glauben hat wie Jesus. 
[3:27] Wo bleibt denn nun das Rühmen? Damit ist's aus für immer. Durch was für ein Gesetz? Durch ein Gesetz, das Werke fordert? Im Gegenteil: durch ein Gesetz, das Glauben fordert. 
[3:28] So kommen wir zu dem Schluß, daß der Mensch, ganz unabhängig von Gesetzeswerken, durch den Glauben gerechtfertigt wird. 
[3:29] Oder ist Gott etwa nur der Juden Gott? Ist er nicht auch der Heiden Gott? Gewiß, er ist auch der Heiden Gott. 
[3:30] Denn es gibt nur einen Gott, und der rechtfertigt die Juden aus Glauben und die Heiden durch den Glauben. 
[3:31] Bringen wir nun etwa das Gesetz zu Fall durch den Glauben? Nimmermehr! Wir bringen vielmehr das Gesetz erst recht zur Geltung. 
[4:1] Was hat denn unser Ahnherr Abraham durch sein eigenes Tun erreicht? 
[4:2] Wäre Abraham aus Werken gerechtfertigt worden, so hätte er freilich Grund, sich zu rühmen. Aber Gott gegenüber ist es anders. 
[4:3] Denn was sagt die Schrift? Abraham glaubte Gott, und das ward ihm angerechnet zur Gerechtigkeit. 
[4:4] Hat nun einer Werke aufzuweisen, so wird ihm der verdiente Lohn nicht aus Gnaden angerechnet, sondern aus Schuldigkeit. 
[4:5] Wer aber keine Werke aufweisen kann, sondern glaubt an den, der den Gottlosen rechtfertigt, dem wird sein Glaube angerechnet zur Gerechtigkeit. 
[4:6] Auch David preist ja den Menschen selig, dem Gott ganz unabhängig von Werken Gerechtigkeit anrechnet: 
[4:7] Selig sind, denen die Übertretungen vergeben und deren Sünden zugedeckt sind! 
[4:8] Selig ist der Mann, dem der Herr die Sünde nicht anrechnet! 
[4:9] Bezieht sich nun diese Seligpreisung allein auf die Beschnittenen oder auch auf die Unbeschnittenen? Abraham — so behaupten wir ja — ward sein Glaube angerechnet zur Gerechtigkeit. 
[4:10] Wann ist er ihm denn angerechnet worden? Vor oder nach seiner Beschneidung? Nicht nach der Beschneidung, sondern schon vorher. 
[4:11] Das Zeichen der Beschneidung empfing er dann als Siegel der Gerechtigkeit jenes Glaubens, den er schon als Unbeschnittener bewiesen hatte. So sollte er ein Vater aller derer sein, die als Unbeschnittene zum Glauben kommen — denn auch ihnen sollte die Gerechtigkeit angerechnet werden —. 
[4:12] Aber er sollte auch ein Vater von Beschnittenen sein, das heißt derer unter den Beschnittenen, die nicht nur äußerlich beschnitten sind, sondern die auch in den Fußtapfen jenes Glaubens wandeln, den unser Vater Abraham schon als Unbeschnittener bewiesen hat. 
[4:13] Auch die Verheißung, die Welt zum Erbe zu empfangen, die Abraham und seinen Nachkommen zuteil geworden, ist nicht an die Erfüllung eines Gesetzes geknüpft, sondern sie ist bedingt durch die Gerechtigkeit des Glaubens. 
[4:14] Erben nämlich solche, die ein Gesetz erfüllen, so hat der Glaube keinen Wert und die Verheißung keine Geltung. 
[4:15] - Jedes Gesetz führt ja Strafe herbei. Nur da, wo es kein Gesetz gibt, ist auch von Übertretung keine Rede —. 
[4:16] Deshalb erben nur solche, die Glauben haben; denn das Erbe soll ja ein Gnadengeschenk sein. Und nur in diesem Fall steht die Verheißung sicher für alle (wahren) Nachkommen Abrahams — nicht allein für die, die das Gesetz empfangen haben, sondern auch für alle, die Glauben haben wie Abraham. So ist er unser aller Vater 
[4:17] - wie geschrieben steht: Zum Vater vieler Völker habe ich dich bestimmt —. Und das ist er nach Gottes Willen. Denn ihm hat er geglaubt: ihm, der die Toten lebendig macht, und der das Nichtseiende ins Dasein ruft. 
[4:18] Selbst da, wo nichts zu hoffen war, hat er voll Hoffnung an dem Glauben festgehalten, daß er ein Vater vieler Völker werden solle, gemäß dem Wort: So (zahlreich) sollen deine Nachkommen sein. 
[4:19] Und ohne im Glauben schwach zu werden, sah er, wie sein eigener Leib die Lebenskraft verloren hatte — denn er war fast hundert Jahre alt —, und wie auch Saras Mutterschoß erstorben war. 
[4:20] Er zweifelte nicht ungläubig an Gottes Verheißung. Nein, er wurde stark im Glauben und gab Gott die Ehre 
[4:21] in der festen Überzeugung, daß er seine Verheißung auch erfüllen könne. 
[4:22] Darum ist ihm auch (sein Glaube) angerechnet worden zur Gerechtigkeit. 
[4:23] Doch dies Wort: "Es ist ihm angerechnet worden" hat nicht allein für ihn Bedeutung, 
[4:24] sondern auch für uns. Uns soll es "angerechnet" werden, wenn wir unseren Glauben gründen auf den, der unseren Herrn Jesus von den Toten auferweckt hat. 
[4:25] In den Tod ist er gegeben worden um unserer Fehltritte willen und auferweckt um unserer Rechtfertigung willen. 
[5:1] Sind wir nun gerecht geworden durch den Glauben, so laßt uns mit Gott in Frieden bleiben durch unseren Herrn Jesus Christus, 
[5:2] durch den wir ja im Glauben Zutritt haben zu dieser Gnade, darin wir jetzt stehen! Laßt uns auch rühmen, daß wir hoffen dürfen, einst Gottes Herrlichkeit zu erben! 
[5:3] Noch mehr: wir wollen uns sogar des rühmen, daß wir jetzt Trübsal leiden. Wir wissen ja: Trübsal wirkt Standhaftigkeit, 
[5:4] Standhaftigkeit wirkt Festigkeit, Festigkeit wirkt Hoffnung. 
[5:5] Und diese Hoffnung kann nicht trügen; denn Gottes Liebe fließt in unseren Herzen durch den Heiligen Geist, der uns gegeben worden ist. 
[5:6] Als wir noch krank in Sünden waren, gerade da hat Christus für Gottlose den Tod erlitten. 
[5:7] Nun geschieht es kaum, daß jemand für einen Gerechten sein Leben opfert. — Für den, der ihm Gutes erwiesen, erleidet wohl einer mit kühnem Entschluß den Tod. — 
[5:8] Gott aber macht uns seine Liebe dadurch kund, daß Christus für uns gestorben ist, als wir noch Sünder waren. 
[5:9] Wieviel mehr nun dürfen wir jetzt, da wir in seinem Blut gerecht geworden sind, durch ihn auf Rettung hoffen vor Gottes Zorngericht! 
[5:10] Denn sind wir als Gottes Feinde versöhnt worden mit Gott durch seines Sohnes Tod, wieviel mehr werden wir als Versöhnte Rettung finden durch sein Leben! 
[5:11] Und nicht nur das; wir dürfen uns auch Gottes rühmen durch unseren Herrn Jesus Christus, durch den wir jetzt die Versöhnung erlangt. 
[5:12] Demnach verhält es sich so: Durch einen Menschen ist die Sünde in die Welt gekommen, und durch die Sünde der Tod. Darum ist der Tod zu allen Menschen gelangt, weil alle gesündigt haben. 
[5:13] Auch vor dem Gesetz ward in der Welt gesündigt. Die Sünde aber ward nicht angerechnet, solange noch kein Gesetz da war. 
[5:14] Trotzdem herrschte der Tod mit königlicher Macht von Adam bis Mose auch über alle, die beim Sündigen kein bestimmtes Gebot übertraten wie Adam. Der wies als Vorbild hin auf jenen Adam, der noch kommen sollte. 
[5:15] Doch nicht wie der Fehltritt (Adams) war, ist nun die Gnadengabe (Gottes). (Hier zeigt sich vielmehr ein Unterschied.) Durch eines Menschen Fehltritt sind alle Menschen dem Tod verfallen. Weit mehr hat Gottes Gnade gewirkt: Die Gabe, die wir der Gnade des einen Menschen Jesus Christus danken, hat alle Menschen überschwenglich reich gemacht. 
[5:16] Doch dies Geschenk der Gnade übt eine andere Wirkung aus als jener eine Sünder. Das Urteil (Gottes) über den einen Sünder hat (über alle Menschen) ein Strafurteil gebracht. Die Gnadengabe (Gottes) aber, durch die Fehltritte vieler hervorgerufen, hat (allen Menschen) Freisprechung gebracht. 
[5:17] Wenn durch den Fehltritt jenes einen der Tod mit königlicher Macht geherrscht hat durch die Schuld des einen, wieviel mehr werden da alle, die die überschwenglich reiche Gnade und Gabe der Gerechtigkeit empfangen, in Lebenskraft als Könige herrschen durch den einen Jesus Christus! 
[5:18] Darum: wie eines Menschen Fehltritt für alle Menschen ein Strafurteil (des Todes) verschuldet hat: so bringt nun eines Menschen Gehorsamstat für alle Menschen einen Freispruch, der das Leben schenkt. 
[5:19] Denn wie durch eines Menschen Ungehorsam alle Menschen Sünder geworden sind: so sollen nun durch eines Menschen Gehorsam alle Menschen Gerechte werden. 
[5:20] Das Gesetz ist gleichsam durch eine Nebentür hereingekommen, damit sich Fehltritt auf Fehltritt häufe. Wo sich aber die Sünde gehäuft, da ist auch der Strom der Gnade aufs höchste gestiegen. 
[5:21] Denn wie die Sünde Königin war im Machtgebiet des Todes: So soll nun die Gnade als Königin herrschen, indem sie die Gerechtigkeit verleiht, die zum ewigen Leben führt durch Jesus Christus, unseren Herrn. 
[6:1] Was wollen wir nun daraus schließen? Wollen wir etwa bei der Sünde beharren, damit sich die Gnade mehre? 
[6:2] Nimmermehr! Wir sind ja tot für die Sünde; wie können wir da noch in ihr leben? 
[6:3] Oder wißt ihr nicht, daß wir alle, die wir in Christus Jesus getauft worden, in seinen Tod versenkt worden sind? 
[6:4] Wir sind also deshalb mit ihm durch die Taufe in den Tod begraben worden, damit, wie Christus von den toten auferweckt worden ist durch die Herrlichkeit des Vaters, ebenso auch wir in einem neuen Lebenszustand wandeln. 
[6:5] Denn ist es wahr, daß wir mit ihm verwachsen sind durch einen Tod, der seinem Tod ähnlich ist, so werden wir auch nicht minder mit ihm verwachsen sein durch eine Auferstehung, die der seinen gleicht. 
[6:6] Wir wissen ja: unser alter Mensch ist deshalb mit (Christus) gekreuzigt worden, damit der von der Sünde beherrschte Leib vernichtet werde und wir der Sünde nicht länger als Sklaven dienen. 
[6:7] Denn ein Toter ist von der Macht der Sünde frei. 
[6:8] Sind wir nun aber mit Christus gestorben, so werden wir auch — das ist unsere Zuversicht — mit ihm leben. 
[6:9] Denn wir wissen: Christus, von den Toten auferweckt, kann nicht wieder sterben; der Tod hat kein Herrscherrecht mehr über ihn. 
[6:10] Sein Tod galt ja der Sünde, ein für allemal; sein Leben aber gilt Gott. 
[6:11] Geradeso — bedenkt das wohl! — sollt auch ihr tot sein für die Sünde, aber lebendig für Gott, weil ihr ja in Gemeinschaft steht mit Christus Jesus, unserem Herrn. 
[6:12] Darum soll die Sünde nicht als Königin herrschen in euerm sterblichen Leib, so daß ihr seinen Lüsten nachgebt. 
[6:13] Ihr dürft auch nicht eure Glieder als Waffen der Ungerechtigkeit in den Dienst der Sünde stellen. Sondern da ihr aus dem Tod zum Leben gekommen seid, so weiht euch dem Dienst Gottes und ergebt Gott eure Glieder als Waffen der Gerechtigkeit! 
[6:14] Die Sünde wird euch nicht besiegen können. Denn ihr steht nicht unter dem Gesetz, sondern unter der Gnade. 
[6:15] Was folgt hieraus? Sollen wir sündigen, weil wir nicht unter dem Gesetz stehen, sondern unter der Gnade? Nimmermehr! 
[6:16] Ihr wißt doch: wenn ihr euch einem als Knecht zum Gehorsam verpflichtet, dann werdet ihr auch tatsächlich Knechte dessen, dem ihr gehorsam seid, — und zwar entweder Knechte, die der Sünde dienen und dem Tod verfallen, oder Knechte, die (Gott) gehorsam sind und zur Gerechtigkeit gelangen. 
[6:17] Gott sei Dank: ihr dient jetzt nicht mehr der Sünde als Knechte, sondern ihr seid der (christlichen) Lehre in der Gestalt, worin sie euch überliefert worden ist, von Herzen gehorsam. 
[6:18] Von der Sünde Herrschaft frei, seid ihr nun "Knechte der Gerechtigkeit" geworden. 
[6:19] - Mit Rücksicht auf eure menschliche Schwachheit wähle ich diesen bildlichen Ausdruck "Knechte" —. Wie ihr (früher) eure Glieder in den Knechtsdienst der Unreinigkeit und Gesetzwidrigkeit gestellt habt, um ein gesetzloses Leben zu führen: so stellt jetzt eure Glieder in den Knechtsdienst der Gerechtigkeit, um zur Heiligung zu gelangen! 
[6:20] Denn als ihr Knechte der Sünde wart, da wart ihr frei gegenüber der Gerechtigkeit. 
[6:21] Welche Frucht ist euch nun damals aus euerm Wandel erwachsen? Taten, deren ihr euch jetzt schämt! Denn sie führen zum Tod. 
[6:22] Jetzt aber, wo ihr von der Sünde frei und Gottes Knechte geworden seid, erwächst euch solche Frucht, die zur Heiligung führt, und endlich erlangt ihr das ewige Leben. 
[6:23] Denn die Sünde zahlt als Sold den Tod. Das Gnadengeschenk Gottes aber ist das ewige Leben in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus, unserem Herrn. 
[7:1] Oder wißt ihr nicht, liebe Brüder — ich rede ja zu Leuten, die mit dem Gesetz wohlbekannt sind —, daß das Gesetz den Menschen während seines ganzen Lebens beherrscht? 
[7:2] Eine verheiratete Frau zum Beispiel ist durch das Ehegesetz an ihren Mann gebunden, solange er lebt. Stirbt aber der Mann, so ist sie frei von dem Gesetz, wodurch sie an den Mann gebunden war. 
[7:3] Gibt sie sich also zu Lebzeiten ihres Mannes einem anderen Mann hin, so führt sie den Namen Ehebrecherin. Nach dem Tod ihres Mannes aber ist sie von dem Ehegesetz frei: sie ist dann keine Ehebrecherin, wenn sie sich mit einem anderen Mann vermählt. 
[7:4] Nun denn, meine Brüder, auch ihr seid durch den Leib Christi dem Gesetz gegenüber tot, und ihr sollt einem anderen zu eigen werden: dem, der deshalb von den Toten auferweckt worden ist, damit wir Frucht bringen im Dienst Gottes. 
[7:5] Denn solange wir im Fleisch lebten, waren die durch das Gesetz aufgeregten sündlichen Leidenschaften in unseren Gliedern wirksam, so daß wir Frucht brachten für den Tod. 
[7:6] Jetzt aber sind wir vom Gesetz los: für unseren früheren Zwingherrn sind wir tot und dienen nun (Gott) in einem neuen Zustand unter der Herrschaft des Geistes. Denn der alte Zustand unter der Herrschaft des Buchstabens hat ein Ende. 
[7:7] Was folgt hieraus? Ist das Gesetz Sünde? Nimmermehr! Aber ich hätte die Sünde nie erkannt ohne das Gesetz. Was zum Beispiel böse Begierde ist, davon wüßte ich nichts, wenn das Gesetz nicht immer wieder spräche: Du sollst nicht begehren! 
[7:8] Dies Gebot diente nun der Sünde als Waffe wider mich und erregte in mir allerlei böse Begierden. Denn ohne Gesetz ist die Sünde tot. 
[7:9] Einst lebte ich dahin, ohne etwas vom Gesetz zu wissen. Dann trat das Gebot an mich heran. Da ward die Sünde (in mir) lebendig, 
[7:10] und — ich starb. Das Gebot, das mir zum Leben dienen sollte, gereichte mir so in Wirklichkeit zum Tod. 
[7:11] Denn die Sünde benützte das Gebot als Waffe wider mich: sie verführte mich, und so hat sie mir gerade durch das Gebot den Tod gebracht. 
[7:12] Es bleibt demnach dabei: Das Gesetz an sich ist heilig, und das Gebot ist heilig, gerecht und gut. 
[7:13] Ist denn nun das Gute mein Tod geworden? Nimmermehr! Die Sünde hat mich in den Tod gestürzt. Die sollte als Sünde offenbar werden: darum hat sie mir durch das Gute den Tod gebracht. So sollte sich gerade durch den Mißbrauch des Gebotes die grenzenlose Sündigkeit der Sünde zeigen. 
[7:14] Das Gesetz — so wissen wir — ist geistlich. Ich aber bin fleischlich, unter die Herrschaft der Sünde verkauft. 
[7:15] Mein ganzes Tun ist mir ein Rätsel. Ich führe ja nicht aus, was ich mir vornehme; sondern gerade was ich verabscheue, das tue ich. 
[7:16] Tue ich aber das, was meinem Willen entspricht, dann stimme ich dem Gesetz innerlich zu (und erkenne an), daß es gut ist. 
[7:17] Also bin ich es nicht, der das Böse vollbringt, sondern die Sünde, die in mir wohnt. 
[7:18] Ich weiß ja: es wohnt in mir, das heißt in meinem Fleisch nichts Gutes. Ich kann wohl das Gute wollen; aber mir fehlt die Kraft, es zu vollbringen. 
[7:19] Denn ich tue nicht das Gute, das ich will; nein, das Böse, das ich nicht will, das führe ich aus. 
[7:20] Tue ich aber gerade das, was ich nicht will, so bin ich es nicht, der das Böse vollbringt, sondern die Sünde, die in mir wohnt. 
[7:21] Dies ist also die Regel, die ich immer wieder finde: will ich das Gute tun, so ist das Böse da. 
[7:22] Denn nach meinem inneren Menschen habe ich Freude am Gesetz Gottes. 
[7:23] Ich entdecke aber in meinen Gliedern ein anderes Gesetz, das mit dem Gesetz meiner Vernunft im Kampf liegt und mich gefangennimmt für das Gesetz der Sünde, das in meinen Gliedern ist. 
[7:24] Ich unglückseliger Mensch! Wer wird mich erretten von diesem Todesleib? 
[7:25] Dank sei Gott! Er hat's getan durch Jesus Christus, unseren Herrn! So bleibt es denn dabei: Auf meine eigene Kraft gestellt, diene ich mit der Vernunft dem Gesetz Gottes, mit dem Fleisch aber dem Gesetz der Sünde. 
[8:1] Klar ist nun: Kein Verdammungsurteil kann jetzt treffen, die in Gemeinschaft stehen mit Christus Jesus. 
[8:2] Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der das Leben schenkt in Christus Jesus, das hat mich freigemacht von dem Gesetz der Sünde und des Todes. 
[8:3] Denn was für das Gesetz unmöglich war, weil seine Kraft gelähmt ward durch das Fleisch, das hat Gott selbst vollbracht: Er sandte seinen eigenen Sohn in Ähnlichkeit des Sündenfleisches als Opfer für die Sünde. So hat er die Sünde im Fleisch verurteilt. 
[8:4] Nun soll, was das Gesetz verlangt, in uns zustande kommen, wenn wir nicht nach dem Fleisch wandeln, sondern nach dem Geist. 
[8:5] Die Fleischesmenschen trachten nach des Fleisches Gütern, die Geistesmenschen trachten nach des Geistes Gütern. 
[8:6] Des Fleisches Trachten bringt den Tod, des Geistes Trachten bringt das Leben und den Frieden. 
[8:7] Des Fleisches Trachten ist ja Feindschaft gegen Gott. Denn dem Gesetz Gottes fügt das Fleisch sich nicht, es kann's auch nicht. 
[8:8] Die Fleischesmenschen können darum Gott nicht gefallen. 
[8:9] Ihr aber seid nicht Fleischesmenschen, sondern Geistesmenschen, wenn wirklich der Geist Gottes in euch wohnt. Wer Christi Geist nicht hat, der ist auch nicht sein Eigentum. 
[8:10] Wenn aber Christus in euch wohnt, so ist zwar euer Leib dem Tod verfallen um der Sünde willen, doch euer Geist ist voller Leben infolge der Gerechtigkeit. 
[8:11] Wohnt aber dessen Geist in euch, der Jesus von den Toten hat erweckt, so wird, der Christus von den Toten auferweckte, auch eure Leiber, die dem Tod verfallen sind, lebendig machen durch seinen Geist, der in euch wohnt. 
[8:12] Darum sind wir, Brüder, nicht dem Fleisch schuldig, nach dem Fleisch zu leben. 
[8:13] Denn lebt ihr nach dem Fleisch, so müßt ihr sterben. Wenn ihr jedoch des Leibes böse Triebe durch den Geist ertötet, so sollt ihr leben. 
[8:14] Denn alle, die von Gottes Geist sich leiten lassen, sind Söhne Gottes. 
[8:15] Der Geist, den ihr empfangen, macht euch nicht zu Knechten, so daß ihr wiederum euch fürchten müßtet. Der Geist, den ihr empfangen, schenkt die Sohneswürde, und im Gebet rufen wir durch ihn: "Abba, unser Vater!" 
[8:16] Und kein geringerer als dieser Geist bestätigt unserem Geist, daß wir Gottes Kinder sind. 
[8:17] Als Kinder sind wir dann auch Erben: Erben Gottes und Miterben Christi. Wir müssen aber mit ihm leiden, wenn wir mit ihm verherrlicht werden wollen. 
[8:18] Ich meine nun: Die Leiden dieser Zeit sind gar nicht von Belang, verglichen mit der Herrlichkeit, die sich an uns bald offenbaren soll. 
[8:19] Denn wartet nicht die ganze Schöpfung gespannt und sehnsuchtsvoll der Stunde, da Gottes Söhne sich enthüllen sollen in ihrer vollen Herrlichkeit? 
[8:20] Die Schöpfung liegt ja in den Banden der Vergänglichkeit: Nicht nach eigener Wahl, vielmehr durch fremde Schuld. Ihr winkt jedoch die Hoffnung, 
[8:21] da auch sie — die Schöpfung — einst befreit soll werden von des Verderbens Knechtschaft, um teilzunehmen an der Freiheit, die Gottes Kinder mit der Herrlichkeit empfangen sollen. 
[8:22] Wir wissen ja: Die ganze Schöpfung ist bis jetzt voll Klageseufzer und harrt mit Schmerzen einer Neugeburt entgegen. 
[8:23] Doch nicht allein sie seufzt. Auch wir, die wir bereits den Geist als Erstlingsgabe (der zukünftigen Herrlichkeit) besitzen, auch wir, wir seufzen innerlich und warten sehnsuchtsvoll darauf, in unsere Kindesrechte eingesetzt zu werden und damit auch für unseren Leib Befreiung zu erlangen. 
[8:24] Dies ist das Heil, worauf wir jetzt noch hoffen. Die Hoffnung aber, die man schon erfüllt vor Augen sieht, ist keine Hoffnung mehr. Denn wozu soll man das noch hoffen, was man schon sieht? 
[8:25] Wenn wir jedoch auf das noch Unsichtbare hoffen, so warten wir darauf mit Sehnsucht und Geduld. 
[8:26] Damit nimmt nun der (Heilige) Geist sich unserer Schwachheit an. Denn um was wir bitten sollen, das wissen wir nicht immer recht. Dann eben tritt der Geist selbst für uns ein mit Seufzern, die sich nicht in Worte fassen lassen. 
[8:27] Gott aber, der die Herzen prüft, versteht des Geistes Sprache; denn der tritt ein nach Gottes Willen für die Heiligen. 
[8:28] Wir wissen ferner: Denen, die Gott lieben, dient alles nur zum Besten, weil sie nach seinem Vorsatz (zum Heil) berufen sind. 
[8:29] Denn die er vorher hat erkannt, die hat er auch vorherbestimmt, daß sie dem Bild seines Sohnes ähnlich werden; denn der soll sein der Erstgeborene unter vielen Brüdern. 
[8:30] Und die er hat vorherbestimmt, die hat er auch berufen. Die er berufen hat, die hat er auch gerecht gemacht. Die er gerecht gemacht hat, die hat er auch verherrlicht. 
[8:31] Was folgt hieraus? Ist Gott für uns, wer kann da streiten wider uns? 
[8:32] Der seinen eigenen Sohn nicht hat verschont, vielmehr zu unser aller Heil ihn hingegeben, wie sollte der nun mit ihm uns nicht alles schenken? 
[8:33] Wer wagt es, Gottes Auserwählte zu verklagen? Gott selbst spricht sie ja frei! 
[8:34] Wer will sie verdammen? Christus Jesus ist gestorben! Noch mehr: Er ist auch auferstanden, er sitzt zur Rechten Gottes und tritt sogar fürbittend für uns ein! 
[8:35] Wer kann uns also trennen von der Liebe Christi? Trübsal, Angst, Verfolgung, Hunger, Blöße? Gefahr und Henkerbeil? 
[8:36] Das alles droht uns; denn es steht geschrieben: "Um deinetwillen werden wir den ganzen Tag dahingemordet. Man sieht uns an wie Schafe, die man schlachtet." 
[8:37] In all diesen Kämpfen aber siegen wir aufs herrlichste; denn uns hilft er, der uns geliebt! 
[8:38] Fürwahr, ich bin gewiß: Nicht Tod noch Leben, nicht Engel noch Gewalten, nicht Gegenwart noch Zukunft 
[8:39] nicht Kräfte aus der Höhe oder Tiefe, nichts in der ganzen weiten Welt wird je uns trennen können von der Liebe Gottes, die wir schmecken in der Gemeinschaft Christi Jesu, unseres Herrn. 
[9:1] Ich rede die Wahrheit als einer, der mit Christus in Gemeinschaft steht; ich lüge nicht. Mein durch den Heiligen Geist erleuchtetes Gewissen zeugt für mich, wenn ich hier beteuere: 
[9:2] Ich habe tiefe Traurigkeit, und ein steter Gram nagt an meinem Herzen. 
[9:3] Ja ich habe oft zu Gott gefleht, er möge mich aus der Gemeinschaft Christi stoßen und dem Verderben überliefern, wenn das zur Rettung meiner Brüder, meiner irdischen Stammverwandten, dienen könne. 
[9:4] Sie tragen den Ehrennamen Israeliten. Sie haben die Sohneswürde. In ihrer Mitte ist des Herrn Herrlichkeit erschienen. Ihnen sind die (göttlichen) Verordnungen zuteil geworden. Sie haben das Gesetz, den Gottesdienst und die Verheißungen empfangen. 
[9:5] Ihnen gehören die Erzväter an. Aus ihnen ist der Messias seiner Menschheit nach hervorgegangen —, der da ist Herr über alles und als Gott zu preisen in Ewigkeit. Amen. 
[9:6] Damit will ich aber nicht sagen, daß Gottes Zusage hinfällig geworden wäre. Denn nicht alle, die von Israel stammen, gehören zu dem (wahren) Israel. 
[9:7] Heißen doch auch nicht alle Nachkommen Abrahams ausnahmslos seine Kinder, sondern: "Nur Isaaks Kinder sollen deine Nachkommen heißen." 
[9:8] Also: nicht die leiblichen Nachkommen Abrahams sind damit auch schon Kinder Gottes, sondern nur die Kinder der Verheißung werden als Abrahams echte Nachkommen betrachtet. 
[9:9] Denn es ist ein Verheißungswort: Um diese Zeit will ich wiederkommen, dann soll Sara einen Sohn haben. 
[9:10] Und ganz dasselbe gilt auch bei Rebekka. Sie war guter Hoffnung von einem Mann, unserem Vater Isaak. 
[9:11] Als aber die Kinder noch nicht geboren waren und folglich auch noch nichts Gutes oder Böses getan hatten, schon da traf Gott eine Auswahl. 
[9:12] Die blieb in voller Kraft und hing nicht ab von dem Verhalten des Menschen, sondern von dem Willen des Berufenden. Darum erging auch an Rebekka des Wort: Der Ältere soll dem Jüngeren dienstbar sein. 
[9:13] Und anderswo steht geschrieben: Jakob habe ich geliebt, und Esau habe ich gehaßt. 
[9:14] Was folgt hieraus? Gibt's etwa Ungerechtigkeit bei Gott? Nimmermehr! 
[9:15] Zu Mose sagt er ja: Ich werde gnädig sein, wem ich will, und mich erbarmen, wes ich will. 
[9:16] Demnach kommt es nicht an auf menschliches Wollen oder Laufen, sondern auf Gottes Erbarmen. 
[9:17] Sagt doch die Schrift zu Pharao: Gerade darum habe ich dich zum König bestellt, um an dir meine Macht zu erweisen und meinen Namen auf der ganzen Erde kundzumachen. 
[9:18] Also: Gott ist gnädig, wem er will, und verstockt, wen er will. 
[9:19] Nun kannst du mir einwenden: "Wie kann Gott dann noch jemand tadeln? Kann man denn seinem Willen widerstehen?" 
[9:20] O Mensch, wer bist du, daß du Gott widersprechen willst? Darf etwa das Bild zu seinem Bildner sagen: Warum hast du mich gerade so gemacht? 
[9:21] Hat der Töpfer nicht freie Verfügung über seinen Ton? Kann er nicht aus derselben Masse verschiedene Gefäße bilden — das eine zur Zier, das andere zum gewöhnlichen Gebrauch? 
[9:22] Was willst du nun sagen, wenn Gott, obwohl er einst sein Zorngericht offenbaren und seine Macht erweisen will, zum Verderben reife Zorngefäße dennoch bisher in großer Langmut getragen hat, 
[9:23] und zwar deshalb, um zu gleicher Zeit den Reichtum seiner Herrlichkeit zu zeigen an Gefäßen des Erbarmens, die er vorbereitet hat für die zukünftige Herrlichkeit? 
[9:24] Und sind wir nicht solche Gefäße? Gerade dazu hat er uns berufen nicht nur aus den Juden, sondern auch aus den Heiden. 
[9:25] Darum spricht Gott bei Hosea: Was nicht mein Volk ist, das will ich mein Volk nennen, und die nicht Geliebte soll Geliebte heißen. 
[9:26] Ja, an dem Ort, wo zu ihnen gesagt worden ist: "Ihr seid nicht mein Volk", da sollen sie Söhne des lebendigen Gottes heißen. 
[9:27] Und Jesaja ruft über Israel aus: Wären auch die Kinder Israels so zahlreich wie der Meeressand, so soll doch der Überrest errettet werden. 
[9:28] Denn der Herr will sein Strafurteil in Kürze vollstrecken auf der Erde. 
[9:29] Und — wie Jesaja vorhergesagt hat —: Hätte uns der Herr der Heerscharen nicht ein Saatkorn übriggelassen, so wäre es uns ergangen wie Sodom, und wir hätten Gomorras Schicksal geteilt. 
[9:30] Was folgt nun hieraus? Heiden, die nicht nach Gerechtigkeit gestrebt, haben Gerechtigkeit erlangt: nämlich die Gerechtigkeit, die aus dem Glauben kommt. 
[9:31] Israel aber, das durch Erfüllung des Gesetzes Gerechtigkeit erlangen wollte, hat dies von dem Gesetz gesteckte Ziel nicht erreicht. 
[9:32] Und warum nicht? Weil es dies Ziel nicht erreichen wollte durch Glauben, sondern durch Werke. 
[9:33] Darum hat es sich auch gestoßen an dem Stein des Anstoßes, wie geschrieben steht: Siehe, ich lege in Zion einen Stein des Anstoßes und einen Fels des Strauchelns; wer auf ihn vertraut, der soll nicht zuschanden werden. 
[10:1] Brüder, von ganzem Herzen sehne ich mich nach ihrer Rettung und bete auch deshalb für sie zu Gott. 
[10:2] Ich muß ihnen ja das Zeugnis geben, daß sie Eifer haben für Gott; doch es fehlt ihnen dabei die rechte Erkenntnis. 
[10:3] Denn weil sie Gottes Gerechtigkeit verkannten und nur darauf bedacht waren, ihre eigene Gerechtigkeit geltend zu machen, darum haben sie sich der Gerechtigkeit Gottes nicht unterworfen. 
[10:4] Christus hat dem Gesetz ein Ende gemacht, damit Gerechtigkeit empfange jeder, der da glaubt. 
[10:5] Mose schreibt von der Gerechtigkeit, die aus dem Gesetz kommt: Der Mensch, der des Gesetzes Vorschriften erfüllt, wird dadurch leben. 
[10:6] Aber die Gerechtigkeit, die aus dem Glauben kommt, spricht so: Du darfst nicht sagen in deinem Herzen: Wer wird in den Himmel hinaufsteigen? — um Christus von dort herabzuholen — 
[10:7] oder: Wer wird in die Unterwelt hinabsteigen? — um Christus von den Toten heraufzuholen —. 
[10:8] Was sagt ihr vielmehr? Das Herz ist dir nahe; es ist in deinem Mund und in deinem Herzen: das Wort, das Glauben fordert, und das wir verkündigen. 
[10:9] Bekennst du nämlich mit deinem Mund Jesus als den Herrn und glaubst du mit deinem Herzen, daß Gott ihn von den Toten auferweckt hat, so wirst du gerettet werden. 
[10:10] Denn mit dem Herzen glaubt man und erlangt dadurch Gerechtigkeit, und mit dem Mund bekennt man und erlangt dadurch Errettung. 
[10:11] Sagt doch die Schrift: Alle, die an ihn glauben, sollen nicht zuschanden werden. 
[10:12] Denn hier gibt es keinen Unterschied zwischen Juden und Griechen. Sie alle haben denselben Herrn, und der ist unendlich gnädig gegen alle, die ihn anrufen. 
[10:13] Denn: Alle, die den Namen des Herrn anrufen, sollen errettet werden. 
[10:14] Wie können sie ihn aber anrufen, ohne an ihn zu glauben? Und wie können sie glauben, ohne von ihm gehört zu haben? Wie können sie ferner (von ihm) hören ohne Prediger? 
[10:15] Und wie kann jemand predigen, ohne dazu gesandt zu sein? Darum steht auch geschrieben: Wie lieblich sind die Füße derer, die gute Botschaft bringen! 
[10:16] Doch nicht alle haben die Heilsbotschaft im Glauben aufgenommen. Denn Jesaja spricht: Herr, wer hat unserer Predigt geglaubt? 
[10:17] Mithin kommt der Glaube aus der Predigt, und die Predigt geschieht in Christi Auftrag. 
[10:18] Doch — so frage ich — haben sie vielleicht die Predigt nicht vernommen? O freilich, denn: Über die ganze Erde ist die Stimme der Prediger erschallt, und ihre Worte sind gedrungen bis ans Ende der Welt. 
[10:19] Aber — so frage ich weiter — hat Israel vielleicht die Predigt nicht verstanden? O gewiß; denn schon Mose spricht: Durch ein Volk, das kein Volk ist, will ich eure Eifersucht erregen, durch ein unverständiges Volk will ich euch erbittern. 
[10:20] Und Jesaja sagt frei und offen: Ich bin gefunden worden von denen, die mich nicht gesucht; ich bin bekannt geworden denen, die nicht nach mir gefragt. 
[10:21] Von Israel aber spricht er: Den ganzen Tag habe ich meine Arme (liebend) ausgestreckt nach einem Volk, das voll Ungehorsam ist und Widerspruch. 
[11:1] Ich frage nun: Hat Gott sein Volk verstoßen? Nimmermehr! Ich bin doch auch ein Israelit, entsprossen aus Abrahams Geschlecht, aus dem Stamm Benjamin. 
[11:2] Gott hat sein Volk nicht verstoßen, das er sich einst zum Eigentum erwählt. Wißt ihr nicht, was die Schrift in der Geschichte von Elia sagt? Der klagt vor Gott über Israel: 
[11:3] Herr, sie haben deine Propheten getötet und deine Altäre umgestürzt; ich allein bin übriggeblieben, und sie trachten mir nach dem Leben. 
[11:4] Doch wie lautet Gottes Antwort? Ich habe mir 7000 Männer erhalten, die nie ihre Knie gebeugt haben vor Baal. 
[11:5] Ebenso gibt's auch heute einen (treuen) Überrest, den Gottes Gnade auserwählt hat. 
[11:6] Ist aber hier die Gnade ausschlaggebend, dann können keine Werke dabei in Frage kommen. Sonst wäre ja die Gnade keine Gnade mehr. 
[11:7] Wie steht's also? Was Israel erstrebt, das hat es (als Gesamtheit) nicht erlangt. Nur die Auserwählten haben es erlangt. Die anderen aber sind verstockt, 
[11:8] wie geschrieben steht: Gott hat ihnen einen Geist der Schläfrigkeit gegeben — Augen, um nicht zu sehen, und Ohren, um nicht zu hören — bis auf den heutigen Tag. 
[11:9] Und David sagt: Ihr Tisch soll ihnen zur Schlinge werden und zum Strick, zur Falle und zur Vergeltung! 
[11:10] Ihre Augen sollen sich verdunkeln, daß sie nicht sehen; und ihre Rücken beuge immerdar! 
[11:11] Ich frage nun: Sind sie deshalb gestrauchelt, um ins Verderben zu fallen? Nimmermehr! Sondern durch ihren Fehltritt ist das Heil zu den Heiden gekommen, damit sie dadurch gereizt würden, auch selbst das Heil zu suchen. 
[11:12] Hat nun aber schon der Fehltritt der Juden die Welt reich gemacht, und hat schon die kleine Zahl, die aus ihrer Mitte gläubig geworden ist, den Heiden solchen Segen zugeführt, wie groß wird da erst der Segen für die Heiden sein, wenn sich einst die Vollzahl der Juden bekehrt? 
[11:13] Jetzt wende ich mich an euch, ihr Heidenchristen. Gerade ich bin ja in besonderem Sinn Heidenapostel. Aber es ist doch auch eine Ehre für mein Amt, 
[11:14] wenn ich versuche, in (meinen Landsleuten,) meinem Fleisch und Blut, den Eifer (für die Frohe Botschaft) zu wecken und wenigstens einige von ihnen zum Heil zu führen. 
[11:15] Denn hat schon ihre Verwerfung der Heidenwelt (die Wohltaten der) Versöhnung gebracht, was wird dann ihre Wiederannahme mit sich bringen? Nichts anderes als die Auferstehung aus den Toten. 
[11:16] Ist das Erstlingsbrot heilig, so ist auch der ganze Teig heilig; und ist die Wurzel heilig, dann sind es auch die Zweige. 
[11:17] Sind aber einige Zweige abgebrochen, und bist du als Zweig eines wilden Ölbaums an ihrer Stelle eingepfropft worden und hast nun Anteil an der Wurzel und dem Saft des edlen Ölbaums: 
[11:18] so erhebe dich nicht in Hochmut über die (abgehauenen) Zweige! Erhebst du dich trotzdem, so bedenke: nicht du trägst die Wurzel, sondern die Wurzel trägt dich. 
[11:19] Du kannst nun sagen: "Die Zweige sind abgebrochen worden, weil ich eingepfropft werden sollte." 
[11:20] Ganz recht! Sie sind wegen ihres Unglaubens abgebrochen worden; und du stehst an ihrer Stelle, weil du glaubst. Sei nicht hochmütig, sondern fürchte dich! 
[11:21] Denn hat Gott die natürlichen Zweige nicht verschont, so könnte er vielleicht dich auch nicht verschonen. 
[11:22] So schau denn hin auf Gottes Güte und auf Gottes Strenge! Gegen die Gefallenen offenbart sich Gottes Strenge. An dir aber erweist sich seine Güte, wenn du im Guten treu verharrst. Sonst wirst du auch abgehauen. 
[11:23] Umgekehrt sollen jene, wenn sie nicht im Unglauben verharren, wieder eingepfropft werden. Denn Gott hat die Macht, sie wieder einzupfropfen. 
[11:24] Bist du herausgeschnitten aus dem wilden Ölbaum, dem du ursprünglich angehörst, und im Widerspruch mit deiner Herkunft einem edlen Ölbaum eingepfropft worden: wieviel leichter können diese ihrem angestammten Ölbaum, dem sie ursprünglich als Zweige angehören, wieder eingepfropft werden! 
[11:25] Damit ihr euch nicht selbst für weise haltet, liebe Brüder, will ich euch hier Kunde geben über ein Geheimnis: Verstockung ist über einen Teil von Israel gekommen, und die wird so lange währen, bis der Heiden Vollzahl (in der Kirche) eingegangen ist. 
[11:26] Dann wird ganz Israel gerettet werden, wie geschrieben steht: Es wird aus Zion kommen der Erretter, der wird von Jakob wegtun das gottlose Wesen. 
[11:27] So will ich einen Bund mit ihnen schließen, wenn ich hinweggenommen habe ihre Sünden. 
[11:28] Weil die Juden zur Zeit gegen die Heilsbotschaft verstockt sind, stehen sie Gott feindlich gegenüber, und das kommt euch zugute. Weil sie aber auserwählt sind, werden sie noch immer um der Väter willen von Gott geliebt. 
[11:29] Denn Gott nimmt seine Gnadengaben und Berufung nicht zurück. 
[11:30] Wie ihr einst ungehorsam gegen Gott gewesen seid, nun aber sein Erbarmen erfahren habt zu einer Zeit, wo sie ungehorsam sind: 
[11:31] so sind sie jetzt ungehorsam zu einer Zeit, wo ihr Barmherzigkeit erfahrt, damit auch sie dereinst Erbarmen finden. 
[11:32] Denn Gott hat sie als Volk in den Kerker des Unglaubens eingeschlossen, um sich (einst) des ganzen Volkes zu erbarmen. 
[11:33] Wie unergründlich tief ist Gottes Gnadenfülle, Weisheit und Erkenntnis! Wie unerforschlich sind seine Gerichte, wie unbegreiflich seine Wege! 
[11:34] Denn: Wer hat des Herrn Sinn verstanden? Und wer hat ihn beraten? 
[11:35] Wer hätte ihm etwas geschenkt, was ihm vergolten werden müßte? 
[11:36] Von ihm, durch ihn, für ihn sind alle Dinge. Ihm sei Lobpreis in Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[12:1] Ich ermahne euch nun, liebe Brüder, weiht Gott aus Dankbarkeit für seine Erbarmung euern Leib als ein lebendiges, heiliges, Gott wohlgefälliges Opfer! So verrichtet ihr einen geistlichen Gottesdienst. 
[12:2] Bildet euch nicht nach den Grundsätzen dieser Weltzeit! Nehmt vielmehr ein anderes Wesen an, indem sich euer Sinn erneuert! Dann könnt ihr auch recht beurteilen, was Gottes Wille ist, oder mit anderen Worten: was gut ist, gottgefällig und vollkommen. 
[12:3] Kraft der mir geschenkten Gnade warne ich jeden von euch, höher von sich zu denken, als sich ziemt. Jeder denke vielmehr bescheiden von sich, ganz nach dem Maß seines Glaubens, das Gott ihm zugeteilt. 
[12:4] Denn wie wir in einem Leib viele Glieder haben, alle Glieder aber nicht denselben Dienst verrichten: 
[12:5] so bilden wir auch trotz unserer Vielheit einen Leib in der Gemeinschaft Christi; doch dabei ist jeder des anderen Glied. 
[12:6] Nach dem Maß der uns geschenkten Gnade haben wir auch verschiedene Gnadengaben. 
[12:7] Wer Weissagung hat, der übe sie nach der Richtschnur des Glaubens aus! Hat jemand ein Kirchenamt, der bewähre sich darin: der Lehrer betätige sich im Lehren, 
[12:8] der Seelsorger in der Seelsorge; wer (Liebesgaben) austeilt, der sei unparteiisch; wer als Vorsteher dient, der zeige Eifer; wer Werke der Barmherzigkeit übt, der tue es mit freudigem Sinn! 
[12:9] Habt (alle Menschen) aufrichtig lieb! Habt Abscheu vor dem Bösen und Eifer für das Gute! 
[12:10] Kommt einander in herzlicher Bruderliebe entgegen! Gebt einander ein gutes Vorbild in gegenseitiger Wertschätzung! 
[12:11] In euerm Eifer seid nicht träge! Glüht im Geist! Dient dem Herrn! 
[12:12] Seid fröhlich in der Hoffnung, bleibt standhaft in Trübsal, haltet an am Gebet! 
[12:13] Helft eifrig mit an der Unterstützung der Heiligen! Übt fleißig Gastfreundschaft! 
[12:14] Segnet eure Verfolger, segnet und flucht nicht! 
[12:15] Freut euch mit den Fröhlichen, weint mit den Weinenden! 
[12:16] Lebt in Eintracht miteinander! Strebt nicht nach hohen Dingen, sondern zieht mit den Geringen dieselbe Straße! 
[12:17] Halt euch nicht selbst für klug! Vergeltet niemand Böses mit Bösem! Seid bedacht auf das, was in den Augen aller Menschen gut und edel ist! 
[12:18] Lebt wo möglich, soviel an euch liegt, mit allen Menschen in Frieden! 
[12:19] Schafft euch nicht selbst Recht, Geliebte, sondern überlaßt das dem Zorngericht (Gottes)! Denn es steht geschrieben: Mein ist die Rache, ich will vergelten, spricht der Herr. 
[12:20] Darum: Hungert deinen Feind, so speise ihn; dürstet ihn, so tränke ihn! Tust du das, so sammelst du feurige Kohlen auf sein Haupt. 
[12:21] Laß dich nicht vom Bösen überwinden, sondern überwinde das Böse mit Gutem! 
[13:1] Jeder unterwerfe sich den herrschenden Gewalten! Denn es gibt keine obrigkeitliche Gewalt, die nicht von Gott wäre; sondern die bestehenden Obrigkeiten sind von Gott verordnet. 
[13:2] Wer sich also der Obrigkeit widersetzt, der lehnt sich gegen Gottes Ordnung auf. Und solche Empörer ziehen sich selbst gerechte Strafe zu. 
[13:3] Denn die Gewalthaber sind nicht ein Schrecken für gute Taten, sondern für böse. Willst du nicht in Schrecken leben vor der Obrigkeit? So handle gut! Dann erntest du Lob von ihr. 
[13:4] Denn sie ist Gottes Dienerin zu deinem Besten. Tust du aber Böses, so fürchte dich! Denn sie trägt das Richtschwert nicht umsonst. Sie ist Gottes Dienerin, die den Übeltäter strafen soll. 
[13:5] Ihr müßt deshalb (der Obrigkeit) gehorsam sein, nicht nur aus Furcht vor Strafe, sondern auch aus Gewissenspflicht. 
[13:6] Darum entrichtet auch die Steuern! Denn die Träger der Gewalt sind Gottes Diener, und als solche sollen sie beharrlich tätig sein. 
[13:7] So gebt denn jedem, was ihm zukommt: Gebt Steuern dem, der darauf Anspruch hat; gebt Zoll dem, der ihn fordern darf; erweist Ehrfurcht, wem sie zukommt, und Achtung, wem sie gebührt! 
[13:8] Bleibt niemand etwas schuldig als die gegenseitige Liebe! Wer Liebe übt, der hat auch sonst das Gesetz erfüllt. 
[13:9] Denn die Gebote: "Du sollst nicht ehebrechen, du sollst nicht morden, du sollst nicht stehlen, du sollst nicht begehren" und all die anderen Gebote, die werden kurz zusammengefaßt in der Vorschrift: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst! 
[13:10] Die Liebe tut dem Nächsten nichts Böses. Darum ist die Liebe des Gesetzes Erfüllung. 
[13:11] Diese Ermahnung gebe ich euch, weil ihr ja wißt, in welcher Zeit wir leben: Die Stunde ist nun da, wo ihr vom Schlaf erwachen müßt. Denn jetzt ist uns die Errettung näher als damals, wo wir zum Glauben gekommen sind. 
[13:12] Die Nacht ist vorgerückt, der Tag ist nahe. Darum laßt uns ablegen die Werke der Finsternis und anlegen die Waffen des Lichts! 
[13:13] Laßt uns ehrbar wandeln wie am hellen, lichten Tag: nicht in Schwelgerei und Trinkgelagen, nicht in Unzucht und Ausschweifung, nicht in Streit und Eifersucht! 
[13:14] Zieht vielmehr den Herrn Jesus Christus an und pflegt den Leib nicht so, daß böse Begierden erwachen! 
[14:1] Des Glaubensschwachen nehmt euch freundlich an, ohne über abweichende Ansichten mit ihm zu streiten! 
[14:2] Der eine meint, er dürfe alles essen; der Schwache lebt nur von Pflanzenkost. 
[14:3] Wer alles ißt, der soll den nicht verachten, der bestimmte Speisen meidet. Andererseits darf jemand, der bestimmte Speisen meidet, den, der alles ißt, nicht (als Sünder) verurteilen. Gott hat ihn ja in seine Gemeinschaft aufgenommen. 
[14:4] Wer bist du denn, daß du den Diener eines fremden Herrn richten willst? Mag er feststehen oder fallen, das geht doch nur seinen Herrn an. Aber er wird feststehen; denn sein Herr ist stark genug, ihn aufrechtzuerhalten. 
[14:5] Der eine hält einen Tag heiliger als den anderen; der andere achtet alle Tage gleich. Jeder handle hier nach seiner Überzeugung! 
[14:6] Wer einen Tag vor dem anderen auszeichnet, der tut das dem Herrn zu Ehren. Und wer alles ohne Unterschied ißt, der tut es auch dem Herrn zu Ehren: er dankt ja Gott für die Speise. Wer nicht alles ißt, der tut es ebenso zur Ehre des Herrn, und er dankt Gott auch (für die Speise). 
[14:7] Denn keiner von uns lebt für sich, und keiner stirbt für sich. 
[14:8] Leben wir, so leben wir für den Herrn; sterben wir, so sterben wir für den Herrn. Im Leben und im Sterben sind wir des Herrn Eigentum. 
[14:9] Denn dazu ist Christus gestorben und wieder lebendig geworden, daß er über Tote und Lebendige Herr sei. 
[14:10] Mit welchem Recht richtest du über deinen Bruder? Oder mit welchem Recht verachtest du deinen Bruder? Wir alle müssen ja dereinst erscheinen vor Gottes Richterstuhl. 
[14:11] Denn es steht geschrieben: So wahr ich lebe, spricht der Herr, vor mir soll jedes Knie sich beugen, und jede Zunge soll Gott preisen. 
[14:12] Mithin wird jeder von uns für sich selbst Gott Rechenschaft ablegen müssen. 
[14:13] Laßt uns deshalb nicht mehr einander richten! Nehmt euch vielmehr vor, dem Bruder keinen Anstoß oder Ärgernis zu geben! 
[14:14] - Durch den Herrn Jesus belehrt, habe ich die feste Überzeugung, daß nichts an und für sich unrein ist. Wer aber etwas für unrein ansieht, für den ist es dann auch unrein —. 
[14:15] Denn wenn du deinen Bruder durch den Genuß einer Speise betrübst, so wandelst du nicht mehr nach der Liebe. Bring ihn nicht durch dein Essen ins Verderben! 
[14:16] Gebt eure heiligsten Güter nicht der Lästerung preis! 
[14:17] Das Königreich Gottes hat nichts mit Essen und Trinken zu tun, sondern es offenbart sich in Gerechtigkeit, Frieden und Freude, die von dem Heiligen Geist gewirkt werden. 
[14:18] Wer Christus darin dient, der ist Gott wohlgefällig und den Menschen wert. 
[14:19] So laßt uns das im Auge haben, was zum Frieden und zur gegenseitigen Förderung dient! 
[14:20] Zerstöre Gottes Bauwerk nicht um einer Speise willen! "Alles ist rein." Allerdings! Doch wer etwas ißt, wodurch er anderen einen Anstoß gibt, der handelt übel. 
[14:21] Recht handelst du, wenn du auf Fleisch- und Weingenuß verzichtest und auch sonst alles meidest, woran dein Bruder Anstoß nimmt. 
[14:22] Du hast deine Überzeugung. Behalte sie für dich allein! Gott kennt sie. Wohl dem, der keine Gewissensbedenken hat bei dem, was er für recht hält! 
[14:23] Wer aber beim Essen einer Speise im Zweifel ist (ob er wirklich recht tut), der ist damit schon verurteilt. Denn er handelt nicht nach seiner inneren Überzeugung. Was aber nicht aus innerer Überzeugung kommt, das ist samt und sonders Sünde. 
[15:1] Wir Starken haben die Pflicht, der Schwachen Gebrechen zu tragen, und dürfen nicht uns selbst zu Gefallen leben. 
[15:2] Jeder von uns soll seinem Nächsten zu Gefallen leben, um ihm Gutes zu tun und ihn zu fördern. 
[15:3] Auch Christus hat ja nicht sich selbst zu Gefallen gelebt, sondern an ihm erfüllte sich das Schriftwort: Die Schmähungen derer, die dich schmähen, haben mich getroffen. 
[15:4] Alles, was Vorzeiten geschrieben worden ist, das ist zu unserer Belehrung geschrieben, damit wir voll Ausdauer und gestärkt durch den Trost, den wir aus der Schrift schöpfen, an der Hoffnung festhalten. 
[15:5] Gott aber, der Ausdauer und Trost verleiht, gewähre euch, im Sinne Christi in Eintracht zu leben, 
[15:6] damit ihr einmütig wie mit einem Mund den Gott und Vater unseres Herrn Jesus Christus preist. — 
[15:7] So nehme sich denn einer des anderen freundlich an, wie sich auch Christus unser angenommen hat zur Ehre Gottes. 
[15:8] Ich meine hier: Christus ist ein Diener der Juden geworden, um Gottes Wahrhaftigkeit zu erweisen; denn die den Vätern gegebenen Verheißungen sollten erfüllt werden. 
[15:9] Die Heiden aber haben Gott zu preisen für seine (unverdiente) Barmherzigkeit, wie geschrieben steht: Darum will ich dich rühmen unter den Heiden und deinem Namen lobsingen. 
[15:10] Und an einer anderen Stelle heißt es: Freut euch, ihr Heiden, mit seinem Volk! 
[15:11] Und anderswo: Lobt den Herrn, alle Heiden! Es sollen ihn preisen alle Völker. 
[15:12] Jesaja endlich sagt: Kommen wird Isais Sproß, und der sich erhebt als Herrscher der Heiden. Auf ihn werden die Völker hoffen. 
[15:13] Gott aber, der die Hoffnung wirkt, erfülle euch mit reicher Freude und mit Frieden im Glauben, damit ihr überreich an Hoffnung seid durch die Kraft des Heiligen Geistes! 
[15:14] Ich bin ganz überzeugt davon, liebe Brüder, daß ihr auch ohne meine Belehrung voll guter Gesinnung seid, reich an aller Erkenntnis und fähig, einander zurechtzuweisen. 
[15:15] Trotzdem habe ich euch, wenigstens an einigen Stellen, recht kühn geschrieben, freilich nur, um euch an das zu erinnern, was ihr schon wißt. Das habe ich getan, weil mir Gott in seiner Gnade den Auftrag geschenkt hat, 
[15:16] ein Diener Christi Jesu zu sein, um den Heiden Gottes Frohe Botschaft priesterlich zu verkünden, damit die Heiden ein Gott wohlgefälliges Opfer werden, das durch den Heiligen Geist geheiligt ist. 
[15:17] Ich darf mich darum in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus wohl auch dessen rühmen, was ich für Gottes Sache getan habe. 
[15:18] Freilich hätte ich nie den Mut, von Erfolgen zu reden, die Christus bei der Heidenbekehrung durch andere und nicht durch meine Arbeit errungen hat mit Wort und Tat, 
[15:19] mit mächtigen Zeichen und Wundern und in der Kraft des Heiligen Geistes. So habe ich, ausgehend von Jerusalem, in weitem Bogen bis nach Illyrien hin Christi Frohe Botschaft ausgerichtet. 
[15:20] Dabei ist es aber eine Ehrensache für mich gewesen, die Frohe Botschaft nirgends zu verkündigen, wo Christi Name schon bekannt war. Denn ich wollte nicht auf fremdem Grund weiterbauen, 
[15:21] sondern handeln nach dem Schriftwort: Denen nichts von ihm verkündet worden ist, die sollen ihn sehen und die nicht von ihm gehört haben, die sollen ihn kennenlernen. 
[15:22] Deswegen bin ich auch so oft verhindert worden, zu euch zu kommen. 
[15:23] Jetzt aber, wo ich in diesen Gegenden kein Arbeitsfeld mehr finde und noch dazu seit vielen Jahren Sehnsucht nach euch habe, 
[15:24] (jetzt will ich euch besuchen,) wenn ich nach Spanien reise. Ich hoffe, euch auf der Durchreise zu sehen und von euch dorthin geleitet zu werden, nachdem ich mich zunächst an euerm Verkehr eine Zeitlang erquickt habe. 
[15:25] Augenblicklich bin ich auf der Reise nach Jerusalem, um den dortigen Heiligen eine Liebesgabe zu bringen. 
[15:26] Mazedonien und Achaja haben sich gern dazu verstanden, für die Armen in der Gemeinde in Jerusalem eine Beisteuer zu sammeln. 
[15:27] Ich sage: sie haben sich gern dazu verstanden; und das sind sie ihnen auch schuldig. Denn haben die Heiden an den geistlichen Gütern der Gläubigen in Jerusalem Anteil, so ist's auch ihre Pflicht, ihnen mit ihren irdischen Gütern zu dienen. 
[15:28] Habe ich nun dies Geschäft erledigt und ihnen den Ertrag der Sammlung sicher eingehändigt, so will ich über Rom nach Spanien reisen. 
[15:29] Ich weiß aber, daß ich euch bei meinem Besuch Christi Segensfülle mitbringe. 
[15:30] Nun bitte ich euch, liebe Brüder, in dem Namen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus und bei der Liebe, womit uns der Heilige Geist verbindet: Steht mir als treue Kampfgenossen zur Seite und fleht für mich zu Gott, 
[15:31] damit ich den Nachstellungen der Ungläubigen in Judäa entgehe und die Liebesgabe, die ich nach Jerusalem bringen will, von den Heiligen dort gut aufgenommen werde! 
[15:32] Dann kann ich, wenn es Gottes Wille ist, in freudiger Stimmung zu euch kommen und im Verkehr mit euch Erquickung finden. 
[15:33] Der Gott des Friedens sei mit euch allen! Amen. 
[16:1] Ich empfehle euch unsere Schwester Phöbe, eine Diakonisse der Gemeinde in Kenchreä. 
[16:2] Nehmt sie im Sinn des Herrn auf, wie sich's für Heilige ziemt, und steht ihr bei, wo sie euer bedarf! Auch sie hat vielen geholfen, besonders mir. 
[16:3] Grüßt Priska und Aquila, meine Mitarbeiter im Dienst Christi Jesu! 
[16:4] Sie haben einst ihren Kopf eingesetzt, um mir das Leben zu retten. Ihnen sind mit mir auch alle Gemeinden der Heidenchristen zu Dank verpflichtet. 
[16:5] Grüßt auch ihre Hausgemeinde! Grüßt meinen lieben Epänetus, der in Asien zuerst an Christus gläubig geworden ist! 
[16:6] Grüßt Maria, die sich so treu für euch gemüht hat! 
[16:7] Grüßt meine Volksgenossen Andronikus und Junias, die einst meine Gefangenschaft geteilt haben! Sie werden hochgeschätzt von den Aposteln und sind vor mir an Christus gläubig geworden. 
[16:8] Grüßt Amplias: er ist mir teuer in dem Herrn! 
[16:9] Grüßt Urbanus, unseren Mitarbeiter im Dienst Christi, und meinen lieben Stachys! 
[16:10] Grüßt Apelles, den bewährten Jünger Christi! Grüßt die Brüder aus dem Hause Aristobuls! 
[16:11] Grüßt meinen Volksgenossen Herodion! Grüßt alle aus dem Hause des Narzissus, die in des Herrn Gemeinschaft stehen! 
[16:12] Grüßt Tryphäna und Tryphosa! Sie mühen sich ab im Dienst des Herrn. Grüßt meine liebe Persis! Sie hat viel gearbeitet im Dienst des Herrn. 
[16:13] Grüßt den im Herrn auserwählten Rufus und seine Mutter, die auch mich wie eine Mutter liebt! 
[16:14] Grüßt Asynkritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas und die mit ihnen verbundenen Brüder! 
[16:15] Grüßt Philologus und Julia, Nereus und seine Schwester und Olympas und alle mit ihnen verbundenen Heiligen! 
[16:16] Grüßt einander mit dem heiligen Kuß! Es grüßen euch alle Gemeinden Christi. 
[16:17] Ich ermahne euch, Brüder: Hütet euch vor den Leuten, die die (bekannten) Spaltungen und Ärgernisse anrichten im Widerspruch mit der Lehre, die ihr gelernt habt! Geht diesen Menschen aus dem Weg! 
[16:18] Denn sie dienen nicht unserem Herrn Christus, sondern ihrem Bauch, und durch ihre wohlmeinend klingenden Reden und schönen Worte täuschen sie die Herzen der Unerfahrenen. 
[16:19] Doch euer Glaubensgehorsam ist überall bekannt. Darum habe ich meine Freude an euch. Nun möchte ich auch, ihr wähltet in Weisheit stets das Gute und bliebet unbefleckt vom Bösen. 
[16:20] Der Gott des Friedens wird den Satan bald zermalmen unter euern Füßen. Die Gnade unseres Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit euch! 
[16:21] Es grüßen euch mein Mitarbeiter Timotheus und meine Volksgenossen Lucius, Jason und Sosipater. 
[16:22] - Ich, Tertius, der Schreiber dieses Briefes, grüße euch im Herrn. — 
[16:23] Es grüßt euch Gajus, der mir und der ganzen Gemeinde Herberge gibt. Es grüßen euch Erastus, der Stadtkämmerer, und der Bruder Quartus. 
[16:24]  
[16:25] Ihm aber, der euch stärken kann im Glauben an meine Heilsverkündigung und an die Botschaft Jesu Christi, worin sich ein Geheimnis offenbart, das ewiglang verschwiegen war, 
[16:26] jetzt aber kundgemacht und durch die Auslegung der Schriften der Propheten nach dem Befehl des ewigen Gottes allen Völkern bekannt geworden ist, um sie dem Glauben gehorsam zu machen, 
[16:27] - ihm, dem allein weisen Gott, ihm sei durch Jesus Christus Lobpreis in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 

### I Corinthians

[1:1] Paulus, nach Gottes Willen zum Apostel Christi Jesu berufen, und der Bruder Sosthenes 
[1:2] begrüßen die Gemeinde Gottes in Korinth, deren Glieder als berufene Heilige in der Lebensgemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus auch geheiligt sind, und zwar zugleich mit allen, die überall (auf Erden) den Namen Jesu Christi, der ihr und unser Herr ist, (im Gebet) anrufen. 
[1:3] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:4] Ich danke meinem Gott allezeit euretwegen für die Gnade Gottes, die euch in Christus Jesus zuteil geworden ist. 
[1:5] In der Lebensgemeinschaft mit ihm seid ihr mit aller Art Belehrung und Erkenntnis in jeder Hinsicht reichlich ausgestattet worden. 
[1:6] Denn das Zeugnis von Christus hat unter euch tief Wurzeln geschlagen. 
[1:7] Darum steht ihr auch (hinter den anderen Gemeinden) in keiner Gnadengabe zurück, während ihr voll Sehnsucht auf die Offenbarung unseres Herrn Jesus Christus wartet. 
[1:8] Der wird euch auch bis ans Ende stärken, damit ihr an dem Tag unseres Herrn Jesus Christus unsträflich erfunden werden könnt. 
[1:9] Denn Gott ist treu, durch den ihr zur Gemeinschaft mit seinem Sohn Jesus Christus, unserem Herrn, berufen worden seid. 
[1:10] Ich ermahne euch, Brüder, bei dem Namen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus: Seid einig untereinander! Duldet keine Spaltungen unter euch, sondern steht in derselben Gesinnung und in derselben Überzeugung in festgefügter Einheit da! 
[1:11] Von den Leuten in Chloe habe ich über euch erfahren, meine Brüder, daß es Streitigkeiten unter euch gibt. 
[1:12] Ich will mich noch deutlicher ausdrücken. Der eine von euch sagt: "Ich bin des Paulus Jünger", der andere: "Ich bin des Apollos Jünger", ein dritter: "Ich bin des Kephas Jünger", ein vierter: "Ich bin Christi Jünger." 
[1:13] Ist Christus denn zerteilt? Ist etwa Paulus für euch gekreuzigt, oder seid ihr auf des Paulus Namen getauft worden? 
[1:14] Ich danke Gott, daß ich weiter keinen von euch getauft habe als Krispus und Gajus. 
[1:15] So kann doch niemand behaupten, ihr wäret auf meinen Namen getauft worden. 
[1:16] Doch halt, ich habe ja auch die Hausgenossen des Stephanus getauft. Sonst wüßte ich nicht, daß ich noch jemand getauft hätte. 
[1:17] Denn Christus hat mich nicht gesandt, um zu taufen, sondern um die Frohe Botschaft zu verkünden, aber nicht in der prunkvollen Rede der Weltweisen, damit Christi Kreuz nicht seine Kraft verliere. 
[1:18] Das Wort vom Kreuz ist freilich denen, die verlorengehen, Torheit, uns aber, die zum Heil gelangen, ist es eine Gotteskraft. 
[1:19] Denn es steht geschrieben: "Vernichten will ich die Weisheit der Weisen, die Klugheit der Klugen zuschanden machen." 
[1:20] Wo (sagt mir) bleiben die Weisen: die Schriftgelehrten und die Redekünstler, die vor den Leuten glänzen? Hat nicht Gott die Weltweisheit als Torheit kundgemacht? 
[1:21] Da, wo Gott seine Weisheit kundtat, hat die Welt Gott nicht erkannt mit ihrer Weisheit. Darum hat es Gott gefallen, durch eine Predigt, die der Welt als Torheit gilt, zum Heil zu führen alle, die ihr glauben. 
[1:22] Die Juden fordern zwar noch weiter Wunderzeichen, die Griechen trachten nach wie vor nach Weisheit. 
[1:23] Wir aber sind Herolde Christi, des Gekreuzigten. Das ist ein Ärgernis den Juden, den Heiden eine Torheit. 
[1:24] Für alle aber, die berufen sind aus Juden und aus Griechen, beweist sich Christus, den wir predigen, als Gottes Kraft und Gottes Weisheit. 
[1:25] Denn Gottes Taten, die den Menschen töricht scheinen, sind weiser als die Menschen. Und Gottes Taten, die den Menschen schwach erscheinen, sind stärker als die Menschen. 
[1:26] Seht doch einmal: wer ist bei euch zum Heil berufen, Brüder? Da finden sich nicht viele Einflußreiche, nicht viele Edelgeborene. 
[1:27] Vielmehr, was der Welt als töricht gilt, das hat sich Gott erwählt, damit er die Weisen beschäme. Und was der Welt als schwach gilt, das hat sich Gott erwählt, damit er das Starke beschäme. 
[1:28] Und was der Welt als unedel gilt und was sie verachtet, ja was nichts für sie ist, das hat sich Gott erwählt, damit er vernichte, was etwas gilt. 
[1:29] Denn kein Mensch soll sich rühmen vor Gott. 
[1:30] Ihm allein verdankt ihr's auch, daß ihr in Christi Jesu Gemeinschaft steht. Den hat uns Gott geschenkt als Weisheit, als Gerechtigkeit, Heiligung und Erlösung. 
[1:31] So geht das Schriftwort in Erfüllung: "Wer sich rühmt, der rühme sich des Herrn!" 
[2:1] Auch ich, liebe Brüder, bin unter euch bei der Verkündigung des mir von Gott aufgetragenen Zeugnisses nicht mit hervorragender Beredsamkeit und Weisheit aufgetreten. 
[2:2] Denn ich wollte euch weiter nichts verkündigen als Jesus Christus — ihn, den Gekreuzigten. 
[2:3] Ich hatte während meines Aufenthalts bei euch von (leiblicher) Schwachheit zu leiden und war mit Furcht und großem Zagen erfüllt. 
[2:4] Meine Rede und Verkündigung waren frei von allen Worten, wodurch menschliche Weisheit überzeugen will. Dafür aber waren sie begleitet von deutlichen Wirkungen des Geistes und (göttlicher) Kraft. 
[2:5] Denn euer Glaube sollte sich nicht auf Menschenweisheit gründen, sondern auf Gottes Kraft. 
[2:6] Von Weisheit wissen wir freilich auch zu reden, wenn wir es mit geistlich Reifen zu tun haben. Doch das ist keine Weisheit, die dieser Welt angehört, oder die man bei den Machthabern dieser Welt, die dem Untergang geweiht sind, zu finden pflegt. 
[2:7] Sondern die Weisheit, die wir vortragen, ist (der Welt) verborgen, und schon vor aller Zeit hat sie Gott zu unserer Verherrlichung vorherbestimmt. 
[2:8] Keiner von den Machthabern dieser Welt hat diese Weisheit erkannt — sonst hätten sie den Herrn der Herrlichkeit sicher nicht gekreuzigt —. 
[2:9] Nach dem Zeugnis der Schrift redet sie vielmehr von Dingen, die kein Auge gesehen und wovon kein Ohr gehört; ja, des Menschen Herz ahnt nicht von ferne, was Gott bereitet hat denen, die ihn lieben. 
[2:10] Uns aber hat es Gott offenbart durch den Geist. Denn der Geist erforscht alles, sogar die Tiefen Gottes. 
[2:11] Denn wer weiß, was in dem Inneren eines Menschen vorgeht? Das weiß nur der Geist, der in dem betreffenden Menschen ist. Ebenso kennt auch niemand das innere Wesen Gottes als nur der Geist Gottes. 
[2:12] Wir haben nun aber nicht den Geist der Welt empfangen, sondern den Geist, der von Gott ausgeht, um das zu erkennen, was uns von Gott aus Gnaden geschenkt worden ist. 
[2:13] Und gerade dies verkündigen wir auch, freilich nicht in Worten, die menschliche Weisheit lehrt, sondern in solchen Worten, die der Geist lehrt: so bringen wir für Geistesmenschen geistliche Dinge zum Ausdruck. 
[2:14] Ein seelischer Mensch nimmt nichts an, was Gottes Geist ihm schenken will. Denn es erscheint ihm töricht, und er kann es nicht verstehen, weil es geistlich beurteilt werden muß. 
[2:15] Der Geistesmensch dagegen weiß alles (recht) zu beurteilen, während er selbst (in seinem inneren Wesen und Leben) von niemand (recht) beurteilt (und begriffen) werden kann. 
[2:16] Denn: Wer hat des Herrn Sinn erkannt, so daß er ihn belehren könnte? Wir aber haben Christi Sinn. 
[3:1] Auch ich, Brüder, habe zu euch nicht reden können wie zu geistlichen Menschen, sondern nur wie zu fleischlichen. Ich mußte euch bei der Verkündigung der Wahrheit Christi wie unmündige Kinder behandeln. 
[3:2] Darum habe ich euch nur Milch gereicht und keine feste Speise; denn die konntet ihr damals noch nicht vertragen. 
[3:3] Und nicht einmal heute könnt ihr sie vertragen. Denn ihr seid noch immer fleischlich. Es herrschen ja Eifersucht und Streit unter euch. Ist das nicht ein Beweis dafür, daß ihr fleischlich seid und ganz wie andere Menschen dahinlebt? 
[3:4] Wenn der eine sagt: "Ich bin des Paulus Jünger" und der andere: "Ich bin des Apollos Jünger" — treibt ihr's dann nicht genau so wie andere Menschen? 
[3:5] Was ist denn Apollos? Und was ist Paulus? Sie sind weiter nichts als Diener, durch die ihr zum Glauben gekommen seid. Und zwar dient jeder von uns beiden so, wie es der Herr ihm aufgetragen hat. 
[3:6] Ich habe gepflanzt, Apollos hat begossen, Gott aber hat es wachsen lassen. 
[3:7] Das Verdienst gebührt darum nicht dem, der da pflanzt, noch dem, der begießt, sondern Gott allein, der es wachsen läßt. 
[3:8] Der Pflanzer und der Begießer stehen beide auf derselben Stufe. Und jeder von ihnen wird nach seiner besonderen Arbeit auch seinen besonderen Lohn empfangen. 
[3:9] Denn wir sind Gottes Mitarbeiter; ihr seid Gottes Ackerfeld, ihr seid auch Gottes Bau. 
[3:10] Nach der Gnade Gottes, die mir verliehen worden ist, habe ich als ein geschickter Baumeister den Grund (bei euch) gelegt. Andere bauen nun darauf weiter. Doch jeder sehe zu, wie er weiterbaue! 
[3:11] So viel ist zwar gewiß: Einen anderen Grund kann niemand legen als den, der (von mir) gelegt worden ist, und das ist Jesus Christus. 
[3:12] Es kann nun aber jemand auf diesen Grund Gold, Silber und kostbare Steine oder Holz, Heu und Stroh bauen. 
[3:13] Was jeder gebaut hat, das wird (dereinst in seinem Wert) offenbar werden. Der Tag (des Herrn) wird es ausweisen, denn der offenbart sich mit Feuer. Und eben das Feuer wird erproben, was eines jeden Werk wert ist. 
[3:14] Bleibt das Werk, das jemand (auf dem rechten Grund) gebaut hat, (in der Feuerglut) unversehrt, so wird er Lohn empfangen. 
[3:15] Verbrennt es, so geht er seines Lohnes verlustig. Er selbst indes wird noch gerettet werden, aber (nur mit genauer Not und mit dem nackten Leben) wie bei einer Feuersbrunst. 
[3:16] Wißt ihr nicht, daß ihr Gottes Tempel seid und der Geist Gottes in euch wohnt? 
[3:17] Wer den Tempel Gottes verderbt, den wird Gott verderben. Denn der Tempel Gottes ist heilig, und heilig seid auch ihr! 
[3:18] Niemand täusche sich selbst! Bildet sich einer von euch ein, er sei in dieser Weltzeit weise, der werde zuerst ein Tor, damit er dann zur wahren Weisheit komme! 
[3:19] Denn die Weisheit dieser Welt ist nach Gottes Urteil Torheit. Steht doch geschrieben: Er fängt die Weisheit in ihrer Schlauheit. 
[3:20] Und anderswo heißt es: Der Herr weiß, daß die Gedanken der Weisen mächtig sind. 
[3:21] Daher rühme sich niemand irgendeines Menschen! Es ist ja alles euer: 
[3:22] Paulus, Apollos oder Kephas, Welt, Leben oder Tod, Gegenwärtiges und Zukünftiges — alles ist euer. 
[3:23] Ihr selbst aber seid Christi Eigentum, und Christus ist aufs innigste mit Gott verbunden. 
[4:1] So sehe man uns denn als Christi Diener an und als Verwalter der Geheimnisse Gottes. 
[4:2] Hier kommt noch hinzu, daß man von Verwaltern weiter nichts verlangt, als daß sie treu erfunden werden. 
[4:3] Mir macht es sehr wenig aus, ob ich von euch oder von einem menschlichen Gerichtstag abgeurteilt werde. Ja ich fälle nicht einmal selbst ein Urteil über mich. 
[4:4] Es ist wohl wahr: ich bin mir keiner Schuld bewußt. Doch damit bin ich noch nicht gerechtfertigt. Der Herr ist, der mir das Urteil spricht. 
[4:5] Darum urteilt nicht voreilig! Haltet euer Urteil zurück, bis der Herr kommt! Er wird auch das, was in Finsternis verborgen ist, ans Licht bringen und die Gedanken der Herzen offenbar machen. Dann wird jedem das ihm gebührende Lob von Gott zuteil werden. 
[4:6] Bisher, Brüder, habe ich nur von mir und Apollos geredet. Das habe ich mit Rücksicht auf euch getan. Denn durch unser Beispiel sollt ihr lernen, nicht über die rechten Grenzen (der Demut und Bescheidenheit) hinauszugehen und nicht den einen (Lehrer) auf Kosten des anderen in Aufgeblasenheit vorzuziehen. 
[4:7] (Du erhebst dich über andere; doch sage mir:) Wer gibt dir solchen Vorzug? Und solltest du wirklich etwas an Vorzügen aufweisen können, hast du es dann nicht (von Gott) empfangen? Hast du es aber empfangen, warum rühmst du dich, als wäre das nicht der Fall? 
[4:8] Ihr seid schon satt. Ihr seid schon reich geworden. Ihr herrscht schon ohne unser Zutun als Könige. Ach, ich wollte, ihr wärt wirklich schon zur Herrschaft gelangt! Dann könnten ja auch wir mit eurer Hilfe herrschen. 
[4:9] Es scheint mir, Gott habe uns, die letzten Apostel, wie zum Tod verurteilte Verbrecher öffentlich zur Schau gestellt. Denn wir sind für die Welt — für Engel und Menschen — ein Schauspiel geworden. 
[4:10] Wir sind Toren um Christi willen, ihr seid kluge Leute in Christus. Wir sind schwach, ihr seid stark. Ihr seid in Ehren, wir sind in Schmach. 
[4:11] Bis auf diese Stunde leiden wir Hunger und Durst, wir sind ohne Kleidung, wir werden tätlich mißhandelt, wir wandern heimatlos umher, 
[4:12] wir quälen uns ab bei unserer Hände Arbeit. Schmäht man uns, so segnen wir. Verfolgt man uns, so halten wir still. Verleugnet man uns, so geben wir gute Worte. 
[4:13] Wir sind bis jetzt gleichsam der Auswurf der Welt, der Abschaum der Menschheit gewesen. 
[4:14] Das schreibe ich nicht, um euch zu beschämen, sondern um euch als meine geliebten Kinder zurechtzuweisen. 
[4:15] Denn hättet ihr in euerm Christenleben auch zehntausend (strenge) Erzieher, so habt ihr doch nur einen (liebevollen) Vater. Ich habe euch ja in Christus Jesus durch die Heilsbotschaft gezeugt. 
[4:16] Darum ermahne ich euch: Folgt meinen Weisungen! 
[4:17] Deshalb habe ich auch Timotheus zu euch gesandt. Der ist mein geliebter und treuer Sohn im Herrn, und er soll euch an die Weisungen erinnern, die ich als Diener Christi Jesu überall in jeder Gemeinde gebe. 
[4:18] Manche unter euch bilden sich freilich ein, ich käme nicht zu euch, und sind deshalb aufgeblasen. 
[4:19] Wenn es aber des Herrn Wille ist, so werde ich recht bald zu euch kommen. Dann will ich sehen — nicht, was die Aufgeblasenen für Worte machen, sondern mit welcher Kraft sie auftreten können. 
[4:20] Denn das Königreich Gottes offenbart sich nicht in Worten, sondern in Kraft. 
[4:21] Was wollt ihr nun? Soll ich mit der Rute zu euch kommen oder mit Liebe und im Geist der Milde? 
[5:1] Man hört allgemein davon reden, es werde Unzucht bei euch getrieben, und noch dazu so schrecklicher Art, wie sie nicht einmal bei den Heiden vorkommt: Es soll ja einer mit seines Vaters Frau zusammen leben. 
[5:2] Und da seid ihr noch aufgeblasen? Solltet ihr nicht vielmehr Leid tragen und dafür sorgen, daß der Übeltäter aus eurer Mitte entfernt würde? 
[5:3] Nun, ich — dem Leibe nach zwar fern, aber mit meinem Geist in eurer Mitte gegenwärtig — ich habe schon, als wäre ich selbst unter euch, über den, der sich so schwer vergangen hat, das Urteil gesprochen: 
[5:4] In dem Namen des Herrn Jesus Christus wollen wir — ihr und mein Geist vereint mit der Kraft unseres Herrn Jesus — 
[5:5] den Übeltäter dem Satan übergeben. So soll er leibliche Plagen erdulden, damit sein Geist an dem Tag des Herrn Jesus gerettet werde. 
[5:6] Euer Prahlen ist nicht schön. Wißt ihr nicht, daß ein wenig Sauerteig den ganzen Teig durchsäuert? 
[5:7] Fegt den alten Sauerteig aus, damit ihr ein neuer Teig seid! Ihr seid ja ungesäuert. Denn wir haben auch ein Passahlamm, das geschlachtet worden ist: Christus. 
[5:8] Darum laßt uns nicht mit altem Sauerteig Festfeier halten, nicht mit dem Sauerteig der Schande und Bosheit, sondern mit dem ungesäuerten Brot der Reinheit und der Wahrheit! 
[5:9] In meinem (vorigen) Brief habe ich euch geschrieben, ihr solltet nicht mit unzüchtigen Menschen verkehren. 
[5:10] Dabei habe ich natürlich nicht an die unzüchtigen Leute gedacht, die in der Welt leben, auch nicht an die Habsüchtigen, Räuber und Götzendiener. Sonst müßtet ihr ja die Welt verlassen. 
[5:11] Ich meinte vielmehr, ihr solltet mit keinem verkehren, der den christlichen Brudernamen trägt und der trotzdem ein unzüchtiger Mensch ist oder ein Habgieriger, Götzendiener, Verleumder, Trunkenbold oder Räuber. Mit einem solchen Menschen sollt ihr nicht einmal an einem Tisch sitzen. 
[5:12] Denn kommt es mir zu, die Draußenstehenden zu richten? Auch ihr richtet ja nur Gemeindeglieder. 
[5:13] Über die Draußenstehenden wird Gott das Urteil fällen. Schafft den Bösewicht aus eurer Mitte! 
[6:1] Wie kann sich jemand von euch unterstehen, wenn er mit einem christlichen Bruder einen Rechtshandel hat, statt die Sache vor die Heiligen zu bringen, sie vor den Ungerechten entscheiden zu lassen? 
[6:2] Wißt ihr nicht, daß die Heiligen einst die Welt richten werden? Wenn nun von euch die Welt gerichtet werden soll, taugt ihr denn nicht einmal dazu, die geringfügigsten Rechtssachen zu entscheiden? 
[6:3] Wißt ihr nicht, daß wir sogar über Engel richten werden? Und da sollten wir nicht fähig sein, Streitigkeiten über mein und dein zu schlichten? 
[6:4] Wenn ihr also Händel habt über mein und dein, dann laßt gerade die geringsten Gemeindeglieder Schiedsrichter darüber sein! 
[6:5] Um euch zu beschämen, rede ich so. Gibt's denn unter euch keinen einzigen verständigen Mann, der einen Streit zwischen christlichen Brüdern schlichten könnte? 
[6:6] Muß ein Bruder mit dem anderen in Streit liegen, und noch dazu vor heidnischen Gerichten? 
[6:7] Es ist überhaupt schon ein Schade für euch, daß ihr Rechtshändel miteinander habt. Warum leidet ihr nicht lieber Unrecht? Warum laßt ihr euch nicht lieber um das Eure bringen? 
[6:8] Aber nein, ihr müßt Unrecht tun und die Leute um das Ihre bringen, noch dazu christliche Brüder! 
[6:9] Wißt ihr nicht, daß Ungerechte das Königreich Gottes nicht ererben werden? Täuscht euch nicht: Kein Unzüchtiger, kein Götzendiener, kein Ehebrecher, kein Wollüstiger, kein Knabenschänder, 
[6:10] kein Dieb, kein Habsüchtiger, kein Trunkenbold, kein Verleumder, kein Räuber wird Gottes Königreich ererben! 
[6:11] Und solche Sünder sind manche von euch in früheren Tagen gewesen. Nun aber habt ihr euch rein waschen lassen, nun seid ihr geheiligt und gerechtfertigt worden in dem Namen des Herrn Jesus Christus und durch den Geist unseres Gottes. 
[6:12] "Es ist mir alles erlaubt" — so sagen manche. Jawohl! Aber es frommt nicht alles. "Es ist mir alles erlaubt." Wohl wahr! Doch ich darf mich von nichts beherrschen lassen. 
[6:13] "Die Speisen sind für den Magen, und der Magen ist für die Speisen da." Sicher! Aber Gott wird einst Magen und Speisen vernichten. Der Leib jedoch ist nicht für die Unzucht da, sondern für den Herrn; und der Herr ist da für den Leib. 
[6:14] Wie Gott den Herrn auferweckt hat, so wird er auch uns auferwecken durch seine Macht. 
[6:15] Wißt ihr nicht, daß eure Leiber Glieder Christi sind? Darf ich nun Christus seine Glieder nehmen, um sie zu Gliedern einer Buhlerin zu machen? Nimmermehr! 
[6:16] Oder wißt ihr nicht, daß, wer sich einer Buhlerin ergibt, ein Leib mit ihr ist? Es heißt ja: Beide werden eins sein. 
[6:17] Wer sich aber dem Herrn ergibt, der ist ein Geist mit ihm. 
[6:18] Flieht die Unzucht! Jede andere Sünde, die der Mensch begeht, die bleibt außerhalb seines Leibes. Der Unzüchtige aber versündigt sich (unmittelbar) gegen seinen eigenen Leib. 
[6:19] Oder wißt ihr nicht, daß euer Leib ein Tempel des in euch wohnenden Heiligen Geistes ist, den ihr von Gott empfangen habt, — und daß ihr nicht nach eigener Willkür über euch verfügen könnt? 
[6:20] Ihr seid um einen hohen Preis erkauft worden. Darum verherrlicht Gott mit euerm Leib! 
[7:1] Auf die Fragen in euerm Brief antworte ich: Ein Mann tut gut, wenn er kein Weib berührt. 
[7:2] Zur Verhütung der Unzucht aber mag jeder Mann seine Ehefrau und jede Frau ihren Ehemann haben. 
[7:3] Der Mann soll seiner Frau den schuldigen Umgang gewähren und ebenso die Frau ihrem Mann. 
[7:4] Die Frau hat kein Verfügungsrecht über ihren Leib, sondern ihr Mann. Gleicherweise hat auch der Mann kein Verfügungsrecht über seinen Leib, sondern seine Frau. 
[7:5] Entzieht euch einander nicht, es sei denn allenfalls nach gemeinsamer Übereinkunft auf kurze Zeit, damit ihr euch ungestört dem Gebet widmen könnt! Und dann kommt wieder zusammen, auf daß euch der Satan nicht in Versuchung bringe, weil ihr ja so unenthaltsam seid! 
[7:6] Was ich hier ausspreche, das ist nur ein Rat und kein Gebot. 
[7:7] Ich möchte: alle Menschen wären ebenso wie ich. Doch jeder hat seine besondere Gnadengabe von Gott empfangen, der eine so, der andere so. 
[7:8] Den Unverheirateten und namentlich den Witwen sage ich: Sie tun gut, wenn sie (ledig) bleiben ebenso wie ich. 
[7:9] Können sie sich aber nicht beherrschen, so mögen sie heiraten. Denn es ist besser, zu heiraten als von glühender Begierde zu leiden. 
[7:10] Den Verheirateten gebietet der Herr, nicht ich allein: Die Frau soll sich von ihrem Mann nicht trennen. 
[7:11] - Tut sie es doch, so soll sie unverheiratet bleiben oder sich mit ihrem Mann wieder aussöhnen. — Und der Mann soll die Frau nicht entlassen. 
[7:12] Den anderen Ehepaaren sage ich, nicht der Herr: Hat ein (christlicher) Bruder eine ungläubige Frau, und sie ist damit einverstanden, mit ihm zusammenzuleben, so soll er sie nicht entlassen. 
[7:13] Ferner: hat eine (christliche) Frau einen ungläubigen Mann, und er ist damit einverstanden, mit ihr zusammenzuleben, so soll sie ihren Mann nicht verlassen. 
[7:14] Denn der ungläubige Mann ist durch die Gemeinschaft mit seiner (christlichen) Frau geheiligt. Sonst wären ja auch eure Kinder unrein, und sie sind doch heilig. 
[7:15] Will aber der ungläubige Teil das eheliche Zusammenleben aufgeben, so mag er es tun. In solchen Fällen ist der Bruder oder die Schwester nicht gebunden. Gott hat euch aber berufen, um miteinander in Frieden zu leben. 
[7:16] Kannst du, Frau, denn wissen, ob du deinen Mann zum Heil führen wirst? Oder kannst du, Mann, wissen, ob du deine Frau zum Heil führen wirst? 
[7:17] Im übrigen gelte dies als allgemeine Regel: Ein jeder bleibe in dem Stand und Lebenskreis, den ihm der Herr beschieden und worin ihn Gott zum Heil berufen hat. Das ist die Verordnung, die ich in allen Gemeinden gebe. 
[7:18] Wer als Beschnittener berufen ist, der suche seine Beschneidung nicht zu verbergen. Wer als Heide berufen ist, der lasse sich nicht beschneiden. 
[7:19] Die Beschneidung hat keinen Wert und ebensowenig das Nichtbeschnittensein. Es kommt nur an auf das Halten der göttlichen Gebote. 
[7:20] Jeder bleibe also in dem Stand, worin ihn Gott zum Heil berufen hat. 
[7:21] Bist du als Leibeigener berufen: gräme dich nicht darum! Kannst du jedoch frei werden, dann benutze die Gelegenheit! 
[7:22] Der Leibeigene, der in die Gemeinschaft des Herrn berufen worden ist, ist ja ein Freigelassener des Herrn. Ebenso ist der Freie, der zum Heil berufen worden ist, "ein Knecht Christi". 
[7:23] Ihr seid um einen hohen Preis erkauft worden. Werdet darum keine "Menschenknechte"! 
[7:24] Ein jeder also, liebe Brüder, diene Gott in dem Stand, worin er zum Heil berufen ist. 
[7:25] Wegen der Jungfrauen habe ich kein ausdrückliches Gebot vom Herrn. Aber ich will doch meine Meinung aussprechen als ein Mann, der durch des Herrn Erbarmen Vertrauen verdient. 
[7:26] Ich meine nun: Wegen der gegenwärtigen schweren Zeitlage ist es für jeden gut, so zu bleiben, wie er ist. 
[7:27] Bist du an eine Frau gebunden, so suche das Verhältnis nicht zu lösen! Bist du ledig, dann suche keine Frau! 
[7:28] Wenn du aber heiratest, so tust du damit keine Sünde. Doch müssen die Verheirateten äußere Trübsal durchmachen, und die möchte ich euch gern ersparen. 
[7:29] Ich versichere euch, Brüder: Die Zeit (bis zu dem Kommen des Herrn) ist nur noch kurz. Deshalb gelte hinfort die Regel: Auch jene, die Frauen haben, sollen sich so verhalten, als hätten sie keine. 
[7:30] Die Weinenden sollen sein, als weinten sie nicht, die Fröhlichen, als wären sie nicht fröhlich, die Käufer, als behielten sie das Gekaufte nicht; 
[7:31] kurz, die in der Welt leben, sollen sich so verhalten, als lebten sie nicht darin. Denn die Welt in ihrer jetzigen Gestalt ist im Vergehen begriffen. 
[7:32] Da möchte ich gern, ihr wärt von allen weltlichen Sorgen frei. Der Unverheiratete richtet seine Sorge auf den Dienst des Herrn: er will dem Herrn gefallen. 
[7:33] Der Verheiratete ist um die weltlichen Dinge besorgt: er will seiner Frau gefallen. 
[7:34] Derselbe Unterschied besteht auch zwischen der verheirateten Frau und der Jungfrau. Die Jungfrau richtet ihre Sorge auf den Dienst des Herrn; sie will heilig sein an Leib und Geist. Die verheiratete Frau ist um die weltlichen Dinge besorgt: sie will ihrem Mann gefallen. 
[7:35] Diesen Rat (nicht zu heiraten) gebe ich euch zu euerm eigenen Besten. Damit will ich euch aber nicht etwa eine Schlinge überwerfen. Ich möchte euch vielmehr helfen, daß es geziemend bei euch zugehe, und ihr allezeit ungestört zu des Herrn Füßen sitzen könnt. 
[7:36] Glaubt aber ein Vater, er handle unrecht gegen seine jungfräuliche Tochter, wenn er sie unverheiratet alt werden läßt, und hält er deshalb ihre Verheiratung für nötig, so tue er, was ihm gut scheint. Er sündigt damit nicht: die Tochter und ihr Freier mögen ruhig heiraten. 
[7:37] Wer dagegen als willensstarker Mann und frei von allem äußeren Zwang — so daß er ganz nach eigenem Wunsch handeln kann — zu dem Entschluß gekommen ist, seine Tochter unverheiratet zu lassen, der tut wohl daran. 
[7:38] Also: ein Vater, der seine jungfräuliche Tochter verheiratet, der handelt recht; und wer sie nicht verheiratet, der handelt noch besser. 
[7:39] Eine Ehefrau ist an ihren Mann gebunden, solange er lebt. Stirbt der Mann, so hat sie Freiheit zu heiraten, wen sie will; nur muß es ein Christ sein. 
[7:40] Sie ist aber besser daran, wenn sie unverheiratet bleibt. Das ist meine Ansicht, und ich denke doch auch Gottes Geist zu haben. 
[8:1] Mit Bezug auf das Götzenopferfleisch (schreibt ihr in euerm Brief): "Wir wissen, daß wir alle (die rechte) Erkenntnis haben." (Bedenkt indes:) Die Erkenntnis (allein) macht stolz, die Liebe aber sucht andere zu fördern. 
[8:2] Wer sich mit seiner Erkenntnis brüstet, der hat die wahre Erkenntnis noch gar nicht erlangt. 
[8:3] Wer aber Gott liebt, der ist von ihm (als sein Eigentum) erkannt. 
[8:4] Also über den Genuß des Götzenopferfleisches (schreibt ihr mir): "Wir wissen: es gibt überhaupt keine Götzen in der Welt, sondern es gibt nur einen Gott. 
[8:5] Denn es mag auch (nach dem Glauben der Heiden) sogenannte Götter im Himmel und auf Erden geben — wie sie ja wirklich viele Götter und viele Herren verehren —, 
[8:6] so kennen wir (Christen) doch nur einen Gott, den Vater, von dem alles geschaffen ist, und für dessen Dienst wir bestimmt sind, und nur einen Herrn, Jesus Christus, durch den alles geschaffen ist, und durch den wir leben." 
[8:7] (Ganz richtig!) Doch nicht alle haben diese Erkenntnis. Sondern es gibt manche unter euch, die nach alter Gewohnheit das Götzenopferfleisch noch immer in dem Gedanken essen, als wäre es wirklich einem Götzen geopfert. Dadurch wird dann ihr Gewissen, schwach wie es ist, befleckt. 
[8:8] Nun ist's zwar wahr: "Die Speise, die wir essen, hat keinen Einfluß auf unser Verhältnis zu Gott. Ob wir dies oder jenes essen oder nicht, das macht uns in Gottes Augen nicht besser oder schlechter." 
[8:9] Seht aber zu, daß diese eure Freiheit den Schwachen keinen Anstoß gebe! 
[8:10] Du nimmst bei deiner rechten Erkenntnis (über das Götzenopfer) in einem heidnischen Tempel an einem Opfermahl teil. Da sieht dich nun einer (aus der Gemeinde, der diese Erkenntnis nicht hat). Muß da nicht sein Gewissen, obwohl er schwach ist, dazu verleitet werden, (gegen seine Überzeugung) auch von dem Götzenopferfleisch zu essen? 
[8:11] So wird dann durch deine Erkenntnis der Schwache ins Verderben gebracht — der Bruder, für den doch Christus gestorben ist. 
[8:12] Wenn ihr euch aber in solcher Weise an den Brüdern versündigt und ihr schwaches Gewissen verwundet, so versündigt ihr euch gegen Christus. 
[8:13] Verleite ich deshalb durch das Essen einer Speise meinen Bruder zur Sünde, so will ich in Zukunft überhaupt kein Fleisch mehr essen, um meinen Bruder nicht zur Sünde zu verführen. 
[9:1] Bin ich nicht frei? Bin ich nicht ein Apostel? Habe ich nicht unseren Herrn Jesus gesehen? Seid ihr nicht mein Werk in dem Herrn? 
[9:2] Bin ich auch für andere kein Apostel, so bin ich's doch jedenfalls für euch. Denn ihr seid das Siegel meines Apostelamtes im Herrn. 
[9:3] So verteidige ich mich denen gegenüber, die meine Richter sein wollen. 
[9:4] Haben wir nicht das Recht, (auf Kosten der Gemeinden) zu essen und zu trinken? 
[9:5] Haben wir nicht gleich den anderen Aposteln, den Brüdern des Herrn und Kephas das Recht, auf unseren Reisen eine (christliche) Schwester als Ehefrau bei uns zu haben? 
[9:6] Müssen nur ich und Barnabas den Lebensunterhalt durch Handarbeit erwerben? 
[9:7] Wer tut denn Kriegsdienst für eigenen Sold? Wer pflanzt einen Weinberg und ißt nicht von seiner Frucht? Wer weidet eine Herde, ohne von ihrer Milch zu genießen? 
[9:8] Ist das nur in der Welt so Brauch? 
[9:9] Stimmt damit nicht auch das Gesetz? Im Gesetz Moses steht ja geschrieben: Du sollst dem Ochsen, der das Getreide drischt, nicht das Maul verbinden. Denkt Gott hier an die Ochsen? 
[9:10] Haben seine Worte nicht auf jeden Fall für uns Bedeutung? Ja, zu unserem Besten stehen sie da. Denn die das Land pflügen und die das Getreide dreschen, die sollen ihre Arbeit tun in der Hoffnung, davon Genuß zu haben. 
[9:11] Haben wir nun zu euerm Heil den Samen geistlicher Güter ausgestreut, ist es da zuviel verlangt, wenn wir (als Lohn dafür) etwas von euern zeitlichen Gütern ernten? 
[9:12] Haben andere (Lehrer) das Recht, sich von euch unterhalten zu lassen, sind wir dann nicht noch viel mehr dazu berechtigt? Doch wir haben von diesem Recht keinen Gebrauch gemacht. Wir nehmen vielmehr alle möglichen Entbehrungen auf uns, um der Frohen Botschaft Christi nur ja kein Hindernis zu bereiten. 
[9:13] Wißt ihr nicht, daß die Priester, die im Tempel dienen, von den Einkünften des Tempels ihren Unterhalt empfangen? Und daß die, die am Opferaltar beschäftigt sind, auch ihren Teil vom Altar bekommen? 
[9:14] Ebenso hat nun auch der Herr für die Verkündiger der Frohen Botschaft die Verordnung gegeben, daß sie davon leben sollen. 
[9:15] Ich aber habe auf diesen Anspruch freiwillig verzichtet. Das erwähne ich hier nicht, damit man mir künftig diesen Anspruch befriedige. Nein, lieber sterben, als meinen Ruhm mir nehmen lassen! 
[9:16] An und für sich freilich ist die Verkündigung der Frohen Botschaft nichts, dessen ich mich rühmen könnte. Sie ist ja einfach eine Pflicht, die ich erfüllen muß. Denn wehe mir, wollte ich die Frohe Botschaft nicht verkündigen! 
[9:17] Täte ich es aus eigenem Antrieb, so hätte ich Lohn zu erwarten. Ist es aber ein Muß für mich, so richte ich ja nur einen mir anvertrauten Auftrag aus. 
[9:18] Worin besteht also mein Lohn? Darin, daß ich die Frohe Botschaft umsonst verkündige und als ihr Diener auf mein gutes Recht verzichte. 
[9:19] Denn wenn ich auch von allen Menschen unabhängig bin, so bin ich doch freiwillig aller Knecht geworden, um recht viele (für den Glauben) zu gewinnen. 
[9:20] Mit den Juden bin ich umgegangen wie ein Jude, um Juden zu gewinnen. Mit denen, die unter dem Gesetz stehen, habe ich verkehrt, als stünde ich auch unter dem Gesetz — obwohl ich doch mit dem Gesetz nichts zu schaffen habe —, um die, die unter dem Gesetz stehen, zu gewinnen. 
[9:21] Mit den Heiden, die ohne das Gesetz leben, bin ich umgegangen wie einer, der das Gesetz nicht kennt — während ich doch Gottes Gesetz nicht verachte, sondern im Gesetz Christi lebe —, um die, die das Gesetz nicht kennen, zu gewinnen. 
[9:22] Im Umgang mit den Schwachen bin ich schwach geworden, um die Schwachen zu gewinnen. So bin ich allen alles geworden, um wenigstens einige zum Heil zu führen. 
[9:23] Das alles tue ich der Frohen Botschaft wegen, um an ihrem Segen teilzuhaben. 
[9:24] Wißt ihr nicht, daß die Läufer in der Rennbahn zwar alle laufen, aber nur einer den Siegespreis erhält? Lauft nun so (wie dieser Sieger), damit ihr den Preis erlangt! 
[9:25] Jeder Wettkämpfer übt strengste Enthaltsamkeit. Und doch wollen sie nur einen vergänglichen Siegeskranz gewinnen, wir aber einen unvergänglichen. 
[9:26] Ich laufe nun nach keinem ungewissen Ziel, ich führe bei meinem Faustkampf keine Hiebe in die Luft. 
[9:27] Sondern ich schlage meinen Leib und bezwinge ihn, um nicht, nachdem ich andere zum Kampf aufgerufen habe, bei der Austeilung des Preises selbst leer auszugehen. 
[10:1] Ich will euch nicht in Unkenntnis darüber lassen, liebe Brüder, daß unsere Väter alle unter dem Schutz der Wolke gewesen und alle durch das Meer gegangen sind. 
[10:2] Alle haben sich auf Mose taufen lassen in der Wolke und im Meer. 
[10:3] Alle haben dieselbe geistliche Speise gegessen, 
[10:4] und alle haben denselben geistlichen Trank getrunken. Sie tranken aus einem geistlichen Fels, der mit ihnen ging, und dieser Fels war Christus. 
[10:5] Doch an der Mehrzahl von ihnen hatte Gott keinen Gefallen. Denn sie wurden niedergestreckt in der Wüste. 
[10:6] Das ist zum warnenden Vorbild für uns geschehen, damit wir nicht nach dem Bösen gierig sind, so wie jene es waren. 
[10:7] Werdet auch nicht Götzendiener, wie einige von ihnen es geworden sind; denn es steht geschrieben: Das Volk lagerte sich, um zu essen und zu trinken; dann stand es auf zu Spiel und Tanz. 
[10:8] Laßt uns auch nicht Unzucht treiben, wie manche von ihnen es taten, so daß an einem Tag 23000 fielen! 
[10:9] Laßt uns ferner den Herrn nicht versuchen, wie einige von jenen ihn versuchten und dann (zur Strafe) von Schlangen getötet wurden! 
[10:10] Murrt nicht, wie einige von ihnen murrten, die dafür den Tod durch den Verderber fanden! 
[10:11] Dies alles ist jenen vorbildlich widerfahren, und es ist aufgezeichnet worden zur Warnung für uns, die wir am Ende der Zeiten leben. 
[10:12] Wer also meint, er stehe fest, der gebe acht, daß er nicht falle! 
[10:13] Bisher hat euch noch keine Versuchung betroffen, die menschliche Kräfte überstiege. Und Gott ist treu! Er wird nicht zugeben, daß ihr über eure Kraft versucht werdet. Sondern wenn er euch Versuchung schickt, so wird er auch einen Ausweg eröffnen, daß ihr sie siegreich bestehen könnt. 
[10:14] Darum, meine Lieben, meidet den Götzendienst! 
[10:15] Ich rede ja zu verständigen Leuten. Beurteilt selbst, was ich sage: 
[10:16] Der geweihte Kelch, den wir segnen, bringt er uns nicht in Gemeinschaft mit dem Blut Christi? Das Brot, das wir brechen, bringt es uns nicht in Gemeinschaft mit dem Leib Christi? 
[10:17] Denn wie es ein Brot ist (das gebrochen und ausgeteilt wird), so bilden auch wir trotz unserer Vielheit nur einen Leib; denn wir genießen ja alle ein und dasselbe Brot. 
[10:18] Seht das irdische Israel an! Stehn nicht alle, die von den Opfern essen, in Gemeinschaft mit dem Altar? 
[10:19] Was will ich damit sagen? Meine ich, daß ein Götzenopfer Wert hat, oder daß es wirklich Götzen gibt? 
[10:20] Nein! Was die Heiden opfern, das opfern sie bösen Geistern und nicht Gott. Ich will aber nicht, daß ihr mit der bösen Geisterwelt in Gemeinschaft kommt. 
[10:21] Ihr könnt nicht des Herrn Kelch trinken und daneben auch den Kelch böser Geister. Ihr könnt nicht von des Herrn Tisch essen und daneben auch von dem Tisch böser Geister. 
[10:22] Oder wollen wir den Herrn herausfordern? Sind wir etwa stärker als er? 
[10:23] (Ihr sagt:) "Alles ist erlaubt." Aber ich sage: Es nützt nicht alles. "Alles ist erlaubt." Mag sein! Doch es fördert nicht alles. 
[10:24] Niemand denke nur an sich, sondern an das Heil des anderen! 
[10:25] Alles, was auf dem Fleischmarkt zum Verkauf steht, das eßt ruhig, ohne weiter nachzufragen, damit euer Gewissen nicht beunruhigt werde. 
[10:26] Denn: Die Erde ist des Herrn, und was sie erfüllt. 
[10:27] Lädt euch ein Heide zu Gast, und ihr wollt hingehen, so eßt alles, was euch vorgesetzt wird, ohne weiter nachzufragen, damit euer Gewissen nicht beunruhigt werde. 
[10:28] Sagt euch aber jemand: "Das hier ist Opferfleisch!", so eßt nicht davon! Tut das mit Rücksicht auf den, der euch dies sagt, und um das Gewissen nicht zu verletzen. 
[10:29] Hier denke ich nicht an euer eigenes Gewissen, sondern an das Gewissen des anderen. Denn warum soll ich meine Freiheit von dem Gewissen eines anderen beurteilen lassen? 
[10:30] Wenn ich eine Speise mit Dank (gegen Gott) genieße, ist es dann recht, daß ich wegen der Speise, für die ich danke, (von anderen) gelästert werde? 
[10:31] Ihr mögt nun essen oder trinken oder sonst etwas tun: tut alles zur Ehre Gottes! 
[10:32] Gebt keinen Anstoß bei Juden und Heiden und bei der Gemeinde Gottes! 
[10:33] Auch ich will ja in jeder Weise allen zu Gefallen leben, und darum trachte ich nicht nach dem, was meinem Besten dient, sondern was der großen Mehrzahl zu ihrem Heil nützlich ist. 
[11:1] Folgt mir nach, wie ich selbst Christus folge! 
[11:2] Ich erkenne es lobend an, daß "ihr in allen Stücken mein eingedenk seid und die Weisungen befolgt, die ich euch gegeben habe". 
[11:3] Ihr sollt nun wissen: Jedes Mannes Haupt ist Christus, das Haupt des Weibes ist der Mann, und Christi Haupt ist Gott. 
[11:4] Trägt ein Mann beim Beten oder Weissagen eine Kopfbedeckung, so entehrt er sein "Haupt". 
[11:5] Und betet oder weissagt eine Frau mit unverhülltem Haupt, so entehrt sie ihr "Haupt"; denn sie stellt sich auf eine Stufe mit einer geschorenen (Dirne). 
[11:6] Will sich eine Frau nicht verhüllen, dann mag sie sich auch (wie eine Dirne) das Haar scheren lassen. Ist es aber für die Frau ein Schimpf, sich das Haar abschneiden oder scheren zu lassen, nun, dann soll sie sich verhüllen. 
[11:7] Der Mann braucht sich das Haupt nicht zu verhüllen, denn er ist Gottes Bild und seiner Hoheit Abglanz. Die Frau ist ein Abglanz von des Mannes Hoheit. 
[11:8] Denn der Mann ist nicht von der Frau genommen, sondern die Frau vom Mann. 
[11:9] Auch ist nicht der Mann der Frau wegen, sondern umgekehrt die Frau des Mannes wegen erschaffen worden. 
[11:10] Deshalb soll die Frau das Zeichen ihrer Abhängigkeit vom Mann auf ihrem Haupt tragen, und zwar mit Rücksicht auf die Engel. 
[11:11] Übrigens ist nach des Herrn Ordnung die Frau ebenso auf den Mann angewiesen wie der Mann auf die Frau. 
[11:12] Denn wie die Frau von dem Mann angenommen ist, so wird auch der Mann von der Frau geboren. Alle Dinge aber sind von Gott erschaffen. 
[11:13] Urteilt selbst: Geziemt es sich für eine Frau, unverhüllt zu Gott zu beten? 
[11:14] Lehrt euch nicht schon euer eigenes Empfinden, daß langes Haar dem Mann eine Schande, 
[11:15] der Frau eine Zierde ist? Denn das lange Haupthaar ist ihr als Schleier gegeben. 
[11:16] Wer über diese Fragen streiten will, dem sei gesagt: Wir haben solche Weise nicht und ebensowenig die Gemeinde Gottes. 
[11:17] Indem ich diese Verordnungen gebe, muß ich etwas zur Sprache bringen, was ich nicht loben kann: Eure Zusammenkünfte bringen euch keinen Segen, sondern Schaden. 
[11:18] Fürs erste höre ich, daß es bei euern Gemeindeversammlungen Spaltungen unter euch gibt, und ich glaube auch, es ist etwas Wahres daran. 
[11:19] Denn wie die Menschen nun einmal sind, ist es kaum anders möglich, als daß es Parteien bei euch gibt. So sollen die Treuen unter euch offenbar werden. 
[11:20] Bei euern Zusammenkünften könnt ihr ferner nicht das Mahl des Herrn in rechter Weise halten. 
[11:21] Denn wenn ihr euch zu Tisch setzt, so ißt jeder die Speise, die er mitgebracht hat, für sich allein. So kommt es, daß der eine hungrig bleibt, während sich der andere berauscht. 
[11:22] Habt ihr denn keine Häuser, wo ihr essen und trinken könnt? Oder verachtet ihr die Gemeinde Gottes, und wollt ihr die Armen beschämen? Was soll ich dazu sagen? Soll ich euch loben? Das kann ich doch sicher nicht loben. 
[11:23] Ich habe es ja von dem Herrn empfangen, was ich euch überliefert habe: In der Nacht, wo der Herr Jesus verraten ward, nahm er Brot, 
[11:24] dankte, brach es und sprach: "Das ist mein Leib, der euch zum Heil dient. Tut dies zu meinem Gedächtnis!" 
[11:25] Ebenso nahm er nach dem Mahl auch den Kelch und sprach: "Dieser Kelch ist der Neue Bund in meinem Blut. Sooft ihr ihn trinkt, tut dies zu meinem Gedächtnis!" 
[11:26] Denn sooft ihr dies Brot eßt und den Kelch trinkt, verkündigt ihr den Tod des Herrn, bis er wiederkommt. 
[11:27] Wer nun unwürdig das Brot ißt oder den Kelch des Herrn trinkt, der vergreift sich an des Herrn Leib und Blut. 
[11:28] Darum prüfe sich jeder, und dann erst esse er von dem Brot und trinke er aus dem Kelch! 
[11:29] Denn wer da ißt und trinkt, ohne den Leib des Herrn zu unterscheiden, der zieht sich durch sein Essen und Trinken ein (göttliches) Strafgericht zu. 
[11:30] Deshalb sind auch so viel Schwache und Kranke unter euch, und manche sind schon entschlafen. 
[11:31] Wenn wir uns selbst recht beurteilen, so würden wir nicht gerichtet. 
[11:32] Werden wir aber von dem Herrn gerichtet, so soll das zu unserer Erziehung dienen, damit wir nicht mit der (ungläubigen) Welt verdammt werden. 
[11:33] Darum, meine Brüder, wartet aufeinander, wenn ihr zum Mahl zusammenkommt! 
[11:34] Wer Hunger hat, der esse vorher zu Hause, damit ihr nicht durch eure Zusammenkünfte ein Strafgericht (Gottes) über euch bringt! Das andere will ich ordnen, wenn ich komme. 
[12:1] Über die geistlichen Gaben will ich euch, liebe Brüder, nicht in Unkenntnis lassen. 
[12:2] Ihr wißt: Als ihr Heiden wart, da ließt ihr euch blindlings zu den stummen Götzen führen. 
[12:3] Darum tue ich euch kund: Wer durch den Geist Gottes redet, der kann Jesus niemals fluchen; doch kann auch niemand Jesus als den Herrn bekennen ohne durch den Heiligen Geist. 
[12:4] Es gibt verschiedene Gnadengaben, doch nur einen Geist. 
[12:5] Es gibt verschiedene Kirchenämter, doch nur einen Herrn. 
[12:6] Es gibt verschiedene Kraftwirkungen, doch nur einen Gott, der alles in allen wirkt. 
[12:7] Jeder empfängt die Offenbarung des Geistes zum Besten des Ganzen. 
[12:8] Dem einen wird durch den Geist Weisheitsrede verliehen, einem anderen Erkenntnisrede nach dem Willen desselben Geistes, 
[12:9] einem anderen Glaube durch denselben Geist, einem anderen Heilungsgaben durch den einen Geist, 
[12:10] einem anderen Kraftwirkungen, einem anderen Weissagung, einem anderen Geisterunterscheidung, einem anderen Arten von Zungenreden, einem anderen Auslegung des Zungenredens. 
[12:11] Das alles wirkt ein und derselbe Geist, der jedem eine besondere Gabe zuteilt, wie er will. 
[12:12] Wie der Leib nur einer ist und doch viele Glieder hat, alle Glieder des Leibes aber trotz ihrer Vielheit einen Leib bilden, ebenso ist es auch mit Christus. 
[12:13] Denn durch einen Geist sind wir alle durch die Taufe einem Leib eingefügt, wir seien Juden oder Heiden, Sklaven oder Freie. Und wir sind alle mit einem Geist getränkt worden. 
[12:14] Auch der Leib besteht ja nicht aus einem Glied, sondern aus vielen. 
[12:15] Spräche der Fuß: "Weil ich keine Hand bin, so bin ich kein Teil des Leibes" — gehörte er deshalb nicht zum Leib? 
[12:16] Und spräche das Ohr: "Weil ich kein Auge bin, so bin ich kein Teil des Leibes" — gehörte es deshalb nicht zum Leib? 
[12:17] Wäre der ganze Leib nur Auge, wo bliebe da das Gehör? Wäre er ganz Gehör, wo bliebe der Geruch? 
[12:18] Nun hat aber Gott jedem Glied seine besondere Stelle im Leib angewiesen nach seinem Willen. 
[12:19] Wäre alles nur ein Glied, wo bliebe da der Leib? 
[12:20] So gibt es zwar viele Glieder, aber nur einen Leib. 
[12:21] Das Auge darf nicht sagen zur Hand: "Ich bedarf dein nicht" — ebensowenig das Haupt zu den Füßen: "Ich bedarf euer nicht." 
[12:22] Vielmehr sind gerade die scheinbar schwächsten Glieder des Leibes ganz besonders nötig. 
[12:23] Ferner: Die Glieder des Leibes, die nach unserer Meinung am unscheinbarsten sind, die kleiden wir besonders köstlich. Und unsere unedlen Glieder verhüllen wir aufs schicklichste, 
[12:24] während unsere edlen Glieder solcher Hüllen nicht bedürfen. Gott hat den Leib so wunderbar gebildet und dem geringeren Glied desto größere Auszeichnung verliehen, 
[12:25] damit im Leib keine Uneinigkeit entstehe, sondern alle Glieder einträchtig füreinander sorgen. 
[12:26] Leidet ein Glied, so leiden alle Glieder mit; wird ein Glied geehrt, so freuen sich alle Glieder mit. 
[12:27] Ihr seid Christi Leib, und jeder ist ein Glied daran an seinem Platz. 
[12:28] Und zwar hat Gott in der Kirche eingesetzt: an erster Stelle Apostel, an zweiter Stelle Propheten, an dritter Stelle Lehrer, dann solche, die Heilungsgaben besitzen, die sich (der Brüder) hilfreich annehmen, die (die Gemeinde) leiten, die in verschiedenen Zungen reden. 
[12:29] Sind alle Apostel? Sind alle Propheten? Sind alle Lehrer? Sind alle im Besitz von Wunderkräften? 
[12:30] Haben alle Heilungsgaben? Reden alle in Zungen? Können alle in Zungen auslegen? 
[12:31] Strebt nach den köstlichsten Gnadengaben! Jetzt will ich euch noch den herrlichen Weg zeigen, der dazu führt. 
[13:1] Könnte ich in Sprachen der Menschen und Engel reden, aber mir fehlte die Liebe, so wäre ich ein tönend Erz oder eine klingende Schelle. 
[13:2] Hätte ich Weissagung und wüßte alle Geheimnisse und besäße alle Erkenntnis, ja wäre mein Glaube so stark, daß ich Berge versetzen könnte, aber mir fehlte die Liebe, so wäre ich nichts. 
[13:3] Wenn ich alle meine Habe den Armen schenkte und gäbe meinen Leib dem Feuertod preis, aber mir fehlte die Liebe: Es nützte mir nichts. 
[13:4] Die Liebe ist langmütig, die Liebe ist freundlich. Sie ist nicht neidisch, prahlt nicht, ist nicht aufgeblasen. 
[13:5] Sie gibt nicht Anstoß, sucht nicht ihren Vorteil, läßt sich nicht zum Zorn reizen, trägt nicht Böses nach. 
[13:6] Sie freut sich nicht über Unrecht, sie wünscht vielmehr der Wahrheit Glück. 
[13:7] Alles deckt sie, alles glaubt sie, alles hofft sie, alles trägt sie. 
[13:8] Die Liebe hört niemals auf. Die Weissagungen werden schwinden, die Zungenreden werden schweigen, die Erkenntnis wird ein Ende nehmen. 
[13:9] Denn Stückwerk ist unser Erkennen, Stückwerk unser Weissagen. 
[13:10] Wenn aber das Vollkommene erscheint, dann hört das Stückwerk auf. 
[13:11] Als ich ein Kind war, da sprach ich wie ein Kind, ich dachte wie ein Kind, ich urteilte wie ein Kind. Seit ich aber ein Mann bin, ist es vorbei mit dem kindischen Wesen. 
[13:12] Jetzt sehen wir nur ein dunkles Spiegelbild, einst aber schauen wir von Angesicht zu Angesicht. Jetzt ist mein Erkennen nur Stückwerk, einst aber werde ich erkennen, wie ich erkannt worden bin. 
[13:13] So bleiben Glaube, Hoffnung, Liebe, diese drei. Am größten aber unter ihnen ist die Liebe. 
[14:1] Jagt der Liebe nach! Strebt auch nach den Geistesgaben, vor allem nach der Weissagung! 
[14:2] Wer in Zungen redet, der redet nicht für Menschen, sondern für Gott. Es kann ihn ja niemand verstehen; durch die Eingebung des Geistes redet er Geheimnisse. 
[14:3] Der Weissager aber wendet sich mit seiner Rede an die Menschen: er erbaut, ermahnt und tröstet sie. 
[14:4] Der Zungenredner erbaut sich selbst, der Weissager erbaut die Gemeinde. 
[14:5] Ich wollte, ihr könntet alle in Zungen reden. Doch noch viel lieber wäre es mir: ihr weissagtet. Denn der Weissager steht höher als der Zungenredner, außer wenn der Zungenredner seine Worte auch auslegt und so die Gemeinde erbaut wird. 
[14:6] Käme ich nun, liebe Brüder, zu euch und redete in Zungen, was nützte euch das, wenn ich nicht auch zu euch spräche in Offenbarung, Erkenntnis, Weissagung oder Lehre? 
[14:7] Es ist hier ebenso wie bei leblosen Musikwerkzeugen: Sind zum Beispiel auf einer Flöte oder Zither die Töne nicht ganz deutlich, wie kann man dann wissen, welche Weise darauf gespielt wird? 
[14:8] Oder: gibt die Trompete (im Krieg) ein unklares Zeichen, wer wird sich dann zum Kampf rüsten? 
[14:9] So ist's nun auch mit euch: redet ihr mit eurer Zunge nicht klar und deutlich, so kann man nicht verstehen, was ihr sprecht. Ihr redet dann in den Wind. 
[14:10] Es gibt in der Welt so viele verschiedene Sprachen, und jede hat ihre ganz bestimmten Laute. 
[14:11] Ist mir aber eine Sprache so fremd, daß ich den Sinn ihrer Worte nicht kenne, so bleibe ich dem, der sie redet, unverständlich, und er versteht mich nicht. 
[14:12] Genau so ist's in euerm Fall. Ihr trachtet nach geistlichen Gaben. Sucht nun an den Gaben reich zu werden, die der Erbauung der Gemeinde dienen! 
[14:13] Wer in Zungen redet, der soll deshalb auch um die Gabe der Auslegung beten. 
[14:14] Denn wenn ich in Zungenrede bete, so betet wohl mein Geist, doch mein Verstand ist dabei unbeteiligt. 
[14:15] Wie soll es denn nun sein? Ich will mit meinem Geist beten, und ich will auch mit meinem Verstand beten. Ich will lobsingen mit meinem Geist, und ich will auch lobsingen mit meinem Verstand. 
[14:16] Dankst du Gott nur mit deinem Geist (im Zungenreden), wie kann da jemand, der (das Zungenreden) nicht auszulegen weiß, zu deinem Dankgebet Amen sagen? Er versteht ja gar nicht, was du sagst. 
[14:17] Das Dankgebet, das du sprichst, mag noch so schön sein, der andere wird doch nicht dadurch erbaut. 
[14:18] Ich rede — Gott sei Dank dafür! — viel mehr in Zungen als ihr alle. 
[14:19] In einer Gemeindeversammlung aber will ich lieber fünf Worte mit meinem Verstand reden — um dadurch auch andere zu belehren — als zehntausend Worte in Zungen. 
[14:20] Brüder, seid nicht Kinder an Einsicht und Verständnis! Bleibt Kinder, wenn es sich ums Böse handelt; an Einsicht und Verständnis aber werdet gereifte Menschen! 
[14:21] Im Gesetz steht geschrieben: In anderen Zungen und durch fremde Lippen will ich zu diesem Volk reden, und trotzdem werden sie nicht auf mich hören — spricht der Herr. 
[14:22] Aus diesem Wort folgt: Die Zungen sind nicht ein göttlich Zeichen, das die Hörer zum Glauben führt, sondern bei dem sie ungläubig bleiben. Die Weissagung dagegen hat zur Folge, daß die Hörer nicht ungläubig bleiben, sondern gläubig werden. 
[14:23] Wenn also in einer Versammlung der ganzen Gemeinde alle mit Zungen redeten, und es kämen Laien oder Ungläubige hinein, würden die nicht sagen, ihr wärt von Sinnen? 
[14:24] Wenn aber alle weissagen, und es tritt dann ein Ungläubiger oder Laie ein, der wird von allen (in seinem Gewissen) überführt und gleichsam ins Verhör genommen; 
[14:25] die verborgenen Gedanken seines Herzens werden aufgedeckt, und tief ergriffen wird er auf sein Antlitz fallen, Gott anbeten und bekennen, daß Gott wahrhaftig in eurer Mitte ist. 
[14:26] Wie soll es nun gehalten werden, Brüder? Wenn ihr zusammenkommt, so hat der eine einen Lobgesang, der andere einen Lehrvortrag, der andere eine Offenbarung, der andere ein Reden in Zungen, der andere eine Auslegung der Zungen. Alles soll der Erbauung dienen. 
[14:27] In Zungen sollen nur zwei oder höchstens drei reden, aber nacheinander, und einer soll auslegen. 
[14:28] Ist kein Ausleger da, so sollen die Zungenredner in der Gemeindeversammlung schweigen; sie mögen dann (still) mit sich und Gott reden. 
[14:29] Von den Propheten mögen zwei oder drei reden, und die anderen mögen das Gesprochene beurteilen. 
[14:30] Wird aber einem anderen, der dasitzt, eine Offenbarung zuteil, dann soll der erste schweigen. 
[14:31] Denn ihr könnt alle weissagen, doch nacheinander, damit alle lernen und alle ermahnt werden. 
[14:32] Die Propheten haben ja die Herrschaft über ihren Geist. 
[14:33] Denn Gott ist nicht ein Gott der Unordnung, sondern des Friedens. 
[14:34] Wie in allen Gemeinden der Heiligen, so sollen auch (bei euch) die Frauen in den Gemeindeversammlungen schweigen. Sie haben keine Erlaubnis zu reden; sie sollen sich vielmehr unterordnen, wie auch das Gesetz sagt. 
[14:35] Wünschen sie aber irgendwie Belehrung, so mögen sie daheim ihre Männer fragen. Es schickt sich nicht für eine Frau, in einer Gemeindeversammlung zu reden. 
[14:36] Ist denn das Wort Gottes von euch ausgegangen, oder ist es nur zu euch gekommen? 
[14:37] Wer nun glaubt, ein Prophet oder sonst ein geistlich Begabter zu sein, der erkenne in dem, was ich euch schreibe, des Herrn Gebot. 
[14:38] Wer das nicht anerkennen will, der wird auch nicht anerkannt. 
[14:39] Also, meine Brüder: trachtet nach der Weissagung, und das Zungenreden hindert nicht! 
[14:40] Alles aber soll mit Anstand und in Ordnung zugehen. 
[15:1] Ich erinnere euch jetzt, liebe Brüder, an die Heilsbotschaft, die ich euch verkündigt habe. Ihr habt sie gläubig angenommen, ihr beharrt darin, 
[15:2] und ihr werdet auch durch sie errettet, wenn ihr sie genau so festhaltet, wie ich sie euch verkündigt habe. Andernfalls wäret ihr umsonst gläubig geworden. 
[15:3] Ich habe euch gleich zuerst überliefert, was ich selbst empfangen habe: Christus ist gestorben für unsere Sünden nach der Schrift, 
[15:4] er ist begraben worden und am dritten Tag auferstanden nach der Schrift, 
[15:5] er ist erschienen dem Kephas, dann den Zwölfen. 
[15:6] Darauf ist er erschienen mehr als fünfhundert Brüdern zugleich, von denen die meisten noch heute am Leben sind, einige aber sind entschlafen. 
[15:7] Darauf ist er erschienen dem Jakobus, dann allen Aposteln. 
[15:8] Zu allerletzt ist er, gleichsam als einer Frühgeburt, auch mir erschienen. 
[15:9] Denn ich bin der geringste unter den Aposteln: ja ich verdiene den Apostelnamen nicht, weil ich die Kirche Gottes verfolgt habe. 
[15:10] Doch durch Gottes Gnade bin ich, was ich bin: und seine Gnade, die mir zuteil geworden, ist nicht fruchtlos geblieben. Ja ich habe viel mehr gearbeitet als sie alle; doch nein! nicht ich, sondern Gottes Gnade, die mit mir wirkt. 
[15:11] Mag es sich nun um mich oder um jene handeln — dies ist unsere Botschaft, dies war auch euer Glaube. 
[15:12] Ist nun Christi Auferstehung der Kern unserer Botschaft, wie können dann einige unter euch behaupten: Eine Auferstehung der Toten gibt es nicht? 
[15:13] Gibt's aber keine Auferstehung der Toten, so ist auch Christus nicht auferstanden. 
[15:14] Und ist Christus nicht auferstanden, so ist unsere Botschaft nur ein leerer Wahn, und leerer Wahn ist dann auch euer Glaube. 
[15:15] Ja noch mehr: wir erweisen uns sogar als falsche Zeugen im Dienst Gottes; denn wir haben gegen Gott Zeugnis abgelegt, wenn wir verkündigen, er habe Christus auferweckt. Er hat ihn ja nicht auferweckt, wenn ihr recht habt mit eurer Behauptung, daß die Toten nicht auferstehen. 
[15:16] Denn stehen die Toten nicht auf, so ist auch Christus nicht auferstanden. 
[15:17] Ist aber Christus nicht auferstanden, so ist euer Glaube töricht. Ihr seid dann noch in euern Sünden. 
[15:18] Folglich sind auch die im Vertrauen auf Christus Entschlafenen verloren. 
[15:19] Hoffen wir nur für dieses Leben auf Christus, so sind wir die beklagenswertesten unter allen Menschen. 
[15:20] Nun aber ist Christus auferstanden von den Toten — als Erstling der Entschlafenen. 
[15:21] Weil durch einen Menschen der Tod gekommen ist, so kommt auch durch einen Menschen die Auferstehung der Toten. 
[15:22] Denn wie durch Adam alle dem Tod verfallen sind, so sollen umgekehrt durch Christus alle wieder zum Leben kommen. 
[15:23] Jeder aber gelangt zur Auferstehung in seiner besonderen Schar. Zuerst ist Christus auferstanden. Dann werden auferstehen, die Christus angehören, wenn er wiederkommt 
[15:24] Darauf tritt der Schluß (der Auferstehung) ein, und zwar dann, wenn er das Königreich Gott dem Vater übergeben wird, nachdem er alle (gottfeindliche) Herrschaft, Macht und Gewalt vernichtet hat. 
[15:25] Er muß so lange als König herrschen, bis er seinen Fuß auf den Nacken aller seiner Feinde gesetzt hat. 
[15:26] Als letzter Feind wird der Tod vernichtet. 
[15:27] Denn Gott hat alles unter seine Füße gelegt. Heißt es aber in dieser Stelle: "Alles ist (Christus) unterworfen", so ist selbstverständlich davon ausgenommen er, der ihm alles unterworfen hat. 
[15:28] Wenn nun dem Sohn erst alles unterworfen ist, dann wird er sich auch selbst unterordnen dem, der ihm alles unterworfen hat, damit Gott alles sei in allen. — 
[15:29] Wäre es mit der Auferstehung der Toten nichts, welchen Nutzen hätten dann alle, die sich taufen lassen, von der Taufe für ihre sterblichen Leiber? Stehen die Toten überhaupt nicht auf, welchen Gewinn hat man dann von der Taufe für den sterblichen Leib? 
[15:30] Warum begeben auch wir uns dann stündlich in Gefahr? Täglich schwebt mir der Tod vor Augen! 
[15:31] Das ist so gewiß, meine Brüder, als ich mich euer rühme in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus, unserem Herrn. 
[15:32] Hätte ich nur aus menschlichen Gründen in Ephesus mit den wilden Tieren gekämpft — was hätte mir das genützt? Stehen die Toten nicht auf, dann hat das Sprichwort recht: Laßt uns essen und trinken; den morgen sind wir tot! 
[15:33] Laßt euch nicht irreleiten! "Ein schlechter Umgang macht auch gute Sitten schlecht." 
[15:34] Werdet nüchtern, wie sich's gehört, und versündigt euch nicht! Denn manchen von euch fehlt es an der rechten Erkenntnis Gottes. Das muß ich euch zu eurer Schande sagen. 
[15:35] Nun könnte einer fragen: "Wie stehen die Toten auf? Und mit welchem Leib kommen sie wieder?" 
[15:36] Du Tor! Was du säst, wird erst dann lebendig, wenn es vorher erstorben ist. 
[15:37] Und was du säst, ist nicht die Pflanze, die später entsteht, sondern ein nacktes Samenkorn: von Weizen oder von anderen Früchten. 
[15:38] Gott aber gibt dem Korn einen Leib, wie er will: jeder Samenart ihren besonderen Leib. 
[15:39] Nicht alles Fleisch ist gleicher Art: anders ist es bei Menschen, anders bei vierfüßigen Tieren, anders bei Vögeln, anders bei Fischen. 
[15:40] So gibt es auch himmlische Körper und irdische Körper. Doch die Schönheit der himmlischen ist anders als die der irdischen. 
[15:41] Anders ist der Glanz der Sonne, anders der Glanz des Mondes, anders der Glanz der Sterne. Ein Stern ist vom anderen verschieden an Glanz. 
[15:42] So ist's auch mit der Auferstehung der Toten. Gesät wird in Vergänglichkeit, auferweckt in Unvergänglichkeit. 
[15:43] Gesät wird in Unehre, auferweckt in Herrlichkeit. Gesät wird in Schwachheit, auferweckt in Kraft. 
[15:44] Gesät wird ein seelischer Leib, auferweckt ein geistlicher Leib. Gibt es einen seelischen Leib, so gibt's auch einen geistlichen. 
[15:45] Darum steht geschrieben: Der erste Mensch Adam ward eine lebendige Seele. Der letzte Adam ist ein lebendigmachender Geist. 
[15:46] Doch nicht das Geistliche kommt zuerst, sondern das Seelische; darauf folgt das Geistliche. 
[15:47] Der erste Mensch, aus Erde gebildet, ist irdisch. Der zweite Mensch stammt aus dem Himmel. 
[15:48] Wie der Irdische ist, so sind auch die Irdischen; und wie der Himmlische ist, so sind auch die Himmlischen. 
[15:49] Wie wir getragen des Irdischen Bild, so laßt uns auch tragen des Himmlischen Bild! 
[15:50] Das aber, Brüder, versichere ich euch: Fleisch und Blut kann Gottes Königreich nicht erben; Vergänglichkeit erbt nicht die Unvergänglichkeit. 
[15:51] Ich tue euch jetzt ein Geheimnis kund: Wir werden nicht alle entschlafen, wir werden aber alle verwandelt werden: 
[15:52] Im Nu geschieht das, im Augenblick, beim Schall der letzten Posaune. Es wird die Posaune erklingen: Dann werden die Toten unverweslich auferstehen, und wir werden verwandelt werden. 
[15:53] Denn dies Vergängliche muß anziehen Unvergänglichkeit, und dies Sterbliche muß anziehen Unsterblichkeit. 
[15:54] Hat aber dies Vergängliche angezogen Unvergänglichkeit, und hat dies Sterbliche angezogen Unsterblichkeit, dann erfüllt sich das Schriftwort: 
[15:55] Der Tod ist verschlungen vom Sieg! Tod, wo ist dein Sieg? Tod, wo ist dein Stachel? 
[15:56] Des Todes Stachel ist die Sünde, die Kraft der Sünde liegt im Gesetz. 
[15:57] Dank sei Gott, der uns den Sieg verleiht durch unseren Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[15:58] So steht denn fest, meine geliebten Brüder, laßt euch nicht wankend machen! Sondern schreitet unaufhörlich fort im Werk des Herrn! Ihr wißt ja, eure Mühe ist nicht umsonst in dem Herrn. 
[16:1] Bei der Geldsammlung zum Besten der Heiligen sollt ihr nach derselben Ordnung verfahren, die ich für die Gemeinden in Galatien gegeben habe. 
[16:2] Immer am ersten Wochentag soll jeder unter euch von seinem (wöchentlichen) Verdienst einen Teil beiseite legen und so eine größere Summe aufsparen, damit die Sammlungen nicht erst nach meiner Ankunft stattzufinden brauchen. 
[16:3] Wenn ich dann komme, so will ich die Männer, die ihr dafür auswählt, mit Empfehlungsschreiben absenden, damit sie eure Liebesgabe nach Jerusalem bringen. 
[16:4] Fällt die Sammlung reichlich genug aus, so will ich auch selbst hinreisen, und sie sollen mich dann begleiten. 
[16:5] Ich will zu euch kommen, wenn ich die Reise durch Mazedonien vollendet habe. Dort nehme ich keinen längeren Aufenthalt. 
[16:6] Bei euch aber werde ich wohl eine Zeitlang bleiben oder auch den Winter zubringen. Ihr könntet mir dann bis zu dem Ort, wohin ich weiterreise, das Geleit geben. 
[16:7] Ich möchte euch diesmal nicht nur im Vorbeigehen sehen. Ich hoffe vielmehr, eine Zeitlang bei euch zu verweilen, wenn es des Herrn Wille ist. 
[16:8] Hier in Ephesus bleibe ich bis Pfingsten. 
[16:9] Ich habe hier einen großen, vielversprechenden Wirkungskreis gefunden; aber es gibt auch viele Widersacher. 
[16:10] Wenn Timotheus kommt, so sorgt dafür, daß er ohne Furcht bei euch verweile. Er treibt das Werk des Herrn ebenso wie ich. 
[16:11] Daß ihn nun niemand mißachte! Geleitet ihn in Frieden zurück, daß er wieder zu mir komme! Denn ich erwarte ihn mit den Brüdern. 
[16:12] Dem Bruder Apollos habe ich vielfach zugeredet, sich den Brüdern bei ihrer Rückkehr zu euch anzuschließen. Doch gerade jetzt will er die Reise nicht unternehmen. Er wird aber sicher kommen, wenn er gelegene Zeit dazu findet. 
[16:13] Wacht, steht fest im Glauben; seid mannhaft und werdet stark! 
[16:14] Alles soll in der rechten Liebe bei euch zugehen. 
[16:15] Ich habe noch eine Bitte, liebe Brüder. Ihr kennt das Haus des Stephanas. Er ist zuerst in Achaja gläubig geworden, und seine Angehörigen haben sich dem Dienst der Heiligen gewidmet. 
[16:16] Fügt euch nun willig so verdienten Männern und allen, die mit ihnen wirken und sich abmühen! 
[16:17] Ich freue mich über den Besuch des Stephanas, Fortunatas und Achaikus: sie haben mich dafür entschädigt, daß ich eure Gegenwart entbehren muß. 
[16:18] Denn sie haben meinen Geist erquickt und euern. Wißt solche Männer recht zu schätzen! 
[16:19] Es grüßen euch die Gemeinden Asiens. Es senden euch viele Grüße im Herrn Aquilas und Priska mit ihrer Hausgemeinde. 
[16:20] Es grüßen euch alle Brüder. Grüßt einander mit dem heiligen Kuß! 
[16:21] Ich grüße euch, indem ich eigenhändig schreibe: Paulus. 
[16:22] Wer den Herrn nicht liebhat, den treffe Gottes Zorngericht! Marana tha. 
[16:23] Die Gnade des Herrn Jesus sei mit euch! 
[16:24] Ich liebe euch alle in Christus Jesus. 

### II Corinthians

[1:1] Paulus, durch Gottes Willen ein Apostel Christi Jesu, und der Bruder Timotheus entbieten ihren Gruß der Gemeinde Gottes in Korinth samt allen Heiligen in ganz Achaja. 
[1:2] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:3] Gepriesen sein der Gott und Vater unseres Herrn Jesus Christus — der Vater voll Barmherzigkeit und der Gott, der in jeder Weise tröstet! 
[1:4] Er tröstet uns in all unserer Trübsal, damit wir dann auch andere in ihren Trübsalen trösten können mit dem Trost, der uns von Gott zuteil wird. 
[1:5] Denn wie Christi Leiden reichlich über uns kommen, so wird uns auch durch Christus reichlich Trost geschenkt. 
[1:6] Und beides dient zu euerm Besten. Denn leiden wir Trübsal, so können wir euch auch (in eurer Trübsal) trösten und dadurch euerm Heil dienen. Und werden wir (von Gott) getröstet, so können wir euch auch Trost spenden, und der zeigt seine Kraft darin, daß ihr dieselben Leiden, die auch uns treffen, mit Standhaftigkeit ertragt. 
[1:7] Daß ihr solchen Trost erfahrt, ist unsere feste Hoffnung. Denn wir wissen, daß ihr nicht nur an unseren Leiden, sondern auch an unserem Trost Anteil habt. 
[1:8] Wir wollen euch, liebe Brüder, nicht in Unkenntnis lassen über die Trübsal, die uns in Asien widerfahren ist: sie hat uns so gewaltig und unerträglich gedrückt, daß wir sogar am Leben verzweifelten. 
[1:9] Ja wir glaubten eine sichere Beute des Todes zu sein. Denn wir sollten lernen, unser Vertrauen nicht auf uns selbst zu setzen, sondern auf Gott, der die Toten auferweckt. 
[1:10] Der hat uns denn auch aus des Todes Rachen errettet und rettet uns noch fort und fort. Ja, zu ihm steht unsere Hoffnung, daß er uns auch ferner retten wird. 
[1:11] In dieser Hoffnung stärkt uns die Gewißheit, daß auch ihr fürbittend für uns einsteht. So soll nun auch aus vielen Herzen ein Dankgebet aufsteigen für die gnädige Errettung, die so viele für uns (von Gott) erfleht haben. 
[1:12] Und dürfen wir uns nicht rühmen (eurer Teilname wert zu sein)? Unser Gewissen gibt uns ja das gute Zeugnis, daß wir in Heiligkeit und Lauterkeit, wie Gott sie wirkt, nicht in fleischlicher Weisheit, sondern von Gottes Gnade geleitet, unseren Wandel in der Welt und ganz besonders im Verkehr mit euch geführt haben. 
[1:13] Denn unsere Briefe an euch sind frei von allen Hintergedanken: sie sagen nichts anderes, als was ihr darin lest und wahrnehmt. Ich hoffe auch, ihr werdet es schließlich verstehen — wie ihr's zum Teil bereits verstanden habt —, 
[1:14] daß, ebenso wie wir uns euer rühmen dürfen, ihr euch auch unser an dem Tag unseres Herrn Jesus rühmen könnt. 
[1:15] In dieser Zuversicht war ich willens, euch zuerst zu besuchen, um euch eine doppelte Freude zu machen: 
[1:16] ich wollte über Korinth nach Mazedonien reisen und dann wieder von Mazedonien zu euch zurückkehren, um mir von euch das Geleit nach Judäa geben zu lassen. 
[1:17] Habe ich nun etwa leichtsinnig gehandelt, als ich diesen Plan faßte? Oder lasse ich mich bei meinen Entschlüssen von menschlichen Launen leiten, so daß ich heute ja und morgen nein sage? 
[1:18] Bei der Wahrhaftigkeit Gottes erkläre ich: unser Wort an euch ist nicht heute Ja und morgen Nein. 
[1:19] Denn der Sohn Gottes, Jesus Christus, den wir — ich, Silvanus und Timotheus — unter euch verkündigt haben, der ist auch nicht Ja und Nein zugleich gewesen, sondern ihm ist nur Ja. 
[1:20] Alle Verheißungen Gottes finden in ihm ihr Ja. Darum sprechen wir auch durch ihn zur Ehre Gottes das Amen aus. 
[1:21] Gott ist's, der uns und euch in Christi Gemeinschaft befestigt und uns gesalbt hat: 
[1:22] er hat uns auch sein Siegel aufgedrückt und seinen Geist als Angeld in unser Herz gegeben. 
[1:23] Ich rufe Gott zum Zeugen an für meine Seele: ich bin deshalb noch nicht wieder nach Korinth gekommen, weil ich zunehmend gegen euch verfahren wollte. 
[1:24] Damit will ich aber sagen, daß wir Herren sind über euern Glauben; nein, wir wollen nur eure Freude mehren. Denn im Glauben steht ihr fest. 
[2:1] Ich habe mir vorgenommen, euch bei einem neuen Besuch nicht wieder Betrübnis zu bereiten. 
[2:2] Denn wenn ich euch betrübe, wer soll mich dann erfreuen? Das könnte doch nur der, der von mir Betrübnis erfährt. 
[2:3] Deshalb habe ich mich auch brieflich an euch gewandt, um nicht bei meinem Besuch von denen, die mir Freude machen sollten, Betrübnis zu erfahren. Ich darf doch wohl zu euch allen das Vertrauen haben, daß meine Freude euer aller Freude ist. 
[2:4] Denn aus großer innerer Not und Herzensangst und unter vielen Tränen habe ich euch geschrieben, nicht um euch Betrübnis zu bereiten, sondern um euch die Liebe sehen zu lassen, die ich ganz besonders zu euch habe. 
[2:5] Hat jemand Kränkungen verursacht, der hat nicht mich gekränkt, sondern mehr oder weniger — um nicht zuviel zu sagen — euch alle. 
[2:6] Für diesen Mann genügt die Rüge, die ihm die Mehrzahl von euch erteilt habt. 
[2:7] Darum solltet ihr ihm jetzt verzeihen und Trost zusprechen, damit der Ärmste nicht etwa von den Fluten der Traurigkeit verschlungen wird. 
[2:8] So fordere ich euch denn auf: laßt Liebe gegen ihn walten! 
[2:9] Der Zweck meines letzten Briefes ist ja erreicht: ich wollte sehen, ob sich euer Gehorsam wirklich in allen Stücken bewährt. 
[2:10] Wenn ihr ihm nun verzeiht, so verzeihe ich ihm auch. Ja vor dem Angesicht Christi habe ich ihm um euretwillen bereits verziehen, wenn überhaupt noch etwas zu verzeihen war. 
[2:11] Denn der Satan soll keinen Vorteil über uns gewinnen. Solche Schliche kennen wir nur zu gut. 
[2:12] Ich kam nach Troas, um die Frohe Botschaft Christi zu verkündigen. Dort fand ich einen großen Wirkungskreis im Dienst des Herrn. 
[2:13] Trotzdem hatte ich keine Ruhe in meinem Geist, weil ich meinen Bruder Titus nicht antraf. Darum nahm ich Abschied von ihnen und zog nach Mazedonien. 
[2:14] Gott sei Dank, der uns im Dienst Christi fortwährend Siege feiern läßt und den Duft seiner Erkenntnis überall durch uns verbreitet! 
[2:15] Denn wir sind ein Gott angenehmer Wohlgeruch, den Christus wirkt — bei denen, die gerettet werden, und bei denen, die verlorengehen. 
[2:16] Für diese sind wir ein Geruch, der aus dem Tod kommt und zum Tod führt, für jene aber ein Geruch, der aus dem Leben kommt und zum Leben führt. Und wer ist zu solchem Dienst tüchtig? 
[2:17] Wir: denn wir treiben nicht wie so viele mit dem Wort Gottes Schacher; sondern wie Männer, die das Tageslicht nicht scheuen, ja, wie Männer, die von Gott gesandt sind und, eins mit Christus, vor Gottes Antlitz stehen, — so und nicht anders reden wir. 
[3:1] Fangen wir schon wieder an, uns selbst zu "empfehlen"? Oder bedürfen wir gar wie gewisse Leute Empfehlungsbriefe an euch oder von euch? 
[3:2] Unser Empfehlungsbrief seid ihr. Der ist in unser Herz geschrieben, der wird von aller Welt erkannt und auch gelesen. 
[3:3] Es ist ja klar zu sehen, daß ihr ein Brief Christi seid, den wir als seine Diener ausgefertigt haben: ein Brief, nicht mit Tinte geschrieben, sondern mit dem Geist des lebendigen Gottes; ein Brief, der nicht auf steinernen Tafeln steht, sondern auf fleischernen Herzenstafeln. 
[3:4] Diese Zuversicht können wir nur durch Christus vor Gott zum Ausdruck bringen. 
[3:5] Nicht durch eigene Kraft können wir aus uns selbst Gedanken schöpfen; nein, unsere Tüchtigkeit kommt von Gott. 
[3:6] Er hat uns tüchtig gemacht, Diener eines neuen Bundes zu sein: nicht Buchstabendiener, sondern Geistesdiener. Denn der Buchstabe (des Gesetzes) tötet, der Geist (des Herrn) macht lebendig. 
[3:7] Wenn aber schon der Dienst, der den Tod verkündigt — dessen Urkunde in Buchstaben auf Stein gegraben war — so herrlich gewesen ist, daß die Kinder Israel das Antlitz Moses wegen des Glanzes auf seinem Angesicht — der doch verschwand — nicht unverwandt ansehen konnten: 
[3:8] wie sollte da der Dienst, der den Geist mitteilt, nicht noch viel herrlicher sein? 
[3:9] Denn wenn der Dienst, der die Verurteilung ausspricht, herrlich gewesen ist: so ist der Dienst, der die Rechtfertigung schenkt, ganz unvergleichlich herrlicher. 
[3:10] Ja, man kann sagen: Jener Herrlichkeitsglanz (des ersten Dienstes) verblaßt hier völlig vor der überwältigenden Herrlichkeit (des anderen Dienstes). 
[3:11] Denn ist schon das Vergängliche herrlich, wieviel herrlicher ist da erst das Bleibende! 
[3:12] In dieser Hoffnung (auf die bleibende Herrlichkeit unseres Dienstes) reden wir nun frei und offen. 
[3:13] Wir machen es nicht wie Mose, der eine Decke auf sein Antlitz legte, weil die Kinder Israel nicht sehen sollten, daß der vergängliche Glanz ein Ende nahm. 
[3:14] Doch trotzdem ist ihr Sinn verstockt. Denn bis auf den heutigen Tag ist noch immer dieselbe Decke da, wenn ihnen die Schriften des Alten Bundes vorgelesen werden: es ist ihnen verborgen, daß der Alte Bund in Christus ein Ende hat. 
[3:15] Also bis heute liegt eine Decke auf ihrem Herzen, sooft Mose vorgelesen wird. 
[3:16] Wenn sich aber Israel dereinst zum Herrn bekehrt, dann soll diese Decke weggenommen werden. 
[3:17] Mit "dem Herrn" ist hier der Geist gemeint. Denn wo der Geist des Herrn ist, da ist Freiheit. 
[3:18] Und wir alle, die wir mit unverhülltem Angesicht die Herrlichkeit des Herrn wie in einem Spiegel schauen, wir werden in dasselbe Bild verwandelt, so daß seine Herrlichkeit die unsere wird. Das kann nicht anders sein, weil der Herr, das heißt der Geist, hier wirksam ist. 
[4:1] Weil wir nun diesen Dienst durch Gottes Erbarmen ausrichten dürfen, so sind wir nicht feige. 
[4:2] Nein, wir meiden alle "schändlichen Schleichwege"; wir gehen auch nicht mit "Arglist" um, noch "verfälschen" wir Gottes Wort; sondern wir machen offen die Wahrheit kund. So suchen wir uns vor Gottes Angesicht dem unbefangenen Bewußtsein aller Menschen zu empfehlen. 
[4:3] "Liegt nun trotzdem über unserer Heilsbotschaft eine Decke", so ist das nur der Fall bei denen, die verloren gehen. 
[4:4] Ihnen hat der Gott dieser Weltzeit wegen ihres Unglaubens den Sinn verblendet, damit ihnen nicht leuchte der Glanz der Frohen Botschaft von der Herrlichkeit Christi, der da ist das Ebenbild Gottes. 
[4:5] Denn wir verkündigen nicht "uns selbst", sondern Christus Jesus: er ist der Herr, und wir sind um Jesu willen eure Knechte. 
[4:6] Denn Gott, der einst gesprochen hat: "Das Lichte leuchte aus der Finsternis", der hat auch in unseren Herzen das Licht aufgehen lassen, damit (durch uns auch anderen) leuchte jene Erkenntnis der Herrlichkeit Gottes, die da strahlt auf Christi Angesicht. 
[4:7] Diesen (köstlichen) Schatz tragen wir aber in (zerbrechlichen) Tongefäßen — denn es soll sich zeigen, daß die überschwengliche Fülle der Kraft (die in diesem Schatz liegt) von Gott stammt, nicht von uns —. 
[4:8] Wir werden von allen Seiten bedrängt, doch nicht erdrückt; wir zagen wohl, doch wir verzagen nicht. 
[4:9] Wir werden verfolgt, aber nicht (von Gott) verlassen; wir werden zu Boden geworfen, doch nicht getötet. 
[4:10] Auf Schritt und Tritt tragen wir das Sterben Jesu an unserem Leib umher, damit sich auch das Leben Jesu an unserem Leib offenbare. 
[4:11] Denn im Dienst Jesu geraten wir mitten im Leben beständig in des Todes Rachen, damit sich auch das Leben Jesu an unserem sterblichen Fleisch offenbare. 
[4:12] So wirkt in uns der Tod, in euch jedoch das Leben. 
[4:13] Trotzdem erfüllt uns derselbe Glaubensgeist, der in dem Schriftwort zum Ausdruck kommt: Ich glaube, darum rede ich. Wir glauben auch, und darum reden wir auch. 
[4:14] Denn wir haben die Gewißheit, daß er, der den Herrn Jesus auferweckt hat, auch uns, die wir mit Jesus eins sind, auferwecken und uns zugleich mit euch darstellen wird (vor seinem Angesicht). 
[4:15] Dies alles erfahren wir um euretwillen. Denn je reicher der Strom der Gnade fließt, desto mehr Herzen sollen auch zur Ehre Gottes überströmen von Dank. 
[4:16] Deshalb sind wir auch nicht feige. Mag unser äußerer Mensch auch aufgerieben werden, unser innerer Mensch gewinnt dafür von Tag zu Tag stets neue Kraft. 
[4:17] Denn ein kurzer Augenblick leichter Trübsal bringt uns in überschwenglich reichem Maß eine ewige Fülle der Herrlichkeit, 
[4:18] wenn wir nicht schauen auf das Sichtbare, sondern auf das Unsichtbare. Denn das Sichtbare ist vergänglich, das Unsichtbare ist ewig. 
[5:1] Wir wissen ja: Wenn unser Zelt — das Haus, worin wir hier auf Erden wohnen — (im Tode) abgebrochen wird, so haben wir einen Bau, von Gott bereitet, ein himmlisches Haus, das nicht mit Händen gemacht ist, sondern ewig bleiben soll. 
[5:2] Solange wir in diesem Zelt wohnen, haben wir zu seufzen, weil wir voll Sehnsucht darauf warten, mit unserer himmlischen Behausung überkleidet zu werden. 
[5:3] Denn haben wir diese angezogen, dann werden wir nicht unbekleidet dastehen. 
[5:4] Solange wir also noch in diesem Zelt wohnen, haben wir zu seufzen unter einem schweren Druck. Denn wir möchten nicht entkleidet, sondern überkleidet werden, damit das Sterbliche verschlungen werde von dem Leben. 
[5:5] Gott ist's, der uns hierzu befähigt hat: er hat uns auch den Geist als Angeld darauf gegeben. 
[5:6] Darum sind wir allezeit getrost, obwohl wir wissen: Solange dieser Leib noch unsere Heimat ist, sind wir noch fern von der Heimat, 
[5:7] fern vom Herrn — denn unser Lebensweg führt uns hier durch Glauben, nicht durch Schauen —. 
[5:8] Trotzdem sind wir getrost und möchten sogar lieber diesen Leib verlassen und daheim sein bei dem Herrn. 
[5:9] Deshalb setzen wir auch alles daran, ihm (bei seinem Kommen) wohlgefällig zu sein — ganz einerlei, ob wir dann in diesem Leib wohnen oder ihn verlassen haben. 
[5:10] Denn wir alle müssen offenbar werden vor dem Richterstuhl Christi, damit ein jeder seinen Lohn empfange für sein Tun in diesem Leibesleben, es sei gut oder böse. 
[5:11] Weil wir nun wissen, wie sehr der Herr (als Richter) zu fürchten ist, könnten wir uns da bei den Menschen "einschmeicheln" wollen? Gott kennt uns genau. Ich hoffe, auch ihr seid innerlich von unserer Aufrichtigkeit überzeugt. 
[5:12] Damit wollen wir uns aber nicht wieder einmal bei euch "empfehlen". Nein, wir wollen euch nur Anlaß geben, eure gute Meinung von uns auch jenen Prahlern gegenüber zu vertreten, deren Herz ganz anders ist als ihr frommes Gesicht. 
[5:13] Sind wir nun wirklich "von Sinnen gekommen", so ist das im Dienst Gottes geschehen: sind wir aber bei gesundem Verstand, so ist das euch zum Segen. 
[5:14] Was uns ganz und gar gefangennimmt, das ist die Liebe, die Christus uns bewiesen hat. wir denken nämlich so: Einer ist für alle gestorben, folglich sind alle gestorben. 
[5:15] Und er ist darum für alle gestorben, damit die, die da leben, nicht mehr sich selbst leben, sondern dem, der zu ihrem Heil gestorben und auferstanden ist. 
[5:16] Darum beurteilen wir jetzt niemand mehr nach dem äußeren Augenschein. Und haben wir früher sogar Christus nur nach seiner äußeren Erscheinung im Fleisch beurteilt, so denken wir jetzt ganz anders von ihm. 
[5:17] Wer also mit Christus in Gemeinschaft steht, der ist ein neues Geschöpf. Das Alte ist (bei ihm) vergangen: ein Neues ist offenbar geworden. 
[5:18] Dies alles aber ist Gottes Werk: Er hat uns durch Christus mit sich versöhnt und uns den Dienst übertragen, die Versöhnung zu verkündigen. 
[5:19] Denn Gott war es, der in Christus die Welt mit sich versöhnte: er rechnet den Menschen ihre Übertretungen nicht zu, und er hat uns den Auftrag gegeben, die Versöhnung kundzumachen. 
[5:20] So treten wir in Christi Namen als Gesandte auf, ja, Gottes Stimme tönt durch unseren Mahnruf. Wir bitten in Christi Namen: "Laßt euch mit Gott versöhnen!" 
[5:21] Ihn, der die Sünde nicht gekannt, hat er für uns zur Sünde gemacht, damit wir in ihm Gottes Gerechtigkeit würden. 
[6:1] Als (Gottes) Mitarbeiter ermahnen wir euch auch: Laßt Gottes Gnade, die ihr empfangen habt, nicht ohne Wirkung bei euch bleiben! 
[6:2] Gott spricht ja: Zu willkommener Zeit habe ich dich erhört, am Tage des Heils habe ich dir geholfen. Jetzt ist die hochwillkommene Zeit, jetzt ist der Tag des Heils! 
[6:3] Wir geben euch in keiner Weise Anstoß, damit auf unseren Dienst kein Tadel falle. 
[6:4] Sondern in jeder Hinsicht beweisen wir uns, wie sich's für Gottes Diener ziemt: Voll Ausdauer sind wir in Trübsal, Nöten und Ängsten, 
[6:5] bei Schlägen und in Gefängnissen, bei Aufruhr und Mühsal, in Nachtwachen und Fasten. 
[6:6] Wir bewähren uns durch Reinheit des Lebens, durch Erkenntnis, Langmut und freundliches Wesen, durch Wirken im Heiligen Geist und ungeheuchelte Liebe, 
[6:7] durch Verkündigen der Wahrheit und Erweisung der Gotteskraft, indem wir die Waffen führe, die die Gerechtigkeit verleiht, zu Trutz und Schutz. 
[6:8] Wir bleiben fest, mag unser Weg durch Ehre oder Schande führen, mag man uns schmähen oder rühmen: Man schilt uns als Betrüger, und doch sind wir wahrhaftig. 
[6:9] Man hält uns für unbekannt, aber wir sind wohlbekannt. Man sagt, wir lägen im Sterben, und siehe da: wir leben! Man meint, Gott züchtige uns, und trotzdem werden wir nicht getötet. 
[6:10] Man denkt, wir müßten traurig sein, und wir sind immer fröhlich. Man hält uns für Bettler, aber wir machen viele reich. Es scheint, wir hätten nichts, und wir besitzen alles! 
[6:11] Wir haben offen zu euch geredet, o Korinther; unser Herz hat sich (in Liebe zu euch) weit aufgetan. 
[6:12] Es ist viel Raum für euch in unserem Herzen; doch in euern Herzen ist nur wenig Raum für uns. 
[6:13] Habt uns doch auch lieb — ich rede zu euch als zu meinen Kindern —: macht auch eure Herzen weit für uns! 
[6:14] - Habt nicht vertrauten Umgang mit den Heiden! Denn was hat die Gerechtigkeit zu schaffen mit der Gesetzlosigkeit? Oder welche Gemeinschaft haben Licht und Finsternis? 
[6:15] Wie stimmt Christus mit Beliar? Oder was hat der Gläubige zu tun mit dem Ungläubigen? 
[6:16] Wie verträgt sich der Tempel Gottes mit den Götzen? Und wir sind der Tempel des lebendigen Gottes. Denn Gott hat gesagt: Ich will unter ihnen wohnen und wandeln, ich will ihr Gott sein, und sie sollen mein Volk sein. 
[6:17] Darum: Geht aus von ihnen und sondert euch ab, spricht der Herr, und rührt nichts Unreines an! Denn ich will euch annehmen 
[6:18] und euer Vater sein, und ihr sollt meine Söhne und Töchter sein, spricht der allmächtige Herr. 
[7:1] Weil wir so köstliche Verheißungen haben, Geliebte, wollen wir uns reinigen von allem, was Fleisch und Geist befleckt, und ein heiliges Leben führen in Gottesfurcht! — 
[7:2] Gebt uns Raum (in euern Herzen)! Wir haben doch keinem von euch Unrecht getan, wir haben niemand betrogen. 
[7:3] Diese Worte sollen kein Vorwurf für euch sein: Wir wollen euch ja, wie ich eben erst gesagt, in Tod und Leben nicht aus unserem Herzen lassen. 
[7:4] Ich habe großes Vertrauen zu euch, ich habe viel an euch zu rühmen; ich habe Trost in Fülle und bin bei all unserer Trübsal überreich an Freude. 
[7:5] Auch nach unserer Ankunft in Mazedonien haben wir keinen ruhigen Augenblick gehabt, sondern überall gab es Widerwärtigkeit: von außen Kämpfe, im Herzen Angst. 
[7:6] Gott, der Tröster der Betrübten, hat uns aber durch die Ankunft des Titus Trost geschenkt, 
[7:7] das heißt nicht nur durch seine Ankunft, sondern vor allem durch die Erquickung, die er bei euch gefunden hat. Er hat uns erzählt, wie ihr euch sehnt (mich wiederzusehen), wie tief betrübt ihr seid, wie sehr ihr an mir hängt. Das alles hat meine Freude noch vermehrt. 
[7:8] Habe ich euch nun auch durch meinen Brief betrübt, so tut mir das jetzt nicht mehr leid. Früher hat es mir wohl leid getan — denn ich sehe, daß euch jener Brief, wenn auch nur vorübergehend, betrübt hat —. 
[7:9] Jetzt aber freue ich mich, freilich nicht darüber, daß ihr in Traurigkeit gekommen seid, aber daß euch diese Traurigkeit zur Sinnesänderung geführt hat. Eure Traurigkeit ist Gott wohlgefällig gewesen, und darum haben wir euch in keiner Weise Schaden zugefügt. 
[7:10] Denn die Traurigkeit, die Gott gefällt, wirkt eine Reue, die zum Heil führt, und solche Reue bereut man nie. Die Traurigkeit dagegen, die die Welt empfindet, wirkt den Tod. 
[7:11] Seht doch, welche Wandlung gerade diese gottgefällige Traurigkeit bei euch hervorgebracht hat! Ihr seid ernst geworden, ja noch mehr: ihr habt euch entschuldigt, ihr habt euerm Unwillen Ausdruck gegeben, ihr habt Furcht, ihr sehnt euch nach mir, ihr wollt streng vorgehen, ihr wollt strafen. So habt ihr deutlich bewiesen, daß ihr selbst in dieser Sache ohne jede Schuld seid. 
[7:12] Meinen Brief habe ich euch nicht deshalb geschrieben, um den Beleidiger zu strafen oder dem Beleidigten Genugtuung zu verschaffen, sondern vor Gottes Angesicht sollte es offenbar werden, wie sehr ihr uns gewogen seid. 
[7:13] Und da dies erreicht ist, so sind wir auch getröstet. Außer diesem Trost haben wir aber noch eine besondere Freude erlebt, als wir sahen, wie sehr sich Titus darüber freute, daß ihr alle seinen Geist so reich erquickt habt. 
[7:14] Denn wenn ich euch ihm gegenüber früher manchmal gerühmt habe, so bin ich nun nicht damit zuschanden geworden. Sondern wie alles, was wir zu euch geredet haben, die lautere Wahrheit ist, so hat sich auch unser Rühmen dem Titus gegenüber als Wahrheit erwiesen. 
[7:15] Und sein Herz schlägt jetzt noch mehr für euch als früher, wenn er daran denkt, wie gehorsam ihr alle gewesen seid, und mit welcher Scheu und Ehrfurcht ihr ihn aufgenommen habt. 
[7:16] Wie freue ich mich, daß ich nun in jeder Hinsicht Vertrauen zu euch haben kann! 
[8:1] Wir wollen euch nun auch mitteilen, liebe Brüder, wie reich sich die Gnade Gottes in den Gemeinden Mazedoniens erwiesen hat. 
[8:2] Trotz ihrer bedrängten Lage haben sie große Freudigkeit gezeigt, und trotz ihrer tiefen Armut haben sie eine überreiche Freigebigkeit an den Tag gelegt. 
[8:3] Denn nach Kräften — das muß ich ihnen bezeugen —, ja über ihre Kräfte haben sie freiwillig beigesteuert. 
[8:4] Sie haben uns dringend angefleht um die Gunst, an dem Liebeswerk für die Heiligen (in Jerusalem) teilnehmen zu dürfen. 
[8:5] Auch ist ihre Gabe viel reicher gewesen, als wir erwarten konnten: im Gehorsam gegen Gottes Willen haben sie sich selbst (und ihre Gaben) zunächst dem Herrn und dann auch uns zur Verfügung gestellt. 
[8:6] Dieser Erfolg hat uns nun ermutigt, dem Titus zuzureden, auch bei euch die schon früher begonnene Sammlung zu vollenden. 
[8:7] Wie ihr euch sonst überall hervortut: durch Glauben, Einsicht und Erkenntnis, durch regen Eifer und zumal durch innige Liebe zu mir, so tut euch auch bei diesem Liebeswerk hervor! 
[8:8] Ich will euch hier nichts befehlen, ich halte euch nur den Eifer anderer vor, um zu prüfen, ob auch eure Liebe echt ist. 
[8:9] - Ihr kennt ja die Gnade unseres Herrn Jesus Christus: er war reich, und trotzdem ist er arm geworden um euretwillen, um euch durch seine Armut reich zu machen —. 
[8:10] Ich gebe euch hier nur einen Rat. Den der kann euch nur nützlich sein. Im vorigen Jahr habt ihr schon mit der Sammlung begonnen: ihr habt sie also nicht nur zuerst ins Werk gesetzt, ihr habt sie auch zuerst beschlossen. 
[8:11] Führt nun das angefangene Werk jetzt auch zu Ende, damit dem freudigen Entschluß auch die Tat entspreche, soweit euch eure Mittel das erlauben! 
[8:12] Denn wer mit freudigem Herzen nach seinem Vermögen gibt, der ist Gott angenehm. Gott verlangt nicht, was man selbst nicht hat. 
[8:13] Ihr sollt also andere nicht so unterstützen, daß ihre Not gelindert wird, während ihr selbst in Not geratet. Nein, es handelt sich hier nur um einen Ausgleich: 
[8:14] Diesmal soll euer Überfluß ihrem Mangel abhelfen, damit ein andermal ihr Überfluß euerm Mangel zugute komme. Auf diese Weise soll ein Ausgleich stattfinden, 
[8:15] wie geschrieben steht: Wer viel (Manna) sammelte, der hatte keinen Überfluß; und wer nur wenig sammelte, der litt keinen Mangel. 
[8:16] Gott sei Dank, daß er Titus denselben Eifer um euch ins Herz gegeben hat (der uns erfüllt)! 
[8:17] Denn er ist unserer Aufforderung (euch zu besuchen) nachgekommen. Bei seinem Eifer hätte es aber gar keiner Aufforderung bedurft: er kommt ganz aus eigenem Antrieb zu euch. 
[8:18] Und mit ihm senden wir jenen Bruder, der als Diener der Heilsbotschaft in allen Gemeinden geschätzt wird, 
[8:19] und der außerdem auch zur Ehre des Herrn und auf unseren ausdrücklichen Wunsch von den Gemeinden (Mazedoniens) zu unserem Reisegefährten erwählt worden ist, um diese Liebesgabe, die wir jetzt einsammeln, mit uns (nach Jerusalem) zu bringen. 
[8:20] So vermeiden wir die Gefahr, daß man uns bei dieser reichen Gabe, die wir sammeln irgendeinen Vorwurf mache. 
[8:21] Den unsere Sorge ist, daß alles redlich zugehe nicht nur vor Gott, sondern auch vor Menschen. 
[8:22] Mit beiden senden wir noch einen dritten Bruder: sein Eifer, den wir schon bei vielen Gelegenheiten erprobt haben, ist gerade jetzt besonders groß, da er das vollste Vertrauen zu euch hat. 
[8:23] Für Titus rede ich, weil er mein Gehilfe und mein besonderer Mitarbeiter bei euch ist. Was die beiden anderen Brüder angeht, so sind sie Abgesandte der Gemeinden und Diener, die zur Ehre Christi wirken. 
[8:24] Wenn ihr nun diesen Männern Liebe beweist und das, was wir von euch gerühmt haben, durch euer Verhalten gegen sie rechtfertigt, so (steht ihr auch) vor den (anderen) Gemeinden (in gutem Licht da). 
[9:1] Über die Liebesgabe selbst, die für die Heiligen bestimmt ist, brauche ich euch nicht weiter zu schreiben. 
[9:2] Denn eure Opferwilligkeit ist mir wohlbekannt. Ich rühme sie auch den Mazedoniern gegenüber, indem ich ihnen vorhalte: "Achaja ist schon seit Jahresfrist bereit, die gesammelten Gelder abzuliefern." So hat euer Eifer die Mehrzahl (der Mazedonier) angespornt. 
[9:3] Trotzdem sende ich euch die erwähnten Brüder: das Lob, das wir euch in diesem Stück erteilt, soll nicht hinfällig werden, sondern ihr sollt wirklich, wie ich behauptet habe, mit der Sammlung fertig sein. 
[9:4] Denn was wäre die Folge, wenn mich Brüder aus Mazedonien zu euch begleiten und fänden, ihr wärt noch nicht fertig? Dann müßten wir — um nicht zu sagen ihr — in dieser Sache beschämt dastehen. 
[9:5] Darum habe ich's für nötig erachtet, die Brüder aufzufordern, mir nach Korinth vorauszureisen und die von euch versprochene Liebesgabe ganz einzusammeln, damit sie bei meiner Ankunft bereitliege, und zwar als reiche Liebesgabe, nicht als karge. 
[9:6] Ich meine: Wer kärglich sät, der wird auch kärglich ernten; und wer reichlich sät, der wird auch reichlich ernten. 
[9:7] Jeder gebe, wie er sich's in seinem Herzen vorgenommen hat, ohne Unlust, ohne Zwang. Denn einen fröhlichen Geber hat Gott lieb. 
[9:8] Gott aber ist mächtig genug, euch mit (irdischem) Segen so zu überschütten, daß ihr nicht nur stets völlig euer Auskommen findet, sondern auch noch reichlich Mittel habt zu allerlei Liebeswerken. 
[9:9] Steht doch geschrieben: Er hat ausgestreut, er hat den Armen gegeben, seine Gerechtigkeit bleibt ewig. 
[9:10] Der nun dem Sämann Samen gibt und ihm Brot zur Speise reicht, der wird auch euch (bei eurer Wohltätigkeit) reichlich Mittel schenken und die Früchte eurer Gerechtigkeit wachsen lassen. 
[9:11] Ja ihr sollt an irdischen Gütern solchen Überfluß haben, daß ihr nach Herzenswunsch beisteuern könnt zu unserer Liebesgabe, wofür die Empfänger Gott danken werden. 
[9:12] Denn diese gleichsam priesterliche Opfergabe, die durch unseren Dienst dargebracht wird, hilft nicht nur dem Mangel der Heiligen (in Jerusalem) ab. Sie wirkt noch mehr. Einmal wird sie viele dazu treiben, Gott (für seine Hilfe) zu danken 
[9:13] und im Blick auf die Bewährung (eures Glaubens), die sich durch diese Liebesgabe kundgibt, ihn dafür zu preisen, daß ihr dem Bekenntnis zu Christi Froher Botschaft so treu ergeben seid und die brüderliche Gemeinschaft mit ihnen und allen Gläubigen so aufrichtig festhaltet. 
[9:14] Dann aber werden sie auch für euch beten und sich in Liebe nach euch sehnen, weil sich Gottes Gnade so überschwenglich reich an euch beweist. 
[9:15] Ja, Gott sei Dank für seine unaussprechlich herrliche Gabe! 
[10:1] Nun habe ich, Paulus, — mit dem Hinweis auf Christi Freundlichkeit und Milde — noch ein besonderes Wort der Ermahnung an euch zu richten. Ich bin ja (nach den Worten meiner Gegner) feige, wenn ich euch Aug in Aug gegenüberstehe, doch mutig, wenn ich aus der Ferne zu euch rede. 
[10:2] Bitte, zwingt mich nicht, wenn ich bei euch bin, mutig aufzutreten mit jener zuversichtlichen Kühnheit, die ich gewissen Leuten gegenüber zeigen will, die da meinen, wir lassen uns von fleischlichen Rücksichten leiten. 
[10:3] Wohl leben wir noch im (sterblichen) Fleisch, doch kämpfen wir nicht fleischlich. 
[10:4] Denn die Waffen, womit wir kämpfen, sind nicht fleischlich. Gott macht sie stark, Bollwerke zu zerstören. 
[10:5] Wir vernichten damit (dem Glauben feindliche) Anschläge und jede stolze Festung, die sich gegen die Erkenntnis Gottes erhebt, und nehmen jeden Gedanken gefangen für den Gehorsam, wie ihn Christus bewiesen. 
[10:6] Jeden Ungehorsam aber sind wir entschlossen zu strafen, wenn ihr (als Gemeinde) unseren Weisungen erst völlig gehorsam geworden seid.. 
[10:7] Seht auf das, was klar vor Augen liegt! Trotzt einer darauf, Christi Diener zu sein, der sage sich, daß wir ebenso gut Christus dienen wie er. 
[10:8] Und sollte ich mich der uns vom Herrn verliehenen Vollmacht — euch zu erbauen, nicht euch zu zerstören — auch noch viel lauter rühmen, so würde ich nicht damit zuschanden. 
[10:9] Ich will aber nicht den Schein erwecken, als suchte ich euch durch meine Briefe einzuschüchtern. 
[10:10] "Seine Briefe" — so sagt man ja — "sind wuchtig und entschieden; seine äußere Erscheinung aber macht keinen Eindruck, und reden kann er gar nicht." 
[10:11] Wer so spricht, der lasse sich gesagt sein: Wie wir aus der Ferne in unseren Briefen reden, so werden wir auch nach unserer Ankunft handeln. 
[10:12] Allerdings haben wir nicht den "Mut", uns mit gewissen Leuten, die sich selbst empfehlen, auf eine Stufe zu stellen und uns mit ihnen zu vergleichen. Diese Leute messen sich in ihrem Unverstand an sich selbst und spiegeln sich in ihrem eigenen Bild. 
[10:13] Wir dagegen wollen uns nicht maßlos rühmen, sondern uns mit unserem Rühmen auf das Arbeitsfeld beschränken, das Gott uns abgemessen hat, und das auch euch umfaßt. 
[10:14] Wir dehnen unseren Wirkungskreis nicht eigenmächtig aus, sondern ihr gehört mit dazu. Denn wir sind ja mit Christi Froher Botschaft wirklich bis zu euch gekommen und haben sie euch zuerst verkündigt. 
[10:15] Wir schreiben uns also nicht in maßlosem Ruhmesdünkel die Früchte fremder Arbeit zu. Wohl aber hoffen wir: wenn euer Glaube wächst, so können wir später — doch stets innerhalb der Grenzen des uns angewiesenen Arbeitsfeldes — von euch aus einen größeren Wirkungskreis aufsuchen 
[10:16] und auch in jenen Gegenden, die über Korinth hinaus (weiter westwärts) liegen, die Heilsbotschaft verkündigen. Dabei wollen wir aber nie in ein fremdes Arbeitsfeld eindringen noch uns der durch andere errungenen Erfolge rühmen. Nein: 
[10:17] Wer sich rühmt, der rühme sich des Herrn! 
[10:18] Denn nicht der ist bewährt (als Gottes Diener), der sich selbst empfiehlt, sondern der, den der Herr empfiehlt. 
[11:1] Daß ihr euch doch ein klein wenig "Torheit" von mir gefallen ließet! Und nicht wahr, das tut ihr auch. 
[11:2] Denn ich liebe euch ja mit einer Eifersucht, wie sie Gott empfindet, und ich habe euch für einen Mann geworben, um euch als eine Jungfrau Christus zuzuführen. 
[11:3] Ich fürchte aber: wie Eva durch die List der Schlage verführt worden ist, so können vielleicht auch eure Gedanken betört und abgezogen werden von der Aufrichtigkeit und Lauterkeit, die ihr Christus schuldet. 
[11:4] Kommt nämlich einer zu euch und verkündigt euch einen anderen Jesus, den wir nicht verkündigt haben, oder empfangt ihr einen Geist verschieden von dem, den ihr (durch meinen Dienst) empfangen habt, oder hört ihr eine Heilsbotschaft, die der, die ihr vernommen, widerspricht, — so laßt ihr euch das gern gefallen. 
[11:5] Ich glaube doch in keinem Stück hinter den "unvergleichlich hohen Aposteln" zurückzustehen. 
[11:6] Denn bin ich auch ein Stümper in der Redekunst, so bin ich es doch nicht in der Erkenntnis, die haben wir stets in jeder Hinsicht in bezug auf euch bewiesen. 
[11:7] Oder ist es etwa eine Sünde, daß ich mich selbst erniedrigt habe, um euch zu erhöhen? Ich rede hier davon, daß ich euch Gottes Heilsbotschaft umsonst verkündigt habe. 
[11:8] Andere Gemeinden habe ich ausgeplündert und Bezahlung von ihnen genommen, um euch zu dienen. 
[11:9] Und als ich bei euch war und Mangel litt, bin ich doch keinem zur Last gefallen. Denn was ich nötig hatte, das haben mir die Brüder aus Mazedonien mitgebracht. Ich habe mich stets gehütet, euch zur Last zu fallen, und das will ich auch in Zukunft tun. 
[11:10] Bei Christi Wahrhaftigkeit, die in mir wohnt, versichere ich: daß ich mich so rühme, dem soll in dem Gebiet von Achaja kein Riegel vorgeschoben werden. 
[11:11] Warum? Etwa weil ich euch nicht liebhabe? Das weiß Gott! 
[11:12] Doch wie ich jetzt handle, so will ich auch in Zukunft handeln, um denen, die ihre Freude daran finden (mich zu schmähen), jeden Vorwand dafür abzuschneiden und sie zu zwingen, wenn sie sich rühmen wollen, sich ebenso zu zeigen wie wir. (Aber so zeigen sie sich nicht.) 
[11:13] Denn diese Leute sind falsche Apostel, Arbeiter, die mit Lug und Trug umgehen, die sich in Apostel Christi verkleiden. 
[11:14] Und das ist gar kein Wunder. Denn auch der Satan, ihr Meister, verkleidet sich in einen Engel des Lichts. 
[11:15] Da kann es nicht befremden, wenn auch seine Diener äußerlich als Diener der Gerechtigkeit auftreten. Sie werden aber ein Ende nehmen, wie ihre Werke verdienen. 
[11:16] Noch einmal sage ich: Niemand denke, ich sei ein "Tor". Haltet ihr mich aber doch dafür, nun, dann kann ich auch warten, daß ihr mich mit meiner Torheit anhört und auch mir erlaubt, einen kleinen Augenblick zu prahlen. 
[11:17] Was ich jetzt rede, das rede ich also nicht im Sinne des Herrn, das rede ich wie ein Tor; denn jetzt soll doch einmal geprahlt werden. 
[11:18] Weil so viele mit äußeren Vorzügen prahlen, darum will ich auch einmal so prahlen. 
[11:19] Ihr klugen Leute habt ja die Toren so gern. 
[11:20] Ja ihr habt es gern, wenn man euch mit List einfängt, wenn man hochfahrend auftritt, wenn man euch ins Antlitz schlägt. 
[11:21] Zu meiner Schande muß ich gestehen: das haben wir nicht fertiggebracht. Womit aber sonst gewisse Leute prahlen — ich rede töricht —, damit kann ich auch prahlen: 
[11:22] Sie sind Hebräer? Ich auch. Sie sind Israeliten? Ich auch. Sie sind Nachkommen Abrahams? Ich auch. 
[11:23] Sie sind Christi Diener? Das bin ich noch viel mehr — dies sage ich freilich im Wahnwitz —. Ich habe viel mehr Mühsal erduldet, bin häufiger im Gefängnis gewesen, bin übermäßig geschlagen worden, habe oft dem Tod ins Auge geschaut. 
[11:24] Von den Juden habe ich fünfmal vierzig Streiche weniger einen erhalten. 
[11:25] Dreimal bin ich mit Ruten gepeitscht und einmal gesteinigt worden. Dreimal habe ich Schiffbruch gelitten, vierundzwanzig Stunden bin ich ein Spielball der Meereswogen gewesen. 
[11:26] Dann die vielen Reisen und Gefahren aller Art: Gefahren auf Flüssen, Gefahren von den Heiden, Gefahren von meinem eigenen Volk, Gefahren in der Wüste, Gefahren auf der See, Gefahren unter falschen Brüdern. 
[11:27] Dazu: Mühe und Drangsal, viele schlaflose Nächte, Hunger und Durst, viel Fasten, Kälte und Blöße. 
[11:28] Endlich — von allem anderen hier zu schweigen — die tägliche Arbeit, die auf mir liegt: die Sorge für alle Gemeinden. 
[11:29] Ist einer schwach, bin ich dann nicht mit ihm schwach? Fällt einer in Sünde, bin ich da nicht (von Schmerz) entbrannt? 
[11:30] Bin ich gezwungen, mich zu rühmen, so will ich mich meiner Schwachheit rühmen. 
[11:31] Der Gott und Vater des Herrn Jesus — der gepriesen sei in Ewigkeit — der weiß, daß ich nicht lüge: 
[11:32] In Damaskus ließ der Statthalter des Königs Aretas die Stadt bewachen, um mich gefangenzunehmen. 
[11:33] Da wurde ich durch ein Fenster in einem Korb die Mauer hinabgelassen, und so entging ich seinen Händen. 
[12:1] Ich muß mich rühmen — es taugt zwar nicht —, und so will ich nun auf die Gesichte und Offenbarungen eingehen, die mir der Herr geschenkt hat. 
[12:2] Ich kenne einen Jünger Christi, der vor vierzehn Jahren — ob im Leib oder außerhalb des Leibes, das weiß ich nicht, Gott weiß es — bis in den dritten Himmel entrückt wurde. 
[12:3] Und von demselben Menschen ist mir bekannt, daß er — ob im Leib oder ohne seinen Leib, das weiß ich nicht, Gott weiß es — 
[12:4] bis in das Paradies entrückt worden ist und (dort) geheimnisvolle Dinge vernommen hat, von denen man nicht reden darf. 
[12:5] Wenn ich aber an mich selbst denke, so will ich mich nur meiner Schwachheit rühmen. 
[12:6] Wollte ich mich jedoch rühmen, so wäre ich deshalb kein "Tor": denn ich würde ja die Wahrheit sagen. Ich verzichte aber darauf (mich zu rühmen), damit mich niemand überschätze, sondern jeder mich nur nach dem beurteile, was er an mir sieht und hört. 
[12:7] Damit ich jedoch wegen der außerordentlichen Offenbarungen nicht hochmütig werde, ist mir ein Stachel ins Fleisch gegeben worden: ein Satansengel, der mich mit Fäusten schlagen muß, damit ich nicht hochmütig werde. 
[12:8] Dreimal habe ich den Herrn angefleht, daß dieser Satansengel von mir weiche. 
[12:9] Doch der Herr hat mir geantwortet: "Es genügt dir meine Gnade; denn die Kraft zeigt sich am herrlichsten in der Schwachheit." So will ich mich denn am liebsten gerade meiner Schwachheiten rühmen, damit Christi Kraft bei mir einkehre. 
[12:10] Darum habe ich meine Freude an den Schwachheiten, Schmähungen, Nöten, Verfolgungen und Drangsalen, die ich um Christi willen leide. Denn wenn ich schwach bin, dann bin ich stark. 
[12:11] Ich habe mich (mit meinem Rühmen) wirklich töricht gezeigt. Ihr habt mich aber dazu gezwungen. Denn ich hätte von euch empfohlen werden sollen (und nicht meine Gegner). Ich bin ja in keiner Weise hinter den "unvergleichlich hohen Aposteln" zurückgeblieben, wenn ich auch "nichts bin". 
[12:12] Fürwahr, die Beweise für mein Apostelamt habe ich durch Zeichen, Wunder und Taten übernatürlicher Kraft in unermüdlicher Ausdauer unter euch erbracht. 
[12:13] Denn worin steht ihr hinter den anderen Gemeinden zurück? Doch nur darin, daß ich euch nicht zur Last gefallen bin. Verzeiht mir dieses Unrecht! 
[12:14] Jetzt will ich euch zum drittenmal besuchen, und auch da will ich euch nicht zur Last fallen. Denn ich suche nicht euer Hab und Gut, sondern euch selbst. Es sollen ja auch nicht die Kinder den Eltern Schätze sammeln, sondern umgekehrt, die Eltern den Kindern. 
[12:15] Ich aber will nicht nur mein Hab und Gut, sondern sogar mein Leben mit Freuden für eure Seelen opfern. Soll ich denn, je mehr ich euch liebe, nur desto weniger Gegenliebe von euch erfahren? 
[12:16] Doch gut: Ich bin euch nicht zur Last gefallen. Aber "ich bin durchtrieben und habe euch mit Kost um das Eure gebracht". 
[12:17] Habe ich euch denn durch einen meiner Mitarbeiter ausbeuten lassen? 
[12:18] Ich habe Titus veranlaßt, euch zu besuchen, und habe mit ihm den bekannten Bruder gesandt. Hat euch etwa Titus ausgebeutet? Haben wir nicht beide in demselben Geist gehandelt? Sind wir nicht in denselben Fußstapfen gewandelt? 
[12:19] Schon längst denkt ihr wohl, wir wollten uns vor euch verteidigen. Nein, wir reden vor Gottes Angesicht als solche, die mit Christus in Gemeinschaft stehen. Alle unsere Worte, Geliebte, sollen nur zu eurer Förderung dienen. 
[12:20] Ich fürchte nämlich, daß ich euch bei meiner Ankunft nicht so finde, wie ich möchte, und daß auch ihr mich nicht nach euerm Wunsch findet. Ich fürchte, Zank und Neid, Leidenschaft und Selbstsucht, Verleumdung und Ohrenbläserei, Aufgeblasenheit und Unordnung bei euch anzutreffen. 
[12:21] Ja mir ist bange, daß mich mein Gott, wenn ich nun komme, aufs neue bei euch demütige und ich über viele trauern müsse, die noch in ihren alten Sünden stecken und sich nicht bekehrt haben von ihrer Unreinigkeit, Hurerei und Ausschweifung, in die sie gefallen sind. 
[13:1] Zum drittenmal will ich jetzt zu euch kommen. Durch die Aussage zweier oder dreier Zeugen soll jede Sache entschieden werden. 
[13:2] Was ich bei meiner zweiten Anwesenheit denen, die noch in ihren alten Sünden stecken, und allen anderen (Widerspenstigen) erklärt habe, das wiederhole ich jetzt in meiner Abwesenheit: Bei meiner Rückkehr will ich keine Schonung üben. 
[13:3] Ihr wünscht ja zu erfahren, daß Christus durch mich redet: er zeigt sich gegen euch nicht schwach; nein, er ist mächtig unter euch. 
[13:4] Denn ist er auch in (menschlicher) Schwachheit gekreuzigt worden, so lebt er nun durch Gottes Kraft. Wir sind auch schwach wie er; doch in seiner Gemeinschaft werden wir durch Gottes Kraft voll Leben sein, und das sollt ihr erfahren! 
[13:5] Seht zu, ob ihr im Glauben steht; prüft euch selbst! Oder merkt ihr nicht, daß Jesus Christus in euch wohnt? Ihr wärt sonst nicht echt (im Glauben). 
[13:6] Daß wir echt sind und die Probe bestehen, das sollt ihr hoffentlich erfahren. 
[13:7] Wir beten aber zu Gott, er möge euch vor allem Bösen bewahren. Uns liegt ja nicht daran, daß wir erprobt erscheinen, sondern daß ihr das Gute tut, — dann wollen wir gern als solche gelten, die die Probe nicht bestehen. 
[13:8] Denn wir vermögen nichts gegen die Wahrheit, wir wollen nur die Wahrheit fördern. 
[13:9] Ja wir freuen uns, wenn wir schwach sind und ihr stark seid. Und daß ihr euch wieder zurechtbringen laßt —, das ist es ja, was wir (von Gott) erflehen. 
[13:10] Gerade deshalb schreibe ich euch diesen Brief aus der Ferne, damit ich bei meiner Anwesenheit nicht mit Strenge aufzutreten brauche in der Ausübung der Macht, die mir der Herr verliehen hat zur Erbauung und nicht zur Zerstörung. 
[13:11] Im übrigen, Brüder, freut euch, laßt euch wieder zurechtbringen, nehmt Ermahnung an, seid einträchtig und lebt in Frieden! Dann wird der Gott der Liebe und des Friedens mit euch sein. 
[13:12] Grüßt einander mit dem heiligen Kuß! Es grüßen euch alle Heiligen. 
[13:13] 
[13:14] Die Gnade des Herrn Jesus Christus, die Liebe Gottes und die Gemeinschaft des Heiligen Geistes sei mit euch allen! 

### Galatians

[1:1] Paulus — ein Apostel, nicht von Menschen ausgegangen, auch nicht durch Menschen eingesetzt, sondern unmittelbar gesandt durch Jesus Christus und Gott den Vater, der ihn von den Toten auferweckt hat — und alle Brüder, 
[1:2] die bei mir sind: wir entbieten den Gemeinden Galatiens unseren Gruß. 
[1:3] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus, 
[1:4] der sich für unsere Sünden dahingegeben hat, damit er uns befreie aus der gegenwärtigen bösen Weltzeit nach dem Willen unseres Gottes und Vaters, 
[1:5] dem Ehre gebührt in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[1:6] Ich muß mich wundern, daß ihr den, der euch durch Christi Gnade berufen hat, so schnell verlaßt und euch einer ganz andersartigen Heilsbotschaft zuwendet! 
[1:7] Und doch gibt es gar keine andere. Es handelt sich nur um gewissen Leute, die euch zu verwirren suchen, und die jene Frohe Botschaft, die Christus gebracht, verfälschen wollen. 
[1:8] Aber selbst wenn wir oder ein Engel vom Himmel eine Botschaft verkündigten im Widerspruch mit der, die wir euch verkündigt haben — den treffe Gottes Zorngericht! 
[1:9] Wie wir schon früher gesagt haben, so wiederhole ich heute: Verkündigt euch einer eine Heilsbotschaft im Widerspruch mit mir, die ihr empfangen habt — den treffe Gottes Zorngericht! 
[1:10] Rede ich jetzt Menschen oder Gott zuliebe? Oder suche ich (mit meiner Predigt) "Menschen zu gefallen"? Wenn ich mich noch Menschen gefällig zeigte, so wäre ich nicht Christi Knecht. 
[1:11] Ich tue euch kund, Brüder, daß die von mir verkündigte Heilsbotschaft kein Menschenwerk ist. 
[1:12] Denn auch ich habe sie von keinem Menschen empfangen oder gelernt, sondern sie ist mir durch eine Offenbarung Jesu Christi zuteil geworden. 
[1:13] Ihr habt ja gehört, wie ich mich früher, als ich noch im Judentum lebte, verhalten habe: da verfolgte ich die Kirche Gottes über die Maßen und suchte sie zu zerstören. 
[1:14] Ja ich zeichnete mich im Judentum vor vielen Altersgenossen in meinem Volk aus, indem ich noch viel mehr als sie für die von meinen Vätern ererbten Überlieferungen eiferte. 
[1:15] Dann aber offenbarte Gott, der mich seit meiner Geburt (für seinen Dienst) ausersehen und durch seine Gnade berufen hat, 
[1:16] nach seinem Wohlgefallen seinen Sohn in mir, damit ich ihn unter den Heiden verkündige. Da fragte ich keine Menschen um Rat, 
[1:17] ich zog auch nicht nach Jerusalem zu denen, die vor mir Apostel gewesen sind, sondern ich ging geradewegs nach Arabien und kehrte von dort wieder nach Damaskus zurück. 
[1:18] Erst drei Jahre später zog ich dann nach Jerusalem, um Kephas kennenzulernen, und blieb vierzehn Tage bei ihm. 
[1:19] Sonst sah ich keinen der Apostel; ich sah nur noch Jakobus, den Bruder des Herrn. 
[1:20] Was ich euch hier schreibe — Gott ist mein Zeuge: ich lüge nicht! 
[1:21] Nachher kam ich in die Gegenden von Syrien und Zilizien. 
[1:22] Den Christengemeinden Judäas blieb ich persönlich unbekannt. 
[1:23] Sie hörten nur: "Unser früherer Verfolger verkündigt jetzt den Glauben, den er auszurotten suchte." 
[1:24] Und sie priesen Gott um meinetwillen. 
[2:1] Nach vierzehn Jahren ging ich zum zweitenmal nach Jerusalem, diesmal zusammen mit Barnabas, und nahm auch Titus als Begleiter mit. 
[2:2] Diese Reise machte ich infolge einer (göttlichen) Offenbarung. Ich legte ihnen die Heilsbotschaft vor, die ich unter den Heiden verkündige. Besondere Verhandlungen hatte ich dann noch mit denen, "die etwas galten", um von ihnen zu hören, ob ich mit meiner Arbeit ins Leere liefe oder gelaufen sei. 
[2:3] Sie waren aber so völlig mit mir einverstanden, daß nicht einmal mein Begleiter Titus trotz seiner heidnischen Herkunft zur Beschneidung genötigt wurde. 
[2:4] Freilich die gleichsam durch eine Hintertür eingedrungenen falschen Brüder verlangten dies. Sie hatten sich ja eingeschlichen, um unserer Freiheit, die wir in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus haben, aufzulauern. und uns ganz unter das Joch (des Gesetzes) zu bringen. 
[2:5] Diesen Leuten haben wir aber keinen Augenblick in Unterwürfigkeit nachgegeben, damit die Frohe Botschaft in ihrer vollen Wahrheit bei euch fortbestehe. 
[2:6] Wie groß das Ansehen derer war, "die etwas galten", das kümmert mich hier nicht weiter. Gott urteilt ja bei keinem Menschen nach äußeren Dingen. Übrigens hatten mir jene, "die etwas galten", nicht Neues mitzuteilen. 
[2:7] Im Gegenteil, sie sahen ein, daß ich mit der Frohen Botschaft für die Heiden betraut bin, wie Petrus mit der für die Juden. — 
[2:8] Denn der dem Petrus die Kraft gegeben hat, das Apostelamt unter den Juden auszurichten, der hat auch mir die Kraft gegeben für das Apostelamt unter den Heiden. — 
[2:9] Weil sie nun die mir verliehene Gnade erkannte, so gaben sie — Jakobus, Kephas und Johannes, die als Säulen angesehen wurden — mir und Barnabas den Handschlag zum Gemeinschaftsbund, und wir vereinbarten, wir sollten zu den Heiden gehen, sie aber zu den Juden. 
[2:10] Nur verlangten sie von uns, wir sollten der Armen gedenken, und das habe ich auch mit Eifer getan. 
[2:11] Als aber Kephas (einst) nach Antiochia kam, da bin ich ihm ganz offen entgegengetreten; denn sein Verhalten verdiente Tadel. 
[2:12] Vor der Ankunft einiger Sendboten des Jakobus hielt er nämlich Tischgemeinschaft mit den Heidenchristen. Nach ihrer Ankunft aber zog er sich feige zurück und trennte sich (von ihnen) aus Furcht vor den Judenchristen. 
[2:13] Und mit ihm heuchelten auch die anderen Judenchristen; ja selbst Barnabas ließ sich von ihrer Heuchelei mit fortreißen. 
[2:14] Als ich nun sah, daß sie nicht aufrichtig wandelten in Übereinstimmung mit der Wahrheit der Heilsbotschaft, da sprach ich zu Kephas in öffentlicher Gemeindeversammlung: "Wenn du als Jude heidnisch und nicht jüdisch lebst, wie kannst du da die Heiden zwingen, nach jüdischer Sitte zu leben? 
[2:15] Wir sind zwar geborene Juden und nicht Sünder heidnischer Herkunft. 
[2:16] Aber wir haben erkannt, daß man nicht aus Gesetzeswerken gerechtfertigt wird, sondern durch Jesu Christi Glauben. Deshalb sind wir auch an Christus Jesus gläubig geworden, um aus Christi Glauben und nicht aus Gesetzeswerken gerechtfertigt zu werden; denn aus Gesetzeswerken wird niemand gerechtfertigt. 
[2:17] Zeigt es sich nun aber, daß auch wir (Juden), wenn wir unsere Rechtfertigung in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus suchen, Sünder sind, kann man dann nicht sagen, daß Christus die Sünde befördere? Nimmermehr! 
[2:18] Wollte ich freilich das, was ich niedergerissen habe, wiederaufbauen, so würde ich mich dadurch zu einem Übertreter machen. (Doch davon bin ich weit entfernt.) 
[2:19] Denn ich bin gerade durch das Gesetz dem Gesetz gestorben, um (fortan) für Gott zu leben. Ich bin und bleibe mit Christus gekreuzigt. 
[2:20] Nun lebe ich nicht mehr mit meinem eigenen Ich, sondern Christus lebt in mir. Das Leben also, das ich jetzt noch im (sterblichen) Fleisch führe, ist ein Leben in dem Glauben des Sohnes Gottes, der mich geliebt und sich für mich dahingegeben hat. 
[2:21] Ich verwerfe die Gnade Gottes nicht (als überflüssig). Denn könnte man durchs Gesetz Gerechtigkeit erlangen, so wäre Christus umsonst gestorben." 
[3:1] O ihr unverständigen Galater, wer hat euch bezaubert? Und doch habe ich euch Jesus Christus so lebendig vor die Augen gemalt, als sähet ihr ihn am Kreuz hangen! 
[3:2] Beantwortet mir nur diese eine Frage: "Habt ihr den Geist empfangen, weil ihr Gesetzeswerke vollbracht oder weil ihr die Glaubensbotschaft angenommen habt?" 
[3:3] Seid ihr denn so unverständig? Ihr habt (euer Christenleben) im Geist begonnen und wollt nun im Fleisch enden? 
[3:4] Solltet ihr so viel geistliche Segnungen vergeblich empfangen haben? Ja, nicht nur vergeblich, sondern euch sogar zum Schaden und Gericht? 
[3:5] Der euch nun den Geist darreicht und Wunderkräfte unter euch wirkt: tut er das, weil ihr Gesetzeswerke vollbracht oder weil ihr die Glaubensbotschaft angenommen habt? 
[3:6] Es heißt ja: Abraham glaubte Gott, und das ward ihm zur Gerechtigkeit gerechnet. 
[3:7] Ihr seht also: Die es mit dem Glauben zu tun haben, die und keine anderen sind (wahre) Söhne Abrahams. 
[3:8] Weil aber die Schrift voraussah, daß Gott die Heiden durch den Glauben rechtfertigen würde, verhieß sie dem Abraham zum voraus die Frohe Botschaft: In dir sollen alle Völker gesegnet werden. 
[3:9] Mithin werden alle, die Glauben haben, zugleich mit dem gläubigen Abraham gesegnet. 
[3:10] Denn alle, die sich auf Gesetzeswerke stützen, sind unter einem Fluch. Es steht ja geschrieben: Verflucht ist jeder, der nicht beharrt bei allem, was in dem Buch des Gesetzes geschrieben ist, daß er es erfülle. 
[3:11] Da aber durch das Gesetz niemand bei Gott gerechtfertigt wird, ist klar; denn: Der Gerechte wird durch den Glauben das Leben erlangen. 
[3:12] Nun hat aber das Gesetz nichts mit dem Glauben zu tun; es heißt vielmehr: Wer seine Gebote erfüllt, der wird dadurch leben. 
[3:13] Darum hat uns Christus von dem Fluch des Gesetzes losgekauft, indem er für uns ein Fluch geworden ist. Es steht ja geschrieben: Verflucht ist jeder, der am Holz hängt. 
[3:14] So sollte der Abrahamssegen den Heiden in der Gemeinschaft mit Jesus Christus zuteil werden, und wir sollten den verheißenen Geist empfangen durch den Glauben. 
[3:15] Brüder, ich will ein Beispiel aus menschlichen Verhältnissen nehmen: Nicht einmal eines Menschen letztwillige Verfügung, die rechtskräftig geworden ist, kann man umstoßen oder durch Zusätze abändern. 
[3:16] Nun sind die Verheißungen dem Abraham und seinem Nachkommen zugesagt worden. Es heißt nicht: "und den Nachkommen" — in der Mehrzahl —, sondern in der Einzahl: "und deinem Nachkommen": das ist Christus. 
[3:17] Ich meine nun: Dies von Gott getroffene Verfügung kann doch nicht umgestoßen werden durch das Gesetz, das erst 430 Jahre später gegeben ist, so daß das Gesetz die Verheißung aufhöbe. 
[3:18] Denn käme das Erbe aus dem Gesetz, so käme es ja nicht mehr aus der Verheißung. Nun aber hat es Gott durch eine Verheißung dem Abraham aus Gnaden geschenkt. 
[3:19] Was soll denn da noch das Gesetz? Es ist der Übertretungen wegen (der Verheißung) hinzugefügt worden und sollte so lange in Kraft bleiben, bis der Nachkomme käme den die Verheißung gilt. Es ward durch Engel verordnet und (von ihnen) in die Hand eines Vermittlers gelegt. 
[3:20] Ein Vermittler ist jedoch da nicht nötig, wo nur ein einziger handelt. Gott aber ist nur einer. 
[3:21] Steht nun das Gesetz im Widerspruch mit den Verheißungen Gottes? Nimmermehr! Denn wäre ein Gesetz gegeben worden mit der Fähigkeit, lebendig zu machen, so käme die Gerechtigkeit wirklich aus dem Gesetz. 
[3:22] Nun aber hat die Schrift (in ihren Zeugnissen) alles als unter die Sünde verschlossen erklärt, damit die Verheißung als eine Frucht des Glaubens Jesu Christi allen denen zuteil würde, die da glauben. 
[3:23] Ehe indes der Glaube kam, waren wir unter der Aufsicht des Gesetzes wie in einem Gefängnis eingeschlossen bis auf die Zeit, wo sich der Glaube offenbaren sollte. 
[3:24] So ist das Gesetz unser Führer zu Christus geworden, damit wir aus Glauben gerecht würden. 
[3:25] Nachdem nun aber der Glaube gekommen ist, sind wir nicht mehr unter einem Führer. 
[3:26] Ihr seid ja alle Gottes Söhne durch den Glauben in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus. 
[3:27] Denn ihr alle, die ihr in Christus getauft worden seid, habt Christus angezogen. 
[3:28] Darum gibt es keinen Unterschied mehr zwischen Juden und Heiden, zwischen Sklaven und Freien, zwischen Mann und Weib: ihr seid alle eins in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus. 
[3:29] Gehört ihr aber Christus an, so gehört ihr auch zu Abrahams Nachkommen und seid kraft der Verheißung Erben. 
[4:1] Nun meine ich: Solange der Erbe noch nicht mündig ist, unterscheidet er sich in keiner Weise von einem Sklaven, obwohl ihm das ganze Gut gehört; 
[4:2] sondern er steht bis zu der von seinem Vater bestimmten Zeit unter der Aufsicht von Vormündern und Verwaltern. 
[4:3] Ebenso standen wir, solange wir (geistlich) noch nicht mündig waren, unter der Knechtschaft der Geistermächte, die in der Welt Einfluß haben. 
[4:4] Als aber die Zeit erfüllt war, da sandte Gott seinen Sohn von sich aus,, der von einem Weib geboren und unter das Gesetz gestellt ward, 
[4:5] damit er die, die dem Gesetz unterworfen waren, loskaufe, auf daß wir die Kindschaft empfingen. 
[4:6] Weil ihr nun Söhne seid, hat Gott den Geist seines Sohnes in eure Herzen ausgesandt, der da ruft: Abba, Vater! 
[4:7] Darum bist du nicht mehr ein Sklave, sondern ein Sohn. Bist du aber ein Sohn, so bist du auch ein Erbe durch Gott. 
[4:8] Damals freilich, als ihr Gott noch nicht kanntet, habt ihr denen, die in Wirklichkeit nicht Götter sind, als Knechte gedient. 
[4:9] Doch wie könnt ihr nun, nachdem ihr Gott erkannt habt oder, richtiger gesagt, von Gott (als sein Eigentum) erkannt worden seid, rückwärtsgehen, indem ihr euch den schwachen und armen Geistermächten zuwendet und Neigung zeigt, euch durch ihren Dienst in eine zweite, neue Knechtschaft zu begeben? 
[4:10] Ihr beobachtet ja schon Feiertage und Neumonde, Festzeiten und Sabbatjahre! 
[4:11] Ich fürchte, ich habe mich vergeblich mit euch abgemüht. 
[4:12] Werdet doch, wie ich bin; denn auch ich bin geworden, wie ihr früher wart — ich bitte euch, Brüder! Ihr habt mir ja kein Leid getan. 
[4:13] Ihr wißt: Als ich euch das erste Mal die Heilsbotschaft verkündigte, wurde ich durch Krankheit veranlaßt, bei euch zu verweilen. 
[4:14] Aber trotz meines körperlichen Leidens habt ihr mich nicht verachtet und verabscheut; sondern wie einen Engel Gottes, ja wie Christus Jesus selbst habt ihr mich aufgenommen. 
[4:15] Wo ist nun eure frühere Begeisterung geblieben? Ich muß euch das Zeugnis geben: Ihr hättet euch damals wo möglich die Augen ausgerissen und sie mir gegeben. 
[4:16] Bin ich denn jetzt euer Feind geworden, weil ich euch die Wahrheit vorgehalten habe? 
[4:17] Der Eifer, womit sie um eure Gunst werben, ist nicht lauter; sondern sie möchten euch von mir losreißen, damit ihr dann um ihre Gunst werbt. 
[4:18] Schön ist's freilich, im Dienst einer guten Sache eifrig umworben zu werden, und zwar allezeit und nicht nur dann, wenn ich bei euch bin. 
[4:19] Meine Kinder, die ich noch einmal mit Schmerzen gebäre, bis Christus in euch Gestalt gewinnt, 
[4:20] wie gern möchte ich jetzt bei euch sein und in anderem Ton zu euch reden! Denn im Augenblick weiß ich mir keinen Rat mit euch. 
[4:21] Ihr, die ihr unter dem Gesetz stehen wollt, sagt mir doch: Hört ihr denn das Gesetz nicht vorlesen? 
[4:22] Da steht ja geschrieben: Abraham hatte zwei Söhne, einen von der Sklavin und einen von der Freien. 
[4:23] Aber der Sohn der Sklavin ist auf dem natürlichen Weg erzeugt worden, der Sohn der Freien dagegen kraft der (göttlichen) Verheißung. 
[4:24] Das hat eine tiefere Bedeutung. Die beiden Frauen sind ein Bild von zwei (göttlichen) Verordnungen. Die eine (Verordnung) stammt von dem Berg Sinai; sie bringt Knechtschaft. Darauf weist Hagar hin. 
[4:25] Denn das Wort Hagar bedeutet bei den Arabern den Berg Sinai. Und Hagar entspricht dem jetzigen Jerusalem. Das ist ja mit seinen Kindern noch immer in Knechtschaft. 
[4:26] Aber das obere Jerusalem ist frei, und dies (Jerusalem) ist unsere Mutter. 
[4:27] Denn es steht geschrieben: Freue dich, du Unfruchtbare, die du nicht gebierst! Brich aus in Jubelruf, die du keine Wehen hast! Denn die Vereinsamte hat viel mehr Kinder als die Vermählte. 
[4:28] Ihr, liebe Brüder, seid nun ähnlich wie Isaak Kinder kraft (göttlicher) Verheißung. 
[4:29] Doch wie damals der nach dem Fleisch Erzeugte den nach dem Geist Erzeugten verfolgte, ebenso ist es auch jetzt. 
[4:30] Aber was sagt die Schrift? Verstoße die Sklavin und ihren Sohn; denn der Sklavin Sohn soll nicht erben mit dem Sohn der Freien! 
[4:31] Also, Brüder, sind wir nicht Kinder der Sklavin, sondern der Freien. 
[5:1] Für die Freiheit hat uns Christus freigemacht. Steht nun fest und laßt euch nicht wieder an ein Sklavenjoch binden! 
[5:2] Ich, Paulus, sage euch jetzt: Laßt ihr euch beschneiden, so wird euch Christus nichts mehr nützen. 
[5:3] Dabei bezeuge ich nochmals jedem, der sich beschneiden läßt, daß er sich damit zur Beobachtung des ganzen Gesetzes verpflichtet. 
[5:4] Eure Verbindung mit Christus ist zerrissen, wenn ihr durch Gesetz gerecht werden wollt; ihr seid dann aus der Gnade gefallen. 
[5:5] Im Besitz des (Heiligen) Geistes warten wir sehnsuchtsvoll darauf, die (volle) Gerechtigkeit als eine Frucht des Glaubens zu empfangen. 
[5:6] Denn in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus gilt weder Beschneidung noch Vorhaut etwas; da gilt nur ein Glaube, der sich durch Liebe wirksam zeigt. 
[5:7] (Auf dieser Glaubensbahn) seid ihr so schön gelaufen. Wer hat euch nun aufgehalten, daß ihr der Wahrheit nicht mehr folgen wollt? 
[5:8] Das ist die Stimme des Verführers; sie geht nicht aus von dem, der euch beruft. 
[5:9] Ein wenig Sauerteig durchsäuert den ganzen Teig. 
[5:10] Ich habe im Vertrauen auf den Herrn die Zuversicht zu euch, daß ihr ganz ebenso denken werdet. Der Mann aber, der euch irreführt — er sei, wer er wolle —, wird seiner Strafe nicht entgehen. 
[5:11] Predige ich aber wirklich noch (die Notwendigkeit der) Beschneidung, liebe Brüder, warum verfolgt man mich da noch? Dann wäre ja der Anstoß, den das Kreuz bereitet, hinweggeräumt. 
[5:12] Möchten doch die Leute, die euch aufwiegeln, in Zukunft lieber gleich beschneiden lassen! 
[5:13] Ihr, Brüder, seid zur Freiheit berufen. Nur mißbraucht die Freiheit nicht, um dem Fleisch zu Willen zu sein! Sondern durch die Liebe dient einander! 
[5:14] Denn das ganze Gesetz findet seine Erfüllung in dem einen Wort: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst. 
[5:15] Beißt und freßt ihr aber einander, so gebt acht, daß ihr euch nicht gegenseitig verzehrt! 
[5:16] Ich meine: Wandelt im Geist, dann werdet ihr des Fleisches Begehren nicht zur Tat werden lassen! 
[5:17] Denn das Fleisch mit seinem Begehren tritt dem Geist feindlich entgegen und ebenso der Geist dem Fleisch. Beide liegen im Kampf miteinander und dulden nicht, daß ihr nach euerm eigenen Willen handelt. 
[5:18] Laßt ihr euch aber von dem Geist leiten, so steht ihr nicht unter dem Gesetz. 
[5:19] Die Werkes des Fleisches liegen klar vor Augen; dahin gehören: Hurerei, Unreinigkeit, Ausschweifung, 
[5:20] Götzendienst, Zauberei, Feindschaft, Streit, Eifersucht, Zorn, Zank, Zwietracht, Spaltungen, 
[5:21] Neid, Trinkgelage, üppige Schmausereien und dergleichen. Ich sage euch vorher, wie ich euch schon früher gewarnt habe: Alle, die solche Dinge treiben, werden Gottes Königreich nicht ererben. 
[5:22] Die Frucht des Geistes aber ist: Liebe, Freude, Friede, Langmut, Freundlichkeit, Güte, Treue, Sanftmut, Enthaltsamkeit. 
[5:23] Dergleichen wird durch kein Gesetz verboten. 
[5:24] Die aber Christus Jesus angehören, die haben ihr Fleisch mit seinen Leidenschaften und Begierden gekreuzigt. 
[5:25] Wenn uns der Geist belebt, so laßt uns auch in fester Ordnung nach des Geistes Sinn vorwärtsschreiten! 
[5:26] Laßt uns nicht ehrgeizig sein, indem wir einander herausfordern und einander beneiden! 
[6:1] Brüder, sollte wirklich jemand bei einem Fehltritt betroffen werden, so bringt ihn als geistlich Gesinnte im Geist der Milde wieder zurecht, und sei auf deiner Hut, daß du nicht auch verführt werdest! 
[6:2] Tragt einer des anderen Lasten: dann erst werdet ihr das Gesetz Christi ganz erfüllen! 
[6:3] Denn wer sich einbildet, er sei etwas Besonderes, während er doch nicht ist, der betrügt sich selbst. 
[6:4] Jeder prüfe nur sein eigenes Tun! Dann wird er seinen Ruhm für sich behalten und nicht dem anderen gegenüber großtun. 
[6:5] Denn jeder wird seine eigene Last zu tragen haben. 
[6:6] Wer in dem Wort (Gottes) Unterricht erhält, der teile seinem Lehrer von allen seinen Gütern mit! 
[6:7] Laßt euch nicht irreführen: Gott wird nicht (ungestraft) verspottet! Denn was der Mensch sät, das wird er auch ernten. 
[6:8] Wer auf sein Fleisch sät, der wird von dem Fleisch Verderben ernten; wer aber auf den Geist sät, der wird von dem Geist ewiges Leben ernten. 
[6:9] Im Gutestun laßt uns nicht müde werden! Denn zu seiner Zeit werden wir ernten, wenn wir nicht ermatten. 
[6:10] Laßt uns denn, solange wir dazu Gelegenheit haben, Gutes tun an allen Menschen, ganz besonders aber an den Glaubensgenossen! 
[6:11] Seht, mit was für großen Buchstaben ich euch eigenhändig schreibe! 
[6:12] Alle, die nach äußerem Ansehen trachten, suchen euch die Beschneidung aufzudrängen, doch nur deshalb, um nicht wegen des Kreuzes Christi Verfolgung zu erleiden. 
[6:13] Denn trotz ihrer Beschneidung beobachten sie selbst das Gesetz nicht; sondern sie wünschen eure Beschneidung nur, um sich eures Fleisches rühmen zu können. 
[6:14] Mir aber soll es fernliegen, in etwas anderem meinen Ruhm zu suchen, als in dem Kreuz unseres Herrn Jesus Christus, durch das mir die Welt gekreuzigt ist und ich der Welt. 
[6:15] Denn weder Beschneidung noch Vorhaut hat Bedeutung; Wert hat nur eine neue Schöpfung. 
[6:16] Über alle, die nach dieser Richtschnur wandeln wollen, komme Friede, und auch dem Israel Gottes werde Erbarmen zuteil! 
[6:17] Künftig soll mir niemand weiter Mühe machen, denn ich trage die Malzeichen des Herrn Jesus an meinem Leibe. 
[6:18] 

### Ephesians

[1:1] Paulus, durch Gottes Willen ein Apostel Christ Jesu, begrüßt die Heiligen (in Asien?), die auch an Christus Jesus gläubig sind. 
[1:2] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:3] Gepriesen sei der Gott und Vater unseres Herrn Jesus Christus! Er hat vom Himmel aus in Christus uns gesegnet mit einer Gnadenfülle durch den Geist. 
[1:4] Bereits vor Grundlegung der Welt hat er uns auserwählt in Christus, damit wir vor ihm wären heilig und unsträflich. 
[1:5] In seiner Liebe hat er uns vorausbestimmt zu seinen Kindern durch Jesus Christus, nach dem Wohlgefallen seines Willens. 
[1:6] So wird verherrlicht seine wunderbare Gnade, die er uns hat geschenkt in dem Geliebten. 
[1:7] Weil wir mit ihm vereint sind, haben wir Befreiung aus der Schuldhaft durch sein Blut: Vergebung unserer Sünden. So reich ist seine Gnade! 
[1:8] Die hat er uns in Fülle mitgeteilt, indem er uns geziert mit mannigfacher Weisheit und Erkenntnis. 
[1:9] Denn das Geheimnis seines Willens ist uns kundgeworden. 
[1:10] Das ist geschehen nach jenem Rat, den er gefaßt und in der Zeiten Fülle nach bestimmter Ordnung ausgeführt. Und wohin zielte dieser Ratschluß? Es sollte alles, was im Himmel und auf Erden ist, in Christus unter einem Haupt vereinigt werden. 
[1:11] In ihm sind wir auch Erben. Dazu sind wir vorherbestimmt nach einem Vorsatz dessen, der alles nach dem Rat seines Willens wirkt: 
[1:12] Wir Juden, die schon lang zuvor gehofft auf den Messias, wir sollten Gottes Herrlichkeit zum Ruhm gereichen. 
[1:13] Doch auch ihr Heiden habt gehört das Wort der Wahrheit, die Frohe Botschaft, die euch Rettung bringt, und ihr habt sie im Glauben aufgenommen. So steht ihr nun mit Christus in Gemeinschaft und seid mit dem verheißenen Heiligen Geist versiegelt worden. 
[1:14] Der ist das Angeld unseres Erbes, und er verbürgt uns die Befreiung, die Gottes Volk erlangen soll, damit man rühme Gottes Herrlichkeit. 
[1:15] Nachdem ich nun gehört von euerm Glauben an den Herrn Jesus und von der Liebe, die ihr habt zu allen Heiligen 
[1:16] so werde ich nicht müde, Gott für euch zu danken und euer zu gedenken, wenn ich bete. 
[1:17] Ich flehe zu dem Gott unseres Herrn Jesus Christus, dem Vater, der die Herrlichkeit verleiht, er möge euch den Geist der Weisheit schenken und der Offenbarung, damit ihr ihn erkennt. 
[1:18] Denn sind die Augen euers Herzens recht erleuchtet, dann könnt ihr auch verstehen, zu welcher Hoffnung ihr berufen seid, wie groß der Reichtum jenes herrlichen Erbes ist, das er den Heiligen verheißen hat, 
[1:19] und wie gewaltig seine Macht sich zeigt an uns, den Gläubigen. Hier wirkt dieselbe starke Kraft 
[1:20] die er bewiesen hat an Christus, als er ihn auferweckte von den Toten und ihn zu seiner Rechten setzte in der Himmelswelt. 
[1:21] Dort thront er nun, erhaben über alle Mächte und Gewalten, er haben über jede Kraft und Herrschaft, ja über alles, was es Hohes gibt in der Weltzeit und in der zukünftigen. 
[1:22] Alles hat Gott ihm unterworfen. Ihn aber, aller Dinge Haupt, hat er gesetzt zum Haupt der Kirche: 
[1:23] Sie ist sein Leib, und sie ergänzt ihn, der fort und fort in allen wird ergänzt. 
[2:1] Auch euch (hat Gott mit Christus lebendig gemacht). Ihr wart tot durch eure Übertretungen und Sünden. 
[2:2] Darin lebtet ihr einst nach der Weise dieser Welt, beeinflußt von dem Herrscher über die Macht der Finsternis: über jenen Geist, der jetzt wirksam ist in allen, die Gott nicht gehorchen. 
[2:3] Auch wir alle haben einst wie jene dahingelebt in den Begierden unseres Fleisches. Wir taten, was unser Fleisch und unsere (bösen) Gedanken lüstete, und obwohl durch unsere Geburt Kinder, waren wir doch ebenso wie alle anderen Menschen Gottes Zorngericht verfallen. 
[2:4] Gott aber, an Erbarmen reich, hat in seiner großen Liebe, womit er uns geliebt, 
[2:5] auch uns, die wir tot waren durch unsere Übertretungen, zugleich mit Christus lebendig gemacht — durch Gnade seid ihr gerettet! —, 
[2:6] und mit Christus Jesus hat er uns auferweckt und in die Himmelswelt versetzt. 
[2:7] So will er in den kommenden Zeiten den überschwenglichen Reichtum seiner Gnade kundmachen durch die Güte, die er uns in Christus Jesus erwiesen hat. 
[2:8] Denn aus Gnade habt ihr durch Glauben das Heil empfangen. Das ist nicht euer Verdienst, es ist Gottes Gabe. 
[2:9] Werke haben nichts damit zu tun, auf daß sich niemand rühme. 
[2:10] Denn sein Gebilde sind wir. In Christi Jesu Gemeinschaft sind wir dazu geschaffen worden, gute Werke zu vollbringen. Darin zu wandeln, hat uns Gott vorherbestimmt 
[2:11] Denkt nun daran: Ihr wart einst, äußerlich betrachtet, Heiden und wurdet von den sogenannten Beschnittenen, deren Beschneidung am Fleisch mit der Hand vollzogen wird, (verächtlich) mit dem Namen "Unbeschnittene" bezeichnet. 
[2:12] Damals hattet ihr keinen Christus, ihr wart ausgeschlossen von dem Bürgerrecht in Israel und dem Verheißungsbund fremd; daher hattet ihr auch keine Hoffnung und lebtet ohne Gott in dieser Welt dahin. 
[2:13] Jetzt aber, in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus, seid ihr, die ihr einst fern gestanden, durch Christi Blut nahe gebracht worden. 
[2:14] Er ist unser Friede. Er hat aus beiden (Juden und Heiden) eins gemacht und den sie trennenden Zaun hinweggeräumt. Denn er hat durch sein Fleisch die Feindschaft, 
[2:15] die das Gesetz mit seinen Geboten und Verordnungen zwischen ihnen erregte, für immer abgetan. so wollte er die beiden in sich selbst zu einem neuen Menschen umschaffen. Ja, er hat Frieden gestiftet 
[2:16] und beide, die in einem Leib vereinigt werden sollten, mit Gott versöhnt durch das Kreuz, an dem er ihre Feindschaft ertötet hat. 
[2:17] Dann ist er gekommen und hat euch, die ihr fern wart, und denen, die nahe standen, die Frohe Botschaft des Friedens verkündigt. 
[2:18] Denn durch ihn haben wir beide in einem Geist Zugang zum Vater. 
[2:19] So seid ihr nun nicht mehr Fremdlinge und Beisassen: nein, ihr seid Mitbürger der Heiligen und Gottes Hausgenossen. 
[2:20] Ihr seid auferbaut auf dem Grund der Apostel und Propheten, und Christus Jesus ist der Eckstein dieses Grundes. 
[2:21] In ihm ist der ganze Bau fest zusammengefügt und wächst so hinan zu einem heiligen Tempel in dem Herrn. 
[2:22] Ihn ihm werdet auch ihr (Heiden) miterbaut zu einer Wohnung Gottes im Geist. 
[3:1] Deshalb (beuge) ich Paulus, der Gefangene Christi Jesu für euch Heiden, (meine Knie vor dem Vater). — 
[3:2] Ihr habt gewiß gehört, welchen Auftrag mir Gott in seiner Gnade für euch gegeben hat: 
[3:3] Es ist mir durch besondere Offenbarung das Geheimnis kundgetan worden, wie ich davon schon vorher in Kürze geschrieben habe. 
[3:4] Wenn ihr das lest, so könnt ihr daraus erkennen, daß ich in dem Geheimnis Christi wohlbewandert bin. 
[3:5] Dies Geheimnis ist in früheren Zeiten den Menschenkindern nicht so deutlich kundgetan worden, wie es jetzt seinen heiligen Aposteln und Propheten durch den Geist enthüllt worden ist. 
[3:6] Die Heiden (das ist der Inhalt dieses Geheimnisses) erben mit (uns Juden). Sie gehören mit (uns) zu demselben Leibe (Christi) und haben mit (uns) teil an der Verheißung, die in Christus Jesus durch die Heilsbotschaft geschenkt wird. 
[3:7] Ein Diener dieser Botschaft bin ich geworden durch die unverdiente Gnade Gottes, die ich empfangen habe nach der Wirkung seiner Macht. 
[3:8] Mir, dem allergeringsten unter allen Heiligen, ist diese Gnade zuteil geworden: Ich soll den Heiden die Frohe Botschaft von dem unergründlichen Reichtum Christi verkündigen 
[3:9] und allen Lichten geben über das wahre Wesen jenes Geheimnisses, das von Ewigkeit her in Gott, dem Schöpfer aller Dinge, verborgen gewesen ist. 
[3:10] Denn jetzt soll durch die Kirche den Herrschaften und Gewalten der Himmelswelt die mannigfaltige Weisheit Gottes kundgetan werden. 
[3:11] Dies hat sich Gott schon seit ewigen Zeiten vorgenommen in Christus Jesus, unserem Herrn. 
[3:12] In seiner Gemeinschaft haben wir, erfüllt mit seinem Glauben, freudige Zuversicht und können uns (dem Vater) voll Vertrauen nahen. 
[3:13] So bitte ich euch denn: Werdet nicht mutlos bei den Trübsalen, die ich für euch dulde; sie bringen euch ja Ehre. — 
[3:14] Deshalb also beuge ich meine Knie vor dem Vater, 
[3:15] dem alle Geschöpfe im Himmel und auf Erden ihr Dasein danken. 
[3:16] Ich bitte ihn: er möge euch nach dem Reichtum seiner Herrlichkeit verleihen, durch seinen Geist mit Kraft gestärkt zu werden in dem inneren Menschen, 
[3:17] damit Christus durch den Glauben in euern Herzen Wohnung nehme. Dann werdet ihr auch in der Liebe festgewurzelt und gegründet. 
[3:18] Ja ihr könnt mit allen Heiligen die Liebe Christi in der Breite, Länge, Tiefe und Höhe erfassen, 
[3:19] und ihr vermögt diese Liebe zu erkennen, obwohl sie alle Schranken der Erkenntnis übersteigt. So sollt ihr endlich dahin kommen, erfüllt zu werden mit der ganzen Fülle Gottes. 
[3:20] Ihm aber, der durch seine Kraft, die in uns wirksam ist, unendlich mehr zu tun vermag, als wir bitten und verstehen, ihm sei Ehre in der Kirche und in Christus Jesus bis in alle Geschlechter der endlosen Zeiten der zukünftigen Welt! Amen. 
[3:21] 
[4:1] Ich, um des Herrn willen im Gefängnis, ermahne euch nun: 
[4:2] Wandelt in aller Demut und Sanftmut, so wie es dem an euch ergangenen Ruf entspricht! Vertragt einander in Duldsamkeit 
[4:3] und seid in Liebe bestrebt, die vom Geist gewirkte Einheit durch das Band des Friedens zu bewahren! 
[4:4] Es ist nur ein Leib, und (darin waltet) nur ein Geist, wie es auch nur eine Hoffnung gibt, zu der ihr berufen worden seid. 
[4:5] Es ist nur ein Herr, ein Glaube, eine Taufe. 
[4:6] Es ist nur ein Gott und Vater aller: er herrscht über alle, wirkt durch alle und wohnt in allen. 
[4:7] Jedem einzelnen von uns ist die Gnade in dem Maße zuteil geworden, wie sie Christus ihm geschenkt hat. 
[4:8] Darum heißt es: Er ist aufgefahren in die Höhe, er hat Gefangene weggeführt, er hat den Menschen Gaben gegeben. 
[4:9] - "Er ist aufgefahren": was bedeutet das anderes, als daß er zuerst (vom Himmel aus) herabgefahren ist in diese niedere Erdenwelt? 
[4:10] Der herabgefahren ist, der ist auch aufgefahren über alle Himmel, um (von dort) das ganze Weltall zu erfüllen. — 
[4:11] Er hat nun einige gegeben als Apostel, andere als Propheten, andere als Evangelisten, andere als Hirten und Lehrer, 
[4:12] damit die Heiligen tüchtig werden, den Dienst auszurichten, wodurch Christi Leib erbaut wird. 
[4:13] Das soll geschehen, bis wir alle gelangen zu der Einheit im Glauben und in der Erkenntnis des Sohnes Gottes, zur vollen Mannesreife, zu jener Größe, worin wir Christi Gabenfülle fassen können. 
[4:14] Denn wir sollen nicht länger unmündige Kinder sein, die sich durch das Trugspiel solcher Menschen, die mit List auf Verführung ausgehen, von jedem Wind der Lehre wie Meereswogen schaukeln und umtreiben lassen. 
[4:15] Sondern wir sollen den wahren Glauben bekennen und durch die Liebe völlig hineinwachsen in Christus, der das Haupt ist. 
[4:16] Denn aus ihm zieht der ganze Leib sein Wachstum, indem seine einzelnen Teile sich eng zusammenfügen und fest zusammenhalten mit Hilfe aller Gelenke, die ihren Dienst verrichten nach der besonderen Tätigkeit, die jedem Glied zugewiesen ist. So erbaut sich der ganze Leib im Geist der Liebe. 
[4:17] Im Namen des Herrn ermahne ich euch nun mit allem Ernst: Wandelt nicht mehr wie die Heiden, die in der Torheit ihres Sinnes dahingehen! 
[4:18] Ihr Verstand ist verfinstert. Wegen der Unwissenheit, die infolge ihrer Herzensverstockung in ihnen wohnt, sind sie dem Leben Gottes entfremdet. 
[4:19] Aller sittlichen Empfindung bar, haben sie sich der Ausschweifung in die Arme geworfen, und in unersättlicher Gier frönen sie jeder Art von Unsittlichkeit. 
[4:20] Ihr habt in Christi Schule solche Dinge nicht gelernt. 
[4:21] Wenn ihr seine Stimme gehört und seinen Unterricht empfangen habt — und in Jesus ist die Wahrheit —, dann wißt ihr auch: 
[4:22] Ihr habt — was euer früherer Wandel nötig machte — den alten Menschen abgelegt, der an den trügerischen Lüsten zugrunde geht. 
[4:23] Ihr werdet aber jetzt erneuert im Geist eurer Denkungsart 
[4:24] und habt den neuen Menschen angezogen, der nach Gottes Bild geschaffen ist, und zwar in der Gerechtigkeit und Heiligkeit, die aus der Wahrheit stammt. 
[4:25] Darum legt die Lüge ab, und jeder rede die Wahrheit mit seinem Nächsten! Wir sind ja untereinander Glieder. 
[4:26] Wenn ihr zürnt, so sündigt nicht! Die Sonne soll nicht über eurer Zornesstimmung untergehen. 
[4:27] Gebt dem Teufel keinen Raum! 
[4:28] Der Dieb stehle nicht mehr, sondern er sei fleißig und erwerbe sich mit seiner Hände Arbeit redlichen Gewinn, damit er den Notleidenden unterstützen könne! 
[4:29] Es soll kein übles Wort aus euerm Munde gehen! Sprecht vielmehr im rechten Augenblick nur das, was anderen dienlich ist, damit die Hörer Segen davon haben! 
[4:30] Betrübt nicht den Heiligen Geist Gottes, mit dem ihr für den Tag der Befreiung versiegelt worden seid! 
[4:31] Alle Bitterkeit und Heftigkeit, alles Zürnen, Zanken und Lästern, ja alles böse Wesen sei fern von euch! 
[4:32] Zeigt euch vielmehr gegeneinander gütig und barmherzig! Vergebt einander, wie Gott in Christus euch vergeben hat! 
[5:1] So folgt denn Gottes Vorbild als geliebte Kinder 
[5:2] und wandelt in der Liebe, so wie Christus euch geliebt und sich für uns als wohlgefällige Opfergabe Gott dargebracht hat! 
[5:3] Unzucht und alle Art Unreinigkeit oder Habsucht soll nicht einmal in euern Gesprächen berührt werden — denn so ziemt sich's für Heilige —. 
[5:4] Ebensowenig sollen sich unanständiges Wesen, albernes Geschwätz oder leichtfertige Scherze bei euch finden! Das alles schickt sich nicht. Statt dessen übt Danksagung! 
[5:5] Denn das merkt euch wohl: Kein Unzüchtiger, kein Unreiner, kein Habsüchtiger — das ist ein Götzendiener! — hat ein Erbteil in dem Königreich Christi und Gottes. 
[5:6] Keiner täusche euch mit Lügenreden! Um dieser Sünden willen — das steht fest — kommt Gottes Zorngericht über alle Ungehorsamen. 
[5:7] Habt darum mit ihnen nichts zu schaffen! 
[5:8] Es hat ja eine Zeit gegeben, da wart ihr Finsternis. Jetzt aber seid ihr ein Licht in des Herrn Gemeinschaft. 
[5:9] Wandelt denn als Lichteskinder! Die Furcht, die das Licht zur Reife bringt, zeigt sich in alledem, was gut, gerecht und wahr ist. 
[5:10] Prüft auch dabei, was dem Herrn wohlgefällt, 
[5:11] und habt keine Gemeinschaft mit den unfruchtbaren Werken der Finsternis! Deckt sie vielmehr auf! 
[5:12] Denn was im Verborgenen von ihnen getrieben wird, das ist so schändlich, daß man nicht einmal davon reden kann. 
[5:13] Deckt man aber dies alles auf, so wird es von dem Licht offenbar gemacht. 
[5:14] Denn alles, was offenbar ist, das ist Licht. Darum heißt es: Auf, du Schläfer! Steh von den Toten auf! Dann wird dir Christi Licht entgegenleuchten. 
[5:15] So achtet denn genau auf euern Wandel! Handelt nicht unweise, sondern weise! 
[5:16] Benutzt stets den rechten Augenblick, denn es sind böse Tage! 
[5:17] Zeit euch deshalb nicht unverständig, sondern lernt des Herrn Willen kennen! 
[5:18] Berauscht euch nicht im Wein; das führt zur Ausschweifung! Trinkt vielmehr in vollen Zügen aus des Geistes Becher! 
[5:19] Dann erbaut ihr einander mit Psalmen, Lobgesängen und geistlichen Liedern. Dann preist ihr den Herrn von Herzensgrund mit Gesang und Spiel. 
[5:20] Dann dankt ihr Gott dem Vater allezeit für alles in dem Namen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus. 
[5:21] Dann seid ihr auch in Ehrfurcht vor Christus einander untertan. 
[5:22] Ihr Frauen, seid euern Männern untertan wie dem Herrn! 
[5:23] Denn der Mann ist des Weibes Haupt, ebenso wie Christus das Haupt der Kirche ist: er, der Retter seines Leibes. 
[5:24] Doch wie die Kirche Christus untertan ist, so sollen auch die Frauen ihren Männern in jeder Hinsicht untertan sein. 
[5:25] Ihr Männer, liebt eure Frauen, ebenso wie Christus die Kirche geliebt und sich für sie dahingegeben hat, 
[5:26] um sie zu heiligen! Er hat die Kirche nach seiner Verheißung gereinigt durch das Wasserbad, 
[5:27] um sie in herrlicher Schönheit, ohne Flecken, Runzeln oder andere Fehler, vielmehr heilig und unsträflich vor seinem Angesicht darzustellen. 
[5:28] Ebenso ist es die Pflicht der Männer, ihre Frauen liebzuhaben wie ihre eigenen Leiber. Wer seine Frau liebhat, der liebt sich selbst. 
[5:29] Denn kein Mensch hat je seinen eigenen Leib gehaßt, sondern er hegt und pflegt ihn, wie es Christus tut mit der Kirche. 
[5:30] Wir sind ja Glieder seines Leibes. 
[5:31] Deshalb wird ein Mann Vater und Mutter verlassen und sich aufs engste mit seinem Weib verbinden, und beide werden eins sein. 
[5:32] In diesen Worten liegt ein tiefes Geheimnis. Ich deute es auf Christus und die Kirche. 
[5:33] Doch auch ein jeder von euch soll seine Frau so lieben wie sich selbst, und die Frau habe Ehrfurcht vor ihrem Mann! 
[6:1] Ihr Kinder, gehorcht euern Eltern, denn ihr steht in des Herrn Gemeinschaft! Ein solcher Gehorsam ist recht und billig. Es heißt ja: 
[6:2] Ehre Vater und Mutter! Das ist ein wichtiges Gebot wegen der Verheißung: 
[6:3] Damit dir's wohl gehe und du lange lebst auf Erden. 
[6:4] Ihr Väter, reizt eure Kinder nicht zum Zorn, sondern erzieht sie so, wie der Herr erzieht und zurechtweist! 
[6:5] Ihr Sklaven, gehorcht euern irdischen Herren in Ehrfurcht und ängstlicher Sorgfalt mit aufrichtigem Herzen, als hättet ihr's mit Christus zu tun! 
[6:6] Seid keine Augendiener, als wolltet ihr Menschen gefallen; sondern als Sklaven Christi tut Gottes Willen von ganzem Herzen! 
[6:7] Verrichtet euern Sklavendienst mit Neigung, als dientet ihr dem Herrn und nicht Menschen! 
[6:8] Bedenkt auch, daß jeder, er sei Sklave oder freier Mann, für seine guten Taten von dem Herrn Lohn empfängt. 
[6:9] Ihr Herren, behandelt eure Sklaven milde und laßt das Drohen! Ihr wißt ja, ihr habt ebenso wie sie im Himmel einen Herrn, und bei dem gilt kein Unterschied. 
[6:10] Im übrigen: erstarkt im Herrn und in der Kraft seiner Macht! 
[6:11] Zieht an die volle Waffenrüstung, die Gott euch reicht, damit ihr gegen des Teufels Schliche gewappnet seid! 
[6:12] Denn wir haben nicht mit schwachen, sterblichen Menschen zu streiten, sondern mit den Mächten, Gewalten und Herrschern, die hier in der Finsternis ihr Wesen treiben: mit dem bösen Geisterheer haben wir zu kämpfen um die Himmelsgüter. 
[6:13] Darum legt die volle Waffenrüstung Gottes an, damit ihr am Kampfestag widerstehen und nach Besiegung aller Feinde das Feld behaupten könnt. 
[6:14] So steht denn da zum Kampf fertig! Die Wahrheit sei euer Lendengurt! Die Gerechtigkeit decke eure Brust als Panzer! 
[6:15] Der freudige Mut, wie ihn die Heilsbotschaft des Friedens schenkt, bekleide eure Füße gleichwie Schuhe! 
[6:16] Ergreift dazu den Glauben als den Schild, womit ihr alle feurigen Pfeile des Bösen auslöschen könnt! 
[6:17] Nehmt auch das Heil als euern Helm und den Geist — Gottes Wort als euer Schwert! 
[6:18] Erfüllt vom Geist, betet und fleht in allen Lagen unverdrossen! Seid dabei auch wachsam und betet beharrlich für alle Heiligen! 
[6:19] Betet namentlich für mich, daß mir Gelegenheit geboten werde, meinen Mund zu öffnen und das Geheimnis der Frohen Botschaft, 
[6:20] für die ich ja in Ketten werbe, mit Freimut kundzumachen, damit ich's ohne Furcht verkündige, wie sich's gebührt! 
[6:21] Damit auch ihr von meiner Lage und meinem Ergehen Bescheid wißt, wird euch Tychikus, der geliebte Bruder und treue Diener des Herrn, genau Bericht geben. 
[6:22] Ich sende ihn deshalb zu euch, damit ihr erfahrt, wie es bei uns geht, und er euch Mut zuspreche. 
[6:23] Friede sei mit den Brüdern und Liebe im Bund mit Glauben von Gott dem Vater und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[6:24] Die Gnade sei mit allen, die unsern Herrn Jesus Christus liebhaben in unvergänglicher Treue! 

### Philippians

[1:1] Paulus und Timotheus, Knechte Christi Jesu, entbieten ihren Gruß allen Heiligen in Philippi, die mit Christus Jesus in Gemeinschaft stehen, sowie auch den Bischöfen und Diakonen. 
[1:2] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:3] Ich danke meinem Gott, sooft ich euer gedenke. 
[1:4] Und immer, wenn ich für euch alle bete, bin ich mit Freudigkeit erfüllt. 
[1:5] Denn von dem Tage an, da ich zu euch gekommen bin, bis heute habt ihr mitgewirkt für die Ausbreitung der Frohen Botschaft. 
[1:6] Deshalb bin ich auch der festen Zuversicht, daß er, der ein so gutes Werk in euch begonnen hat, es auch vollenden wird bis zu dem Tag Jesu Christi. 
[1:7] Daß ich diese gute Meinung von euch allen habe, ist auch nicht mehr als recht und billig. Denn bin ich gefesselt (in meiner Zelle), oder muß ich (im Gerichtssaal) die Heilsbotschaft verteidigen und ihre Wahrheit kundtun, stets trage ich euch in meinem Herzen — euch alle, die ihr meine Mitgenossen an der Gnade seid. 
[1:8] Gott ist mein Zeuge, daß ich nach euch allen solche Sehnsucht habe, als schlüge Christi Jesu Herz in mir. 
[1:9] Darum bete ich auch, daß eure Liebe noch immer mehr zunehme und begleitet sei von klarer Einsicht und dem rechten Feingefühl, 
[1:10] damit ihr unterscheiden könnt, was in jedem Fall das Rechte ist. Dann kommt ihr lauter, wie vom Sonnenlicht geprüft, und ohne Fehltritt bis zum Tage Christi, 
[1:11] reich an jenen Früchten der Gerechtigkeit, die Jesus Christus wirkt, zur Ehre und zum Preis Gottes. 
[1:12] Ich möchte euch nun mitteilen, liebe Brüder, daß alles, was ich hier durchmachen mußte, erst recht zur Förderung der Heilsbotschaft gedient hat. 
[1:13] Bei den Soldaten der kaiserlichen Leibwache und auch sonst ist es bekannt geworden, daß ich nur der Sache Christi wegen in Fesseln liege. 
[1:14] Die meisten unserer Brüder erwarten jetzt im Vertrauen auf den Herrn einen günstigen Ausgang meiner Gefangenschaft und wagen deshalb auch, Gottes Wort mit größerem Freimut zu verkündigen als bisher. 
[1:15] Manche freilich predigen Christus auch aus Neid und Mißgunst gegen mich, andere aber auch aus guter Absicht. 
[1:16] Diese haben Liebe zu mir, denn sie wissen, daß ich dazu berufen bin, die Heilsbotschaft zu verteidigen. 
[1:17] Jene sind voll Selbstsucht: sie verkünden Christus nicht in lauterer Gesinnung, sondern denken mir in meiner Haft noch Kummer zu bereiten. 
[1:18] Doch was tut's? So oder so, ob mit oder ohne Hintergedanken — Christus wird verkündigt, und darüber freue ich mich. Ja ich werde mich auch ferner freuen. 
[1:19] Denn ich weiß: meine Lage wird sich so gestalten, daß ich freigesprochen werde. Das wird geschehen durch eure Fürbitte und durch die Stärkung, die mir von Jesu Christi Geist zuteil wird. 
[1:20] So kann ich denn das Haupt erheben in der Hoffnung, daß ich nicht zuschanden werde, sondern daß, wie früher so auch jetzt, Christus vor aller Augen an meinem Leib wird verherrlicht werden, mag ich nun weiterleben oder den Tod erleiden. 
[1:21] Denn meines Lebens Ziel und Inhalt ist nur Christus, darum ist mir Sterben auch Gewinn. 
[1:22] Bringt mir aber dieses Leben hier auf Erden noch weiterhin Erfolg in meiner Arbeit, so weiß ich wahrlich nicht, was ich mir wählen soll. 
[1:23] Zwei Wünsche halten mich gefangen: Ich habe Sehnsucht, abzuscheiden und vereint zu sein mit Christus; dies wäre mir am allerliebsten. 
[1:24] Um euretwillen aber ist es nötiger, daß ich noch weiter hier auf Erden lebe. 
[1:25] Und ich weiß zuversichtlich: ich werde am Leben bleiben und werde euch allen zur Seite stehen, damit ihr vorwärtskommt in Glaubenskraft und Glaubensfreudigkeit. 
[1:26] So könnt ihr dann für meine Lebensrettung Christus Jesus dankbar preisen, wenn ich noch einmal wieder zu euch komme. 
[1:27] Vor allem seht darauf, daß euer Gemeindeleben im Einklang sei mit Christi Froher Botschaft! Denn wenn ich komme, möchte ich an euch sehen, und wenn ich fern bin, möchte ich von euch hören, daß ihr in einem Geist fest zusammensteht, einmütig kämpfend für den Glauben, den die Frohe Botschaft wirkt. 
[1:28] Dabei laßt euch in keiner Weise von den Widersachern schrecken! Ihr Widerstand beweist, daß sie selbst dem Verderben entgegeneilen. Euer unerschrockener Mut dagegen zeigt, daß euch das Heil bestimmt ist. Und solchen Mut will Gott in euch erwecken. 
[1:29] Denn euch ist im Dienst Christi die Gnade zuteil geworden, nicht nur an ihn zu glauben, sondern auch für ihn zu leiden. 
[1:30] Ihr habt denselben Leidenskampf wie ich. Einst habt ihr mit eigenen Augen gesehen, wie ich zu dulden hatte, und jetzt hört ihr von der Trübsal, die ich durchzumachen habe. 
[2:1] Wenn nun Ermahnung im Sinne Christ, wenn liebevoller Zuspruch, wenn Geistesgemeinschaft, wenn herzliches Mitgefühl noch etwas bei euch gilt, 
[2:2] so macht das Maß meiner Freude voll und seid eines Sinnes, beweist einander die gleiche Liebe, und, zu einer Seele verschmolzen, habt nur einen Gedanken! 
[2:3] Tut nichts aus Selbstsucht und Eitelkeit, sondern in Demut schätze einer den anderen höher als sich selbst! 
[2:4] Jeder habe nicht nur sein eigenes Wohl im Auge, sondern auch das Wohl der anderen! 
[2:5] Seid so gesinnt, wie es Christus Jesus war! 
[2:6] Er hatte sein Dasein in Gottes Art. Aber er sah die Gottgleichheit nicht als Mittel an, sich Beute zu gewinnen. 
[2:7] Nein, er entkleidete sich (seiner göttlichen Herrlichkeit) und nahm Sklavenart an. Er kam in menschlicher Gestalt und trat in seinem Äußeren auf wie jeder andere Mensch. 
[2:8] Dann erniedrigte er sich so tief, daß er gehorsam wurde bis zum Tod, ja bis zum Kreuzestod. 
[2:9] Darum hat ihn Gott auch so wunderbar erhöht und ihm den Namen geschenkt, der höher ist als alle Namen. 
[2:10] In diesem Namen, den Jesus trägt, sollen sich alle Knie beugen — die Knie derer, die im Himmel, auf Erden und unter der Erde sind —, 
[2:11] und zur Ehre Gottes des Vaters sollen alle Zungen bekennen: "Jesus Christus ist der Herr!" 
[2:12] Nun, meine Lieben, ihr seid ja stets gehorsam gewesen. So sucht euch denn nicht etwa nur, wenn ich bei euch bin, sondern erst recht jetzt, wo ich fern bin, mit Furcht und Zittern das Heil zu erringen! 
[2:13] Gott ist's ja, der nach seinem freien Wohlgefallen beides in euch wirkt, das Wollen und das Vollbringen. 
[2:14] Tut alles ohne Murren und zweifelnde Gedanken, 
[2:15] damit ihr tadelfrei und lauter werdet: Kinder Gottes ohne Fehl inmitten eines verkehrten und entarteten Geschlechtes! In dieser Umgebung leuchtet als Sterne — 
[2:16] indem ihr in einer (verderbten) Welt das Wort des Lebens darreicht — mir zum Ruhm für Christi Tag! Dann bin ich nicht vergeblich gelaufen und habe mich auch nicht vergeblich abgemüht. 
[2:17] Ja sollte auch mein Blut vergossen werden, so kann ich mich doch freuen über den priesterlichen Opferdienst, den euer Glaube leistet, und dazu wünsche ich euch allen Glück. 
[2:18] Freut ihr euch ebenso und wünscht mir Glück! 
[2:19] Im Vertrauen auf den Herrn Jesus hoffe ich, daß ich Timotheus bald zu euch senden kann, damit auch ich durch Nachrichten über euer Ergehen frohes Mutes werde. 
[2:20] Ich habe hier sonst keinen, der so denkt wie er und der so selbstlos für euch sorgen wird. 
[2:21] Denn die anderen denken alle miteinander an sich, nicht an die Sache Jesu Christi. 
[2:22] Wie zuverlässig er dagegen ist, das wißt ihr. Denn wie ein Kind dem Vater hilft, so hat er mir geholfen bei dem Dienst für die Heilsbotschaft. 
[2:23] Ihn also hoffe ich sofort zu senden, sobald ich übersehen kann, wie sich meine Lage hier gestaltet. 
[2:24] Doch habe ich im Vertrauen auf den Herrn die Zuversicht, daß ich auch selbst bald zu euch kommen werde. 
[2:25] Ich halte es für dringend nötig, Epaphroditus, meinen Bruder, Mitarbeiter und Mitstreiter, der mir als euer Bote eure Liebesgabe überbracht hat, jetzt wieder zu euch zurückzusenden. 
[2:26] Denn er hatte Heimweh nach euch allen und war voll Unruhe, weil ihr von seiner Krankheit gehört hattet. 
[2:27] Und in der Tat, er ist todkrank gewesen. Gott aber hat Erbarmen gehabt mit ihm, und nicht mit ihm allein, sondern auch mit mir, damit ich nicht Trauer über Trauer hätte. 
[2:28] Darum beeile ich mich jetzt doppelt, ihn heimzusenden, damit ihr euch des Wiedersehens mit ihm freut und ich eine Sorge weniger habe. 
[2:29] Nehmt ihn nun auf im Sinn des Herrn mit ungeteilter Freude und haltet solche Männer wie ihn in Ehren! 
[2:30] Denn um des Werkes Christi willen ist er dem Tod nahe gekommen: er hat sein Leben aufs Spiel gesetzt, um mir an eurer Statt zu dienen. 
[3:1] Nun, meine Brüder, freut euch in dem Herrn! Frühere Warnungen zu wiederholen, ist mir keine Last, euch aber eine Stärkung: 
[3:2] Hütet euch vor den Hunden, hütet euch vor den verderblichen Arbeitern, hütet euch vor den Zerschnittenen! 
[3:3] Wir sind die wahrhaft Beschnittenen: wir dienen Gott im Geist, wir suchen unseren Ruhm in Christus Jesus und bauen nicht auf äußere Vorzüge. 
[3:4] Und doch hätte ich allen Grund dazu. Denkt ein anderer, er könne auf äußere Vorzüge bauen, dann ich erst recht! 
[3:5] Ich bin am achten Tag beschnitten worden, ich gehöre zu dem Volk Israel, zu dem Stamm Benjamin, ich bin ein Hebräer von rein hebräischer Herkunft. Dazu war ich ein gesetzesstrenger Pharisäer, 
[3:6] ein eifriger Verfolger der Kirche und ohne Tadel in der Gerechtigkeit, die im Gesetz gefordert wird. 
[3:7] Doch alles, was mir Vorteil brachte, habe ich um Christi willen als Nachteil angesehen. 
[3:8] Wahrlich, auch jetzt noch sehe ich alles andere als Nachteil an im Vergleich mit dem alles überragenden Wert der Erkenntnis Christi Jesu, meines Herrn, um dessentwillen ich alles aufgegeben habe. Ja ich sehe alles andere als Abschaum an, wenn ich nur Christus gewinne 
[3:9] und in ihm erfunden werde. Denn ich will nicht selbsterworbene Gerechtigkeit besitzen, die aus Gesetzeswerken kommt, sondern die Gerechtigkeit durch Christi Glauben, die Gerechtigkeit, die Gott auf Grund des Glaubens schenkt. 
[3:10] Dann kann ich ihn recht kennenlernen, indem ich erfahre, welche Kraft von seiner Auferstehung ausgeht. Dadurch werde ich auch fähig, an seinen Leiden teilzunehmen und ihm im Tod ähnlich zu werden. 
[3:11] So darf ich dann auch hoffen, jene Auferstehung zu erreichen, zu der nur eine Auswahl aus den Toten gelangen soll. 
[3:12] Ich bilde mir nicht ein, ich hätte (den Siegespreis) erlangt, oder mit anderen Worten: ich wäre schon am Ziel. Wohl aber laufe ich (nach dem Preis) und hoffe auch, ihn zu ergreifen, weil ich ja von Christus Jesus ergriffen worden bin. 
[3:13] Brüder, ich denke von mir nicht, ich hätte schon (den Preis) ergriffen. Eins aber tue ich: was hinter mir liegt, das vergesse ich; und was vor mir liegt, dem eile ich wie ein Wettläufer mit vorgebeugtem Haupt zu. 
[3:14] So jage ich dem Ziel entgegen, um jenen Kampfpreis zu erlangen, den Gott mir in der Gemeinschaft Christi Jesu droben in Aussicht stellt. 
[3:15] Wir alle nun, die geistlich reif sind, wollen hierauf bedacht sein. Dann wird euch Gott auch, wenn ihr in einem Punkt irrig denkt, darin die volle Wahrheit offenbaren. 
[3:16] Nur laßt uns auf der Bahn, zu der wir alle gleichmäßig gelangt sind, in fester Ordnung vorwärtsschreiten! 
[3:17] Ja, folgt meinem Beispiel, Brüder, und seht auf alle, die so wandeln, wie ihr uns zum Vorbild habt! 
[3:18] Denn in großer Anzahl ziehen jene Leute umher, die ich euch schon oft geschildert habe, und von denen ich jetzt sogar mit Tränen rede: ich meine die bekannten Feinde des Kreuzes Christi. 
[3:19] Ihr Engel ist Verderben, ihr Herrgott ist der Bauch, ihre Ehre suchen sie an ihrer Blöße, ihr ganzes Trachten geht aufs Irdische. 
[3:20] Darum warten wir auch sehnsuchtsvoll, daß der Herr Jesus Christus als Erretter komme. 
[3:21] Der wird den Leib, den wir jetzt in unserer Erniedrigung tragen, so umwandeln, daß er gleichgestaltet wird dem Leib seiner Herrlichkeit. Dazu hat er die Macht, denn er kann sich alle Dinge unterwerfen. 
[4:1] Nun denn, meine lieben Brüder, nach denen ich mich herzlich sehne, ihr meine Freude und mein Ehrenkranz: steht in dieser Weise fest in des Herrn Gemeinschaft, Geliebte! 
[4:2] Euodia und Syntyche ermahne ich, in christlicher Eintracht miteinander zu verkehren. 
[4:3] Ja auch dich, du echter Synzygos, bitte ich: nimm dich ihrer an! Sie haben ja mit mir für die Heilsbotschaft gestritten, ebenso wie Klemens und meine anderen Mitarbeiter, deren Namen im Lebensbuch geschrieben stehen. 
[4:4] Freut euch in dem Herrn! Immer wieder will ich's sagen: Freut euch! 
[4:5] Euer bescheidenes, mildes Wesen soll aller Welt kundwerden. Der Herr ist nahe! 
[4:6] Macht euch keine Sorgen! Sondern laßt in allen Fällen eure Anliegen durch Gebet und Flehen vor Gott kundwerden, und zwar verbunden mit Danksagung! 
[4:7] Dann wird der Friede Gottes, der allen Verstand überragt, eure Herzen und Gedanken bewahren in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus. 
[4:8] Nun, Brüder, seid bedacht auf alles, was wahr, was edel, was recht, was rein, was angenehm ist, und was guten Klang hat; bemüht euch um jede Tugend und um alles, was Lob verdient! 
[4:9] Was ihr gelernt und empfangen, was ihr von mir gehört und an mir gesehen habt — das tut! Dann wird der Gott des Friedens mit euch sein. 
[4:10] Mit Dank gegen den Herrn bin ich hocherfreut darüber, daß ihr endlich einmal wieder eure Fürsorge für mich habt betätigen können. Darauf seid ihr zwar immer bedacht gewesen; aber eure Lage erlaubte euch nicht, etwas für mich zu tun. 
[4:11] Das bringe ich nicht zur Sprache, weil ich etwa Mangel litte; denn ich habe gelernt, in jeder Lage zufrieden zu sein. 
[4:12] Ich weiß kärglich zu leben, und ich weiß auch aus dem Vollen zu leben. In alles und jedes bin ich eingeweiht: ich kann satt sein und hungern, ich kann Überfluß haben und Mangel leiden. 
[4:13] Zu allem habe ich die Kraft in der Gemeinschaft dessen, der mich stark macht. 
[4:14] Doch es ist schön von euch, daß ihr mir in meiner Bedrängnis Teilnahme bewiesen habt. 
[4:15] Ihr wißt ja selbst, liebe Philipper: Als ich zuerst die Heilsbotschaft in Mazedonien verkündigte und dann von dort wegzog, ist keine Gemeinde mit mir in einen Verkehr von Geben und Nehmen getreten als ihr allein. 
[4:16] Auch während meines Aufenthaltes in Thessalonich habt ihr mir mehr als einmal Liebesgaben gesandt. 
[4:17] Davon rede ich nicht, weil es mir um das Geschenk zu tun wäre. Nein, es ist mir zu tun um den Gewinn, der daraus für eure Rechnung erwächst. 
[4:18] Ich habe nun alles, was ich verlangen kann, ich habe reichlich. Ja ich habe in Hülle und Fülle, seitdem mir Epaphroditus eure Gabe überbracht hat. Sie ist Gott ein lieblicher Wohlgeruch, ein angenehmes, wohlgefälliges Opfer. 
[4:19] Mein Gott aber wird euch nach seinem Gnadenreichtum alles, was ihr bedürft, in herrlicher Fülle schenken in der Gemeinschaft Christi Jesu. 
[4:20] Unserem Gott und Vater sei Ehre in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[4:21] Grüßt mir im Namen Christi Jesu jeden einzelnen Heiligen! Es grüßen euch die Brüder, die bei mir sind! 
[4:22] Es grüßen euch alle Heiligen, besonders die vom kaiserlichen Hof. 
[4:23] Die Gnade des Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit euerm Geist! Amen. 

### Colossians

[1:1] Paulus, durch Gottes Willen ein Apostel Christi Jesu, und der Bruder Timotheus 
[1:2] entbieten ihren Gruß den heiligen und gläubigen Brüdern in Kolossä, die mit Christus in Gemeinschaft stehen. Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater! 
[1:3] Wir danken dem Gott und Vater unseres Herrn Jesus Christus allezeit, wenn wir für euch beten. 
[1:4] Denn wir haben von euerm Glauben an Christus Jesus gehört und von der Liebe, die ihr zu allen Heiligen habt. 
[1:5] Zu dieser Liebe treibt euch die Hoffnung, deren Kleinod euch im Himmel aufbewahrt wird. Von dieser Hoffnung habt ihr einst gehört, als euch die Wahrheit der Frohen Botschaft verkündigt wurde. 
[1:6] Diese Botschaft ist auch zu euch gekommen. Sie hat sich in der ganzen Welt verbreitet. Überall bringt sie Frucht und gewinnt sie an Boden. So ist es auch bei euch seit jenem Tag, wo ihr zuerst davon gehört und Gottes Gnade wirklich erkannt habt. 
[1:7] Ihr seid von unserem geliebten Mitknecht Epaphras unterwiesen worden. Der ist ein treuer Diener Christi und arbeitet mit Segen an euch. 
[1:8] Er hat uns auch erzählt, welche Liebe der Heilige Geist in euch entzündet hat. 
[1:9] Seit dem Tag, da wir dies vernommen haben, hören wir darum nicht auf, für euch zu beten und (Gott) zu bitten, er möge euch durch die vom Heiligen Geist gewirkte mannigfaltige Weisheit und Einsicht seinen Willen völlig erkennen lassen. 
[1:10] Dann könnt ihr auch so wandeln, daß ihr dem Herrn Ehre macht und ihm in jeder Hinsicht wohlgefallt. Dann tragt ihr Frucht in allen guten Werken und nehmt zu in der Erkenntnis Gottes. 
[1:11] Dann werdet ihr auch reich gestärkt durch die Macht, die seiner Herrlichkeit eigen ist. So könnt ihr auch in jeder Lage Ausdauer und Geduld beweisen. 
[1:12] Ja ihr könnt mit Freudigkeit dem Vater danken, der euch dazu befähigt hat, an dem Erbe der Heiligen im Licht Anteil zu empfangen. 
[1:13] Er hat uns errettet von der Macht der Finsternis und uns versetzt in das Königreich seines Sohnes, den er liebt. 
[1:14] Weil wir mit ihm vereint sind, haben wir Befreiung aus der Schuldhaft: die Vergebung der Sünden. 
[1:15] Er ist das Ebenbild des unsichtbaren Gottes und eher geboren als alle Geschöpfe. 
[1:16] Denn in ihm ist alles geschaffen, was im Himmel und auf Erden ist, das Sichtbare und das Unsichtbare: Trohne, Herrschaften, Fürstentümer und Gewalten; alles ist durch ihn und für ihn geschaffen. 
[1:17] Er ist schon dagewesen vor der Schöpfung aller Dinge, und das ganze Weltall wird durch ihn im Dasein erhalten. 
[1:18] Er ist auch das Haupt der Kirche, die sein Leib ist. Denn er ist der Erstling, ja der Erstgeborene aus den Toten. Überall sollte er den Vorrang haben. 
[1:19] Denn es hat (Gott) gefallen, in ihm die ganze Fülle wohnen zu lassen 
[1:20] und durch ihn alles, was auf Erden und im Himmel ist, für ihn miteinander zu versöhnen, nachdem er durch sein am Kreuz vergossenes Blut Frieden gestiftet hat. 
[1:21] Auch ihr wart einst durch eure bösen Werke (von Gott) entfremdet und sogar ihm feindlich gesinnt. 
[1:22] Nun aber hat er euch in seinem Fleischesleib durch seinen Tod (mit Gott) versöhnt, um euch heilig, fleckenlos und tadelfrei vor seinem Angesicht darzustellen. 
[1:23] Aber ihr müßt auf dem festen Glaubensgrund unerschütterlich beharren und nimmer wanken in der Hoffnung, die die Heilsbotschaft in euch erweckt hat. Diese Botschaft habt ihr gehört: sie ist verkündigt worden in der ganzen Welt, so weit der Himmel reicht, und ich, Paulus, bin ihr Diener geworden. 
[1:24] Jetzt freue ich mich in meinen Leiden, die ich zu euerm Besten dulde. Und was mich von Christi Trübsalen bisher noch nicht getroffen hat, das koste ich nun, indem ich ihm dadurch für seine Liebe danke, in meinem (sterblichen) Fleisch bis zur Neige aus. Das leide ich für seinen Leib, die Kirche. 
[1:25] Ihr Diener bin ich geworden nach dem Auftrag, den mir Gott gegeben hat: ich soll Gottes Wort in vollem Maße unter euch verkünden. 
[1:26] Dies Wort ist ein Geheimnis, das früheren Zeiten und Geschlechtern verborgen war. Jetzt aber ist's für Gottes Heilige ans Licht getreten. 
[1:27] Denn ihnen hat Gott kundtun wollen, wie groß der Reichtum der Herrlichkeit ist, den dies Geheimnis gerade unter den Heiden offenbart: ich rede hier davon, daß Christus in euch wohnt und euch die Hoffnung auf die künftige Herrlichkeit verbürgt. 
[1:28] Ihn verkünden wir, indem wir jeden ohne Unterschied zurechtweisen und jeden ohne Unterschied in aller Weisheit unterrichten, um jeden einzelnen geistlich reif darzustellen in der Lebensgemeinschaft mit Christus. 
[1:29] Das ist meines mühevollen Ringens Ziel. Und dazu stärkt mich seine Kraft, die mächtig in mir wirksam ist. 
[2:1] Ihr sollt nämlich wissen, welch schweren Kampf ich durchzumachen habe für euch, für die Laodizeer und für alle, die mich noch nicht von Angesicht kennen. 
[2:2] Denn meine Sorge ist, daß ihre Herzen gestärkt werden und sie in Liebe sich zusammenschließen, damit sie zu dem ganzen Reichtum der vollen Einsicht kommen: zu der Erkenntnis des Geheimnisses Gottes, des Vaters Christi, 
[2:3] in dem alle Schätze der Weisheit und der Erkenntnis verborgen liegen. 
[2:4] Dies sage ich, damit euch niemand mit Überredungskünsten täusche. 
[2:5] Denn bin ich auch leiblich fern, so bin ich doch im Geist in eurer Mitte und nehme mit Freuden wahr, wie ihr gleich (einem Heer) in fester Ordnung dasteht, und wie euer Glaube an Christus ein starkes Bollwerk ist. 
[2:6] Wie ihr nun den Herrn Christus Jesus habt kennengelernt, so führt auch euern Wandel in seiner Gemeinschaft! 
[2:7] In ihm seid festgewurzelt und in ihm baut euch auf! In dem Glauben, worin ihr unterwiesen worden seid, werdet immer fester und fließt über vor Dank! 
[2:8] Gebt acht, daß euch niemand fange durch eine Weisheitslehre, die nichts ist als leerer Trug! Denn sie schöpft aus menschlicher Überlieferung, sie folgt den Geistesmächten, die in der Welt Einfluß haben, und gründet sich nicht auf Christus. 
[2:9] In ihm wohnt ja die ganze Fülle des göttlichen Wesens leibhaftig. 
[2:10] Und ihr habt die Fülle in der Lebensgemeinschaft mit ihm, der das Haupt jeglicher Herrschaft und Gewalt ist. 
[2:11] Weil ihr mit ihm vereinigt seid, darum habt ihr auch eine Beschneidung empfangen. Das ist aber keine Beschneidung, die mit der Hand vollzogen wird. Sie besteht vielmehr darin, daß man den Fleischesleib auszieht. Es handelt sich hier um die Beschneidung, die Christus dadurch vollzogen hat, 
[2:12] daß ihr in der Taufe mit ihm begraben worden seid. Darin seid ihr mit ihm auferweckt worden durch den Glauben, den Gott in euch wirkt, der ihn von den Toten auferweckt hat. 
[2:13] Auch euch, die ihr durch eure Übertretungen und euern sündigen, verderbten Zustand tot wart, hat Gott in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus lebendig gemacht und euch alle Übertretungen in Gnaden verziehen. 
[2:14] Wir hatten es mit einem Schuldbrief zu tun, der durch seine Forderungen gegen uns zeugte. Den hat Gott ausgelöscht und auch (ein für allemal) aus dem Weg geräumt, indem er ihn ans Kreuz nagelte. 
[2:15] Er hat die Herrschaften und Gewalten wie ein Gewand von sich abgestreift, sie (in ihrer Schwäche) zur Schau gestellt und sie durch Christus vor aller Welt in seinem Siegeszug aufgeführt. 
[2:16] So laßt euch denn von niemand einen Vorwurf machen wegen Speise oder Trank oder in bezug auf Feste, Neumonde oder Sabbate. 
[2:17] Das alles ist ja nur ein Schatten von dem, was kommen sollte. Erst Christus hat die volle Wirklichkeit gebracht. 
[2:18] Laßt euch den Siegespreis nicht rauben von Leuten, die in falscher Demut die Engel verehren und über ihre (angeblichen) Gesichte grübeln. Sie lassen sich ganz ohne Grund von ihren fleischlichen Gedanken aufblähen 
[2:19] und halten nicht an dem Haupt fest. Aus dem zieht der ganze Leib, der durch die verschiedenen Gelenke zusammengehalten wird, sein von Gott gewolltes Wachstum. 
[2:20] Seid ihr nun in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus tot für die Geistermächte, die in der Welt Einfluß haben, warum tut ihr dann so, als lebtet ihr noch in der Welt, und laßt euch befehlen: "Das faß nicht an, das koste nicht, das rühr nicht an! 
[2:21] Dies alles schadet dir, wenn du's gebrauchst"? 
[2:22] Das sind nichts als menschliche Gebote und Lehren. 
[2:23] Solche Vorschriften haben wohl einen Schein von Weisheit, sofern in (falscher) Demut und schonungsloser Kasteiung des Leibes ein selbsterwählter Gottesdienst geübt wird. Im Grunde aber haben sie nicht den geringsten Wert. Denn sie dienen nur dazu, den fleischlichen Hochmut zu nähren. 
[3:1] Seid ihr nun mit Christus auferstanden, so trachtet nach dem, was droben ist, wo Christus zur Rechten Gottes sitzt! 
[3:2] Richtet euern Sinn auf das Himmlische, nicht auf das Irdische! 
[3:3] Denn ihr seid gestorben, und euer Leben ist mit Christus in Gott verborgen. 
[3:4] Wenn Christus, euer Leben, offenbar wird, dann werdet ihr auch zugleich mit ihm offenbar werden in Herrlichkeit. 
[3:5] Tötet darum die Glieder, die auf Erden sind: Unzucht, Unreinigkeit, Leidenschaft, böse Lust und die Habsucht, die nichts als Götzendienst ist! 
[3:6] Wegen dieser Sünden bricht Gottes Zorngericht herein über alle, die ihm ungehorsam sind. 
[3:7] Unter diesen Leuten habt auch ihr euch einst bewegt, als ihr in solchen Lastern lebtet. 
[3:8] Jetzt aber sollt auch ihr dies alles ablegen, auch Zorn, Erbitterung, Bosheit, Lästerung und häßliches Gerede. 
[3:9] Belügt einander nicht! Ihr habt ja den alten Menschen samt seinen Werken ausgezogen 
[3:10] und angezogen den neuen Menschen, der nach dem Bild seines Schöpfers zu der Erkenntnis (Gottes) erneuert wird. 
[3:11] In dieser neuen Schöpfung gibt es keinen Unterschied mehr zwischen Griechen und Juden, Beschnittenen und Unbeschnittenen, Barbaren und Skythen, Sklaven und Freien. Sondern Christus gilt alles, und er wohnt in allen. 
[3:12] Als heilige und geliebte Auserwählte Gottes kleidet euch nun mit herzlichem Erbarmen, mit Güte, Demut, Milde, Langmut! 
[3:13] Habt miteinander Nachsicht und verzeiht, wenn einer dem anderen etwas vorzuwerfen hat! Wie der Herr euch verziehen hat, so tut auch ihr! 
[3:14] Über alle diese Tugenden aber zieht an das Kleid der Liebe: sie ist das Band der Vollkommenheit! 
[3:15] Und Christi Friede walte in euern Herzen! Zu diesem Frieden seid ihr berufen; denn ihr seid ein Leib. Zeigt euch dankbar! 
[3:16] Christi Wort wohne reichlich unter euch! In aller Weisheit belehrt und ermahnt einander! Mit Psalmen, Lobgesängen und geistlichen Liedern singt Gott voll Dankbarkeit in euern Herzen! 
[3:17] Was ihr tut in Wort und Werk, tut es alles in dem Namen des Herrn Jesus und dankt durch ihn Gott dem Vater! 
[3:18] Ihr Frauen, seid euern Männern untertan, wie es sich ziemt im Herrn! 
[3:19] Ihr Männer, liebt eure Frauen und behandelt sie nicht hart! 
[3:20] Ihr Kinder, gehorcht euern Eltern in allen Stücken; denn das gefällt dem Herrn wohl! 
[3:21] Ihr Väter, reizt eure Kinder nicht (durch übertriebene Strenge), damit sie nicht verschüchtert werden! 
[3:22] Ihr Sklaven, gehorcht euern irdischen Herren in allen Stücken: nicht mit Augendienerei, um Menschen zu gefallen, sondern mit aufrichtigem Herzen als solche, die den Herrn fürchten! 
[3:23] Alles, was ihr tut, das tut mit willigem Herzen, als gälte es dem Herrn und nicht Menschen! 
[3:24] Ihr wißt doch, daß ihr zum Lohn dafür das (himmlische) Erbe von dem Herrn empfangen sollt. Ihr seid ja Sklaven des Herrn Christus. 
[3:25] Wer Unrecht tut, den trifft dafür die wohlverdiente Strafe. Da gilt kein Unterschied. 
[4:1] Ihr Herren, gebt euern Sklaven, was recht und billig ist! Bedenkt: auch ihr habt einen Herrn im Himmel! 
[4:2] Beharrt im Gebet! Seid dabei wachsam und seid dankbar! 
[4:3] Betet auch für uns, daß Gott uns für die Predigt seines Wortes eine Tür auftue, damit wir das Geheimnis Christi, um dessentwillen ich auch in Ketten bin, verkündigen können. 
[4:4] Ja betet, daß ich frei und offen davon reden kann, so wie es meine Pflicht ist! 
[4:5] Geht weise um mit denen, die draußen sind, und benutzt dabei den rechten Augenblick! 
[4:6] Eure Rede sei allezeit gewinnend und mit Salz gewürzt, so daß ihr einem jeden die rechte Antwort zu geben wißt! 
[4:7] Über meine Lage wird euch Tychikus, der geliebte Bruder und treue Diener und Mitknecht in dem Herrn, ausführlich berichten. 
[4:8] Ich sende ihn zu euch, damit er sehe, wie es euch geht, und er eure Herzen stärke. 
[4:9] Mit ihm kommt auch Onesimus, der treue und geliebte Bruder, euer Landsmann. Die beiden werden euch genau mitteilen, wie es hier steht. 
[4:10] Es senden euch Grüße mein Mitgefangener Aristarchus und Markus, der Vetter des Barnabas. Über ihn habt ihr besondere Anweisungen empfangen; wenn er zu euch kommt, so nehmt ihn freundlich auf! 
[4:11] Auch Jesus mit dem Beinamen Justus läßt euch grüßen. Nur diese drei sind von den Judenchristen meine Mitarbeiter für Gottes Königreich, und sie sind mir ein rechter Trost. 
[4:12] Es grüßt euch euer Landsmann Epaphras, ein Knecht Christi Jesu. Er ringt unablässig für euch im Gebet, daß ihr in allem, was Gott von euch verlangt, in voller Geistesreife und klarer Überzeugung feststeht. 
[4:13] Ich muß ihm das Zeugnis geben: er ist in großer Sorge um euch und um die Brüder in Laodizea und Hierapolis. 
[4:14] Es grüßen euch Lukas, der Arzt, der teure Mann, und Demas. 
[4:15] Grüßt die Brüder in Laodizea, namentlich Nymphas und seine Hausgemeinde! 
[4:16] Ist dieser Brief bei euch vorgelesen, dann sorgt dafür, daß er auch in der Gemeinde zu Laodizea verlesen werde, und lest ihr den Brief, den man euch aus Laodizea senden wird! 
[4:17] Sagt dem Archippus: "Sieh zu, daß du das Amt, das du als Diener des Herrn empfangen hast, auch treu verwaltest!" 
[4:18] Ich, Paulus, sende euch einen eigenhändigen Gruß. Denkt an meine Ketten! Die Gnade sei mit euch! 

### I Thessalonians

[1:1] Paulus, Silvanus und Timotheus begrüßen die Gemeinde in Thessalonich, die mit Gott dem Vater und dem Herrn Jesus Christus in Gemeinschaft steht. Gnade sei mit euch und Friede! 
[1:2] Wir danken Gott allezeit für euch alle, indem wir euer in unseren Gebeten gedenken. 
[1:3] Denn fort und fort erinnern wir uns vor dem Angesicht unseres Gottes und Vaters an eure Arbeit im Glauben, eure Mühe in der (brüderlichen) Liebe und eure Ausdauer in der Hoffnung (auf das Kommen) unseres Herrn Jesus Christus. 
[1:4] Wir wissen ja, von Gott geliebte Brüder, daß ihr auserwählt seid. 
[1:5] Denn wir haben die Heilsbotschaft nicht nur mit Worten bei euch verkündigt, sondern auch in Kraft und im Heiligen Geist und mit großer Glaubenszuversicht. Es ist euch wohlbekannt, wie wir zu euerm Besten unter euch gewirkt haben. 
[1:6] Und ihr seid uns und dem Herrn nachgefolgt. Denn trotz vieler Trübsal habt ihr mit jener Freude, die der Heilige Geist wirkt, das Wort aufgenommen, 
[1:7] so daß ihr für alle Gläubigen in Mazedonien und Achaja ein Vorbild geworden seid. 
[1:8] Denn von euch ist das Wort des Herrn (wie ein Posaunenhall) ausgegangen, und nicht nur in Mazedonien und Achaja, sondern überall ist euer Glaube an Gott bekannt geworden. Darum brauchen wir auch (zu anderen) nicht weiter darüber zu reden. 
[1:9] Denn alle (die von euch sprechen) erzählen aus freien Stücken, welche (gastliche) Aufnahme wir bei euch gefunden, und wie ihr euch von den Abgöttern zu Gott bekehrt habt, um ihm, dem lebendigen, wahren Gott, zu dienen 
[1:10] und seinen Sohn, den er von den Toten auferweckt hat, vom Himmel zu erwarten — Jesus, der uns vor dem kommenden Zorngericht bewahrt. 
[2:1] Ihr wißt es selbst, Brüder, daß unser Aufenthalt bei euch nicht erfolglos gewesen ist. 
[2:2] Sondern trotz der Leiden und Mißhandlungen, die wir vorher, wie euch bekannt ist, in Philippi erfahren hatten, gewannen wir doch im Vertrauen auf Gott den Mut, bei euch die Frohe Botschaft unter schwerem Kampf zu verkündigen. 
[2:3] Denn unsere Predigt stammt nicht aus Irrwahn oder Unlauterkeit, noch geht sie mit Täuschung um. 
[2:4] Sondern da wir von Gott für würdig geachtet sind, mit der Heilsbotschaft betraut zu werden, so reden wir nun auch, nicht um Menschen zu gefallen, sondern Gott, der unsere Herzen prüft. 
[2:5] Denn wir sind nie mit Schmeichelworten umgegangen — das wißt ihr. Wir haben uns auch nie von Habsucht leiten lassen — des ist Gott Zeuge. 
[2:6] Auch haben wir niemals Ehre von Menschen gesucht, weder von euch noch von anderen. 
[2:7] Aber wir sind mit euch so zart und linde umgegangen wie eine Mutter, die ihre Kinder herzt und hegt. 
[2:8] In solcher inniger Liebe zu euch waren wir bereit, euch nicht nur Gottes Heilsbotschaft, sondern auch unser Leben zu schenken, — so lieb hatten wir euch gewonnen. 
[2:9] Ihr denkt gewiß noch, Brüder, an unsere Mühen und Beschwerden. Tag und Nacht haben wir gearbeitet, um bei der Verkündigung der Frohen Botschaft Gottes keinem von euch zur Last zu fallen. 
[2:10] Ihr seid Zeugen und Gott, wie heilig und gerecht und untadelig wir mit euch Gläubigen umgegangen sind. 
[2:11] Wie ein Vater seine Kinder, so haben auch wir — das wißt ihr — jeden einzelnen von euch ermahnt, ermuntert 
[2:12] und dringend gebeten, so zu wandeln, wie es Gott würdig ist, der euch fort und fort zu seinem Königreich und zu seiner Herrlichkeit beruft. 
[2:13] Deshalb danken wir auch Gott unablässig dafür, daß ihr das von uns verkündigte Wort Gottes nicht als Menschenwort aufgenommen habt, sondern — was es auch in Wahrheit ist — als Gotteswort, das sich auch in euch Gläubigen wirksam zeigt. 
[2:14] Denn in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus seid ihr, liebe Brüder, Nachfolger der Gemeinden Gottes in Judäa geworden, weil ihr von euern Volksgenossen dasselbe erduldet habt, was jenen von den Juden widerfahren ist. 
[2:15] Die haben den Herrn Jesus und die Propheten getötet und uns verfolgt; sie gefallen Gott nicht und sind aller Menschen Widersacher. 
[2:16] Denn sie suchen uns daran zu hindern, den Heiden zu ihrem Heil zu predigen. So sind sie fort und fort dabei, das Maß ihrer Sünden vollzumachen. Der Zorn (Gottes), der sie vernichten soll, ist schon über sie gekommen. 
[2:17] Wenn wir, liebe Brüder, auch für kurze Zeit dem Angesicht, aber nicht dem Herzen nach von euch geschieden sind, so haben wir doch lebhaft und mit großer Sehnsucht nach einem Wiedersehen mit euch getrachtet. 
[2:18] Deshalb wollten wir auch zu euch kommen — ich, Paulus habe diese Absicht wiederholt gehabt —, doch der Satan hat uns daran gehindert. 
[2:19] Denn wer sonst als ihr ist unsere Hoffnung, Freude oder Ruhmeskrone vor dem Angesicht unseres Herrn Jesus Christus, wenn er wiederkommt? 
[2:20] Ja, ihr seid unsere Ehre, unsere Freude! 
[3:1] Wie wir es vor Sehnsucht nach euch nicht mehr aushalten konnten, deshalb entschlossen wir uns, allein in Athen zurückzubleiben, 
[3:2] und schickten Timotheus, unseren Bruder und Gottes Diener an Christi Froher Botschaft, um euch für euern Glauben Stärkung und Trost zu bringen, 
[3:3] damit niemand in den jetzigen Trübsalen wankend würde. Denn ihr wißt ja selbst, daß wir dazu bestimmt sind (Trübsal durchzumachen). 
[3:4] Haben wir es euch doch, als wir bei euch waren, vorhergesagt, daß wir Trübsal leiden müssen. Und das ist nun, wie ihr erfahren habt, auch wirklich eingetroffen. 
[3:5] So schickte ich denn, weil ich es nicht mehr aushielt, zu euch, um zu erfahren, wie es um euern Glauben stehe, ob euch etwa der Versucher verführt habe und unsere Arbeit vergeblich gewesen sei. 
[3:6] Jetzt aber ist Timotheus von euch zu uns zurückgekehrt mit guter Botschaft über euern Glauben und eure Liebe und mit der Nachricht, daß ihr uns allezeit in gutem Andenken habt und voll Sehnsucht seid, uns wiederzusehen, — wie auch uns nach dem Wiedersehen mit euch verlangt. 
[3:7] Nun sind wir, liebe Brüder, bei all unserer Not und Trübsal durch euern Glauben getröstet worden. 
[3:8] Denn jetzt erst haben wir rechten Lebensmut, weil ihr in der Gemeinschaft des Herrn feststeht. 
[3:9] Ja wir können Gott nicht genug danken für all die Freude, die wir euretwegen vor unserem Gott empfinden. 
[3:10] Tag und Nacht flehen wir ihn innig an, er möge uns euch wiedersehen lassen, damit wir alles, was etwa noch in euerm Glaubensleben mangelt, in rechte Ordnung bringen können. 
[3:11] Er, unser Gott und Vater, und unser Herr Jesus bahne uns den Weg zu euch! 
[3:12] Euch aber erfülle der Herr mit reicher Liebe zueinander und zu allen Menschen — wie auch wir von Liebe zu euch überfließen. 
[3:13] Dann werden eure Herzen fest, und ihr seid unsträflich in Heiligkeit vor unserem Gott und Vater, wenn unser Herr Jesus kommt mit allen seinen Heiligen. 
[4:1] Ihr habt schon, liebe Brüder, von uns gehört, wie ihr wandeln müßt, um Gott zu gefallen. Und ihr seid auch auf dem rechten Weg. Doch nun bitten und ermahnen wir euch in dem Namen des Herrn Jesus: Schreitet ihr weiter vorwärts! 
[4:2] Ihr wißt ja, welche Gebote wir euch im Auftrag des Herrn Jesus gegeben haben. 
[4:3] Gott will, ihr sollt ein heiliges Leben führen und mit der Unzucht nichts zu schaffen haben. 
[4:4] Darum sehe jeder von euch zu, ein Eheweib heimzuführen, um mit ihr in Heiligkeit und Ehrbarkeit zusammenzuleben. 
[4:5] Niemand lasse sich nach Art der Heiden, die Gott nicht kennen, durch sinnliche Lust dazu verführen, 
[4:6] in die ehelichen Rechte seines Bruders überzugreifen und ihn durch Ehebruch zu betrügen. Alle solche Sünden straft der Herr, wie wir euch schon früher gesagt und bezeugt haben. 
[4:7] Denn Gott hat uns nicht dazu berufen, ein unreines, sondern ein heiliges Leben zu führen. 
[4:8] Wer also (diese Mahnungen) mißachtet, der mißachtet nicht einen Menschen, sondern Gott, der euch auch seinen Heiligen Geist gegeben hat. 
[4:9] Von der Bruderliebe braucht man euch nicht erst zu schreiben. Denn ihr habt selbst von Gott gelernt, einander zu lieben. 
[4:10] Und ihr beweist das auch an allen Brüdern in ganz Mazedonien. Doch ermahnen wir euch, Brüder: Betätigt diese Liebe immer mehr! 
[4:11] Seht es auch als Ehrensache an, still und friedlich eure Geschäfte zu besorgen und euch mit eurer Hände Arbeit euern Unterhalt zu verdienen. Das haben wir euch schon früher eingeschärft. 
[4:12] Ihr müßt denen, die draußen sind, durch euern Wandel ein gutes Vorbild geben und dürft nicht auf fremde Unterstützung angewiesen sein. 
[4:13] Über die Entschlafenen wollen wir euch, liebe Brüder, nicht im ungewissen lassen, damit ihr nicht trauert wie die anderen, die keine Hoffnung haben. 
[4:14] Glauben wir, daß Jesus gestorben und auferstanden ist, so glauben wir auch, daß Gott durch Jesus die Entschlafenen wiederbringen wird, auf daß sie mit ihm vereinigt werden. 
[4:15] Denn dies tun wir euch kund, gestützt auf ein Wort des Herrn: Wir, die Lebenden, die bis zur Wiederkunft des Herrn übrigbleiben, werden den Entschlafenen nicht zuvorkommen. 
[4:16] Sobald der Befehlsruf ergeht, die Erzengelstimme erschallt und Gottes Posaune ertönt, wird der Herr selbst vom Himmel herabkommen, und dann ist das erste Ereignis, daß die im Glauben an Christus Gestorbenen auferstehen. 
[4:17] Darauf werden wir, die Lebenden, die übrigbleiben, zugleich mit ihnen auf Wolken in die Luft entrückt, um dort dem Herrn zu begegnen, und so werden wir allezeit mit dem Herrn vereinigt sein. 
[4:18] Tröstet einander mit diesen Worten. 
[5:1] Was aber Zeit und Stunde (der Wiederkunft des Herrn) betrifft, liebe Brüder, so habt ihr darüber keine weitere Belehrung nötig. 
[5:2] Denn es ist euch wohlbekannt, daß der Tag des Herrn kommt wie ein Dieb in der Nacht. 
[5:3] Gerade wenn die Leute sagen: "Jetzt ist Friede und Sicherheit!", — dann überfällt sie ganz plötzlich das Verderben, gleichwie der Schmerz ein Weib, wenn ihre Stunde kommt, und es gibt kein Entrinnen für sie. 
[5:4] Ihr aber, Brüder, seid nicht in Finsternis, so daß euch jener Tag nicht wie ein Dieb überraschen kann. 
[5:5] Ihr seid alle Lichteskinder und Tageskinder. Wir haben nichts mit Nacht und Finsternis zu schaffen. 
[5:6] So laßt uns denn nicht schlafen wie die anderen, sondern laßt uns wachen und nüchtern sein! 
[5:7] Denn die da schlafen, die schlafen des Nachts, und die sich berauschen, die berauschen sich des Nachts. 
[5:8] Wir aber, die Kinder des Tages, wollen nüchtern sein; dabei sollen Glaube und Liebe unser Panzer sein und unser Helm die Hoffnung auf Errettung. 
[5:9] Denn Gott hat uns nicht dazu bestimmt, einem Zorngericht anheimzufallen, sondern Errettung zu erlangen durch unseren Herrn Jesus Christus. 
[5:10] Der ist zu unserem Heil gestorben, damit wir, mögen wir wachen oder schlafen, zugleich mit ihm leben. 
[5:11] Deshalb ermahnt einander und fördert einer den anderen, wie ihr es ja schon tut! 
[5:12] Wir bitten euch, Brüder: Schätzt alle hoch, die sich unter euch (im Dienst des Herrn) abmühen und die eure Vorsteher sind in dem Herrn und euch zurechtweisen! 
[5:13] Haltet sie ihrer Arbeit wegen der größten Liebe wert! Lebt unter ihrer Leitung in Frieden und Eintracht! 
[5:14] Wir ermahnen euch auch, Brüder: Weist alle zurecht, die sich der Ordnung nicht fügen wollen, tröstet die Kleinmütigen, steht den Schwachen bei und seid allen gegenüber langmütig und geduldig! 
[5:15] Seht zu, daß niemand Böses mit Bösem vergelte, sondern jagt im Verkehr miteinander und mit allen Menschen stets dem nach, was (dem Nächsten) heilsam ist! 
[5:16] Seid allezeit fröhlich, 
[5:17] betet unablässig, 
[5:18] seid in jeder Lage dankbar! Denn das will Gott in Christus Jesus von euch. 
[5:19] Löscht das Feuer des Geistes nicht aus! 
[5:20] Weissagungen verachtet nicht! 
[5:21] Aber prüft sie alle: das Echte darin haltet fest, 
[5:22] alle falsche Münze meidet! 
[5:23] Er aber, der Gott des Friedens, heilige euch durch und durch, damit euer ganzes Wesen nach Geist, Seele und Leib für die Wiederkunft unseres Herrn Jesus Christus in fleckenloser Reinheit bewahrt werde. 
[5:24] Treu ist er, der euch ruft. Er wird sein Werk auch (in euch) vollenden. 
[5:25] Brüder, betet für uns! 
[5:26] Grüßt alle Brüder mit dem heiligen Kuß! 
[5:27] Ich beschwöre euch bei dem Herrn: Laßt diesen Brief allen Brüdern vorlesen! 
[5:28] Die Gnade unseres Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit euch! 

### II Thessalonians

[1:1] Paulus, Silvanus und Timotheus begrüßen die Gemeinde in Thessalonich, die mit Gott unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus in Gemeinschaft steht. 
[1:2] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott dem Vater und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:3] Wir sind Gott allezeit euretwegen Dank schuldig, liebe Brüder. Das ist recht und billig. Denn euer Glaube wächst außerordentlich, und die brüderliche Liebe mehrt sich bei jedem einzelnen von euch allen. 
[1:4] Darum rühmen wir uns euer auch in den Gemeinden Gottes wegen eurer Standhaftigkeit und Glaubenstreue in allen Verfolgungen und Trübsalen, die ihr auszuhalten habt. 
[1:5] Weil ihr so leiden müßt, läßt sich erwarten, daß Gott einst jenen gerechten Urteilsspruch fällen wird, wodurch euch das Königreich Gottes, für das ihr duldet als Belohnung zuerkannt werden soll. 
[1:6] Denn es entspricht Gottes Gerechtigkeit, daß er denen, die euch Trübsal bereiten, Trübsal vergelte, 
[1:7] euch aber, die ihr Trübsal leidet, zugleich mit uns Erquickung zum Lohn schenke. Das soll geschehen, wenn sich der Herr Jesus mit seinem Engelheer vom Himmel aus 
[1:8] in Feuerflammen offenbart, um die zu strafen, die Gott nicht kennen und der Frohen Botschaft unseres Herrn Jesus keinen Glauben schenken. 
[1:9] Ihr Lohn wird ewiges Verderben sein: sie werden verstoßen von des Herrn Angesicht und von der Herrlichkeit, die er durch seine Macht bereitet hat. 
[1:10] (Dies Urteil wird sie treffen) an jenem Tag, wenn er kommt, um herrlich zu erscheinen in seinen Heiligen und bewundernswert in allen Gläubigen. (Zu diesen zählt auch ihr.) Denn unser Zeugnis, das an euch ergangen ist, habt ihr im Glauben aufgenommen. 
[1:11] Darum beten wir auch allezeit für euch, unser Gott möge euch des Heils, wozu er euch berufen hat, auch wert erachten und durch seine Kraft das Wohlgefallen an allem Guten und jenes Wirken, das aus dem Glauben kommt, zur Vollendung bei euch bringen. 
[1:12] Dann wird der Name unseres Herrn Jesus sich in euch verherrlichen, und ihr sollt in ihm verherrlicht werden: so will es die Gnade unseres Gottes und des Herrn Jesus Christus. 
[2:1] Was nun die Wiederkunft unseres Herrn Jesus Christus und unsere Vereinigung mit ihm betrifft, so bitten wir euch, Brüder: 
[2:2] Laßt euch doch nicht gleich verwirren und erschrecken, wenn ihr nach (mißverstandenen) Worten der Weissagung oder nach fälschlich uns zugeschriebenen mündlichen oder brieflichen Äußerungen behaupten hört, der Tag des Herrn sei schon da. 
[2:3] Keiner soll euch irgendwie verführen. Denn (vor dem Tag des Herrn) muß zuerst der Abfall kommen und offenbar werden der Mensch der Sünde, "der Verlorene", 
[2:4] jener Widersacher, der sich gegen alles erhebt, was Gott oder Gegenstand der Verehrung heißt, und der so weit geht, daß er sich in den Tempel Gottes setzt und sich als Gott erklärt. 
[2:5] Erinnert ihr euch nicht, daß ich euch dies gesagt habe, als ich noch bei euch war? 
[2:6] Und ihr wißt auch, was ihn jetzt noch zurückhält, so daß er sich erst dann offenbaren kann, wenn seine Zeit gekommen ist. 
[2:7] Das Geheimnis der Gesetzlosigkeit ist freilich jetzt schon wirksam. Nur muß er, der es bisher noch zurückhält, beiseite treten. 
[2:8] Dann erst wird der Gesetzlose offenbar werden. Den wird der Herr Jesus mit dem (bloßen) Hauch seines Mundes umbringen und durch die herrliche Erscheinung seiner Gegenwart vernichten. 
[2:9] Das Auftreten des Gesetzlosen ist ein Werk des Satans: es wird begleitet sein von allen möglichen lügenhaften Kräften, Zeichen und Wundern 
[2:10] und von lauter ungerechtem Trug. Das dient zum Schaden derer, die verlorengehen, und es ist die Strafe dafür, daß sie die Wahrheit, durch die sie errettet werden sollten, nicht liebgehabt und in ihr Herz aufgenommen haben. 
[2:11] Gerade darum läßt Gott Verführung über sie kommen, die so gewaltig wirkt, daß sie der Lüge Glauben schenken. 
[2:12] So verfallen dem Gericht alle, die der Wahrheit nicht geglaubt, sondern Lust gehabt haben an der Ungerechtigkeit. 
[2:13] Wir schulden Gott euretwegen allezeit Dank dafür, vom Herrn geliebte Brüder, daß euch Gott als eine Erstlingsschar erwählt hat, damit ihr durch die vom Geist gewirkte Heiligung und durch den Glauben, den die Wahrheit weckt, errettet werdet. 
[2:14] Dazu hat euch Gott durch unsere Botschaft berufen: ihr sollt ja der Herrlichkeit unseres Herrn Jesus Christus teilhaftig werden. 
[2:15] So steht denn fest, Brüder, und haltet an den Überlieferungen, die ihr mündlich und brieflich von uns empfangen habt! 
[2:16] Er aber, unser Herr Jesus Christus, und Gott, unser Vater, der uns geliebt und uns in seiner Gnade ewigen Trost und sichere Hoffnung gegeben hat, 
[2:17] tröste eure Herzen und stärke sie in jedem guten Werk und Wort! 
[3:1] Im übrigen, Brüder, betet für uns, daß sich das Wort des Herrn immer mehr verbreite und (überall), ebenso wie bei euch, seine Kraft entfalte! 
[3:2] Betet auch, daß wir von den ruchlosen und bösen Menschen errettet werden! Denn nicht alle sind empfänglich für den Glauben. 
[3:3] Der Herr ist treu; er wird euch stärken und bewahren vor dem Bösen. 
[3:4] Auf den Herrn bauend, haben wir das Vertrauen zu euch, daß ihr unsere Gebote jetzt und in Zukunft befolgt. 
[3:5] Der Herr lenke eure Herzen zu der Liebe gegen Gott und zu der Standhaftigkeit, die Christus selbst bewiesen hat! 
[3:6] Wir gebieten euch, Brüder, in dem Namen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus: Zieht euch von jedem Bruder zurück, der einen unordentlichen Lebenswandel führt und der Weisung, die ihr von uns empfangen habt, nicht gehorchen will! 
[3:7] Ihr wißt ja selbst, wie ihr unserem Vorbild folgen müßt. Denn wir haben nicht unordentlich bei euch gelebt, 
[3:8] auch nicht umsonst bei jemand Brot gegessen; sondern wir haben unter Mühen und Beschwerden Tag und Nacht gearbeitet, um keinem von euch zur Last zu fallen, 
[3:9] - nicht als hätten wir kein Recht dazu gehabt; nein, wir wollten euch ein Vorbild zur Nacheiferung geben. 
[3:10] Als wir bei euch waren, haben wir euch auch diese Regel eingeschärft: "Wer keine Lust hat zu arbeiten, der soll auch nicht essen." 
[3:11] Nun hören wir, es gibt Leute bei euch, die unordentlich leben: sie arbeiten nicht, sondern treiben unnütze Dinge. 
[3:12] Diesen Leuten gebieten wir mit ernster Mahnung im Namen des Herrn Jesus Christus, daß sie mit Ruhe arbeiten und ihr Brot verdienen sollen! 
[3:13] Ihr aber, Brüder, werdet nicht müde, Gutes zu tun! 
[3:14] Sollte jemand der Vorschrift, die wir in diesem Brief geben, nicht gehorsam sein, den merkt euch und brecht den Verkehr mit ihm ab, damit er in sich gehe! 
[3:15] Betrachtet ihn aber nicht als Feind, sondern weist ihn zurecht wie einen Bruder! 
[3:16] Der Herr des Friedens gebe euch allezeit in jeder Weise seinen Frieden! Der Herr sei mit euch allen! 
[3:17] Ich, Paulus, füge einen eigenhändigen Gruß für euch hinzu. Dies ist das Echtheitszeichen in jedem meiner Briefe. So ist meine Handschrift. 
[3:18] Die Gnade unseres Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit euch allen! 

### I Timothy

[1:1] Paulus, von Gott, unserem Retter, und von Christus Jesus, der unsere Hoffnung ist, zum Apostel Christi Jesu bestellt, 
[1:2] entbietet seinem echten Glaubenssohn Timotheus seinen Gruß. Gnade, Barmherzigkeit und Friede sei mit dir von Gott dem Vater und dem Herrn Christus Jesus! 
[1:3] Wie ich dich einst bei meiner Abreise nach Mazedonien gebeten habe, in Ephesus zu bleiben, (so ermahne ich dich nun), gewissen Leuten (dort) einzuschärfen, nicht anderes (als die gesunde Lehre) zu verkündigen 
[1:4] und sich nicht mit Fabeln und endlosen Geschlechterreihen zu befassen. Das gibt nur Anlaß zu allen möglichen Streitfragen und hindert die Wirksamkeit eines Haushalters Gottes, die den Glauben fördern soll. 
[1:5] Und was ist das Ziel der rechten Unterweisung? Liebe, die aus reinem Herzen fließt und aus einem guten Gewissen und ungeheucheltem Glauben. 
[1:6] Davon sind manche abgeirrt und haben sich leerem Geschwätz zugewandt. 
[1:7] Sie wollen Gesetzeslehrer sein und verstehen selbst nicht recht, was sie reden und behaupten. 
[1:8] Nun wissen wir, daß das Gesetz heilsam ist, wenn ein Lehrer (im Unterricht) den rechten Gebrauch davon macht. 
[1:9] Dann muß er aber die Erkenntnis haben, daß das Gesetz nicht für den Gerechten da ist, sondern für Frevler und Ungehorsame, für Gottlose und Sünder, für Unheilige und Ruchlose, für solche, die sich an Vater und Mutter vergreifen, für Mörder, 
[1:10] Hurer, Knabenschänder, Seelenverkäufer, Lügner, Meineidige und alle, die sonst noch der gesunden Lehrer zuwiderhandeln. 
[1:11] Diese Erkenntnis steht im Einklang mit der Frohen Botschaft, wodurch die Herrlichkeit des seligen Gottes kundgemacht wird, und womit ich betraut worden bin. 
[1:12] Unserem Herrn Christus Jesus, der mir Kraft verliehen hat, schulde ich Dank. Denn er hat mich für treu erachtet und zu seinem Dienst bestellt, 
[1:13] obwohl ich (ihn) früher gelästert und (seine Jünger) verfolgt und mißhandelt habe. Doch mir ist Erbarmen widerfahren; denn ich habe in Unwissenheit gehandelt, weil ich ungläubig war. 
[1:14] Und die Gnade unseres Herrn hat sich überschwenglich reich (an mir) bewiesen: sie hat in mir jenen Glauben und jene Liebe erweckt, die sich in Christus Jesus finden. 
[1:15] Es ist ein wahres Wort und allgemeiner Anerkennung wert: "Christus Jesus ist in die Welt gekommen, um Sünder zu erretten." Ich bin der größte unter ihnen. 
[1:16] Aber gerade deshalb ist mir Erbarmen widerfahren, weil Christus Jesus an mir, dem größten Sünder, den ganzen Reichtum seiner Langmut offenbaren und ein Beispiel davon geben wollte, was für Menschen durch den Glauben an ihn zum ewigen Leben kommen sollen. 
[1:17] Ihm aber, dem König des Weltalls, dem unvergänglichen, unsichtbaren, alleinigen Gott, sei Ehre und Preis in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[1:18] Im Blick auf die Weissagungen, die früher über dich ergangen sind, ermahne ich dich herzlich, mein Sohn Timotheus: sei ihrer eingedenk und kämpfe so den herrlichen Kampf; 
[1:19] halte fest am Glauben und erhalte dein Gewissen rein! Auf dessen warnende Stimme haben einige nicht hören wollen, und darum hat ihr Glauben Schiffbruch gelitten. 
[1:20] Zu diesen Leuten gehören Hymenäus und Alexander, die ich dem Satan übergeben habe, damit ihnen unter seiner Züchtigung das Lästern vergehe. 
[2:1] Ich verordne nun vor allem: Es sollen Bitten, Gebete, Fürbitten und Danksagungen dargebracht werden für alle Menschen, 
[2:2] (besonders) für die Könige und alle (anderen) Machthaber, damit wir ein ruhiges und stilles Leben führen können in aller Gottseligkeit und Ehrbarkeit. 
[2:3] Solches (Gebet) geziemt sich, und es gefällt (auch) Gott, unserem Retter, wohl. 
[2:4] Er will ja, daß alle Menschen errettet werden und zur Erkenntnis der Wahrheit kommen. 
[2:5] Denn es gibt (für alle Menschen und Völker) nur einen Gott, und es gibt auch nur einen Mittler zwischen Gott und Menschen: das ist der Mensch Christus Jesus, 
[2:6] der sich für alle zum Lösegeld dahingegeben hat. Dies sollte zu der (von Gott) bestimmten Zeit bezeugt werden. 
[2:7] Dazu bin ich — das ist die Wahrheit und keine Lüge — zum Herold und Apostel bestellt worden, um die Heiden den Glauben und die Wahrheit zu lehren. 
[2:8] Ich bestimme nun: die Männer sollen an jedem (gottesdienstlichen) Versammlungsort die Gebete sprechen; dabei sollen sie heilige Hände (zu Gott) erheben und sich von Zorn und Streitsucht fernhalten. 
[2:9] Auch die Frauen sollen beim Gebet zugegen sein[3]. Aber sie sollen in würdiger Tracht erscheinen, sich sittsam und bescheiden benehmen und nicht prunken mit künstlichen Haarflechten, Goldgeschmeide, Perlenschmuck oder kostbarer Kleidung. 
[2:10] Sie sollen sich vielmehr durch den Schmuck guter Werke auszeichnen; denn das ziemt sich für Frauen, die in Gottesfurcht wandeln wollen. 
[2:11] Die Frau soll (beim Gottesdienst) in aller Unterordnung still zuhören. 
[2:12] Ich erlaube keiner Frau, (öffentlich) zu lehren oder sich über den Mann zu stellen; sondern sie soll sich still verhalten. 
[2:13] Denn Adam ist zuerst geschaffen worden, danach Eva. 
[2:14] Auch hat sich Adam nicht verführen lassen, sondern das Weib ist verführt worden und in Übertretung gefallen. 
[2:15] Die Frauen sollen aber (trotz Evas Übertretung) das Heil erlangen, wenn sie (in Erfüllung ihres Mutterberufs) Kinder gebären (und erziehen); nur müssen sie dabei auch mit aller Sittsamkeit in Glauben, Liebe und Heiligung beharren. 
[3:1] Es ist ein wahres Wort: "Wer seine Hand nach dem Bischofsamt ausstreckt, der begehrt ein köstliches Arbeitsfeld." 
[3:2] Ein Bischof muß nun ohne Tadel sein, eines Weibes Mann, ernst, besonnen, gesetzt, gastfrei, lehrtüchtig. 
[3:3] Er darf kein Trinker und kein Händelsucher sein; er muß vielmehr sanftmütig sein und allem Streit aus dem Weg gehen. Er darf nicht geldgierig sein. 
[3:4] Er muß seinem eigenen Haus gut vorstehen und seine Kinder zum Gehorsam und zu einem ehrbaren Lebenswandel anhalten. 
[3:5] Denn wer sein eigenes Haus nicht in Ordnung halten kann, wie ist der fähig, für die Gemeinde Gottes zu sorgen? 
[3:6] Kein Neugetaufter (soll sofort Bischof werden, damit er nicht, von Stolz verblendet, einem ähnlichen Strafgericht verfalle, wie es den Teufel getroffen hat. 
[3:7] Der Bischof muß sich auch eines guten Rufs erfreuen bei denen, die außerhalb (der Kirche) stehen, damit er nicht dem Teufel Anlaß gebe, ihn zu verleumden und in seine Schlinge zu ziehen. 
[3:8] Die Diakonen sollen gleichfalls achtbare Männer sein. Sie müssen sich hüten vor Doppelzüngigkeit, übermäßigem Weingenuß und schmutziger Gewinnsucht. 
[3:9] Denn sie sollen das Geheimnis des Glaubens in einem reinen Gewissen bewahren. 
[3:10] Auch sie sollen zunächst (auf ihre Würdigkeit) geprüft und erst dann zum Dienst zugelassen werden, wenn keine Beschwerde gegen sie erhoben worden ist. 
[3:11] Auch die Diakonissen müssen achtbar sein. Sie dürfen nicht klatschen und verleumden, sondern sie müssen ernst sein und in jeder Hinsicht zuverlässig. 
[3:12] Die Diakonen sollen jeder eines Weibes Mann sein und ihre Kinder und Häuser gut in Ordnung halten. 
[3:13] Denn solche Diakonen, die ihr Amt gut ausrichten, gewinnen eine ehrenvolle Stellung und können im Vertrauen auf Christus Jesus mit großer Zuversichtlichkeit (in der Gemeinde) auftreten. 
[3:14] Dies schreibe ich dir, obwohl ich hoffe, recht bald zu dir zu kommen. 
[3:15] Sollte sich aber meine Ankunft verzögern, so weißt du nun, wie du dich zu verhalten hast in dem Haus Gottes, das da ist die Kirche des lebendigen Gottes, die Säule und Grundfeste der Wahrheit. 
[3:16] Und wahrlich, etwas Großes ist's um das Geheimnis der Gottseligkeit! Der offenbart ist im Fleisch, der ist gerechtfertigt worden durch den Geist: Er ist erschienen seinen Boten, gepredigt unter den Völkern, geglaubt in der Welt, aufgenommen in die Herrlichkeit. 
[4:1] Der Geist verkündigt ganz ausdrücklich, daß in späteren Zeiten manche vom Glauben abfallen werden, weil sie irreführenden Geistern folgen und Teufelslehren, 
[4:2] die von heuchlerischen Lügnern ausgehen: Von Menschen, die in ihrem Gewissen (gleich Verbrechern) ein Brandmal ihrer Schuld tragen. 
[4:3] Diese Leute verbieten die Ehe und den Genuß von Speisen, die doch Gott geschaffen hat, damit sie von den Gläubigen, die die Wahrheit erkannt haben, mit Danksagung genossen werden. 
[4:4] Denn alles, was Gott geschaffen hat, ist gut; und (darum) braucht man auch kein Nahrungsmittel (als böse) zu verwerfen, wenn man's mit Danksagung genießt. 
[4:5] Es wird ja geheiligt durch Gottes Wort, das in dem Tischgebet zum Ausdruck kommt. 
[4:6] Wenn du so die Brüder unterweist, wirst du ein trefflicher Diener Christi Jesu sein; denn dann nährst du dich mit den Worten des Glaubens und der heilsamen Lehre, der du bisher gefolgt bist. 
[4:7] Jene Fabeleien aber, die mit dem Heiligen nichts zu tun haben, und die nur leeres Geschwätz sind, die laß beiseite! Hingegen übe dich, in der Frömmigkeit zu wachsen! 
[4:8] Denn die leibliche Übung bringt wenig Nutzen. die Frömmigkeit aber ist zu allem nütze, denn sie hat eine Verheißung für dieses Leben und das zukünftige. 
[4:9] Das ist ein wahres Wort und allgemeiner Anerkennung wert. 
[4:10] Wir nehmen ja deshalb Mühe und Schande auf uns, weil wir auf den lebendigen Gott vertrauen: der ist der Retter aller Menschen und ganz besonders der Gläubigen. 
[4:11] Dies schärfe ein und lehre! 
[4:12] Damit niemand deiner Jugend wegen gering von dir denke, so sei in Wort und Wandel, in Liebe, Glauben und Sittenreinheit den Gläubigen ein Vorbild! 
[4:13] Bis zu meiner Ankunft sorge dafür, daß die heiligen Schriften vorgelesen werden, und daß die Gemeinde Ermahnung und Belehrung empfange! 
[4:14] Versäume nicht, die Gnadengabe zu betätigen, die in dir wohnt, und die dir nach vorausgegangener Weissagung unter Handauflegung der Ältestenschaft (von mir) zuteil geworden ist. 
[4:15] Dies laß deine Sorge sein; dem gibt dich hin, damit alle deutlich sehen, wie du (im geistlichen Leben) fortschreitest! 
[4:16] Achte beharrlich auf dein Verhalten und auf die Lehre, (die du vorträgst)! Tust du das, so wirst du dich und deine Hörer zum Heil führen. 
[5:1] Auf einen älteren Mann schlage nicht (mit harten Worten) los, sondern sprich ihm zu, als wäre er dein Vater; jüngere Männer behandle wie Brüder, 
[5:2] ältere Frauen wie Mütter, jüngere wie Schwestern, jedoch mit aller Sittsamkeit! 
[5:3] Unterstütze solche Witwen, die wirklich hilfsbedürftig sind! 
[5:4] Hat aber eine Witwe Kinder oder Enkel, so sollen diese zunächst lernen, ihren Angehörigen Liebe zu beweisen und ihren Müttern und Großmüttern die empfangenen Wohltaten zu vergelten. Denn das ist Gott wohlgefällig. 
[5:5] Eine wirklich hilfsbedürftige Witwe, die ganz allein steht, die setzt ihre Hoffnung auf Gott und fleht und betet unablässig Tag und Nacht. 
[5:6] Eine Witwe aber, die ein ausschweifendes Leben führt, ist bei lebendigem Leib tot. 
[5:7] Dies schärfe ihnen ein, damit man ihnen nicht vorwerfen könne! 
[5:8] Sorgt ein Hausvater nicht für seine Hausgenossen und namentlich nicht für seine nächsten Verwandten, so hat er den Glauben verleugnet und ist schlimmer als ein Heide. 
[5:9] Eine Witwe darf nur dann in das Witwenverzeichnis aufgenommen werden, wenn sie mindestens sechzig Jahre alt ist. Sie muß eines Mannes Ehefrau gewesen sein 
[5:10] und sich durch gute Werke ein ehrenvolles Zeugnis erworben haben. Dahin gehört, daß sie Kinder großgezogen, Gastfreundschaft geübt, den Heiligen die Füße gewaschen, den Bedrängten geholfen, kurz, sich an allen möglichen Liebeswerken beteiligt hat. 
[5:11] Jüngere Witwen weise ab! Denn wenn sie im Widerspruch mit dem Dienst Christi von Liebeslust gereizt werden, so wollen sie (wieder) heiraten. 
[5:12] Damit setzen sie sich dann aber dem Vorwurf aus, daß sie ihr früher gegebenes Wort gebrochen haben. 
[5:13] Zugleich gewöhnen sie sich daran, in trägem Nichtstun von Haus zu Haus zu laufen; und nicht nur das, sondern bei ihrer Geschwätzigkeit und Neugier führen sie auch ungehörige Reden. 
[5:14] Darum halte ich's für ratsam, daß jüngere Witwen (wieder) heiraten, Kinder gebären und das Hauswesen besorgen, so daß sie den Widersachern keinen Anlaß zu übler Nachrede geben. 
[5:15] Denn manchen haben sich schon vom rechten Weg abgewandt und sind dem Satan nachgefolgt. 
[5:16] Hat irgendein weibliches Gemeindeglied Witwen (zu seiner Pflege und Handreichung), so soll es auch für sie sorgen. In solchem Fall darf die Gemeinde nicht beschwert werden, damit sie den wirklich bedürftigen Witwen ausreichend helfen könne. 
[5:17] Die Ältesten, die als Vorsteher Tüchtiges leisten, ganz besonders solche, die sich's bei der Predigt und Belehrung (der Gemeinde) sauer werden lassen, die sollen durch eine doppelte Gabe geehrt werden. 
[5:18] Denn die Schrift sagt: Du sollst einem dreschenden Ochsen nicht das Maul verbinden, und: "Der Arbeiter ist seines Lohnes wert." 
[5:19] Gegen einen Ältesten nimm keine Klage an, wenn nicht zwei oder drei Zeugen vorhanden sind. 
[5:20] Die (Ältesten), deren Schuld erwiesen ist, weise in Gegenwart aller zurecht, damit auch die anderen gewarnt werden! 
[5:21] Vor Gott, dem Herrn Jesus Christus und den auserwählten Engeln ermahne ich dich ernstlich: führe diese Anweisungen ohne Vorurteil aus und tue nichts nach Gunst! 
[5:22] Lege niemand übereilt die Hände auf und mache dich nicht an den Sünden anderer mitschuldig! Halte dich rein! 
[5:23] Trinke nicht mehr ausschließlich Wasser, sondern wegen deines Magens und deiner häufigen Kränklichkeit genieße etwas Wein! 
[5:24] Bei manchen Menschen liegen die Sünden so klar zutage, daß sie ihnen wie Vorboten auf dem Weg zum Gericht voraneilen; bei anderen treten sie erst später ans Licht. 
[5:25] Ebenso ist's auch mit den guten Werken: einige sind ganz offenkundig; doch auch solche, mit denen sich's anders verhält, können nicht verborgen bleiben. 
[6:1] Alle, die als Sklaven unter einem Joch schmachten, sollen ihre Herren in jeder Weise ehren, damit der Name Gottes und die Lehre nicht verlästert werden. 
[6:2] Die Sklaven aber, die Gläubige zu Herren haben, sollen deshalb, weil die Herren (christliche) Brüder sind, nicht geringere Ehrfurcht vor ihnen haben. Im Gegenteil, sie sollen ihnen um so williger dienen; denn sie haben es mit Gläubigen und Freunden zu tun, die ihre Wohltäter heißen wollen. Dies lehre und schärfe ein! 
[6:3] Wer anders lehrt und sich nicht hält an die gesunden Aussprüche unseres Herrn Jesus Christus und an die Lehre, die der Frömmigkeit entspricht, 
[6:4] der ist (von Hochmut) verblendet und hat kein rechtes Verständnis. Er krankt vielmehr an der Sucht, sich mit (müßigen) Streitfragen und Wortgezänk zu befassen. Daraus entstehen nur Neid, Hader, Schmähungen, aller mögliche schlimme Argwohn 
[6:5] und fortwährende Reibereien. So sieht es aus bei Menschen, deren ganze Denkart verderbt ist, und die den Sinn für die Wahrheit verloren haben, so daß sie die Frömmigkeit nur als ein Mittel zum Gelderwerb betrachten. 
[6:6] Allerdings liegen reiche Schätze in der Frömmigkeit, wenn sie mit Genügsamkeit verbunden ist. 
[6:7] Wir haben ja nichts mit in die Welt gebracht, und wir können auch nichts mit hinausnehmen. 
[6:8] Haben wir Nahrung und Kleidung, so ist das für uns genug. 
[6:9] Die nach Reichtum trachten, fallen in Versuchung und Schlingen und viel unvernünftige und schädliche Begierden, die die Menschen in den Abgrund des Verderbens stürzen. 
[6:10] Denn die Geldgier ist eine Wurzel aller Übel. Gar manche, die ihre Hand nach dem Geld ausgestreckt haben, sind von dem Weg des Glaubens abgeirrt und haben sich selbst in bitteres Leid gebracht. 
[6:11] Du, Mann Gottes, fliehe dieses Laster! Trachte vielmehr nach der Gerechtigkeit und Frömmigkeit, nach dem Glauben und der Liebe, nach der Geduld und Sanftmut! 
[6:12] Kämpfe den herrlichen Kampf des Glaubens, erringe das ewige Leben als Siegespreis! Dazu bist du berufen und hast in Gegenwart vieler Zeugen das herrliche Bekenntnis (deines Glaubens) abgelegt. 
[6:13] Vor Gott, der allen Dingen Leben gibt, und vor Christus Jesus, der unter Pontius Pilatus sein herrliches Bekenntnis mit dem Tod besiegelt hat, ermahne ich dich: 
[6:14] Bewahre meine Lehre fleckenlos und unversehrt bis auf die Erscheinung unseres Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[6:15] Die wird uns zur rechten Zeit schauen lassen der selige und alleinige Machthaber, der König der Könige und Herr der Herren — er, 
[6:16] der allein Unsterblichkeit hat, der in einem unzugänglichen Licht wohnt, den kein Mensch gesehen hat noch sehen kann. Ihm sei Ehre und Gewalt in Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[6:17] Die Reichen in dieser Welt warne vor Hochmut! Sie sollen ihre Hoffnung nicht auf den unsicheren Reichtum setzen, sondern auf Gott, der uns alles, was wir nötig haben, in reicher Fülle schenkt. 
[6:18] Sie sollen wohltun, an guten Werken reich werden, freigebig und mildtätig sein 
[6:19] und sich so einen herrlichen Schatz für die Zukunft sammeln, damit sie das wahre Leben erlangen. 
[6:20] O Timotheus, bewahre das dir anvertraute Gut; wende dich ab von dem unreinen, leeren Geschwätz und den Streitsätzen der fälschlich sogenannten Erkenntnis! 
[6:21] Denn manche, die sich mit ihr eingelassen haben, sind vom Glauben abgeirrt. Die Gnade sei mit dir! 

### II Timothy

[1:1] Paulus, durch Gottes Willen zum Apostel Christi Jesu bestellt, um das Leben zu verkündigen, das in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus zu finden ist, 
[1:2] entbietet seinem geliebten Kind Timotheus seinen Gruß. Gnade, Erbarmen und Friede werde dir zuteil von Gott dem Vater und unserem Herrn Christus Jesus! 
[1:3] Ich danke Gott, dem ich nach meiner Ahnen Vorbild mit reinem Gewissen diene, sooft ich fort und fort bei Tag und Nacht in meinen Gebeten dein gedenke. 
[1:4] Ich vergesse nicht deiner Tränen, und mich verlangt nach einem Wiedersehen mit dir. Das wäre der Gipfel meiner Freude. 
[1:5] Dabei ist mir dein ungeheuchelter Glaube stets im Gedächtnis. Ein solcher Glaube hat auch schon gewohnt in deiner Großmutter Lois und in deiner Mutter Eunike. Nun wohnt er, wie ich fest vertraue, auch in dir. 
[1:6] Darum rufe ich dir mahnend zu: Fach an zu neuer Glut die Gnadengabe Gottes, die in dir ist durch meine Handauflegung! 
[1:7] Denn Gott hat uns nicht einen Geist gegeben, der Verzagtheit wirkt, sondern einen Geist, der uns erfüllt mit Kraft, mit Liebe und mit nüchterner Besonnenheit. 
[1:8] Darum schäme dich nicht, von unserem Herrn Zeugnis abzulegen! Schäme dich auch mein nicht, der ich um seinetwillen in Ketten liege! Sondern im Dienst der Heilsbotschaft sei ebenso wie ich bereit zu leiden! Dazu gibt Gott die Kraft. 
[1:9] Er hat uns ja errettet und mit heiligem Ruf berufen — nicht wegen unserer Werke, sondern nach seinem freien Ratschluß —, um uns seine Gnade mitzuteilen. Die hat er uns in Christus Jesus schon seit ewigen Zeiten zum Besitz bestimmt. 
[1:10] Doch jetzt erst ist sie offenbar geworden durch die Erscheinung unseres Retters Jesus Christus. Der hat des Todes Macht vernichtet und Leben und Unsterblichkeit ans Licht gebracht durch seine Frohe Botschaft. 
[1:11] Ich bin dazu eingesetzt worden, sie als Apostel und als Lehrer mit lautem Heroldsruf zu verkündigen. 
[1:12] Darum habe ich jetzt auch (Gefangenschaft) zu leiden. Aber ich lasse den Mut nicht sinken. Denn ich weiß, auf wen ich mein Vertrauen setze, und bin gewiß, er hat's in seiner Macht, das mir anvertraute Gut bis auf "jenen Tag" zu bewahren. 
[1:13] Was du von mir gehört, das halte fest als Vorbild für gesunde Lehre in jenem Glauben und in jener Liebe, die sich in Christus Jesus finden! 
[1:14] Bewahre das dir anvertraute köstliche Gut durch die Kraft des Heiligen Geistes, der in uns wohnt! 
[1:15] Du weißt, daß alle Kleinasiaten, darunter Phygelus und Hermogenes, sich von mir abgewandt haben. 
[1:16] Der Herr schenke Barmherzigkeit dem Haus des Onesiphorus! Denn er hat mich oft erquickt und sich meiner Ketten nicht geschämt. 
[1:17] Vielmehr hat er bei seinem Aufenthalt in Rom eifrig nach mir gesucht und mich auch aufgefunden. 
[1:18] Der Herr lasse ihn dafür Erbarmen finden bei dem Herrn an jenem Tag! Und welche Dienste er in Ephesus geleistet hat, das weißt du selbst am besten. 
[2:1] Du nun, mein Kind, erstarke in der Gnade, die in der Gemeinschaft mit Christus Jesus zu finden ist! 
[2:2] Die Wahrheit, die du von mir vernommen hast, und die durch viele Zeugen bekräftigt wird, vertraue zuverlässigen Männern an, die tüchtig sind, auch andere zu belehren! 
[2:3] Leide wie ich als rechter Streiter Christi Jesu! 
[2:4] Ein Krieger, der zu Felde zieht, darf sich nicht in bürgerliche Geschäfte verstricken lassen; sonst kann er dem Feldherrn nicht gefallen, der ihn angeworben hat. 
[2:5] Nimmt einer am Wettkampf teil, so erringt er keinen Siegerkranz, wenn er beim Kampf nicht den vorgeschriebenen Regeln folgt. 
[2:6] Der Landmann, der sich im Schweiße seines Angesichts müht, der hat den ersten Anspruch auf den Genuß der Früchte. 
[2:7] Sinne über meine Worte nach! Der Herr wird dir schon in allem das rechte Verständnis geben. 
[2:8] Gedenke daran, daß Jesus Christus, aus Davids Stamm entsprossen, von den Toten auferstanden ist! So lautet ja die Frohe Botschaft, die ich verkündige. 
[2:9] Für diese Botschaft muß ich leiden, ja sogar in Ketten liegen, als ob ich ein Verbrecher wäre — doch Gottes Wort liegt darum nicht in Ketten —. 
[2:10] Deswegen nehme ich alles auf mich um der Auserwählten willen, damit auch sie das Heil erlangen, das man in der Gemeinschaft Christi Jesu findet: ein Heil, verbunden mit ewiger Herrlichkeit. 
[2:11] Es ist ein wahres Wort: Sind wir mit ihm gestorben, so werden wir auch mit ihm leben. 
[2:12] Sind wir standhaft, so werden wir auch mit ihm herrschen. Wenn wir verleugnen, so wird Er uns auch verleugnen. 
[2:13] Sind wir treulos, Er bleibt treu. Er kann sich nicht verleugnen. 
[2:14] Dies bringe in Erinnerung und ermahne sie feierlich vor des Herrn Angesicht, alles Wortgezänk zu meiden! Denn das bringt keinen Nutzen, sondern richtet die Hörer nur zugrunde. 
[2:15] Trachte danach, in Gottes Augen tadelfrei dazustehen als ein Arbeiter, der sich (seines Werkes) nicht zu schämen braucht, da er das Wort der Wahrheit rein und angemessen vorträgt! 
[2:16] Dem unreinen Geschwätz (der Irrlehrer) aber gehe aus dem Weg! Denn diese Leute versinken immer tiefer in Gottlosigkeit, 
[2:17] und ihre Lehre wird um sich fressen wie ein Krebsgeschwür. Zu dieser Gesellschaft gehören Hymenäus und Philetus. 
[2:18] Sie sind von der Wahrheit abgeirrt; denn sie behaupten, die Auferstehung sei schon geschehen, und suchen den Glauben bei manchen zu untergraben. 
[2:19] Trotzdem bleibt der feste Gottesbau bestehen. Er trägt die Inschrift: Der Herr kennt die Seinen; und: "Es lasse ab von Ungerechtigkeit, wer des Herrn Namen anruft!" 
[2:20] In einem großen Haushalt gibt es aber nicht nur goldene und silberne Gefäße, sondern auch hölzerne und irdene: die einen dienen einem ehrenvollen Zweck, die anderen nehmen Unrat auf. 
[2:21] Wer sich nun von den mit Unrat gefüllten Gefäßen rein erhält, der ist ein Gefäß für einen ehrenvollen Dienst, ein Gefäß von ganz besonderer Weihe, dem Hausherrn nützlich und für alle guten Zwecke brauchbar. 
[2:22] Fliehe die Lüste des Jugendalters! Trachte nach Gerechtigkeit, Glauben, Liebe und Frieden in Gemeinschaft mit alle, die den Herrn aus reinem Herzen anrufen! 
[2:23] Den törichten und unverständigen Erörterungen geh aus dem Weg! Denn du weißt, sie rufen nur Streitigkeiten hervor. 
[2:24] Ein Knecht des Herrn aber darf nicht streiten. Er soll sich vielmehr gegen alle freundlich zeigen, tüchtig sein im Lehren, das Böse ertragen können 
[2:25] und die Irrlehrer mit sanfter Schonung zurechtweisen. Denn Gott kann ja ihren Sinn noch ändern, daß sie die Wahrheit erkennen 
[2:26] und wieder zur Besinnung kommen, Seinen Willen zu tun, wenn sie des Teufels Strick entronnen sind, der sie jetzt noch gefangenhält. 
[3:1] Das sollst du wissen: In den letzten Tagen werden schlimme Zeiten kommen. 
[3:2] Denn da werden die Menschen selbstsüchtig sein und geldgierig, prahlerisch, übermütig, schmähsüchtig, den Eltern ungehorsam, undankbar, gottlos, 
[3:3] lieblos, unversöhnlich, verleumderisch, ausschweifend, roh, Feinde alles Guten, 
[3:4] verräterisch, leichtfertig, verblendet; sie werden Lust und Vergnügen mehr lieben als Gott; 
[3:5] sie halten wohl noch fest an den äußeren Bräuchen der Frömmigkeit, aber sie geben ihr keinen Einfluß auf ihr Leben. Solche Menschen meide! 
[3:6] Zu dem Kreis dieser Leute gehören (jene Verführer), die sich in die Häuser einschleichen und besonders (leichtfertige, beschränkte) Weiber zu fangen suchen, die voller Sünden sind und von Leidenschaften aller Art beherrscht werden, 
[3:7] die immer etwas Neues lernen wollen und dabei doch nie zu einer wirklichen Erkenntnis der Wahrheit kommen können. 
[3:8] Gerade wie einst Jannes und Jambres gegen Mose auftraten, so treten auch diese gegen die Wahrheit auf: sie sind zerrüttet in ihrem Sinn, und ihr Glaube hat die Probe nicht bestanden. 
[3:9] Doch auf die Dauer haben sie keinen Erfolg. Denn alle werden ihren Unsinn (und Betrug) klar erkennen, wie es ja auch bei jenen der Fall gewesen ist. 
[3:10] Du aber kennst genau meine Lehre, mein Leben und mein Streben, meinen Glauben, meine Langmut, meine Liebe, meine Ausdauer, 
[3:11] meine Verfolgungen und meine Leiden. Du weißt, was mir widerfahren ist in Antiochia, Ikonium und Lystra. Was für Verfolgungen habe ich durchgemacht! Und aus allen hat mich der Herr errettet. 
[3:12] Doch auch alle, die in der Gemeinschaft Christi Jesu ein frommes Leben führen wollen, müssen Verfolgung leiden. 
[3:13] Böse Menschen und Betrüger werden wohl äußerlich Erfolge haben, aber ihr Verderben wird desto ärger sein; denn sie sind Verführer und Verführte. 
[3:14] Bleibe du treu bei dem, was du gelernt und von dessen Wahrheit du dich überzeugt hast! Bedenke, wer deine Lehrer gewesen sind, 
[3:15] und wie du von Kindheit auf die heiligen Schriften kennst! Die können dir, wenn du wie Christus Jesus glaubst, die Weisheit schenken, die zum Heil führt. 
[3:16] Jede Schrift, weil von Gott eingegeben, ist auch nützlich zur Belehrung, zur Widerlegung, zur Zurechtweisung, zur Erziehung in der Gerechtigkeit; 
[3:17] so wird der Gottesmann vollkommen und ausgerüstet zu jedem guten Werk. 
[4:1] Ich beschwöre dich vor dem Angesicht Gottes und Christi Jesu, der Lebendige und Tote richten wird, wenn er erscheint in seiner Königsmacht: 
[4:2] Verkündige das Wort, tritt damit auf, gerufen oder ungerufen; überzeuge, weise zurecht und ermahne mit allen Aufwand von Geduld und Lehrgeschick! 
[4:3] Denn es kommt eine Zeit, da werden die Leute die gesunde Lehre unerträglich finden und sich immer neue Lehrer nach ihrem Geschmack suchen, weil sie hören wollen, was ihre Ohren kitzelt; 
[4:4] von der Wahrheit werden sie ihr Ohr abwenden und sich den Fabeln zuwenden. 
[4:5] Du aber sei in jeder Hinsicht nüchtern; sei bereit zu leiden; verrichte das Werk eines Verkündigers der Heilsbotschaft; sei treu in deinem Dienst bis ans Ende! 
[4:6] Denn ich bin schon ein Todesopfer, und die Zeit meines Heimgangs ist da. 
[4:7] Den herrlichen Kampf habe ich gekämpft, den Lauf vollendet, die Treue gehalten. 
[4:8] Nun liegt die Gerechtigkeit als Siegeskranz für mich bereit: den wird mir der Herr an jenem Tag zum Lohn schenken — er, der gerechte Richter; doch nicht mir allein, sondern auch allen, die seine Erscheinung liebgehabt. 
[4:9] Beeile dich, so schnell als möglich zu mir zu kommen! 
[4:10] Denn Demas hat mich aus Liebe zu dem, was die jetzige Weltzeit bietet, im Stich gelassen und ist nach Thessalonich gegangen; Kreszenz ist nach Gallien gereist und Titus nach Dalmatien. 
[4:11] Nur Lukas ist noch bei mir. Nimm dir Markus zum Reisebegleiter und bring ihn mit, denn er kann mir gute Dienste leisten! 
[4:12] Tychikus habe ich nach Ephesus gesandt. 
[4:13] Den Reisemantel, den ich in Troas bei Karpus zurückgelassen habe, bring mir mit, wenn du kommst, ebenso die Buchrollen und namentlich die Pergamentblätter! 
[4:14] Der Metallarbeiter Alexander hat mir viel Böses zugefügt: der Herr wird ihm vergelten nach seinen Werken. 
[4:15] Nimm du dich auch vor ihm in acht; denn er ist unseren Aussagen scharf entgegengetreten! 
[4:16] Als ich mich das erste Mal vor Gericht zu verantworten hatte, da erschien niemand als mein Beistand, sondern alle ließen mich im Stich. Möge es ihnen nicht zugerechnet werden! 
[4:17] Der Herr aber hat mir damals beigestanden und mich gestärkt. Denn die Botschaft des Heils sollte durch mich völlig ausgerichtet werden, und alle Völker sollten sie vernehmen. Deshalb bin ich auch errettet worden aus des Löwen Rachen. 
[4:18] Auch jetzt wird mich der Herr erretten von allen, was mir Schlimmes widerfährt, indem er mich sicher geleitet in sein himmlisches Königreich. Ihm sei ehre in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[4:19] Grüße Priska und Aquila und die Angehörigen des Onesiphorus! 
[4:20] Erastus ist in Korinth geblieben; Trophimus habe ich krank in Milet zurückgelassen. 
[4:21] Beeile dich, noch vor Eintritt des Winters hierher zu kommen! Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Klaudia und alle Brüder lassen dich grüßen. 
[4:22] Der Herr Jesus sei mit deinem Geist! Die Gnade sei mit euch! 

### Titus

[1:1] Paulus, ein Knecht Gottes und ein Apostel Jesu Christi, entbietet seinem echten, im Glauben eng mit ihm verbunden Kind Titus seinen Gruß. — Ich bin ja dazu bestellt, Gottes Auserwählte zum Glauben zu führen und die Erkenntnis jener Wahrheit zu verbreiten, die einen frommen Wandel wirkt 
[1:2] durch die Hoffnung auf das ewige Leben, das Gott, der nicht lügen kann, schon von Ewigkeit her in seinem Ratschluß bestimmt hat. 
[1:3] Kundgemacht aber hat er sein Wort zur rechten Zeit durch die Verkündigung, mit der ich betraut worden bin nach dem Auftrag Gottes, unseres Retters —. 
[1:4] Gnade sei mit dir und Friede von Gott dem Vater und unserem Erretter Christus Jesus! 
[1:5] Dies ist der Grund, warum ich dich in Kreta gelassen habe: Du sollst die Dinge, die ich dort noch nicht erledigt, in Ordnung bringen. Vor allem sollst du nach meiner Anweisung in den einzelnen Städten Älteste einsetzen. 
[1:6] Ein Ältester muß unbescholten sein und eines Weibes Mann. Hat er Kinder, so müssen sie im Glauben stehen; sie dürfen nicht den Ruf haben, daß sie ein liederliches Leben führen; auch dürfen sie (ihren Eltern) nicht ungehorsam sein. 
[1:7] Denn jeder Bischof muß ein unbescholtener Mann sein, — er ist ja Gottes Haushalter. — Er darf nicht selbstherrlich sein und nicht zum Zorn neigen. Er darf kein Trinker sein oder ein Mensch, der Händel sucht und schmutzige Gewinnsucht zeigt. 
[1:8] Er soll vielmehr gastfrei sein, dem Guten zugetan, besonnen, gerecht, gottesfürchtig, voller Selbstbeherrschung. 
[1:9] Er muß festhalten an dem zuverlässigen Wort (Gottes), worin er unterrichtet worden ist, damit er fähig sei, auch in der gesunden Lehre zu unterweisen und alle zu widerlegen, die ihre Wahrheit zu bestreiten suchen. 
[1:10] Es gibt ja, namentlich unter den Judenchristen, viele Schwätzer und Verführer, die sich nicht unterordnen wollen. 
[1:11] Diesen Leuten muß der Mund gestopft werden; denn sie machen ganze Familien unglücklich, indem sie aus schmutziger Gewinnsucht ungehörige Lehren vortragen. 
[1:12] Einer ihrer Landsleute, ihr eigener Prophet, hat gesagt: "Kreter sind immer verlogen, sind Tiere und faule Gesellen." 
[1:13] Dies Zeugnis ist wahr. Darum weise sie scharf zurecht, damit sie im Glauben gesund bleiben 
[1:14] und nicht hören auf jüdische Fabeln und auf Gebote solcher Menschen, die der Wahrheit den Rücken kehren! 
[1:15] Den Reinen ist alles rein. Den Schuldbefleckten aber und Ungläubigen ist nichts rein, sondern bei ihnen ist beides befleckt: ihr Sinn und ihr Gewissen. 
[1:16] Sie rühmen sich zwar, Gott zu kennen, doch mit ihren Werken verleugnen sie ihn. Sie sind Gott ein Greuel; denn sie gehorchen ihm nicht und können kein wahrhaft gutes Werk vollbringen. 
[2:1] Du aber rede, was der gesunden Lehrer entspricht! 
[2:2] Ermahne die älteren Männer, daß sie nüchtern seien, ehrbar, besonnen, gesund im Glauben, in der liebe und in der Geduld! 
[2:3] Die älteren Frauen halte auch zu einem Wandel an, wie er sich für Heilige geziemt! Sie sollen nicht verleumden, auch nicht dem Laster der Trunksucht frönen, sondern in allem Guten unterweisen: 
[2:4] sie sollen die jüngeren Frauen anleiten, ihre Männer und ihre Kinder liebzuhaben, 
[2:5] sittsam und keusch zu sein, ihr Hauwesen gut in Ordnung zu halten und sich ihren Männern unterzuordnen, damit Gottes Wort nicht verlästert werde. 
[2:6] Ebenso ermahne die jüngeren Männer zur Selbstbeherrschung und Sittsamkeit! 
[2:7] Gib ihnen dabei durch dein Verhalten in jeder Hinsicht ein gutes Vorbild! Verkündige die Lehre unverfälscht und mit würdevollem Vortrag; 
[2:8] jedes deiner Worte sei gesund und einwandfrei: dann werden die Widersacher beschämt und können uns nichts Schlechtes nachsagen. 
[2:9] Den Sklaven schärfe den Gehorsam gegen ihre Herren ein! Sie sollen ihnen in allen Stücken gefällig sein, keine Widerworte haben, 
[2:10] nichts veruntreuen, sondern stets die rechte Treue beweisen, damit sie der Lehre Gottes, unseres Erretters, in jeder Hinsicht Ehre machen. 
[2:11] Denn die Gnade Gottes, die alle Menschen retten kann und will, ist offenbar geworden. 
[2:12] Sie will uns nun dazu erziehen, dem gottlosen Wesen und den weltlichen Lüsten völlig zu entsagen, verständig, gerecht und fromm in dieser Weltzeit zu leben 
[2:13] und darauf zu warten, daß sich unsere beseligende Hoffnung erfülle durch die Erscheinung der Herrlichkeit unseres großen Gottes und Erretters Jesus Christus. 
[2:14] Der hat sich für uns hingegeben, um uns von aller Ungerechtigkeit loszukaufen und sich ein Volk zum Eigentum zu reinigen, das Eifer zeigt für gute Werke. 
[2:15] Das ist es, was du reden sollst. Ermahne und weise zurecht mit allem Nachdruck! Tritt so auf, daß niemand wagt, dich verächtlich zu behandeln! 
[3:1] Bringe allen in Erinnerung, daß sie den obrigkeitlichen Gewalten untertan seien, ihren Befehlen gehorchen, sich an allen nützlichen Werken beteiligen, 
[3:2] niemand schmähen, sondern sich friedfertig und nachgiebig zeigen und allen Menschen stets mit Freundlichkeit entgegenkommen! 
[3:3] Auch wir sind ja einst unverständig, ungehorsam und verirrt gewesen; wir haben den mannigfachsten Begierden und Lüsten gedient und in Bosheit und Neid dahingelebt; wir sind verabscheuungswürdig gewesen und haben einander gehaßt. 
[3:4] Als aber die Güte und Menschenfreundlichkeit Gottes, unseres Retters, erschien, 
[3:5] da hat er uns nicht etwas wegen der gerechten Werke, die wir getan, das Heil gebracht; sondern in seinem Erbarmen hat er uns errettet durch das Bad der Wiedergeburt und die Erneuerung, die gewirkt wird durch den Heiligen Geist, 
[3:6] den er durch Jesus Christus, unseren Retter, reichlich über uns ausgegossen hat. 
[3:7] So sollen wir, durch seine Gnade gerechtfertigt, Erben werden des ewigen Lebens, auf das wir hoffen. 
[3:8] Dies ist ein wahres Wort, und du sollst es fest einprägen. Denn die an Gott gläubig geworden sind, sollen auch darauf bedacht sein, sich guter Werke zu befleißigen. Das ist heilsam und bringen den Menschen Segen. 
[3:9] Dagegen den törichten Grübeleien über die Geschlechterreihen und den Zänkereien und Streitigkeiten über das Gesetz geh aus dem Weg! Denn das ist nutzlos und unfruchtbar. 
[3:10] Wer einer falschen Lehre folgt, den meide, wenn du ihn zweimal (vergeblich) zurechtgewiesen hast! 
[3:11] Du weißt ja: ein solcher Mensch ist aus der rechten Bahn geraten und zieht sich durch seine Sünde selbst das Urteil zu. 
[3:12] Sobald ich Artemas oder Tychikus zu dir sende, komme eiligst zu mir nach Nikopolis! Denn dort gedenke ich den Winter über zu bleiben. 
[3:13] Zenas, den Gesetzeslehrer, und Apollos rüste sorgfältig zur Weiterreise aus, damit es ihnen an nichts fehle! 
[3:14] Auch unsere Leute sollen lernen, da, wo es nottut, hilfreich einzutreten, damit sie Früchte (ihres Glaubens) aufzuweisen haben. 
[3:15] Alle, die bei mir sind, lassen dich grüßen. Grüße die Gläubigen, die uns liebhaben! Die Gnade sei mit euch allen! 

### Philemon

[1:1] Paulus, der im Dienst Christi Jesu in Ketten liegt, und der Bruder Timotheus, wir entbieten unserem geliebten Mitarbeiter Philemon, 
[1:2] unserer Schwester Appia, unserem Mitkämpfer Archippus und deiner Hausgemeinde unseren Gruß. 
[1:3] Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von Gott, unserem Vater, und dem Herrn Jesus Christus! 
[1:4] Ich danke meinem Gott jedesmal, wenn ich dein in meinen Gebeten gedenke. 
[1:5] Höre ich doch fort und fort von deinem Glauben an den Herrn Jesus und von deiner Liebe zu allen Heiligen. 
[1:6] Ich bete nun, die Glaubensgemeinschaft, in der du mit uns stehst, möge sich wirksam zeigen für die Sache Christi, so daß du alle uns verliehenen Heilsgüter dankbar zu schätzen wissest. 
[1:7] Ja, durch deine (werktätige) Liebe habe ich viel Freude und Trost gehabt. Denn du, teurer Bruder, hast die Herzen der Heiligen erquickt. 
[1:8] Kraft meiner Gemeinschaft mit Christus könnte ich sehr kühn auftreten und dir vorschreiben, was du zu tun hast. 
[1:9] Wenn ich aber an deine Liebe denke, so ziehe ich's vor, dir mit einer Bitte zu kommen. Ich, Paulus, ein alter Mann und jetzt noch obendrein um Christi willen in Gefangenschaft, 
[1:10] ich bitte dich für mein liebes Kind, dessen Vater ich in meinem Gefängnis geworden bin: für Onesimus. 
[1:11] Der hat sich zwar früher bei dir als Nichtsnutz gezeigt, nun aber kann er uns beiden, dir und mir, von großen Nutzen sein. 
[1:12] Ich schicke ihn dir zurück, ihn, das heißt: mein eigen Herz. 
[1:13] Ich hätte ihn freilich gern an deiner Statt zu meinem Dienste hier behalten, während ich der Frohen Botschaft wegen im Gefängnis bin. 
[1:14] Aber ohne deine Erlaubnis will ich nichts tun, denn du sollst dich nicht gleichsam gezwungen, sondern ganz freiwillig gütig zeigen. 
[1:15] Vielleicht ist er auch gerade darum für kurze Zeit von dir getrennt worden, damit du ihn auf ewig zu eigen hättest — 
[1:16] nicht mehr als Sklaven, nein, als einen, der viel höher steht als ein Sklave: als einen geliebten Bruder. Das ist er im schönsten Sinne mir, und dir wird er's noch mehr sein. Denn dir ist er ja zwiefach verbunden: dem Fleisch nach und auch im Herrn. 
[1:17] Hältst du mich nun für deinen Freund, so nimm ihn auf wie mich selbst! 
[1:18] Und hat er dich geschädigt, oder schuldet er dir etwas, so schreib es nur auf meine Rechnung! 
[1:19] Ich, Paulus, — das gebe ich dir hier schriftlich — ich will's bezahlen. Ich will hier gar nicht davon reden, daß du bei mir noch Schulden hast: du schuldest mir dich selbst. 
[1:20] Ja, Bruder, jetzt will ich Nutzen von dir ziehen im Sinne des Herrn. Mach meinem Herzen eine Freude, wie es Christus wohlgefällt! 
[1:21] Ich schreibe dir in der festen Überzeugung, daß du meinen Wunsch erfüllst. Ja ich weiß, du wirst noch viel mehr tun, als ich verlange. 
[1:22] Zugleich aber rüste dich auch, mich als Gast aufzunehmen! Denn ich hoffe, ich werde euch durch eure Gebete wiedergeschenkt. 
[1:23] Epaphras, der um Christi Jesu willen meine Gefangenschaft teilt, 
[1:24] und meine Mitarbeiter Markus, Aristarchus, Demas und Lukas senden dir Grüße. 
[1:25] Die Gnade des Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit euerm Geiste! Amen. 

### Hebrews

[1:1] Vielfach und mannigfaltig hat Gott in vergangenen Zeiten zu den Vätern geredet durch die Propheten. 
[1:2] Jetzt aber am Ende der Tage hat er zu uns geredet durch den Sohn. Den hat er zum Erben aller Dinge bestimmt, durch den hat er auch die Welt erschaffen. 
[1:3] Der ist der Abglanz seiner Herrlichkeit und das Gepräge seines Wesens. Der trägt das Weltall durch sein Allmachtswort. Der hat die Reinigung von den Sünden vollbracht und sich dann gesetzt zur Rechten der Macht (Gottes) in der Höhe. 
[1:4] Dadurch ist er so weit erhoben worden über die Engel, als der Name, den er zum Erbe empfangen hat, ihren Namen überragt. 
[1:5] Denn zu welchem Engel hätte Gott je gesagt: Mein Sohn bist du, heute habe ich dich gezeugt? Und (zu welchem hätte er) ferner (gesprochen): Ich werde sein sein Vater, und er wird sein mein Sohn? 
[1:6] Wenn er aber den Erstgeborenen zum zweiten Mal in die Welt einführt, dann erfüllt sich das Wort: Es sollen ihn anbeten alle Engel Gottes. 
[1:7] Von den Engeln heißt es: Er macht zu Winden seine Engel, zu Feuerflammen seine Diener. 
[1:8] Von dem Sohn aber (steht geschrieben): Dein Thron, o Gott, steht fest in alle Ewigkeit; und: Der Geradheit Zepter ist das Zepter deiner Königsmacht. 
[1:9] Du hast Gerechtigkeit geliebt und hast gehaßt den Frevel; darum hat, o Gott, dein Gott dich mehr mit Freudenöl gesalbt, als einen deinesgleichen. 
[1:10] Und: Du hast im Anfang, Herr, der Erde Grund gelegt, und deiner Hände Werke sind die Himmel. 
[1:11] Sie werden einst vergehen, du aber bleibst. Sie werden alle wie ein Kleid veralten, 
[1:12] wie einen Mantel wirst du sie zusammenrollen: Sie werden sich verwandeln. Du aber bleibst derselbe, und deine Jahre nehmen nie ein Ende. 
[1:13] Zu welchem Engel hätte er ferner je gesagt: Sitze du zu meiner Rechten, bis ich deine Feinde zum Schemel deiner Füße mache? 
[1:14] Sind sie nicht alle (priesterlich) dienende Geister, die als Helfer ausgesandt werden zum Besten derer, die das Heil erwerben sollen? 
[2:1] Daher müssen wir ganz besonders achten auf das Wort, das wir gehört haben, damit wir nicht des Heils verlustig gehen. 
[2:2] Denn ist schon das durch Engel verkündigte Wort streng verbindlich gewesen, so daß jede Übertretung und jeder Ungehorsam die gebührende Strafe empfingen: 
[2:3] wie könnten wir da (dem Gericht) entrinnen, wenn wir ein so hohes Heil mißachten? Dies Heil ist zuerst durch den Herrn (selbst) verkündigt und uns durch die Hörer (seiner) Predigt zuverlässig überliefert worden. 
[2:4] Zugleich hat Gott dafür Zeugnis abgelegt durch Zeichen, Wunder, mannigfache Kräfte und durch die Gaben des Heiligen Geistes, die er nach seinem Willen austeilt. 
[2:5] Nicht Engel sind's, denen er die zukünftige Welt, von der wir reden, unterworfen hat. 
[2:6] Sondern es hat einer irgendwo feierlich versichert: Was ist der Mensch doch, daß du sein gedenkst, was ist der Menschensohn, daß du so für ihn sorgst? 
[2:7] Du hast ihn nur auf kurze Zeit erniedrigt unter Engel, dann aber hast du ihn gekrönt mit Herrlichkeit und Ehre; 
[2:8] das ganze Weltall hast du ihm gelegt zu Füßen und hast ihn über deiner Hände Werk gesetzt. Hat er ihm aber alles unterworfen, so gibt es nichts, was ihm nicht unterworfen wäre. Jetzt freilich sehen wir noch nicht, daß ihm alles untertan ist. 
[2:9] Wohl aber nehmen wir wahr, wie Jesus, der auf kurze Zeit unter die Engel erniedrigt war, damit er durch Gottes Gnade zu eines jeden Heil den Tod schmecke, nun, weil er den Tod erduldet hat, gekrönt ist mit Herrlichkeit und Ehre. 
[2:10] Denn es ziemte ihm, für den und durch den alle Dinge sind, und der viele Söhne zur Herrlichkeit führen wollte, den Begründer ihres Heils durch Leiden zu vollenden. 
[2:11] Der da heiligt und die geheiligt werden, die haben ja alle denselben Vater. Darum schämt er sich auch nicht, sie seine Brüder zu nennen, 
[2:12] wenn er sagt: Verkünden will ich deinen Namen meinen Brüdern, inmitten der Gemeinde will ich dir lobsingen. 
[2:13] An einer anderen Stelle heißt es: Ich werde mein Vertrauen auf ihn setzen. Und ferner: Hier bin ich, und hier sind die Kinder, die mir Gott gegeben. 
[2:14] Da nun die Kinder alle einen Leib von Fleisch und Blut an sich tragen, so hat er gleichfalls einen solchen Leib angenommen, um durch seinen Tod dem Herrn des Todes, dem Teufel, seine Macht zu rauben 
[2:15] und die zu befreien, die durch Todesfurcht ihr ganzes Leben lang in Knechtschaft schmachteten. 
[2:16] Denn fürwahr, nicht Engeln reicht er helfend seine Hand, sondern den Nachkommen Abrahams. 
[2:17] Deshalb mußte er auch in jeder Hinsicht seinen Brüdern gleich werden, damit er Gott gegenüber ein barmherziger und zuverlässiger Hoherpriester würde, um des Volkes Sünden zu sühnen. 
[2:18] Denn weil er gelitten hat und dabei selbst versucht worden ist, kann er nun auch denen, die versucht werden, ein Helfer sein. 
[3:1] Darum, ihr heiligen Brüder, ihr Mitgenossen einer himmlischen Berufung, schaut hin auf Jesus, den Gottesboten und Hohenpriester, den wir bekennen! 
[3:2] Wie Mose beweist auch er in seinem ganzen Haus Treue gegen Gott, der ihn beauftragt hat. 
[3:3] Doch überragt er Mose weit an Herrlichkeit, und zwar so weit, wie der Baumeister höher steht als das von ihm erbaute Haus. 
[3:4] - Jedes Haus hat ja einen Baumeister, der Baumeister aller Dinge aber ist Gott —. 
[3:5] Nun ist Mose treu gewesen in seinem ganzen Haus als ein Diener, der das kundmachen sollte, was Gott zu ihm redete. 
[3:6] Christus dagegen (ist treu) als Sohn, der da gesetzt ist über Gottes Haus. Dieses Haus sind wir, wenn wir die feste Zuversicht und die freudige Hoffnung bis ans Ende unerschütterlich bewahren. 
[3:7] Deshalb merkt auf das Wort des Heiligen Geistes: Heute, wenn ihr seine Stimme hört, 
[3:8] verhärtet eure Herzen nicht, wie eure Väter es taten, als sie widerspenstig waren an jenem Tage, da sie mich versuchten in der Wüste. 
[3:9] Dort stellten eure Väter meine Langmut immer wieder auf die Probe, obwohl sie meine Wunderwerke sahen vierzig Jahre. 
[3:10] Darum war ich zornig über dies Geschlecht und sprach: Stets wendet sich ihr Herz von mir, sie haben meine Wege nicht erkannt. 
[3:11] Daher schwur ich in meinem Zorn: Nie sollten sie in meine Ruhe eingehen! 
[3:12] So seht denn zu, liebe Brüder, daß keiner von euch ein böses, ungläubiges Herz habe und abfalle von dem lebendigen Gott! 
[3:13] Ermuntert vielmehr einander Tag für Tag, solange es noch "Heute" heißt, damit keiner von euch verhärtet werde durch die trügerische Lockung der Sünde! 
[3:14] Denkt doch daran: Wir sind Genossen des Messias, wenn wir die Glaubenszuversicht, die uns in den ersten Tagen erfüllte, bis ans Ende unerschütterlich bewahren. 
[3:15] Heißt es: Heute, wenn ihr seine Stimme hört, verhärtet eure Herzen nicht, wie eure Väter es taten, als sie widerspenstig waren —, 
[3:16] nun, so frage ich: "Wer sind denn jene, die seine Stimme hörten und trotzdem widerspenstig waren?" Sind es nicht alle, die einst unter Moses Leitung aus Ägypten zogen? 
[3:17] Und über welche Leute war er zornig vierzig Jahre lang? Waren das nicht jene, die da sündigten, und deren Leiber ein Grab gefunden haben in der Wüste? 
[3:18] Und ferner: wer sind jene, denen er geschworen hat, sie sollten nicht in seine Ruhe eingehen? Sind es nicht die, die ungehorsam waren? 
[3:19] So sehen wir denn: ihr Unglaube ist schuld daran gewesen, daß sie nicht haben eingehen können. 
[4:1] Da nun die Verheißung, zu seiner Ruhe einzugehen, noch der Erfüllung harrt, so laßt uns auf der Hut sein, daß niemand unter euch das Ziel verfehle! 
[4:2] Denn gerade so wie jenen ist ja auch uns die Freudenbotschaft zugegangen. Jenen aber hat die Botschaft, die sie hörten, nichts genützt, weil sie sie nicht im Glauben aufgenommen haben. 
[4:3] Denn wir gehen nur in die Ruhe ein, sofern wir glauben. Ich schwur in meinem Zorn: Nie sollen sie in meine Ruhe eingehen! So hat er gesprochen, obwohl seine Werke schon seit der Erschaffung der Welt vollendet waren. 
[4:4] Denn an einer Stelle heißt es von dem siebenten Tag: Gott ruhte am siebenten Tag von allen seinen Werken. 
[4:5] Trotzdem sagt er an dieser Stelle: "Nie sollen sie in meine Ruhe eingehen!" 
[4:6] Der Eingang in die Ruhe steht also für einige noch in Aussicht. Jene aber, an die zuerst die Freudenbotschaft erging, sind ihres Ungehorsams wegen nicht eingegangen. 
[4:7] Darum bestimmt Gott mit dem Wort "Heute" von neuem einen Tag: das tut er nach so langer Zeit durch Davids Mut, wie schon gesagt ist: Heute, wenn ihr seine Stimme hört, verhärtet eure Herzen nicht! 
[4:8] Hätte sie Josua damals in die Ruhe eingeführt, so würde Gott nicht später von einem anderen Tag reden. 
[4:9] Es steht mithin dem Volk Gottes noch eine Sabbatruhe in Aussicht. 
[4:10] Denn wer zu Gottes Ruhe eingegangen ist, der kommt damit auch zur Ruhe von seinen Werken, wie Gott geruht hat von den seinen. 
[4:11] So laßt uns denn Eifer zeigen, in diese Ruhe einzugehen, damit niemand ins Verderben falle und dann ebenso wie jene durch den Ungehorsam ein warnendes Beispiel werde! 
[4:12] Denn was Gott spricht, das ist voll Leben und Kraft und schärfer als das schärfste Schwert: es dringt durch, bis es scheidet Seele und Geist, Gelenke und Mark; es ist auch fähig, des Herzens Gedanken und Absichten zu beurteilen. 
[4:13] Ja nichts in der ganzen Schöpfung ist vor Gott verborgen; alles liegt unverhüllt und aufgedeckt vor seinen Augen. Und dieser Gott ist's, dem wir Rechenschaft zu geben haben. 
[4:14] Weil wir nun einen großen Hohenpriester haben, der seinen Weg durch die Himmel genommen hat, Jesus, den Sohn Gottes, so laßt uns festhalten an unserem Bekenntnis! 
[4:15] Wir haben ja nicht einen Hohenpriester, der mit unseren Schwächen kein Mitleid haben könnte, sondern einen, der in jeder Hinsicht ebenso versucht ist wie wir, der aber nie gesündigt hat. 
[4:16] Laßt uns deshalb mit Zuversicht dem Gnadenthron nahen, damit wir Erbarmen erlangen und Gnade finden, wenn uns Hilfe not ist! 
[5:1] Jeder Hohepriester geht aus den Menschen hervor und hat die Menschen bei Gott zu vertreten, indem er Gaben und Opfer darbringt für die Sünden. 
[5:2] Er ist imstande, die Unwissenden und Irrenden milde zu beurteilen, weil er selbst behaftet ist mit Schwachheit. 
[5:3] Deshalb muß er auch nicht nur für das Volk, sondern ebenso für seine eigenen Sünden Opfer bringen. 
[5:4] Und niemand kann sich aus eigener Macht die hohepriesterliche Würde aneignen. Die empfängt nur, wer von Gott dazu berufen wird, wie dies auch geschehen ist mit Aaron. 
[5:5] Ebenso hat auch Christus das Hohepriestertum nicht eigenmächtig an sich gerissen. Gott hat ihn eingesetzt in dieses Amt, indem er zu ihm sagte: Mein Sohn bist du, heute habe ich dich gezeugt. 
[5:6] Und an einer anderen Stelle spricht er: Du bist ein Priester in Ewigkeit nach Melchisedeks Weise. 
[5:7] Christus hat in den Tagen seines Erdenlebens Gebet und Flehen unter lautem Rufen und Weinen zu dem emporgesandt, der ihn aus des Todes Rachen erretten konnte, und er ist auch erhört worden wegen seiner Frömmigkeit. 
[5:8] So hat er, obwohl er Gottes Sohn war, in seinem Leiden die Schule des Gehorsams durchgemacht. 
[5:9] Nach seiner Vollendung ist er dann für alle, die ihm gehorsam sind, der Spender ewigen Heils. 
[5:10] Denn Gott hat ihn begrüßt als einen Hohenpriester nach der Weise Melchisedeks. 
[5:11] Hierüber hätten wir wohl viel zu sagen; aber es ist euch schwer klarzumachen, weil ihr im geistlichen Verständnis so träge geworden seid. 
[5:12] Ihr solltet andere belehren, weil ihr die Wahrheit schon so lange kennt. Statt dessen habt ihr wieder einen Lehrer nötig, der euch in den allerersten Anfangsgründen der Offenbarungsworte Gottes unterweise. So ist es dahin gekommen, daß ihr nur Milch vertragt und keine feste Speise. 
[5:13] Mit denen, die nur Milch genießen können, meine ich solche, die eine tiefe Unterweisung nicht verstehen; denn sie sind in bezug auf geistliches Verständnis noch unmündige Kinder. 
[5:14] Für geistlich Reife aber schickt sich feste Speise: sie haben durch Erfahrung ihren Sinn geübt, daß sie unterscheiden können, was heilsam oder schädlich sei. 
[6:1] So wollen wir denn die Anfangsgründe der Lehre Christi jetzt beiseitelassen und uns dem zuwenden, was sich für geistliche Reife eignet. Wir wollen uns nicht von neuem mit der Grundlage aufhalten: mit der Sinnesänderung, die sich von toten Werken abkehrt, und mit dem Glauben, der sich zu Gott hinkehrt, 
[6:2] mit der Belehrung über Taufen und Handauflegung, über Totenauferstehung und ewiges Gericht. 
[6:3] Dies wollen wir tun, wenn es Gott gelingen läßt. 
[6:4] Es ist ja unmöglich, solche, die einmal erleuchtet sind und die himmlische Gabe gekostet haben, die des Heiligen Geistes teilhaftig geworden 
[6:5] und das tröstliche Wort Gottes und die Kräfte der zukünftigen Welt geschmeckt haben, 
[6:6] aber trotzdem abfallen, ein zweites Mal zu erneuern, so daß sie zur Sinnesänderung kommen: dies ist unmöglich, wenn sie den Sohn Gottes zu ihrem Verderben immer von neuem kreuzigen und zum Gespött machen. 
[6:7] Denn ein Ackerfeld, das den reich niederströmenden Regen aufgesogen hat und denen, für die es bebaut wird, nützliches Gewächs hervorbringt, ein solches Feld wird von Gott mit immer reicherem Ertrag gesegnet. 
[6:8] Trägt es aber Dornen und Disteln, so ist es wertlos und dem Fluch nahe; ja schließlich verbrennt man es mit Feuer. 
[6:9] Wenn wir nun auch mit solcher Strenge reden, so sind wir dennoch überzeugt von euch, Geliebte, daß euch ein besseres Los erwartet, und daß es etwas gibt, was eure endliche Errettung hoffen läßt. 
[6:10] Gott ist ja nicht ungerecht, daß er vergäße eurer Arbeit und der Liebe, die ihr zur Ehre seines Namens früher und auch jetzt noch durch Unterstützung der Heiligen bewiesen habt. 
[6:11] Es ist nun unser Herzenswunsch, ein jeder von euch möge auch denselben Eifer beweisen, wenn es sich darum handelt, die Hoffnung in Kraft und Zuversicht bis ans Ende festzuhalten. 
[6:12] Denn ihr sollt nicht träge werden, sondern denen nachfolgen, die durch Glauben und Beharrlichkeit die Verheißungen erben. 
[6:13] Als Gott Abraham die Verheißung gegeben hatte, da schwur er, weil er bei keinem Größeren schwören konnte, bei sich selbst 
[6:14] und sprach: "Wahrlich, ich will dich mit Segen überschütten und will dir eine große Schar Nachkommen schenken." 
[6:15] So erlangte Abraham durch geduldiges Ausharren, was ihm Gott verheißen hatte. 
[6:16] Menschen schwören ja bei einem, der größer ist als sie: so dient der Eid bei ihnen zur Bekräftigung der Aussage, gegen die sich kein Widerspruch mehr erheben kann. 
[6:17] Deshalb ist auch Gott, um den Erben der Verheißung noch nachdrücklicher die Unwandelbarkeit seines Ratschlusses zu beweisen, mit einem Eid als Bürge eingetreten. 
[6:18] So sollten wir durch zwei unwandelbare Tatsachen, bei denen Gott unmöglich gelogen haben kann, aufs kräftigste ermuntert und getröstet werden — wir, deren Zufluchtsort es ist, die dargebotene Hoffnung festzuhalten. 
[6:19] Diese Hoffnung ist für uns ein zuverlässiger, sicherer Anker unserer Seele, und sie dringt bis in die Stätte hinter dem Vorhang. 
[6:20] Dorthin ist Jesus uns zum Heil als unser Vorläufer eingegangen, als er nach Melchisedeks Weise Hoherpriester ward in Ewigkeit. 
[7:1] Dieser Melchisedek war König von Salem und ein Priester Gottes des Höchsten. Er ging Abraham entgegen, als dieser nach dem Sieg über die Könige heimkehrte. 
[7:2] Ihm gab Abraham auch den Zehnten von der ganzen Kriegsbeute. Nach der Bedeutung seines Namens ist Melchisedek zuerst "ein König der Gerechtigkeit". Dann ist er auch König von Salem, das heißt "ein König des Friedens". 
[7:3] Die Schrift nennt nicht seinen Vater, seine Mutter, seinen Stammbaum. Sie schweigt auch von seinem Lebensanfang und seinem Lebensende. Darin wird er von der Schrift ganz dem Sohn Gottes gleichgestellt. Eben dieser Melchisedek bleibt Priester für immer. 
[7:4] Bedenkt, wie hoch und erhaben dieser Mann sein muß, dem der Erzvater Abraham sogar den Zehnten von den besten Beutestücken gegeben hat! 
[7:5] Wohl werden auch die von Levis Nachkommen, die das Priestertum empfangen, durch eine Vorschrift des Gesetzes dazu angewiesen, von dem Volk, das heißt also: von ihren Brüdern, die doch ebenso wie sie von Abraham abstammen, den Zehnten zu erheben. 
[7:6] Hier dagegen hat einer, der gar nicht zu ihrem Geschlecht gehört, von Abraham den Zehnten erhoben und den Inhaber der Verheißung gesegnet. 
[7:7] Nun läßt sich aber nicht bestreiten, daß das Geringere von dem Größeren gesegnet wird. 
[7:8] Und ferner: Hier empfangen sterbliche Menschen den Zehnten; dort aber empfängt ihn einer, von dem bezeugt wird, daß er lebe. 
[7:9] Ja in und mit Abraham hat auch sozusagen Levi selbst, der den Zehnten empfängt, den Zehnten entrichtet. 
[7:10] Er war ja noch in seines Stammvaters Lenden, als Melchisedek mit diesem zusammentraf. 
[7:11] Wäre nun freilich durch das levitische Priestertum Vollkommenheit erzielt worden — und auf diesem Priestertum beruht ja das Gesetz, das dem Volk gegeben ist —, warum mußte dann ein ganz neuer Priester "nach der Weise Melchisedeks" auftreten? Warum wurde nicht geredet von einem Priester "nach der Weise Aarons"? 
[7:12] Ändert sich aber das Priestertum, so ändert sich damit auch notwendig das Gesetz. 
[7:13] Der, von dem jene Worte gelten, gehörte ja einem anderen Stamm an, aus dem niemand am Altar gedient hat. 
[7:14] Denn es ist doch allbekannt, daß unser Herr aus Juda hervorgegangen ist; und von Priestern aus diesem Stamm hat Mose kein Wort gesagt. 
[7:15] Noch klarer wird diese Tatsache dadurch, daß ein ganz anderer Priester auftritt. Der ist Melchisedek ähnlich 
[7:16] und empfängt sein Amt nicht nach einem Gesetz, das nur leibliche Abstammung fordert, sondern er besitzt das Priestertum, weil ihm die Kraft eines unvergänglichen Lebens innewohnt. 
[7:17] Es wird ihm ja bezeugt: Du bist ein Priester in Ewigkeit nach Melchisedeks Weise. 
[7:18] Damit wird nun allerdings die bis dahin gültige Priesterordnung aufgehoben, weil sie unwirksam und nutzlos war, 
[7:19] - das Gesetz hat ja keine Vollkommenheit erzielt —; und zugleich wird eine bessere Hoffnung eingeführt, durch die wir uns Gott nahen dürfen. 
[7:20] Ferner ist Christus auch nicht ohne Eid als Priester eingesetzt worden. Jene sind ohne Eid ins Priesteramt gekommen. 
[7:21] Er ist Priester geworden durch ein Gotteswort, das von einem Eid begleitet war. Es heißt ja: Geschworen hat der Herr, und es wird ihn nicht gereuen: Du bist ein Priester ewiglich. 
[7:22] Insofern ist nun Jesus auch der Bürge einer höheren Gottesstiftung geworden. 
[7:23] Von jenen Priestern gibt es eine größere Zahl, weil der Tod sie daran hindert, im Amt zu bleiben. 
[7:24] Weil er aber ewiglich am Leben bleibt, so hat er auch ein Priestertum, das auf keinen anderen übergeht. 
[7:25] Daher kann er auch allen, die sich durch ihn Gott nahen, vollkommene Errettung schenken: er lebt ja allezeit, um fürbittend für sie einzutreten. 
[7:26] Gerade einen solchen Hohenpriester mußten wir auch haben. Er ist heilig, unberührt vom Bösen, unbefleckt; er ist aus dem Bereich der Sünder weggerückt und hoch erhöht über alle Himmel. 
[7:27] Er hat nicht wie die Hohenpriester täglich nötig, zunächst für eigene Sünden Opfer darzubringen und dann für die des Volkes — dies hat er dadurch ein für allemal getan, daß er sich selbst zum Opfer brachte —. 
[7:28] Denn das Gesetz verordnet Menschen zu Hohenpriestern, die behaftet sind mit Schwachheit. Das Eideswort dagegen, das jünger ist als das Gesetz, (bestellt zum Hohenpriester) ihn, den Sohn, der für alle Ewigkeit vollendet ist. 
[8:1] Der Hauptpunkt in unserer Erörterung ist: Wir haben einen solchen Hohenpriester, der sich zur Rechten des Thrones der (göttlichen) Hoheit im Himmel niedergelassen hat, 
[8:2] und zwar als priesterliche Diener des (himmlischen) Heiligtums und der wahrhaftigen Stiftshütte, die der Herr errichtet hat und kein Mensch. 
[8:3] Jeder Hohepriester wird dazu bestellt, Gaben und Opfer darzubringen. Darum muß auch dieser etwas darzubringen haben. 
[8:4] Wäre er nun auf Erden, so wäre er gar kein Priester. Denn hier gibt es schon solche, die nach der Vorschrift des Gesetzes die Gaben darbringen. 
[8:5] Sie dienen dem Bild und dem Schattenriß des himmlischen Heiligtums, gemäß der göttlichen Weisung, die Mose empfing, als er die Stiftshütte aufrichten sollte: Sieh zu, so ward ihm gesagt, daß du alles nach dem Muster machst, das dir auf dem Berg gezeigt worden ist. 
[8:6] Nun aber hat Christus einen weit herrlicheren Priesterdienst empfangen. Denn er hat eine viel höhere Gottesstiftung und Verordnung eingeführt, die sich auf höhere Verheißungen gründet. 
[8:7] Wäre nämlich jene erste Gottesstiftung ohne Mangel, so wäre gar kein Platz für eine zweite da: 
[8:8] Nun aber spricht Gott einen Tadel über sie aus, wenn er sagt: Siehe, es kommen Tage, spricht der Herr, da will ich fürs Haus Israel und fürs Haus Juda eine neue Stiftung machen, 
[8:9] nicht eine Stiftung, wie ich sie zugunsten ihrer Väter machte, an jenem Tag, als ich sie bei der Hand nahm, sie auszuführen aus Ägyptenland. Denn sie sind nicht beharrt bei meiner Stiftung, darum habe auch ich mich losgesagt von ihnen, spricht der Herr. 
[8:10] Dies ist nun die Verordnung, die ich für das Haus Israel aufrichten will nach jenen Tagen, spricht der Herr: Ich gebe mein Gesetz in ihren Sinn, und in ihr Herz will ich es schreiben; ich will dann sein ihr Gott, sie sollen sein mein Volk. 
[8:11] Dann soll auch niemand seinen Volksgenossen und niemand seinen Bruder lehren und ihm sagen: Erkenne doch den Herrn! 
[8:12] Denn alle werden sie mich kennen, klein und groß. Denn gegen ihre Ungerechtigkeiten will ich gnädig sein, und ihrer Sünden auch nicht mehr gedenken. 
[8:13] Indem er hier von einer neuen Verordnung (oder Stiftung) redet, hat er damit die frühere für veraltet erklärt. Was aber veraltet und abgelebt ist, das ist dem Verschwinden nahe. 
[9:1] Auch die alte Gottesstiftung hatte einen durch genaue Vorschriften geordneten Gottesdienst und ein bestimmtes, allerdings nur irdisches Heiligtum. 
[9:2] Ein Zelt ward hergerichtet. In seinem Vorderraum standen der Leuchter und der Tisch mit den Schaubroten; dieser Teil hieß das Heilige. 
[9:3] Hinter dem zweiten Vorhang war ein anderer Raum: das sogenannte Allerheiligste. 
[9:4] Hier befanden sich ein goldenes Rauchfaß und die ganz mit Gold überzogene Bundeslade, worin ein goldener Krug mit Manna sowie der Stab Aarons, der Knospen getrieben hatte, und die Gesetzestafeln lagen. 
[9:5] Oben auf der Bundeslade waren die Cherubim der Herrlichkeit, die den Gnadenstuhl (mit ihren Flügeln) überschatteten. Doch ist hier nicht der Ort, darüber jetzt im einzelnen zu reden. 
[9:6] So war dies alles eingerichtet. In den Vorderraum treten die Priester, die den Gottesdienst auszuführen haben, tagtäglich ein. 
[9:7] Den zweiten Raum betritt allein der Hohepriester, und zwar nur einmal jährlich, jedoch nicht ohne Blut, das er für sich selbst und des Volkes Vergehen darbringt. 
[9:8] Damit wies der Heilige Geist beständig darauf hin, daß der Zutritt zum Allerheiligsten so lange verschlossen sei, als der Vorderraum der Stiftshütte noch benutzt würde. 
[9:9] Dieser Vorderraum ist ein Sinnbild bis auf die gegenwärtige Zeit. Nach der in ihm gültigen Ordnung werden Gaben und Opfer dargebracht, die freilich dem, der Gott damit dient, nicht den wirklichen Gewissensfrieden geben können. 
[9:10] Ebenso wie die Bestimmungen über Speisen und Getränke und die verschiedenen Waschungen gehören sie zu den Vorschriften, die nur die Verhältnisse des äußeren Lebens regeln und die bis zu der Zeit gelten, wo eine bessere Ordnung eingeführt wird. 
[9:11] Als Christus erschien, um als Hoherpriester die von ihm erworbenen Güter auszuteilen, da hat er ein höheres und vollkommeneres Zelt durchschritten, das nicht von Menschenhänden errichtet ist und überhaupt nicht dieser irdischen Schöpfung angehört. 
[9:12] Auch nicht das Blut von Böcken und Kälbern, sondern sein eigen Blut hat ihm ein für allemal den Eingang in das Allerheiligste erschlossen, nachdem er uns eine ewiggültige Erlösung erworben hat. 
[9:13] Denn wenn schon das Blut von Böcken und Stieren und die Asche einer Kuh, woraus das Sprengwasser für Verunreinigte bereitet wird, eine Weihe gibt, die leibliche Reinheit wirkt: 
[9:14] wieviel mehr wird da das Blut Christi, der, erfüllt und gestärkt von dem ewigen Geist, sich Gott als makelloses Opfer dargebracht hat, unser Gewissen von den toten Werken reinigen, so daß wir fähig sind, dem lebendigen Gott zu dienen! 
[9:15] So hat er eine neue Gottesstiftung eingeführt. Auf Grund seines Todes, der zur Befreiung von den unter der früheren Stiftung begangenen Übertretungen erfolgt ist, sollen alle, die dazu berufen sind, das verheißene Erbe empfangen. 
[9:16] Denn wo es sich um eine letztwillige Stiftung (oder ein Vermächtnis) handelt, da muß notwendig der Tod des Stifters nachgewiesen werden. 
[9:17] Eine Stiftung wird erst dann rechtskräftig, wenn der Erblasser tot ist; bei seinen Lebzeiten hat sie keine Gültigkeit. 
[9:18] Daher ist auch die alte Gottesstiftung nicht ohne Blutvergießen eingeweiht. 
[9:19] Denn als Mose dem ganzen Volk alle Gebote des Gesetzes verkündigt hatte, da nahm er das Blut der Kälber und der Böcke nebst Wasser, scharlachroter Wolle und Ysop und besprengte das eben vorgelesene Buch sowie das ganze Volk 
[9:20] mit den Worten: "Dies ist das Blut der Stiftung, die Gott für euch verordnet hat." 
[9:21] Ebenso besprengte er die Stiftshütte und alle Geräte des Gottesdienstes mit dem Blut. 
[9:22] Ja nach der Vorschrift des Gesetzes wird fast alles mit Blut gereinigt, und ohne Blutvergießen ist keine Vergebung zu erlangen. 
[9:23] So mußten die Abbilder der himmlischen Dinge auf diese Weise gereinigt werden. Das Himmlische selbst aber erforderte höhere Opfer. 
[9:24] Denn Christus ist nicht eingegangen in ein von Menschenhänden hergestelltes Heiligtum, also nicht in ein bloßes Abbild des wahrhaftigen Allerheiligsten. Nein, er ist in den Himmel selbst eingetreten, um jetzt zu unserem Heil vor Gottes Angesicht zu erscheinen. 
[9:25] Er ist auch nicht in den Himmel eingegangen, um sich dann wiederholt (Gott) zu opfern, wie der Hohepriester alljährlich in das Allerheiligste eintritt mit fremdem Blut. 
[9:26] Sonst hätte er ja oftmals leiden müssen seit Grundlegung der Welt. Er ist vielmehr nur einmal, und zwar am Ende des jetzigen Weltlaufs, erschienen, um durch sein Opfer die Sünde hinwegzutun. 
[9:27] Wie den Menschen ein einmaliges Sterben bestimmt ist und nach dem Sterben ein Gericht, 
[9:28] so ist auch Christus nur einmal geopfert worden, um vieler Sünden zu tragen. Nun wird er zum zweiten Mal, ohne wieder die Sünde auf sich zu nehmen, denen erscheinen, die mit Sehnsucht auf ihn warten, um ihnen Errettung zu bringen. 
[10:1] Das Gesetz zeigt die künftigen Güter nur in schattenhaftem Umriß: das eigentliche Bild der (himmlischen) Dinge hat es nicht. Darum kann es auch mit den Opfern, die Jahr für Jahr fortwährend in derselben Weise dargebracht werden, die Opfernden nie und nimmer zur Vollendung bringen. 
[10:2] - Hätte man sonst nicht mit den Opfern aufgehört, wenn jene, die sie darbringen, dadurch ein für allemal gereinigt würden und kein Schuldbewußtsein mehr hätten? — 
[10:3] Gerade durch die Opfer wird Jahr für Jahr immer wieder die Erinnerung an die Sünden wachgerufen. 
[10:4] Denn es ist unmöglich, daß das Blut von Stieren und Böcken Sünden tilge. 
[10:5] Deshalb spricht Christus auch bei seinem Eintritt in die Welt: Schlachtopfer und Speisopfer hast du nicht gefordert; doch einen Leib hast du mir zubereitet. 
[10:6] Brandopfer und Sündopfer gefallen dir nicht. 
[10:7] Da sprach ich: Sieh, ich bin gekommen — im Buch ist von mir geschrieben —, um deinen Willen, Gott, zu tun. 
[10:8] Während er in den Anfangsworten sagt: Schlachtopfer und Speisopfer, Brandopfer und Sündopfer hast du nicht gefordert, sie gefallen dir auch nicht — obgleich doch diese Opfer nach der Vorschrift des Gesetzes dargebracht werden müssen —, 
[10:9] spricht er weiter: Sieh, ich bin gekommen, um deinen Willen zu tun. — Damit hebt er die erste Ordnung auf, um die zweite Ordnung festzustellen —. 
[10:10] Durch diesen Gotteswillen sind wir geheiligt, da Jesus Christus ein für allemal seinen Leib zum Opfer hingegeben hat. 
[10:11] Ferner: Jeder Priester steht täglich da, vollzieht den Dienst und bringt immer wieder dieselben Opfer, die doch nie und nimmer die Sünden tilgen können. 
[10:12] Dieser aber hat nur ein einziges Opfer für die Sünden dargebracht und sich dann für immer zur Rechten Gottes gesetzt. 
[10:13] Seitdem wartet er darauf, daß seine Feinde zum Schemel seiner Füße gelegt werden. 
[10:14] Denn mit einem Opfer hat er alle, die sich dadurch heiligen lassen, für immer zur Vollkommenheit gebracht. 
[10:15] Das bezeugt uns auch der Heilige Geist. Denn nach den Worten: 
[10:16] Dies ist nun die Verordnung, die ich für sie aufrichten will nach jenen Tagen, spricht der Herr: Ich gebe mein Gesetz in ihre Herzen, und will es ihnen schreiben in den Sinn, heißt es weiter: 
[10:17] Und ihrer Sünden und Ungerechtigkeiten will ich nicht mehr gedenken. 
[10:18] Wo aber die Sünden wirklich vergeben sind, da ist kein Sündopfer weiter nötig. 
[10:19] So haben wir nun, Brüder, die Zuversicht, daß uns der Eingang ins Allerheiligste durch Jesu Blut geöffnet ist. 
[10:20] Er hat uns einen neuen, immer offenen Weg erschlossen, und der führt durch den Vorhang: durch sein Fleisch. 
[10:21] Wir haben einen Hohenpriester, der da waltet über Gottes Haus. 
[10:22] Darum laßt uns (Gott) nahen mit aufrichtigem Herzen in voller Glaubenszuversicht! Durch die Besprengung unserer Herzen sind wir des Schuldbewußtseins ledig. Am Leib gewaschen mit reinem Wasser; 
[10:23] laßt uns das Bekenntnis der Hoffnung unbeugsam festhalten! Denn er, der die Verheißung gegeben hat, ist treu. 
[10:24] Laßt uns sorgfältig aufeinander achten, um uns gegenseitig zur Liebe und zu guten Werken anzuspornen! 
[10:25] Kehren wir nicht unserer besonderen gottesdienstlichen Versammlung den Rücken, wie es bei manchen Gewohnheit ist! Laßt uns vielmehr einander ermahnen, und das um so mehr, als ihr den Tag schon herannahen seht! 
[10:26] Denn wenn wir vorsätzlich in der Sünde beharren, nachdem wir die Erkenntnis der Wahrheit empfangen haben, so gibt es für uns kein Sündopfer mehr, 
[10:27] sondern es bleibt uns nur eine furchtbare Erwartung des Gerichts und der Zorneifer eines Feuers, das die Widersacher verzehren wird. 
[10:28] Wer das Gesetz Moses übertreten hat, der muß auf die Aussage zweier oder dreier Zeugen hin ohne Erbarmen sterben. 
[10:29] Wieviel härter, meint ihr wohl, wird da der bestraft werden, der den Sohn Gottes mit Füßen tritt, das Blut der Gottesstiftung, durch das er geheiligt worden ist, für wertlos hält und den Geist der Gnade schmäht! 
[10:30] Wir kennen doch den, der gesagt hat: Mir kommt die Rache zu, ich will vergelten. Und anderswo heißt es: Der Herr wird sein Volk richten. 
[10:31] Furchtbar ist es, in die Hände des lebendigen Gottes zu fallen. 
[10:32] Denkt doch zurück an die vergangenen Tage, wo ihr bald nach eurer Erleuchtung so manchen schweren Leidenskampf bestanden habt! 
[10:33] Bald wurdet ihr selbst durch Schmach und Trübsal der Welt zum Schauspiel, bald halfet ihr denen, die so leiden mußten. 
[10:34] Denn den Gefangenen habt ihr Mitgefühl bewiesen und den Verlust eurer Güter mit Freuden aufgenommen in dem Bewußtsein, daß ihr ein höheres, unvergängliches Besitztum habt. 
[10:35] So laßt nun eure Hoffnungszuversicht nicht fahren! Eine hohe Belohnung ist ja mit ihr verbunden. 
[10:36] Denn standhafte Ausdauer ist euch not, damit ihr Gottes Willen tut und den verheißenen Preis erlangt. 
[10:37] Denn nur noch eine kleine, kleine Weile, dann wird erscheinen, der da kommen soll, und nicht verziehen. 
[10:38] Mein Gerechter aber wird durch den Glauben das Leben erlangen. Doch weicht er feig zurück, so hat meine Seele an ihm kein Wohlgefallen. 
[10:39] Unsere Art ist's aber nicht, feig zurückzuweichen und dadurch ins Verderben zu geraten. Wir halten's mit dem Glauben, um das Leben zu gewinnen. 
[11:1] Glauben heißt: zuversichtlich vertrauen auf das, was man hofft, und fest überzeugt sein von Dingen, die man nicht sieht. 
[11:2] Durch solchen Glauben haben die alten Väter Lob empfangen. 
[11:3] Durch den Glauben erkennen wir, daß die Welt durch Gottes Wort entstanden ist. Aus Unsichtbarem also ist das Sichtbare hervorgegangen. 
[11:4] Durch den Glauben hat Abel Gott ein angenehmeres Opfer dargebracht als Kain. Durch den Glauben empfing er auch das Zeugnis, gerecht zu sein, indem ihm Gott sein Wohlgefallen an seinen Opfergaben kundtat. Durch seinen Glauben redet er noch jetzt nach seinem Tod. 
[11:5] Seines Glauben wegen wurde Henoch entrückt, so daß er den Tod nicht sah, und er ward nicht mehr (auf Erden) gefunden, weil ihn Gott entrückt hatte. Denn nach dem Zeugnis der Schrift hat er vor seiner Entrückung nach Gottes Wohlgefallen gelebt. 
[11:6] Ohne Glauben aber ist's unmöglich, Gott zu gefallen. Denn wer Gott naht, der muß glauben, daß er da ist, und daß er denen, die ihn suchen, ihre gebührende Belohnung gibt. 
[11:7] Im Glauben baute Noah, dem Gott Kunde gab von dem, was noch nicht zu sehen war, in frommer Vorsicht eine Arche zur Rettung seines Hauses. Durch solchen Glauben hat er der Welt das Urteil gesprochen und die Glaubensgerechtigkeit ererbt. 
[11:8] Im Glauben folgte Abraham dem göttlichen Befehl, auszuziehen an einen Ort, den er zum Erbe empfangen sollte; und er zog aus, ohne zu wissen, wohin. 
[11:9] Im Glauben lebte er als Gast in dem verheißenen Land wie in der Fremde: er wohnte in Zelten ebenso wie Isaak und Jakob, die Miterben derselben Verheißung. 
[11:10] Denn er wartete auf die Stadt mit den rechten Grundfesten, deren Bildner und Baumeister Gott ist. 
[11:11] Durch Glauben empfing Sara trotz ihres hohen Alters die Fähigkeit zur Mutterschaft; denn sie hielt den für treu, der ihr die Verheißung gegeben hatte. 
[11:12] So ist denn von einem Mann, der noch dazu die Lebenskraft bereits verloren hatte, ein Geschlecht entsprossen so zahlreich wie des Himmels Sterne und wie der Sand am Meeresufer, den niemand zählen kann. 
[11:13] Im Glauben sind alle diese gestorben. Sie haben die verheißenen Güter nicht empfangen, sondern sie nur von ferne geschaut und mit Freuden begrüßt. Bekannten sie doch offen, daß sie hier auf Erden nur Fremdlinge und Pilger seien. 
[11:14] Die solche Sprache führen, erklären damit deutlich, daß sie eine Heimat suchen. 
[11:15] Hätten sie dabei an jenes Land gedacht, von dem sie ausgezogen waren, so stand es ihnen ja frei, dorthin zurückzukehren. 
[11:16] Nun aber tragen sie Verlangen nach einer besseren Heimat: nach einer Heimat, die im Himmel ist. Darum läßt sich Gott auch herab, sich ihren Gott zu nennen; denn er hat ihnen eine Stadt als Wohnung zubereitet. 
[11:17] Im Glauben hat Abraham, als ihn Gott versuchte, den Isaak zum Opfer dargebracht. Seinen einzigen Sohn wollte er opfern — er, der im freudigen Glauben die Verheißungen empfangen hatte, 
[11:18] und an den das Wort ergangen war: Von Isaak soll dein Geschlecht herkommen. 
[11:19] Denn er war überzeugt: Gott hat die Macht, sogar Tote zu erwecken. Daher empfing er seinen Sohn auch wieder aus des Todes Rachen. 
[11:20] Im Glauben segnete Isaak Jakob und Esau, indem er von zukünftigen Dingen redete. 
[11:21] Im Glauben segnete Jakob im Sterben die beiden Söhne Josefs, und, auf seines Stabes Spitze gestützt, neigte er sich anbetend. 
[11:22] Im Glauben gedachte Josef an seinem Lebensende des Auszugs der Kinder Israels und bestimmte, was mit seinen Gebeinen geschehen sollte. 
[11:23] Im Glauben ward Mose nach seiner Geburt drei Monate lang von seinen Eltern verborgen gehalten, weil sie sahen, daß er ein liebliches Kind war; und sie ließen sich nicht einschüchtern durch des Königs Gebot. 
[11:24] Im Glauben verschmähte es Mose, als er herangewachsen war, ein Sohn der Tochter Pharaos zu heißen. 
[11:25] Er wollte lieber mit dem Volk Gottes Unbill leiden, als sich durch Sünde flüchtige Genüsse erkaufen. 
[11:26] Denn er hielt Christi Schmach für größeren Reichtum als Ägyptens Schätze, weil sein Blick auf die künftige Belohnung gerichtet war. 
[11:27] Im Glauben verließ er Ägypten, ohne des Königs Zorn zu fürchten. Denn er war mutig, als sähe er den Unsichtbaren. 
[11:28] Im Glauben hielt er das Passahfest und ließ (die Häuser) mit Blut besprengen, damit der Engel, der die Erstgeburten schlug, sie nicht berühre. 
[11:29] Im Glauben gingen sie durch das Rote Meer wie durch trockenes Land, während die Ägypter, die es auch versuchten, von der Flut verschlungen wurden. 
[11:30] Durch Glauben fielen Jerichos Mauern, als man sieben Tage lang um sie herumgezogen war. 
[11:31] Um ihres Glaubens willen kam die Dirne Rahab nicht ums Leben mit den Ungehorsamen, weil sie die Kundschafter freundlichen aufgenommen hatte. 
[11:32] Was soll ich noch weiter sagen? Es würde mir an Zeit fehlen, wenn ich erzählen wollte von Gideon, Barak, Simson, Jefta und David, von Samuel und den Propheten. 
[11:33] Diese Männer haben in der Kraft des Glaubens Königreiche bezwungen, gerechte Gerichte geübt, die Erfüllung göttlicher Verheißungen erfahren, Löwen den Rachen zugehalten 
[11:34] und Feuersglut gelöscht. Sie sind des Schwertes Schneide entronnen und von Krankheit wieder genesen. Sie sind Helden im Kampf geworden und haben die feindlichen Heere zum Weichen gebracht. 
[11:35] Frauen haben ihre Toten durch Auferstehung wiedererhalten. Andere haben sich auf der Marterbank zu Tode schlagen lassen und die ihnen angebotene Lebensrettung zurückgewiesen, um eine bessere Auferstehung zu erlangen. 
[11:36] Wieder andere wurden verhöhnt und gegeißelt, ja in Ketten und Kerker geworfen. 
[11:37] Sie wurden gesteinigt, verbrannt, zersägt und mit dem Schwert erwürgt. Sie gingen umher in Schafpelzen und Ziegenfellen unter Entbehrungen, Trübsal und Ungemach. 
[11:38] Die ganze Welt konnte ihnen keine würdige Wohnstatt bieten, und doch mußten sie in Wüsteneien und Gebirgen, in Höhen und Erdklüften heimatlos umherirren. 
[11:39] Diese alle haben durch den Glauben Lob erlangt, aber die Erfüllung der Verheißung haben sie nicht erlebt. 
[11:40] Denn im Blick auf uns hatte Gott etwas Besseres vor: sie sollten nicht ohne uns vollendet werden. 
[12:1] Weil wir von einer so dichten Zeugenwolke umgeben sind, so wollen auch wir alle Last, die uns beschwert, und die Sünde, die uns so leicht umstrickt, ablegen und in dem Wettkampf, der uns obliegt, voll Ausdauer dem Ziel entgegenlaufen. 
[12:2] Dabei laßt uns unverwandt auf Jesus schauen, auf ihn, der den Glauben in uns pflanzt und auch zur vollen Reife bringt! Um die Freude zu erringen, die ihn als Siegespreis erwartete, hat er des Kreuzes Pein erduldet und die Schande nicht geachtet; darum sitzt er nun zur Rechten auf dem Thron Gottes. 
[12:3] Ja denkt daran, welch großen Widerspruch er von den Sündern gegen sich erdulden mußte: dann werdet ihr nicht ermüden noch innerlich erschlaffen! 
[12:4] Bis jetzt habt ihr im Kampf mit der Sünde das Leben noch nicht eingesetzt. 
[12:5] Aber trotzdem habt ihr schon die Mahnung ganz vergessen, die zu euch als Söhnen redet: Mein Sohn, mißachte nicht die Züchtigung des Herrn und laß den Mut nicht sinken, wenn du von ihm zurechtgewiesen wirst! 
[12:6] Denn wen der Herr liebhat, den züchtigt er, und geißelt jeden Sohn, den er zur Kindschaft annimmt. 
[12:7] Stellt euch unter die Zucht und ertragt sie standhaft! Als Söhne behandelt euch Gott! Denn wo ist ein Sohn, den der Vater nicht züchtigt? 
[12:8] Bleibt ihr aber ohne Züchtigung, die alle (Söhne Gottes) erfahren haben, dann seid ihr ja unechte, nicht echte Söhne. 
[12:9] Ferner: unseren leiblichen Vätern, die uns züchtigen, haben wir ehrfurchtsvolle Scheu bewiesen. Sollten wir uns da nicht viel mehr dem Vater der Geister unterwerfen, um so zum (ewigen) Leben einzugehen? 
[12:10] Jene haben für eine kurze Zeit nach ihrem Gutdünken Zucht an uns geübt. Dieser aber erzieht uns zu unserem wahren Besten, damit wir an seiner Heiligkeit Anteil haben. 
[12:11] Jede Züchtigung scheint freilich für den Augenblick nicht erfreulich, sondern schmerzlich zu sein. Nachher aber bringt sie allen, die sich dadurch haben üben lassen, einen beseligenden Gewinn: Gerechtigkeit. 
[12:12] Darum: Richtet wieder auf die schlaffen Hände und die gelähmten Knie! 
[12:13] Und: Sucht ebene Bahnen für eure Füße zu finden. Dann wird das Lahme nicht vom rechten Weg abweichen, sondern vielmehr gesund werden! 
[12:14] Sucht mit allen in Frieden zu leben und trachtet nach der Heiligung, ohne die niemand den Herrn sehen wird! 
[12:15] Habt acht darauf, daß niemand Gottes Gnade unbenutzt lasse! Sonst kann ein Giftkraut aufwachsen und Schaden stiften zum Verderben vieler. 
[12:16] Niemand sei bundbrüchig oder irdisch gesinnt wie Esau, der für eine einzige Speise sein Erstgeburtsrecht verkaufte! 
[12:17] Als er dann nachher, wie ihr wißt, den Segen doch erlangen wollte, da wurde er (von seinem Vater) zurückgewiesen. Er fand keine Möglichkeit, den Sinn (des Vaters) zu ändern, obwohl er unter Tränen darum bat. 
[12:18] Ihr seid ja nicht hingetreten zu einem Berg, den man anrühren konnte, und der in Feuersglut brannte, auch nicht zu Dunkel, Finsternis und Sturmwind, 
[12:19] noch zu Posaunenklang und Donnerworten, bei deren Schall die Hörer baten, es möchte nicht weiter zu ihnen geredet werden. 
[12:20] - Denn sie konnten nicht ertragen, daß verordnet wurde: Sogar ein Tier, das den Berg berührt, soll gesteinigt werden. 
[12:21] Ja die Erscheinung war so schrecklich, daß selbst Mose sprach: Ich bin voll Furcht und Zittern. — 
[12:22] Ihr seid vielmehr hingetreten zu dem Berg Zion und zu der Stadt des lebendigen Gottes, dem himmlischen Jerusalem, 
[12:23] zu einer Festversammlung vieler Tausend Engel, zu der Gemeinde der Erstgeborenen, deren Namen im Himmel eingetragen sind; zu einem Helfer, der aller Menschen Gott ist; zu den Geistern der vollendeten Gerechten; 
[12:24] zu Jesus, dem Vermittler einer neuen Gottesstiftung, und zu dem Blut der Besprengung, das noch wirksamer redet als Abel. 
[12:25] Hütet euch, dem euer Ohr zu verschließen, der zu euch redet! Denn sind jene der Strafe nicht entronnen, die seine Worte nicht hören wollte, als er auf Erden zu ihnen redete: wie werden wir da ungestraft bleiben, wenn wir dem den Rücken kehren, der jetzt vom Himmel zu uns redet! 
[12:26] Damals hat seine Stimme die Erde bewegt. Jetzt aber gilt sein Verheißungswort: Noch einmal werde ich nicht nur die Erde erschüttern, sondern auch den Himmel. 
[12:27] Dies Wort "Noch einmal" deutet an, daß das, was erschüttert wird — und zwar, weil es der (vergänglichen) Schöpfung angehört — verwandelt werden soll, damit für immer bleibe, was nicht erschüttert werden kann. 
[12:28] Weil wir nun im Begriff sind, ein unerschütterliches Königreich zu empfangen, so laßt uns dankbar sein! So dienen wir Gott wohlgefällig. Und unser Dank verbinde sich mit ehrfurchtsvoller Scheu. 
[12:29] Denn unser Gott ist auch ein verzehrendes Feuer. 
[13:1] Die Bruderliebe dauere fort! 
[13:2] Gastfreundschaft zu üben vergeßt nicht! Denn dadurch haben einige ohne ihr Wissen Engel beherbergt. 
[13:3] Gedenkt der Gefangenen, als wäret ihr auch im Gefängnis! Nehmt euch der Bedrängten an; ihr seid ja auch im (sterblichen) Leib! 
[13:4] Haltet die Ehe in jeder Hinsicht in Ehren; befleckt nicht das Ehebett! Denn Unzüchtige und Ehebrecher wird Gott richten. 
[13:5] Euer Sinn sei frei von Geldgier! Seid zufrieden mit dem, was euch beschieden ist! Er selbst hat ja gesagt: Nie will ich von dir abtun meine Hand, nie dich verlassen. 
[13:6] Darum können wir auch getrosten Mutes sprechen: Der Herr ist mein Helfer, ich werde mich nicht fürchten. Was können mir Menschen tun? 
[13:7] Gedenkt eurer Führer, die euch Gottes Wort verkündigt haben! Schaut auf den Ausgang ihrer Erdenwallfahrt und folgt ihrem Glauben nach! 
[13:8] Jesus Christus ist gestern, heute und in Ewigkeit derselbe! 
[13:9] Laßt euch nicht durch allerlei fremdartige Lehren irreführen! Denn gut und heilsam ist's, daß das Herz durch Gnade fest werde. Durch Speisen kann das nicht geschehen. Die sich damit befassen, sind ohne den erwarteten Gewinn geblieben. 
[13:10] Wir haben einen Altar, von dessen Opfer die nicht essen dürfen, die (Gott nach den Vorschriften) der Stiftshütte dienen. 
[13:11] Denn die Leiber jener Tiere, deren Blut zur Sühnung für die Sünde durch den Hohenpriester in das Allerheiligste getragen wird, die pflegt man außerhalb des Lagers zu verbrennen. 
[13:12] Darum hat auch Jesus, um durch sein eigen Blut das Volk zu weihen, außerhalb des Tores gelitten. 
[13:13] So laßt uns denn zu ihm hinausgehen außerhalb des Lagers und seine Schmach auf uns nehmen! 
[13:14] Denn hier haben wir keine bleibende Stadt, sondern unsere Sehnsucht steht nach der zukünftigen. 
[13:15] Durch ihn laßt uns nun fort und fort Gott Lobopfer bringen: "die Frucht der Lippen", die seinen Namen preisen! 
[13:16] Vergeßt auch nicht wohlzutun und mitzuteilen, denn an solchen Opfern hat Gott Wohlgefallen! 
[13:17] Gehorcht euern Vorstehern und folgt ihnen! Denn sie sind Wächter zum Heil eurer Seelen, und sie sollen einst Rechenschaft (von ihrer Arbeit) ablegen. Das möchten sie mit Freuden tun und nicht mit Seufzen; denn dies wäre euch zum Schaden. 
[13:18] Betet für uns! Denn wir meinen, daß wir ein gutes Gewissen haben, da wir in jeder Hinsicht recht zu wandeln trachten. 
[13:19] Und besonders deshalb fordere ich euch zu dieser Fürbitte auf, damit ich euch desto eher zurückgegeben werde. 
[13:20] Gott, der Friedenspender, der Jesus, unseren Herrn, aus den Toten heraufgeführt, weil er durch sein Blut eine ewige Gottesstiftung begründet hat, und ihn nun eingesetzt zum Oberhirten seiner Schafe, 
[13:21] der vollende euch in allem Guten, damit ihr seinen Willen tut, und wirke selbst in euch, was vor ihm wohlgefällig ist durch Jesus Christus! Ihm sei Ehre in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[13:22] Ich bitte euch, Brüder, nehmt mein Ermahnungswort freundlich auf! Ich habe euch ja auch nur einen kurzen Brief geschrieben. 
[13:23] Die Abreise des Bruders Timotheus ist euch bekannt. Sobald er zu mir zurückkehrt, will ich euch mit ihm besuchen. 
[13:24] Grüßt alle eure Vorsteher und alle Heiligen! Es grüßen euch die Brüder in Italien. 
[13:25] Die Gnade sei mit euch allen! Amen. 

### James

[1:1] Jakobus, ein Knecht Gottes und des Herrn Jesus Christus, entbietet den zwölf Stämmen in der Zerstreuung seinen Gruß. 
[1:2] Seid hocherfreut, meine Brüder, wenn ihr in allerlei Anfechtungen fallt! 
[1:3] Ihr wißt ja, daß die Prüfung eures Glaubens Beharrlichkeit zur Folge hat. 
[1:4] Und diese Beharrlichkeit sollt ihr in all euerm Handeln betätigen, damit ihr zur vollen geistlichen Reife kommt und es euch an keiner Tugend mangele. 
[1:5] Fehlt es aber einem von euch an Weisheit, der bitte Gott darum, und dann wird sie ihm gegeben werden; denn Gott gibt allen gern und hält es nachher niemand vor. 
[1:6] Er bitte aber im Glauben, ohne zu zweifeln. Denn der Zweifler gleicht einer Meereswoge, die vom Sturm getrieben und geschaukelt wird. 
[1:7] Ein solcher Mensch darf nicht erwarten, etwas von dem Herrn zu empfangen. 
[1:8] Er hat gleichsam zwei Seelen in seiner Brust und schwankt ohne inneren Halt auf allen seinen Wegen hin und her. 
[1:9] Der arme, geringe Bruder rühme sich seiner (künftigen) Erhöhung, 
[1:10] der reiche dagegen denke an seine Erniedrigung; denn wie des Grases Blume wird er vergehen. 
[1:11] Die Sonne geht auf mit ihrer Glut und versengt das Gras; dann fällt seine Blume ab, und ihre Schönheit ist dahin. So wird auch der Reiche in all seinem Treiben verwelken. 
[1:12] Heil dem Mann, der in Anfechtung ausharrt! Denn hat er sich bewährt, dann soll er das (ewige) Leben empfangen als Siegeskranz, den der Herr verheißen hat denen, die ihn lieben. 
[1:13] Keiner, der versucht wird, behaupte: "Ich werde von Gott versucht." Denn Gott, dem alles Böse fremd ist, versucht niemand (zum Bösen). 
[1:14] Sondern ein jeder wird versucht, indem er von seiner eigenen Lust (zum Bösen) gereizt und verlockt wird. 
[1:15] Wenn dann die Lust empfangen hat, so gebiert sie die Sünde. Ist aber die Sünde völlig ausgereift, so gebiert sie den Tod. 
[1:16] Laßt euch also nicht täuschen, meine geliebten Brüder! 
[1:17] Jede vortreffliche Gabe und jede vollkommene Schenkung kommt von oben herab, von dem Vater der Lichter. Bei ihm gibt's keine Veränderung, keinen Wechsel von Licht und Schatten. 
[1:18] Er hat uns nach dem Ratschluß seines Willens durch das Wort der Wahrheit gezeugt, damit wir gleichsam eine Erstlingsschar unter seinen Geschöpfen wären. 
[1:19] Das wißt ihr, meine geliebten Brüder. Darum sei jeder schnell bereit zum Hören, langsam zum Reden, (und namentlich) langsam zum Zorn. 
[1:20] Denn ein zorniger Mensch tut nicht, was Gott gefällt. 
[1:21] So trennt euch nun von allem unsauberen Wesen und dem letzten Überrest der Bosheit und nehmt das Wort, das euch eingepflanzt werden soll, mit Sanftmut auf! Denn es hat die Kraft, eure Seelen zu erretten. 
[1:22] Werdet Täter des Wortes und beschränkt euch nicht aufs Hören: sonst betrügt ihr euch selbst! 
[1:23] Denn wer nur ein Hörer des Wortes ist, aber kein Täter, der gleicht dem Mann, der sein Äußeres im Spiegel beschaut. 
[1:24] Er betrachtet sich wohl, aber er geht weg und vergißt sofort wieder, wie er ausgesehen hat. 
[1:25] Wer aber beharrlich in das vollkommene Gesetz der Freiheit blickt und dabei nicht ein vergeßlicher Hörer, sondern ein wirklicher Täter ist, ein solcher Mensch wird sich glücklich fühlen bei seinem Tun. 
[1:26] Meint einer, er diene Gott, und hält dabei seine Zunge nicht im Zaum, sondern betrügt sein Herz, des Gottesdienst hat keinen Wert. 
[1:27] Ein in Gottes, des Vaters, Augen reiner und fleckenloser Gottesdienst ist es, wenn man Witwen und Waisen in ihrer Trübsal besucht und sich von der Welt unbefleckt bewahrt. 
[2:1] Meine Brüder, seid frei von Menschengefälligkeit, wenn ihr wirklich den Glauben habt, den unser Herr Jesus Christus, der zur Herrlichkeit erhoben ist, bewiesen hat und wirkt. 
[2:2] Da tritt zum Beispiel in eure (gottesdienstliche) Versammlung ein Mann, geschmückt mit goldenem Ring und prächtigem Gewand, und ihm folgt ein Armer in unsauberem Kleid. 
[2:3] Staunt ihr nun den an, der das prächtige Gewand trägt, und sagt zu ihm: "Nimm du diesen Ehrenplatz!", während ihr zu dem Armen sprecht: "Du kannst dort stehen!" — oder auch: "Setze dich unten an meinen Fußschemel!" —, 
[2:4] kommt ihr da nicht mit euch selbst in Widerspruch und zeigt euch als Richter von verwerflicher Sinnesart? 
[2:5] Merkt auf, geliebte Brüder: Hat Gott nicht solche, die die Welt arm nennt, auserwählt, damit sie reich seien im Glauben und das Königreich ererben, das er denen verheißen hat, die ihn lieben? 
[2:6] Ihr aber habt den Armen verächtlich behandelt! Sind es nicht gerade die Reichen, die euch Gewalt antun und euch vor die Gerichte schleppen? 
[2:7] Sind sie es nicht, die den herrlichen Namen, nach dem ihr benannt worden seid, verlästern? 
[2:8] Gewiß, wenn ihr (ohne einen Unterschied zu machen) das königliche Gebot erfüllt, das zum Ausdruck kommt in dem Schriftwort: Du sollst deinen Nächsten lieben wie dich selbst, so tut ihr recht. 
[2:9] Handelt ihr aber nach Menschengunst, so tut ihr Sünde, und das Gesetz verurteilt euch als Übertreter. 
[2:10] Wer nämlich das ganze Gesetz erfüllt, aber gegen ein einziges Gebot verstößt, der hat damit alle Gebote übertreten. 
[2:11] Denn ganz derselbe, der gesagt hat: "Du sollst nicht ehebrechen!", hat auch gesprochen: "Du sollst nicht morden!" Bist du nun zwar kein Ehebrecher, aber ein Mörder, so bist du ein Gesetzesübertreter. 
[2:12] Denkt bei all euerm Reden und Handeln daran, daß ihr einst durch ein Gesetz der Freiheit gerichtet werden sollt. 
[2:13] Denn das Gericht trifft erbarmungslos den, der keine Barmherzigkeit geübt hat. Der Barmherzige dagegen braucht kein Gericht zu fürchten. 
[2:14] Was nützt es, meine Brüder, wenn einer behauptet, er habe Glauben, und kann dabei doch keine Werke aufweisen? 
[2:15] Kann ihn denn ein solcher Glaube retten? Denkt euch: Ein Bruder oder eine Schwester hat keine Kleidung, und es fehlt ihnen am täglichen Brot. 
[2:16] Spräche nun einer von euch zu ihnen: "Geht hin in Frieden, wärmt euch und eßt euch satt!", aber ihr gäbt ihnen nicht, was sie zum Leben nötig haben, — was nützt es ihnen? 
[2:17] Ebenso ist's auch mit dem Glauben: hat er keine Werke aufzuweisen, dann ist er in sich selber tot. 
[2:18] Man könnte nun (jemand, der sich auf einen Glauben ohne Werke verläßt) dies erwidern: "Du hast Glauben (wie du sagst), und ich habe (neben dem Glauben auch noch) Werke aufzuweisen. Zeig mir deinen Glauben, der ohne Werke ist, dann will ich dir aus meinen Werken meinen Glauben zeigen! 
[2:19] Du glaubst: es gibt nur einen Gott? Sehr schön! Aber das glauben auch die bösen Geister, und trotzdem zittern sie. 
[2:20] Willst du gedankenloser Mensch nun einsehen, daß ein Glaube ohne Werke nutzlos ist, (so frage dich:) 
[2:21] Ist unser Vater Abraham nicht durch Werke gerechtfertigt worden? Er hat ja seinen Sohn Isaak auf dem Opferaltar dargebracht. 
[2:22] Da siehst du: sein Glaube ging mit seinen Werken Hand in Hand, und erst durch seine Werke ist sein Glaube vollkommen geworden. 
[2:23] So hat sich das Schriftwort erfüllt: Abraham glaubte Gott, und das ward ihm zur Gerechtigkeit gerechnet, und er wurde Gottes Freund genannt." 
[2:24] Ihr seht also: der Mensch wird durch Werke gerechtfertigt, und nicht durch Glauben allein. 
[2:25] Ist nicht ebenso auch die Dirne Rahab durch Werke gerechtfertigt worden? Sie hat ja die Kundschafter bei sich aufgenommen und sie nachher auf einem anderen Weg entkommen lassen. 
[2:26] Geradeso wie der Leib ohne Geist tot ist, ebenso ist auch der Glaube ohne Werke tot. 
[3:1] Tretet nicht so zahlreich als Lehrer auf, meine Brüder, und bedenkt, daß wir (Lehrer) eine größere Verantwortung haben (als andere)! 
[3:2] Wir alle fehlen ja in vielen Stücken. Wer sich beim Reden nicht versündigt, der ist ein geistlich reifer Mann und vermag (außer der Zunge) auch den ganzen Leib im Zaum zu halten. 
[3:3] Legen wir den Pferden, um sie uns gehorsam zu machen, die Zügel ins Maul, so lenken wir dadurch auch ihren ganzen Leib. 
[3:4] Ja die größten und von heftigen Winden bewegten Schiffe lenkt der Steuermann mit einem ganz kleinen Ruder, wohin er will. 
[3:5] So ist auch die Zunge nur ein kleines Glied; und wie großprahlerisch tritt sie auf! Welch großen Wald vermag ein kleines Feuer anzuzünden! 
[3:6] Auch die Zunge ist ein Feuer. Die Zunge gibt sich her zum Schmuck der Gerechtigkeit. Sie ist's, die unseren Gliedern den ganzen Leib befleckt und sogar den Weltkreis in Flammen setzt, während sie selbst von der Hölle entzündet wird. 
[3:7] Die Kraft aller möglichen Geschöpfe — der vierfüßigen Tiere und Vögel, der Schlangen und der Fische — kann der Mensch mit seiner Kraft zähmen und hat sie auch gezähmt. 
[3:8] Die Zunge aber vermag kein Mensch zu zähmen: sie ist ein unstetes Übel, voll tödlichen Giftes. 
[3:9] Mit ihr preisen wir den Herrn und Vater, und mit ihr fluchen wir den Menschen, die doch nach Gottes Bild geschaffen sind. 
[3:10] So gehen aus demselben Mund Segen und Fluch hervor. Das, meine Brüder, sollte nicht so sein. 
[3:11] Läßt denn eine Quelle aus derselben Mündung süßes und bitteres Wasser sprudeln? 
[3:12] Kann ein Feigenbaum, meine Brüder, Oliven tragen oder ein Weinstock Feigen? Ebensowenig kann eine Salzquelle süßes Wasser geben. 
[3:13] Wer unter euch ist weise und verständig? Der zeige durch seinen guten Wandel und handle in jener Sanftmut, die aus der Weisheit fließt! 
[3:14] Habt ihr aber bitteren Neid und Zank in euerm Herzen, so rühmt euch nur nicht (eurer Weisheit)! Denn das widerspräche der Wahrheit, und ihr würdet als Lügner erfunden. 
[3:15] Solche Weisheit kommt wahrlich nicht von oben; nein, sie ist irdisch, böse, ja teuflisch. 
[3:16] Denn wo Neid und Hader herrschen, da finden sich auch Unordnung und alle möglichen schlimmen Händel. 
[3:17] Die Weisheit aber, die von oben stammt, ist vor allem lauter, dann friedfertig, nachgiebig, folgsam, voll Erbarmen und reich an guten Früchten, frei von Argwohn und Heuchelei. 
[3:18] Der Same, der die Frucht der Gerechtigkeit hervorbringt, wird von denen, die Frieden stiften, mit friedfertigem Sinn ausgestreut. 
[4:1] Woher kommen die Kämpfe und Streitigkeiten (über mein und dein) unter euch? Kommen sie nicht aus euern (auf irdischen Reichtum gerichteten) Lüsten, die in euern Gliedern (mit euerm besseren Ich) im Streit sind? 
[4:2] Ihr seid begehrlich (nach den Gütern dieser Welt) und bekommt sie doch nicht. Ihr haßt und neidet einander bis auf den Tod, aber damit erreicht ihr eure Wünsche nicht. Ihr lebt in offenem Kampf und Krieg und erlangt doch nichts, weil ihr nicht betet. 
[4:3] Oder: ihr betet und empfangt doch nichts, weil ihr in böser Absicht betet: ihr wollt ja (die irdischen Güter, um die ihr bittet) in euern Lüsten vergeuden. 
[4:4] Ihr treulosen Gemeinden, die ihr den Bund mit Gott gebrochen habt, wißt ihr denn nicht, daß die Freundschaft mit der Welt Feindschaft ist gegen Gott? Wer also der Welt Freund sein will, der macht sich zu Gottes Feind. 
[4:5] Oder meint ihr, die Worte der Schrift hätten nichts zu bedeuten? Der Geist, den er in uns hat Wohnung nehmen lassen, begehrt eifersüchtig (unser ganzes Herz). 
[4:6] Um so größer aber ist die Gnade, die er gibt. Deshalb heißt es: Gott widersteht den Hoffärtigen, aber den Demütigen gibt er Gnade. 
[4:7] Darum unterwerft euch Gott (in Demut)! Widersteht dem Teufel, so wird er von euch fliehen! 
[4:8] Naht euch Gott, so wird er sich euch nahen! Reinigt eure Hände, ihr Sünder, und heiligt eure Herzen, ihr Unentschiedenen! 
[4:9] Fühlt euer Elend und trauert mit Tränen! Euer Lachen wandle sich in Leid und eure Freude in Betrübnis! 
[4:10] Ja demütigt euch vor dem Herrn, so wird er euch erhöhen! 
[4:11] Redet einander nichts Böses nach, ihr Brüder! Wer seinem Bruder Böses nachredet oder seinen Bruder richtet, der mißbraucht das Gesetz und stellt sich über das Gesetz. Stellst du dich aber über das Gesetz, so bist du nicht ein Täter des Gesetzes, sondern du wirfst dich zum Richter auf. 
[4:12] Doch nur einer ist Gesetzgeber und Richter: er, der die Macht hat, zu erretten und zu verderben. Wie kommst du aber dazu, über deinen Nächsten zu Gericht zu sitzen? 
[4:13] Jetzt ein Wort an euch, die ihr sagt: "Heute oder morgen wollen wir in die und die Stadt gehen, dort ein Jahr bleiben, Geschäfte machen und Geld verdienen" 
[4:14] - und ihr wißt nicht einmal, was der morgende Tag bringt. Was ist denn euer Leben? Nur ein Dunst, der eine Weile sichtbar ist und dann verschwindet. — 
[4:15] Statt dessen solltet ihr sagen: "Wenn es des Herrn Wille ist, so werden wir leben und dies oder jenes tun." 
[4:16] Nun aber prahlt ihr mit euern guten Tagen. All dies Prahlen ist verwerflich. 
[4:17] Wer nun das Gute kennt, das er zu tun hat, und es unterläßt, dem wird es als Sünde angerechnet. 
[5:1] Jetzt ein Wort an euch, ihr Reichen: Weint und wehklagt ob der Leiden, die über euch kommen sollen! 
[5:2] Euer Reichtum ist vermodert, und eure Kleider sind von Motten zernagt. 
[5:3] Euer Gold und Silber ist mit Rost überzogen, und ihr Rost wird euch ein Zeugnis sein und euer Fleisch verzehren wie Feuer. Ihr habt Schätze aufgehäuft — noch dazu in den letzten Tagen! 
[5:4] Aber der Lohn, um den ihr die Arbeiter, die eure Felder gemäht, betrogen habt, der schreit (zum Himmel), und die Klagerufe der Schnitter sind zu den Ohren des Herrn der Heerscharen gedrungen. 
[5:5] Ihr habt auf Erden geschwelgt und gepraßt; wie Tiere am Schlachttag seid ihr nach Genüssen gierig gewesen. 
[5:6] Verurteilt und hingemordet habt ihr den Gerechten, der eurer Willkür wehrlos preisgegeben war! 
[5:7] Harrt denn geduldig aus, ihr Brüder, bis auf die Wiederkunft des Herrn! Ihr wißt: der Landmann wartet auf die köstliche Frucht der Erde und harrt in Geduld, bis sie Herbstregen und Frühlingsregen empfängt. 
[5:8] So harrt auch ihr in Geduld, stärkt eure Herzen; denn die Wiederkunft des Herrn ist nahe! 
[5:9] Seufzt nicht widereinander, Brüder, damit ihr nicht gerichtet werdet (wegen eurer Ungeduld)! Bedenkt: der Richter steht schon vor der Tür! 
[5:10] Zum Vorbild im Leiden und in der Geduld nehmt euch, Brüder, die Propheten, die im Namen des Herrn geredet hatten! 
[5:11] Die Dulder preisen wir selig. Wie Hiob geduldig ausharrte, das habt ihr vernommen, und aus dem (herrlichen) Ende, das der Herr (seinen Leiden) bereitet hat, erkennt man deutlich, daß der Herr reich ist an Mitleid und Erbarmen. 
[5:12] Vor allem, meine Brüder, schwört nicht, weder bei dem Himmel noch bei der Erde noch mit irgendeinem anderen Schwur! Euer Ja sei einfach Ja, und euer Nein sei einfach Nein, damit ihr nicht (durch leichtfertiges Schwören) einem (göttlichen) Gericht verfallt! 
[5:13] Ist jemand unter euch bekümmert, der bete! Ist einer frohes Mutes, der singe Loblieder! 
[5:14] Ist jemand unter euch krank, der lasse die Ältesten der Gemeinde rufen! Die sollen dann über ihn beten und ihn mit Öl salben in dem Namen des Herrn. 
[5:15] Das im Glauben dargebrachte Gebet wird den Kranken erretten, und der Herr wird ihn aufrichten (von seiner Krankheit). Und hat er Sünden begangen, so sollen sie ihm vergeben werden. 
[5:16] So bekennt denn einander eure Sünden und betet füreinander, damit ihr Heilung findet! Denn das inständige Gebet eines Gerechten hat große Kraft. 
[5:17] Elia war ein Mensch ganz ebenso wie wir, und er betete ernstlich, es möge nicht regnen. Und wirklich, es regnete drei Jahre und sechs Monate nicht auf Erden. 
[5:18] Dann betete er abermals. Da gab der Himmel wieder Regen, und die Erde brachte ihre Frucht hervor. 
[5:19] Meine Brüder, irrt einer unter euch von dem Weg der Wahrheit ab, und es führt ihn jemand wieder zurück, 
[5:20] so wißt: Wer einen Sünder von seinem Irrweg zurückbringt, der rettet des Sünders Seele vom Tod und gewinnt ihm Vergebung für viele Sünden. 

### I Peter

[1:1] Petrus, ein Apostel Jesu Christi, begrüßt die Fremdlinge, die in Pontus, Galatien, Kappadozien, Asien und Bithynien in der Zerstreuung leben, 
[1:2] und die nach der Vorherbestimmung Gottes des Vaters auserwählt sind, um, von dem Geist geheiligt, zum Gehorsam zu kommen und mit dem Blut Jesu Christi besprengt zu werden. Gnade und Friede werde euch reichlich zuteil! 
[1:3] Gepriesen sei der Gott und Vater unseres Herrn Jesus Christus! Er hat uns nach seinem großen Erbarmen durch die Auferstehung Jesu Christi von den Toten wiedergeboren zu einer lebendigen Hoffnung: 
[1:4] zu einem unvergänglichen, unbefleckten und unverwelklichen Erbe. Das wird in sicherer Hut im Himmel aufgehoben 
[1:5] für euch, die ihr in Gottes Kraft durch den Glauben für ein Heil bewahrt werdet, das sich nun bald am Ende der Tage offenbaren soll. 
[1:6] Darüber freut ihr euch, obwohl ihr jetzt noch eine kurze Zeit, wenn es so sein soll, durch mancherlei Prüfungen Traurigkeit erfahren müßt. 
[1:7] Dadurch soll sich euer Glaube bewähren und köstlicher erfunden werden als vergängliches Gold, das die Feuerprobe besteht. Das wird euch Lob, Ruhm und Ehre bringen bei der Offenbarung Jesu Christi. 
[1:8] Den liebt ihr, ohne ihn von Angesicht zu kennen; an den glaubt ihr, ohne ihn jetzt zu sehen. Dem jauchzt ihr entgegen mit unbeschreiblicher, himmlischer Freude, 
[1:9] weil ihr als Frucht eures Glaubens das Seelenheil davontragt. 
[1:10] Diesem Heil haben die Propheten, die von der euch bestimmten Gnade geweissagt haben, eifrig nachgeforscht. 
[1:11] Sie suchten auszuspüren, auf welche Zeit und Ereignisse der in ihnen wirkende Geist Christi hinweise, als er ihnen vorherbezeugte die Leiden, die Christus dulden, und die Stufen der Herrlichkeit, zu denen er danach gelangen sollte. 
[1:12] Ihnen wurde offenbart, daß sie nicht sich selbst, sondern euch diese Botschaft zu bringen hätten. Und euch ist sie jetzt verkündigt worden durch die, die euch in der Kraft des vom Himmel her gesandten Heiligen Geistes die Frohe Botschaft gebracht haben. In deren Geheimnisse möchten selbst die Engel in tiefer Ehrfurcht schauen. 
[1:13] Umgürtet denn die Lenden eures Sinnes, seid völlig nüchtern und richtet eure Hoffnung auf die Gnade, die ihr bei Jesu Christi Offenbarung empfangen sollt! 
[1:14] Weil der Gehorsam eure Freude ist, so fallt nicht zurück in die Begierden, die euch einst beherrschten, als ihr noch in Unwissenheit dahinlebtet! 
[1:15] Sondern, wie der heilig ist, der euch berufen hat, so werdet auch ihr heilig in euerm ganzen Wandel! 
[1:16] Denn es steht geschrieben: Ihr sollt heilig sein, denn ich bin heilig. 
[1:17] Und wenn ihr den als Vater anruft, der unparteiisch jedem nach seinem Tun das Urteil spricht, dann wandelt auch in heiliger Scheu vor ihm, solange ihr noch hier auf Erden pilgert! 
[1:18] Denkt daran: nicht mit vergänglichen Dingen, mit Silber oder Gold, seid ihr aus euerm nichtigen, von den Vätern ererbten Aufenthaltsort losgekauft worden, 
[1:19] sondern mit einem kostbaren Blut, ähnlich dem eines fehllosen und unbefleckten Lammes. 
[1:20] Dies Lamm ist Christus, der schon vor Grundlegung der Welt als solches ausersehen, aber erst jetzt an der Zeiten Ende erschienen ist zu euerm Heil. 
[1:21] Durch ihn glaubt ihr an Gott, der ihn von den Toten auferweckt und ihm Herrlichkeit verliehen hat, so daß ihr nun auf Gott vertraut und auf ihn hofft. 
[1:22] Weil ihr eure Seelen durch den Gehorsam gegen die Wahrheit gereinigt habt, so daß ihr ungeheuchelte Bruderliebe beweisen könnt, so liebt einander aus reinem Herzen und mit ganzer Kraft! 
[1:23] Ihr seid ja nicht aus vergänglichem, sondern aus unvergänglichem Samen wiedergeboren durch Gottes lebendiges, ewig bleibendes Wort. 
[1:24] Denn: Alles Fleisch ist wie Gras, und alle seine Herrlichkeit ist wie des Feldes Blume. Das Gras verdorrt, die Blume fällt ab; 
[1:25] das Wort des Herrn aber bleibt in Ewigkeit. Und dieses Wort ist euch verkündigt worden in der Heilsbotschaft. 
[2:1] So legt nun alle Bosheit und alle Falschheit, jede Art von Heuchelei und Neid und alle Verleumdung von euch ab! 
[2:2] Gleich neugeborenen Kindlein seid begierig nach der unverfälschten Geistesmilch des Wortes! Dadurch sollt ihr hinanwachsen zur Errettung, 
[2:3] wenn ihr wirklich geschmeckt habt, daß der Herr gütig ist. 
[2:4] Kommt zu ihm, dem lebendigen Stein, der zwar von den Menschen verworfen, aber in Gottes Augen auserwählt und köstlich ist! 
[2:5] Laßt euch (auf diesem Grundstein) auch selbst als lebendige Steine erbauen zu einem geistlichen Haus! Dann seid ihr auch eine heilige Priesterschaft und fähig, geistliche Opfer darzubringen, die Gott durch Jesus Christus wohlgefällig sind. 
[2:6] Deshalb heißt es in der Schrift: Sieh, ich lege in Zion einen auserwählten, köstlichen Eckstein; wer auf ihn vertraut, soll nicht zuschanden werden. 
[2:7] Euch also, die ihr (auf ihn) vertraut, wird das köstliche Gut (des Ecksteins) zuteil. Den Ungläubigen aber gilt das Wort: Der Stein, den die Bauleute verworfen haben, der ist zum Eckstein geworden; 
[2:8] und er ist zugleich ein Stein, woran sie sich stoßen, und ein Fels, an dem sie zu Fall kommen. In ihrem Ungehorsam nehmen sie Anstoß an dem Wort, und dazu sind sie auch bestimmt. 
[2:9] Ihr aber seid ein auserwähltes Geschlecht, eine königliche Priesterschaft, ein heiliges Volk, ein Volk des Eigentums, damit ihr die herrlichen Eigenschaften dessen verkündigt, der euch aus der Finsternis zu seinem wunderbaren Licht berufen hat. 
[2:10] Einst wart ihr kein Volk, nun aber seid ihr Gottes Volk. Einst wart ihr nicht in Gnaden, nun aber seid ihr begnadigt worden. 
[2:11] Geliebte, da ihr (hier auf Erden) Fremdlinge und Pilger seid, so ermahne ich euch: Haltet euch frei von fleischlichen Lüsten, die wider die Seele streiten! 
[2:12] Führt einen guten Wandel unter den Heiden! Denn sie, die euch jetzt als Verbrecher schmähen, sollen durch eure guten Werke zu einer besseren Einsicht kommen und Gott preisen an dem Tag, da er sie mit seiner Gnade heimsuchen wird. 
[2:13] Fügt euch um des Herrn willen in jede Ordnung, die zum Wohl der Menschen dient! Gehorcht dem Kaiser als dem Oberherrn 
[2:14] und seinen Statthaltern als denen, die von ihm gesandt werden, um die Verbrecher zu strafen, allen aber, die Gutes tun, lobende Anerkennung zu spenden. 
[2:15] Denn das ist Gottes Wille, daß ihr durch gutes Verhalten die aus Unwissenheit entspringenden Verleumdungen der törichten Menschen zum Schweigen bringt. 
[2:16] Ihr seid frei. Doch hütet euch, mit eurer Freiheit böses Tun zu decken! Zeigt euch vielmehr als Gottes Knechte! 
[2:17] Habt vor allen Achtung! Liebt die Brüder! Fürchtet Gott! Ehrt den Kaiser! 
[2:18] Ihr Sklaven, gehorcht euren Herren mit aller gebührenden Ehrfurcht, und zwar nicht nur den guten und milden, sondern auch den verkehrten! 
[2:19] Denn gerade das ist Gott gefällig, wenn einer ihm zuliebe Trübsal auf sich nimmt, obwohl er unschuldig leidet. 
[2:20] Denn was ist Rühmliches dabei, wenn ihr Böses tut und dafür Schläge hinnehmen müßt? Habt ihr aber trotz eures guten Verhaltens zu leiden und beweist ihr dabei Geduld, so ist das wohlgefällig in Gottes Augen. 
[2:21] Zu solchem Leiden seid ihr berufen. Hat doch auch Christus zu euerm Heil gelitten und euch dadurch ein Vorbild hinterlassen, damit ihr seinen Fußtapfen nachfolgt. 
[2:22] Er hat keine Sünde getan, und in seinem Mund ward kein Trug entdeckt. 
[2:23] Er schalt nicht wieder, wenn er gescholten wurde; in seinem Leiden stieß er keine Drohungen aus; sondern er gab sich in die Hände dessen, der gerecht richtet. 
[2:24] Er hat unsere Sünden auf sich genommen und sie an seinem Leib auf das Kreuzesholz hinaufgetragen, damit wir, den Sünden abgestorben, der Gerechtigkeit leben; durch seine Striemen seid ihr geheilt worden. 
[2:25] Denn ihr gingt einst wie Schafe in die Irre; nun aber habt ihr den Irrweg verlassen und euch gewandt zu dem Hirten und Wächter eurer Seelen. 
[3:1] Auch ihr Frauen, seid euern Männern untertan, damit selbst solche Männer, die dem Wort ungehorsam sind, durch den Wandel ihrer Frauen ohne Unterweisung gewonnen werden, 
[3:2] wenn sie sehen, wie rein ihr wandelt und (wie ihr euch dabei) in Ehrfurcht (euern Männern) unterordnet. 
[3:3] Die Frauen sollen sich nicht äußerlich putzen: sich nicht künstlich die Haare flechten, kein Goldgeschmeide anlegen und keine köstlichen Kleider tragen; 
[3:4] sondern ihr Schmuck sei der verborgene Mensch, der seinen Sitz im Herzen hat und sich in einem sanften, stillen Geist zeigt. Ein solcher Schmuck hat unvergänglichen Wert und ist köstlich in Gottes Augen. 
[3:5] Ebenso haben sich ja auch einst die heiligen Frauen geschmückt, die ihre Hoffnung auf Gott setzten und sich ihren Männern unterordneten. 
[3:6] So war Sara dem Abraham gehorsam und nannte ihn Herr. Ihre Töchter seid ihr, wenn ihr gutes tut und euch durch keine Furcht in der Erfüllung eurer Pflicht beirren laßt. 
[3:7] Ihr Männer desgleichen: geht mit euern Frauen verständig um; sie sind ja das schwächere Geschlecht! Behandelt sie mit Achtung — denn sie sind auch Miterben der Gnadengabe des (ewigen) Lebens —, sonst verschließt ihr euern Gebeten den Weg (zum Thron Gottes)! 
[3:8] Endlich: seid alle eines Sinnes, habt Mitgefühl, zeigt Bruderliebe, seid barmherzig und demütig! 
[3:9] Vergeltet nicht Böses mit Bösem oder Scheltwort mit Scheltwort; im Gegenteil: segnet! Ihr seid ja dazu berufen, Segen zu ererben. 
[3:10] Denn: Wer sich des Lebens freuen will und gute Tage sehen, der halte seine Zunge fern vom Bösen und seine Lippen von den Lügenreden. 
[3:11] Er wende sich vom Bösen ab und tue Gutes, er suche Frieden und jage ihm nach! 
[3:12] Denn des Herrn Augen schauen (mit Wohlgefallen) auf die Gerechten, und seine Ohren hören ihr Gebet. Des Herrn Antlitz aber blickt (im Zorn) auf die Übeltäter. 
[3:13] Wer könnte euch schaden, wenn ihr dem Guten nachstrebt? 
[3:14] Ja selbst dann, wenn ihr um der Gerechtigkeit willen leiden müßt, seid ihr selig zu preisen. Fürchtet euch nicht wie eure Widersacher und erschreckt nicht! 
[3:15] Habt vielmehr vor dem Herrn Christus in euern Herzen heilige Ehrfurcht! Seid auch stets bereit, jedem Antwort zu geben, der über die Hoffnung, die in euch lebt, Rechenschaft von euch fordert! 
[3:16] Antwortet aber mit Sanftmut und Ehrfurcht! Habt dabei ein gutes Gewissen, damit die, die euern guten Wandel in der Nachfolge Christi schmähen, mit ihren Verleumdungen zuschanden werden! 
[3:17] Denn besser ist's, ihr leidet, wenn es Gottes Wille ist, wegen guter Taten, als weil ihr Böses tut. 
[3:18] Auch Christus hat ja ein für allemal um der Sünden willen für uns den Tod erlitten — der Gerechte für die Ungerechten —, damit er uns in die Gemeinschaft Gottes führe. Und zwar ist er getötet worden dem Fleisch nach, aber lebendiggemacht dem Geist nach. 
[3:19] Im Geist ist er dann hingegangen und hat den Geistern im Gefängnis (des Totenreichs) gepredigt. 
[3:20] Die waren einst ungehorsam, als Gottes Langmut in den Tagen Noahs während des Baues der Arche geduldig (auf die Bekehrung der Menschen) wartete. In dieser Arche wurden nur wenige, im ganzen acht Seelen, durch das Wasser am Leben erhalten. 
[3:21] Das Gegenbild dieses Wassers, die Taufe, bringt euch auch jetzt Errettung. Da wird jedoch keine äußere Unreinigkeit entfernt, sondern ihr legt Gott das Gelübde ab, mit reinem Gewissen vor ihm zu wandeln in der Kraft der Auferstehung Jesu Christi. 
[3:22] Der sitzt nun nach seinem Eingang in den Himmel zur Rechten Gottes, und ihm gehorchen dort die Gewalten und Mächte der Engelwelt. 
[4:1] Da nun Christus zu unserem Heil dem Fleisch nach gelitten hat, so wappnet auch ihr euch mit derselben Gesinnung! — Denn wer dem Fleisch nach gelitten hat, der hat mit der Sünde nichts mehr zu schaffen —. 
[4:2] Ihr sollt ja die noch übrige Zeit eures irdischen Lebens nicht mehr nach der Menschen Lüsten, sondern nach Gottes Willen zubringen. 
[4:3] Ihr habt doch in den vergangenen Tagen wahrlich Zeit genug damit vergeudet, den heidnischen Leidenschaften zu frönen durch einen Wandel in Ausschweifungen, Lüsten, Trunksucht, Schmausereien, Zechgelagen und schändlichem Götzendienst. 
[4:4] Das befremdet die Leute nun, daß ihr jetzt nicht mit ihnen in demselben Strom des Lasters schwimmt, und deshalb lästern sie euch. 
[4:5] Dafür aber sollen sie Rechenschaft geben dem, der bereitsteht, Lebendige und Tote zu richten. 
[4:6] Darum ist ja auch Toten die Heilsbotschaft verkündigt worden, daß sie, die nach Menschenlos am Fleisch gerichtet waren, im Geist nach Gottes Erbarmen lebten. 
[4:7] Das Ende aller Dinge steht vor der Tür. Darum seid mäßig und nüchtern, damit ihr beten könnt! 
[4:8] Vor allem habt einander herzlich lieb, denn die Liebe deckt eine Menge Sünden zu! 
[4:9] Seid gastfrei gegeneinander ohne Murren! 
[4:10] Dient einander, ein jeder mit der Gabe, die er empfangen hat! So ziemt es sich für gute Haushalter der mannigfachen Gnade, die Gott schenkt. 
[4:11] Redet jemand, so seien seine Worte wie Aussprüche Gottes! Dient jemand, der richte sein Werk aus in der Kraft, die Gott verleiht! So soll in allen Gott verherrlicht werden durch Jesus Christus. Ihm gebührt die Herrlichkeit und Macht in alle Ewigkeit. Amen. 
[4:12] Geliebte, seid nicht erstaunt über die Feuerglut (der Leiden), die jetzt zu eurer Läuterung unter euch brennt. Damit widerfährt euch nichts Absonderliches. 
[4:13] Im Gegenteil; je mehr ihr an den Leiden Christi teilnehmt, desto größer sei eure Freude! Dann könnt ihr auch bei der Offenbarung seiner Herrlichkeit jauchzen und jubeln. 
[4:14] Schmäht man euch, weil ihr Christi Namen tragt, so seid ihr selig zu preisen. Denn der Geist, der euch die Herrlichkeit verbürgt und Kraft verleiht — Gottes Geist —, der ruht auf euch. 
[4:15] Niemand unter euch darf leiden, weil er etwa mordet, stiehlt oder sich sonst vergeht, auch nicht, weil er sich unbefugt in fremde Angelegenheiten mischt. 
[4:16] Muß aber jemand leiden, weil er ein Christ ist, so braucht er sich nicht zu schämen; er preise vielmehr Gott (voll Dank) dafür, daß er seinen Namen trägt. 
[4:17] Denn die Zeit ist da, da das Gericht seinen Anfang nimmt bei dem Haus Gottes. Fängt's aber an bei uns, was für ein Ende müssen dann die nehmen, die Gottes Heilsbotschaft nicht glauben wollen? 
[4:18] Und wird der Gerechte nur mit genauer Not errettet, wo wird da der Gottlose und Sünder bleiben? 
[4:19] So mögen denn alle, die nach Gottes Willen leiden, dem Schutz des treuen Schöpfers ihre Seelen anbefehlen, indem sie Gutes tun. 
[5:1] Ich richte nun meine Ermahnung an die Ältesten, die unter euch arbeiten — ich bin ein Ältester wie sie; ich habe die Leiden Christi als Augenzeuge gesehen und soll auch teil empfangen an der Herrlichkeit, die sich offenbaren wird —: 
[5:2] Weidet die euch anbefohlene Herde Gottes — nicht aus Zwang, sondern aus innerem Herzensdrang, wie es Gott gefällt; nicht aus schnöder Gewinnsucht, sondern mit Lust und Liebe! 
[5:3] Tretet nicht als Herren auf in euern Gemeinden, sondern werdet Vorbilder der Herde! 
[5:4] Dann werdet ihr bei der Erscheinung des Oberhirten als Ehrenkranz aus unverwelklichen Blumen die Herrlichkeit empfangen. 
[5:5] Ebenso ihr jüngeren Leute: gehorcht euern Ältesten! Ihr alle insgesamt, tragt im Verkehr miteinander den Sklavenschurz der Demut. Denn: Gott widersteht den Stolzen, den Demütigen aber gibt er Gnade. 
[5:6] So demütigt euch denn unter Gottes gewaltige Hand, damit er euch erhöhe, wenn die rechte Stunde gekommen ist! 
[5:7] Werft alle eure Sorge auf ihn, denn er nimmt sich euer an! 
[5:8] Seid nüchtern und wachsam! Euer Widersacher, der Teufel, geht umher wie ein brüllender Löwe und sucht, wen er verschlinge. 
[5:9] Dem widersteht in Glaubensfestigkeit und denkt daran, daß eure Brüder in der ganzen Welt dieselben Leiden zu erdulden haben! 
[5:10] Gott aber, der Spender aller Gnade, der euch in Christi Jesu Gemeinschaft dazu berufen hat, nach einer kurzen Leidenszeit in seine ewige Herrlichkeit einzugehen, der wir euch vollbereiten, stärken, kräftigen und festgründen. 
[5:11] Sein ist die Herrlichkeit und Macht in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[5:12] Durch Silvanus, den treuen Bruder, schreibe ich euch diesen Brief; mir scheint, er ist nur kurz. Ich erinnere und bezeuge euch darin: die rechte Gnade Gottes ist euch zuteil geworden. Darin steht fest! 
[5:13] Die Miterwählte in Babylon und mein Sohn Markus lassen euch grüßen. 
[5:14] Grüßt einander mit dem Kuß der Liebe! Friede sei mit euch allen, die ihr in Christi Gemeinschaft steht! 

### II Peter

[1:1] Symeon Petrus, ein Knecht und Apostel Jesu Christi, entbietet denen seinen Gruß, die durch die Gerechtigkeit unseres Gottes und Erretters Jesus Christus denselben köstlichen Glauben empfangen haben wie wir. 
[1:2] Gnade und Friede werde euch reichlich zuteil durch die Erkenntnis Gottes und Jesu, unseres Herrn! 
[1:3] Er hat uns in seiner göttlichen Macht alles geschenkt, was zum wahren Leben und zur rechten Frömmigkeit nötig ist. Denn er hat uns ihn erkennen lassen, der uns berufen hat durch seine Herrlichkeit und Hoheit. 
[1:4] Die haben ihn auch dazu bewogen, uns die wertvollsten und köstlichsten Verheißungen zu schenken, die euch die Bürgschaft geben, daß ihr göttlicher Art teilhaftig werden sollt, wenn ihr der Lust und Verführung der Welt entronnen seid. 
[1:5] Darum zeigt, soviel an euch ist, in jeder Hinsicht Eifer und beweist bei euerm Glauben auch Tugend, bei der Tugend Erkenntnis, 
[1:6] bei der Erkenntnis Selbstbeherrschung, bei der Selbstbeherrschung Ausdauer, bei der Ausdauer Frömmigkeit, 
[1:7] bei der Frömmigkeit Bruderliebe, bei der Bruderliebe allgemeine Menschenliebe! 
[1:8] Wenn diese Tugenden bei euch vorhanden sind und beständig wachsen, dann machen sie euch auch eifrig und fruchtbar in der Erkenntnis unseres Herrn Jesus Christus. 
[1:9] Wem aber diese Tugenden fehlen, der ist blind und kann nur die nächsten Gegenstände sehen; denn er hat vergessen, daß er von seinen früheren Sünden gereinigt worden ist. 
[1:10] Deshalb, Brüder, beeifert euch um so mehr, eure Berufung und Erwählung durch die guten Werke sicherzustellen! Denn wenn ihr diese Werke tut, werdet ihr niemals straucheln. 
[1:11] So sollt ihr dann siegreich eingehen in das ewige Königreich unseres Herrn und Retters Jesus Christus. 
[1:12] Darum will ich euch immerfort an diese Dinge erinnern, obwohl sie euch bekannt sind und ihr feststeht in der Wahrheit, die euch überliefert worden ist. 
[1:13] Trotzdem halte ich es für meine Pflicht, solange ich in diesem Zelt weile, euch durch solche Ermahnungen wachzuhalten; 
[1:14] (um so mehr) da ich weiß, daß ich mein Zelt plötzlich ablegen muß, wie mir auch unser Herr Jesus Christus kundgetan hat. 
[1:15] Ich will aber auch dafür sorgen, da ihr nach meinem Hingang jederzeit imstande seid, euch an diese Wahrheit zu erinnern. 
[1:16] Denn wir sind nicht klug ersonnenen Fabeln gefolgt, als wir euch die Macht und Wiederkunft unseres Herrn Jesus Christus verkündigten, sondern wir sind Augenzeugen seiner Hoheit gewesen. 
[1:17] Er hat von Gott dem Vater Ehre und Auszeichnung empfangen, als von der erhabenen Herrlichkeit die Stimme zu ihm kam: "Das ist mein geliebter Sohn, den ich erkoren!" 
[1:18] Wir haben gehört, wie diese Stimme aus dem Himmel kam, als wir mit ihm auf dem heiligen Berg waren. 
[1:19] Dadurch steht uns das Wort der Weissagung nun um so fester. Und ihr tut recht daran, auf dieses Wort zu achten — als auf ein Licht, das an einem dunklen Ort scheint —, bis in euern Herzen der Tag anbricht und der Morgenstern aufgeht. 
[1:20] Beherzigt dies vor allem: Niemand kann eine Weissagung der Schrift durch eigenes Wissen deuten! 
[1:21] Denn nie ist eine Weissagung aus menschlicher Willkür hervorgegangen, sondern heilige, gottgesandte Männer haben geredet, getrieben von dem Heiligen Geist. 
[2:1] Es traten auch falsche Propheten im Volk auf. Ebenso werden unter euch falsche Lehrer aufkommen. Die werden heimlich verderbenbringende Sondermeinungen einführen und sogar den Gebieter, der sie als sein Eigentum erkauft hat, verleugnen. Dadurch bringen sie ein plötzliches Verderben über sich. 
[2:2] Viele aber werden ihnen auf ihrer Lasterbahn folgen. So sind sie schuld daran, daß der Weg der Wahrheit gelästert wird. 
[2:3] In ihrer Habsucht werden sie durch heuchlerische Reden Gewinn von euch zu ziehen suchen. Ihr Urteil aber ist schon längst gefällt, und ihr Verderben schlummert nicht. 
[2:4] Selbst gegen Engel, die sich versündigt hatten, hat Gott keine Schonung geübt, sondern er hat sie in die Tiefe der Unterwelt hinabgestoßen und sie dort in der Finsternis mit Stricken binden lassen, damit sie für das Endgericht in Haft behalten werden. 
[2:5] Auch die Welt der Vorzeit hat er nicht verschont; nur Noah, den Herold der Gerechtigkeit, hat er mit noch sieben anderen am Leben erhalten, als er die Wasserflut über die Welt der Gottlosen hereinbrechen ließ. 
[2:6] Die Städte Sodom und Gomorra hat er in Asche verwandelt und sie dem Untergang geweiht zum warnenden Beispiel für alle, die gottlos dahinleben. 
[2:7] Doch den gerechten Lot, der unter dem unzüchtigen Wandel der ruchlosen Menschen litt, hat er errettet. 
[2:8] Zwar lebte dieser gerechte Mann in ihrer Mitte; aber die gottlosen Werke, die er tagtäglich sehen und hören mußte, waren eine Qual für seine reine Seele. 
[2:9] So weiß der Herr fromme Menschen aus der Versuchung zu erretten, Frevler aber zur Strafe für den Gerichtstag zu verwahren. 
[2:10] Das gilt namentlich von denen, die in unreiner Leidenschaft der Fleischeslust frönen und von einer Oberhoheit nichts wissen wollen. Diese verwegenen, frechen Menschen! Sie scheuen sich nicht, überirdische (böse) Mächte zu lästern, 
[2:11] während doch (gute) Engel, die ihnen an Kraft und Stärke überlegen sind, in der Gegenwart des Herrn kein lästerndes Urteil wider die bösen Engelmächte zu fällen wagen. 
[2:12] Diese Leute aber gleichen unvernünftigen Tieren, die von Natur dazu bestimmt sind, gefangen und getötet zu werden. Sie lästern, was sie nicht verstehen. Darum werden sie auch zugrunde gehen wie Tiere 
[2:13] und den verdienten Lohn für ihre Ungerechtigkeit empfangen. Am hellen, lichten Tag zu schwelgen, das halten sie für eine Lust. Als Schmutz- und Schandflecken nehmen diese Menschen, die an ihren Trügereien ihre Freude finden, an euern Liebesmahlen teil. 
[2:14] Dabei funkeln ihre Augen in ehebrecherischer Lust und unersättlicher Sündengier. Sie suchen schwache Seelen zu umgarnen und verstehen sich trefflich darauf, ihre Habsucht zu befriedigen. Sie sind dem Fluch verfallen! 
[2:15] Den geraden Weg haben sie verlassen und gehen in die Irre. Sie folgen dem Weg Bileams, des Sohnes Beors, der nach Sündenlohn begierig war. 
[2:16] Er ward jedoch für seine Übeltat zurechtgewiesen: ein stummes Lasttier, das mit Menschenstimme redete, wehrte des Propheten Torheit. 
[2:17] Diese Leute sind wasserlose Quellen und vom Sturm gepeitschte Nebelwolken. Die Dunkelheit der Finsternis erwartet sie. 
[2:18] Denn stolze Reden führend, die nichts sind als leerer Schall, und verstrickt in Fleischeslüste, verlocken sie durch ihre Ausschweifungen solche, die eben erst dem Kreis derer, die in Irrtum wandeln, entronnen sind. 
[2:19] Sie verheißen ihnen "Freiheit" und sind doch selber Knechte verderblicher Leidenschaften. Denn wem man im Kampf unterlegen ist, dem hat man auch als Knecht zu dienen. 
[2:20] Wenn sich nun Leute, die durch die Erkenntnis, die unser Herr und Heiland Jesus Christus schenkt, den Befleckungen der Welt entronnen sind, aufs neue davon umstricken und überwinden lassen, so ist ihr letzter Zustand schlimmer als der erste. 
[2:21] Ja es wäre ihnen besser, sie hätten den Weg der Gerechtigkeit nicht erkannt, als daß sie sich nun, nachdem sie ihn erkannt, wieder abgewandt haben von dem heiligen Gebot, das ihnen überliefert worden ist. 
[2:22] Bei ihnen bestätigt sich die Wahrheit des Sprichwortes: "Der Hund kehrt zurück zu seinem Auswurf", und: "Die Sau, die sich eben erst im Wasser gereinigt hat, wälzt sich aufs neue im Schlamm." 
[3:1] Dies ist, meine Lieben, schon der zweite Brief, den ich euch schreibe. In beiden Briefen suche ich durch meine Erinnerungen den lauteren Sinn in euch wachzuhalten, 
[3:2] damit ihr eingedenk seid der Worte, die lange zuvor die heiligen Propheten geredet haben, und des Gebotes des Herrn und Heilands, das euch von euern Aposteln mitgeteilt worden ist. 
[3:3] Bedenkt vor allem: In den letzten Tagen werden Spötter auftreten, die alles verhöhnen; sie werden nach ihren eigenen Lüsten wandeln 
[3:4] und sprechen: "Wo bleibt denn seine verheißene Wiederkunft? Seitdem unsere Väter entschlafen sind, geht ja alles seinen Gang wie immer, solange die Welt steht." 
[3:5] Dabei sind sie absichtlich blind gegen die Tatsache, daß es einst einen Himmel gab, der von alters her bestand, und eine Erde, die sich auf Gottes Wort aus dem Wasser erhob und durch das Wasser hin ausdehnte. 
[3:6] Und doch ging gerade durch diese beiden die damalige Welt an einer Wasserflut zugrunde. 
[3:7] Der jetzige Himmel aber und die jetzige Erde sind auch durch ein Gotteswort wie ein Schatz erhalten geblieben: sie werden für ein Feuer aufbewahrt, das sich entzünden soll an jenem Tag, wenn das Gericht gehalten wird und die gottlosen Menschen das Verderben trifft. 
[3:8] Doch eins, Geliebte, dürft ihr nicht vergessen: In des Herrn Augen ist ein Tag wie tausend Jahre, und tausend Jahre sind wie ein Tag. 
[3:9] Der Herr zögert nicht, die Verheißung zu erfüllen, wie so manche denken; er ist nur langmütig gegen euch. Denn er will nicht, daß jemand verlorengehe, sondern daß alle zur Sinnesänderung vorwärtsschreiten. 
[3:10] Es wird aber der Tag des Herrn kommen wie ein Dieb. Dann werden die Himmel mit Geprassel vergehen, denn ihre Grundstoffe werden sich in Flammen auflösen; und die Erde mit allem, was darauf ist, wird verbrennen. 
[3:11] Da nun dies alles so zergehen soll, wie müßt ihr euch deshalb auszeichnen durch heiligen Wandel und durch Frömmigkeit! 
[3:12] Ihr sollt ja die Ankunft des Tages Gottes erwarten und beschleunigen! Weil dieser Tag hereinbricht, werden sich die Himmel im Feuer auflösen, und ihre Grundstoffe werden in Brand geraten und zerschmelzen. 
[3:13] Wir warten aber nach seiner Verheißung auf neue Himmel und eine neue Erde, und darin soll Gerechtigkeit wohnen. 
[3:14] In dieser Erwartung befleißigt euch deshalb, Geliebte, daß er euch zu euerm Heil fehllos und unsträflich finde! 
[3:15] Laßt euch die Langmut unseres Herrn zu eurer Rettung dienen! In diesem Sinn hat euch ja auch unser lieber Bruder Paulus nach der ihm verliehenen Weisheit geschrieben. 
[3:16] Und ebenso redet er in allen seinen Briefen, wenn er auf diese Dinge zu sprechen kommt. Darin ist freilich manches schwer verständlich, und die Schlechtunterrichteten und Unbefestigten verdrehen solche Stellen, wie sie's auch sonst mit den Schriften machen, und zwar zu ihrem eigenen Verderben. 
[3:17] Ihr nun, meine Lieben, seid vorher gewarnt worden. So gebt denn acht, daß ihr nicht durch die Verführung der ruchlosen Menschen mitfortgerissen werdet und aus euerm festen Glaubensstand fallt! 
[3:18] Wachst vielmehr in der Gnade und Erkenntnis unseres Herrn und Heilandes Jesus Christus! Ihm sei Ehre jetzt und bis auf den Tag der Ewigkeit! Amen. 

### I John

[1:1] Was von Anfang war, was wir gehört und mit Augen gesehen, was wir geschaut und mit Händen betastet haben, das berichten wir von dem Wort des Lebens. 
[1:2] Ja, das Leben ist erschienen, und jenes ewige Leben, das bei dem Vater war und uns offenbar geworden ist, das haben wir gesehen, das bezeugen und verkünden wir euch. 
[1:3] Was wir gesehen und gehört, das verkündigen wir auch euch, damit auch ihr mit uns Gemeinschaft habt. Aber diese Gemeinschaft mit uns ist auch eine Gemeinschaft mit dem Vater und mit seinem Sohn Jesus Christus. 
[1:4] Dies schreiben wir, damit unsere Freude vollkommen sei. 
[1:5] Dies ist die Botschaft, die wir von ihm gehört und euch verkünden: "Gott ist Licht, und in ihm ist keine Finsternis." 
[1:6] Behaupten wir, wir haben Gemeinschaft mit ihm, und wandeln trotzdem in der Finsternis, so lügen wir und betätigen die Wahrheit nicht. 
[1:7] Wandeln wir aber im Licht, wie er im Licht ist, so haben wir Gemeinschaft miteinander, und das Blut Jesu, seines Sohnes, reinigt uns von jeder Sünde. 
[1:8] Behaupten wir: wir haben keine Sünde, so betrügen wir uns selbst, und die Wahrheit wohnt nicht in uns. 
[1:9] Bekennen wir aber unsere Sünden, dann ist er treu und gerecht, so daß er uns die Sünden erläßt und uns reinigt von jeglichem Unrecht. 
[1:10] Behaupten wir: wir haben nicht gesündigt, so machen wir ihn zum Lügner, und sein Wort wohnt nicht in uns. 
[2:1] Meine lieben Kinder! Dies schreibe ich euch, damit ihr nicht sündigt. Und sündigt doch jemand, so haben wir einen Fürsprecher bei dem Vater: Jesus Christus, den Gerechten. 
[2:2] Der ist die Sühne für unsere Sünden, und nicht für unsere allein, sondern auch für die Sünden der ganzen Welt. 
[2:3] Dies ist das Merkmal, daß wir ihn erkannt: wir halten seine Gebote. 
[2:4] Wer behauptet: "Ich habe ihn erkannt" und seine Gebote nicht hält, der lügt; in solchem Menschen wohnt nicht die Wahrheit. 
[2:5] Wer aber seinem Wort gehorcht, in dem ist wirklich die Liebe zu Gott vollkommen geworden. Daran zeigt sich, daß wir in ihm sind. 
[2:6] Wer da behauptet, er bleibe in ihm, der muß auch wandeln, wie Er gewandelt. 
[2:7] Geliebte, nicht ein neues Gebot schreibe ich euch nun, sondern ein altes Gebot, das ihr gehabt von Anfang an. Dies alte Gebot ist jenes Wort, das ihr bereits gehört. 
[2:8] Und doch schreibe ich euch ein neues Gebot; das ist es wirklich im Blick auf ihn und auf euch. Denn die Finsternis ist im Schwinden begriffen, und das wahre Licht hat zu leuchten begonnen. 
[2:9] Wer nun behauptet, er sei im Licht, und doch seinen Bruder haßt, der ist noch immer in Finsternis. 
[2:10] Wer seinen Bruder liebhat, der ist fort und fort im Licht, und in seinem Geist ist nichts, das ihn zu Fall bringen könnte. 
[2:11] Wer aber seinen Bruder haßt, der lebt in der Finsternis und wandelt in der Finsternis und weiß nicht, wohin er geht; denn die Finsternis hat seine Augen blind gemacht. 
[2:12] Ich schreibe euch, liebe Kinder, weil euch die Sünden um seines Namens willen vergeben sind. 
[2:13] Ich schreibe euch, ihr Väter, weil ihr den erkannt habt, der von Anfang ist. Ich schreibe euch, ihr Jünglinge, weil ihr den Bösen überwunden habt. 
[2:14] Ich habe euch geschrieben, liebe Kinder, weil ihr den Vater erkannt habt, der von Anfang ist. Ich habe euch, ihr Jünglinge, geschrieben, weil ihr stark seid durch das Wort Gottes unablässig in euch wohnt und ihr den Bösen überwunden habt. 
[2:15] Habt nicht lieb die Welt, noch was in der Welt ist! Wer die Welt liebhat, in dem wohnt nicht die Liebe zum Vater. 
[2:16] Denn alles weltliche Wesen — die Fleischeslust, die Augenlust und das großtuerische Leben — stammt nicht von dem Vater, sondern von der Welt. 
[2:17] Und die Welt fährt dahin mit ihrer Lust; wer aber den Willen Gottes tut, der bleibt in Ewigkeit. 
[2:18] Kinder! Die letzte Stunde ist da! Ihr habt gehört, ein Widerchrist soll kommen. Jetzt aber sind schon Widerchristen in großer Anzahl aufgetreten. Daran erkennen wir: die letzte Stunde ist da. 
[2:19] Sie sind aus unserer Mitte hervorgegangen, aber sie haben uns innerlich nicht angehört. Denn hätten sie uns angehört, so wären sie bei uns geblieben. Doch sie haben uns verlassen, damit es sich zeige, daß nicht alle zu uns gehören. 
[2:20] Ihr aber habt die Salbung von dem Heiligen empfangen und wißt alles. 
[2:21] Ich habe euch nicht geschrieben, weil ihr sie kennt und deshalb auch wissen müßt, daß keine Lüge aus der Wahrheit kommt. 
[2:22] Wer sonst ist der Lügner, als der da leugnet, Jesus sei auch der Christus? Ein solcher Leugner ist der Widerchrist: er leugnet den Vater und den Sohn. 
[2:23] Jeder, der den Sohn leugnet, hat auch den Vater nicht. Wer den Sohn bekennt, der hat auch den Vater. 
[2:24] Was ihr von Anfang an gehört, das soll in euern Herzen bleiben! Bleibt aber das in euch, was ihr von Anfang an gehört, so werdet auch ihr in dem Sohn und dem Vater bleiben. 
[2:25] Und dies hat er selbst uns verheißen: das ewige Leben. 
[2:26] So viel schreibe ich über die, die euch verführen wollen. 
[2:27] Und die Salbung, die ihr von ihm empfangen habt, die bleibt in euch. Ihr habt nicht nötig, daß euch jemand belehre. Sondern wie euch seine Salbung über alles belehrt, so ist's auch wahr und keine Lüge. Wie sie euch belehrt, so bleibt in ihm! 
[2:28] Nun, liebe Kinder, bleibt in ihm! Dann haben wir, wenn er erscheint, auch freudige Zuversicht, und wir brauchen bei seiner Wiederkunft nicht mit Scham und Schande von ihm zu weichen. 
[2:29] Wenn ihr wißt, daß er gerecht ist, so bedenkt auch: jeder, der Gerechtigkeit übt, ist aus ihm erzeugt. 
[3:1] Seht, welch große Liebe hat uns der Vater bewiesen! Wir sollen Gottes Kinder heißen und sind es auch. Darum erkennt die Welt uns nicht, denn sie hat ihn nicht erkannt. 
[3:2] Geliebte, jetzt schon sind wir Gottes Kinder. Aber es ist noch nicht offenbar geworden, was wir sein sollen. Wir wissen jedoch: wenn er erscheint, so werden wir ihm ähnlich sein; denn wir werden ihn sehen. 
[3:3] Wer solche Hoffnung hat im Vertrauen auf ihn, der reinigt sich, wie Er rein ist. 
[3:4] Wer die Sünde tut, der frevelt auch gegen das Gesetz; denn die Sünde ist Gesetzlosigkeit. 
[3:5] Ihr wißt aber: Er ist erschienen, um die Sünden zu tilgen, und in ihm ist keine Sünde. 
[3:6] Wer in ihm bleibt, der sündigt nicht. Wer sündigt, der hat ihn nicht gesehen noch erkannt. 
[3:7] Liebe Kinder, laßt euch von niemand irreführen. Wer Gerechtigkeit übt, der ist gerecht, wie Er gerecht ist. 
[3:8] Wer die Sünde tut, der stammt vom Teufel; denn der Teufel sündigt von Anfang an. Dazu ist Gottes Sohn erschienen, daß er des Teufels Werke zerstöre. 
[3:9] Jeder, der aus Gott gezeugt ist, tut keine Sünde; denn sein Same bleibt in ihm. Ja er kann nicht sündigen, denn er ist aus Gott gezeugt. 
[3:10] Daran erkennt man Gottes Kinder und des Teufels Kinder. Jeder, der nicht Gerechtigkeit übt, stammt nicht von Gott, ebenso auch, wer seinen Bruder nicht liebt. 
[3:11] Denn dies ist die Botschaft, die ihr von Anfang an gehört: wir sollen einander lieben. 
[3:12] Wir sollen nicht Kain gleichen, der von dem Bösen stammte und seinen Bruder mordete. Und warum hat er ihn ermordet? Weil seine Taten böse waren, seines Bruders Taten aber gerecht. 
[3:13] Wundert euch nicht, meine Brüder, wenn die Welt euch haßt. 
[3:14] Wir wissen: wir sind aus dem Tod zum Leben gelangt, weil wir die Brüder lieben. Wer keine Liebe hat, der bleibt im Tod. 
[3:15] Wer seinen Bruder haßt, der ist ein Mörder; und ihr wißt: in einem Mörder wohnt nicht das ewige Leben. 
[3:16] Daran haben wir das wahre Wesen der Liebe erkannt, daß Er sein Leben zu unserem Heil dahingegeben hat. So ist's auch unsere Pflicht, unser Leben zum Besten der Brüder einzusetzen. 
[3:17] Wer irdische Güter hat und seinen Bruder Not leiden sieht, aber sein Herz vor ihm verschließt: wie kann in dem die Liebe zu Gott noch wohnen? 
[3:18] Liebe Kinder, laßt uns nicht lieben mit Worten und mit der Zunge, sondern mit der Tat und in Wahrheit! 
[3:19] Daran werden wir dann auch erkennen, daß wir aus der Wahrheit sind, und dadurch können wir unser Herz vor seinem Angesicht zur Ruhe bringen, 
[3:20] daß wir bedenken, wenn unser Herz uns anklagt: Gott ist größer als unser Herz, und er weiß alles. 
[3:21] Geliebte, wenn unser Herz uns nicht anklagt, so haben wir freudige Zuversicht zu Gott. 
[3:22] Und was wir erbitten, das empfangen wir auch von ihm; denn wir halten seine Gebote und tun, was ihm wohlgefällig ist. 
[3:23] Und dies ist sein Gebot: Wir sollen glauben an den Namen seines Sohnes Jesus Christus und einander lieben, wie er uns geboten. 
[3:24] Wer seine Gebote hält, der bleibt in ihm und er in ihm. Und daß er bleibend in uns wohnt, erkennen wir an dem Geist, den er uns gegeben. 
[4:1] Geliebte, schenkt nicht jedem Geist Glauben! Prüft vielmehr die Geister, ob sie aus Gott sind! Denn viele Lügenpropheten sind ausgezogen in die Welt. 
[4:2] Daran erkennt Gottes Geist: Jeder Geist, der Jesus Christus als den im Fleisch Erschienenen bekennt, der ist aus Gott. 
[4:3] Doch jeder Geist, der Jesus nicht bekennt, ist nicht aus Gott: das ist der Geist des Widerchrists. Ihr habt gehört, daß er kommt; und er ist schon jetzt in der Welt. 
[4:4] Ihr seid aus Gott, liebe Kinder, und habt sie überwunden. Denn der in euch wirkt, ist stärker, als der in der Welt sein Wesen treibt. 
[4:5] Sie gehören der Welt an. Darum reden sie nach Art der Welt, und die Welt hört auf sie. 
[4:6] Wir sind von Gott gesandt. Wer Gott erkennt, der hört auf uns. Wer nicht aus Gott ist, der hört nicht auf uns. Hieran erkennen wir den Geist der Wahrheit und den Geist des Irrtums. 
[4:7] Geliebte, laßt uns einander lieben! Denn die Liebe stammt von Gott, und wer Liebe hat, der ist aus Gott erzeugt und erkennt Gott. 
[4:8] Wer keine Liebe hat, der hat Gott nicht erkannt; denn Gott ist Liebe. 
[4:9] Dadurch ist Gottes Liebe bei uns offenbar geworden, daß Gott seinen eingeborenen Sohn gesandt hat in die Welt, damit wir durch ihn das Leben hätten. 
[4:10] Darin zeigt sich die (wahre) Liebe: nicht wir haben Gott geliebt, sondern er hat uns geliebt und seinen Sohn gesandt als Sühne für unsere Sünden. 
[4:11] Geliebte, hat uns Gott so sehr geliebt, dann müssen auch wir einander lieben. 
[4:12] Keiner hat Gott je gesehen. Lieben wir aber einander, so wohnt Gott bleibend in uns, und seine Liebe ist in uns vollkommen. 
[4:13] Daß wir aber bleibend in ihm wohnen und er in uns, erkennen wir daran, daß er uns von seinem Geist gegeben hat. 
[4:14] Und wir haben gesehen und bezeugen, daß der Vater den Sohn gesandt hat als Heiland der Welt. 
[4:15] Wer nun bekennt, daß Jesus Gottes Sohn ist, in dem bleibt Gott und er in Gott. 
[4:16] Wir haben erkannt und geglaubt die Liebe, die Gott zu uns hat. Gott ist Liebe; und wer in der Liebe bleibt, der bleibt in Gott, und Gott bleibt auch in ihm. 
[4:17] Darin vollendet sich bei uns die Liebe, daß wir freudige Zuversicht haben am Tag des Gerichts; denn so, wie Er ist, so sind auch wir in dieser Welt. 
[4:18] Furcht ist nicht in der Liebe; die vollkommene Liebe vertreibt die Furcht. Die Furcht denkt ja an Strafe. Wer sich also fürchtet, der ist in der Liebe noch nicht vollkommen. 
[4:19] Wir lieben, weil Gott uns zuerst geliebt. 
[4:20] Wer da behauptet: "Ich liebe Gott", und doch seinen Bruder haßt, der ist ein Lügner. Denn wer seinen Bruder nicht liebt, den er leibhaftig sieht, der kann Gott, den er gar nicht sieht, unmöglich lieben. 
[4:21] Ja, dies Gebot haben wir von ihm: Wer Gott liebt, der muß auch seinen Bruder lieben. 
[5:1] Jeder, der glaubt, daß Jesus der Christus ist, der ist aus Gott gezeugt. Und wer seinen Erzeuger liebt, der liebt auch den von ihm Erzeugten. 
[5:2] Daran erkennen wir, daß wir Gottes Kinder lieben, wenn wir Gott lieben und seine Gebote erfüllen. 
[5:3] Denn darin zeigt sich die Liebe zu Gott, daß wir seine Gebote halten. Und seine Gebote sind nicht schwer. 
[5:4] Denn alles, was aus Gott erzeugt ist, überwindet die Welt. Und die Siegesmacht, die die Welt überwunden hat, ist unser Glaube. 
[5:5] Wer ist der Weltüberwinder? Nur wer da glaubt: Jesus ist Gottes Sohn. 
[5:6] Dieser hat seinen Weg genommen durch Wasser und Blut. Jesus ist als der Christus auch immer noch wirksam, nicht durch das Wasser allein, sondern durch das Wasser und das Blut. Auch der Geist legt Zeugnis für ihn ab, denn der Geist ist die Wahrheit. 
[5:7] So sind's denn drei, die Zeugnis geben: 
[5:8] der Geist, das Wasser und das Blut, und diese drei bezeugen die eine Wahrheit. 
[5:9] Nehmen wir schon der Menschen Zeugnis an, so steht Gottes Zeugnis noch viel höher. Denn dies ist Gottes Zeugnis: er hat Zeugnis abgelegt von seinem Sohn. 
[5:10] Wer an den Sohn Gottes glaubt, der hat in der Gemeinschaft mit ihm dies Zeugnis. Wer Gott nicht glaubt, der hat ihn damit zum Lügner gemacht: er hat ja nicht geglaubt an das Zeugnis, das Gott von seinem Sohn abgelegt. 
[5:11] Und dies ist der Inhalt des Zeugnisses: "Gott hat uns das ewige Leben gegeben, und dieses Leben ist zu finden in der Gemeinschaft mit seinem Sohn." 
[5:12] Wer den Sohn hat, der hat das Leben. Wer den Sohn Gottes nicht hat, der hat das Leben nicht. 
[5:13] Dies schreibe ich euch, damit ihr wißt, daß ihr ewiges Leben habt: denn ihr glaubt ja an den Namen des Sohnes Gottes. 
[5:14] Dies zuversichtliche Vertrauen haben wir zu ihm: Wenn wir nach seinem Willen um etwas bitten, so erhört er uns. 
[5:15] Und wie wir wissen, daß er uns erhört auf unser Bitten, so wissen wir zugleich: wir werden das von ihm Erbetene auch sicherlich empfangen. 
[5:16] Sieht einer, daß sein Bruder eine Sünde tut, die nicht zum Tod führt, so bete er für ihn, und Gott wird diesem Bruder Leben geben — das heißt solchen, die nicht eine Sünde tun, die zum Tod führt. Es gibt wirklich Sünde, die zum Tod führt. Ich rede nicht davon, daß man bei solcher Sünde bitte. 
[5:17] Jede Ungerechtigkeit ist Sünde. Aber es gibt Sünde, die nicht zum Tod führt. 
[5:18] Wir wissen: wer aus Gott erzeugt ist, sündigt nicht; sondern der aus Gott Erzeugte ist auf seiner Hut, und der Böse tastet ihn nicht an. 
[5:19] Wir wissen: wir sind aus Gott, und die ganze Welt liegt in der Gewalt des Bösen. 
[5:20] Wir wissen aber: der Sohn Gottes ist gekommen und hat uns Verständnis gegeben, den Wahrhaftigen zu erkennen. Und wir stehen in Gemeinschaft mit dem Wahrhaftigen, weil wir in Gemeinschaft sind mit seinem Sohn Jesus Christus. Dieser ist der wahrhaftige Gott und das ewige Leben. 
[5:21] Liebe Kinder, hütet euch vor den Truggebilden! 

### II John

[1:1] Der Älteste entbietet seinen Gruß der auserwählten Herrin und ihren Kindern. Ich liebe euch in Wahrheit, doch nicht ich allein, sondern auch alle, die die Wahrheit erkannt haben: 
[1:2] ich liebe euch um der Wahrheit willen, die in uns wohnt, und die bei uns bleiben wird in Ewigkeit. 
[1:3] Gnade, Barmherzigkeit und Friede von Gott dem Vater und von Jesus Christus, dem Sohn des Vaters, wird mit uns sein, (damit wir wachsen) in Wahrheit und Liebe. 
[1:4] Ich habe mich sehr gefreut, unter deinen Kindern solche zu finden, die in der Wahrheit wandeln, so wie uns der Vater geboten hat. 
[1:5] Und nun bitte ich dich, Herrin — nicht als schriebe ich dir ein neues Gebot, sondern jenes, das wir von Anfang an gehabt haben —: "Laß uns einander lieben!" 
[1:6] Und darin zeigt sich die Liebe, daß wir nach seinen Geboten wandeln. Dies ist das Gebot: "Wandelt in der Liebe!" so wie ihr von Anfang an gehört habt. 
[1:7] Denn viele Verführer sind ausgezogen in die Welt, die Jesus Christus nicht als den im Fleisch Erschienenen bekennen. Ein solcher Mensch ist der Verführer und der Widerchrist. 
[1:8] Seht euch vor, daß ihr nicht die Frucht eurer Arbeit verliert, sondern einen vollen Lohn empfangt! 
[1:9] Wer über die rechte Grenze hinausgeht und nicht in der Lehre Christi bleibt, der hat keinen Gott. Wer aber in dieser Lehre bleibt, der hat den Vater und den Sohn. 
[1:10] Kommt einer zu euch und bringt diese Lehre nicht, den nehmt nicht auf in euer Haus und bietet ihm auch keinen Gruß! 
[1:11] Denn wer ihn grüßt, der ist mitschuldig an seinem bösen Treiben. 
[1:12] Ich hätte euch noch vieles mitzuteilen, aber ich mag es nicht tun mit Papier und Tinte. Ich hoffe vielmehr, zu euch zu kommen und mich mündlich mit euch auszusprechen, damit unsere Freude vollkommen sei. 
[1:13] Es grüßen dich die Kinder deiner auserwählten Schwester. 

### III John

[1:1] Der Älteste entbietet seinen Gruß dem lieben Gajus, den ich aufrichtig liebe. 
[1:2] Lieber Freund! Mein Wunsch und mein Gebet ist: wie es deiner Seele wohl geht, so möge es dir auch äußerlich und besonders in der leiblichen Gesundheit in jeder Hinsicht wohl gehen. 
[1:3] Es hat mich sehr gefreut, daß Brüder gekommen sind und sich lobend darüber ausgesprochen haben, wie aufrichtig du der Wahrheit ergeben bist und wie treu du sie durch deinen Wandel bezeugst. 
[1:4] Eine größere Freude habe ich nicht, als wenn ich höre, daß meine Kinder in der Wahrheit wandeln. 
[1:5] Mein Lieber, du erfüllst treulich deine Pflicht an den Brüdern, sogar an solchen, die dir fremd sind. 
[1:6] Diese Brüder haben deine Liebe auch vor der (hiesigen) Gemeinde rühmend anerkannt. Du tust wohl daran, wenn du sie auch jetzt wieder freundlich aufnimmst und zur Weiterreise ausrüstest, wie es sich vor Gott geziemt. 
[1:7] Denn sie sind ausgezogen, um den Namen zu verkünden, und dabei nehmen sie von den Heiden keine Unterstützung an. 
[1:8] Darum ist es unsere Pflicht, uns solcher Männer anzunehmen, um so an der Ausbreitung der Wahrheit mitzuwirken. 
[1:9] Ich habe der Gemeinde einige Zeilen geschrieben. Aber Diotrephes, der unter ihnen nach der ersten Stelle strebt, will von uns nichts wissen. 
[1:10] Bei meinem Besuch will ich deshalb sein ganzes Treiben aufdecken: wie er uns mit bösen Reden verdächtigt und, damit nicht genug, auch die Brüder nicht aufnimmt und solche, die sie aufnehmen wollen, daran hindert, ja sogar aus der Gemeinde stößt. 
[1:11] Mein Lieber, folge nicht dem bösen Beispiel, sondern dem guten! Wer Gutes tut, der ist von Gott; wer Böses tut, der hat Gott nicht gesehen. 
[1:12] Demetrius hat von allen, ja von der Wahrheit selbst, ein gutes Zeugnis empfangen. Auch wir geben ihm ein gutes Zeugnis; und du weißt, daß unser Zeugnis wahr ist. 
[1:13] Ich hätte dir noch vieles mitzuteilen, aber ich mag es nicht tun mit Tinte und Feder. 
[1:14] Ich hoffe, dich bald zu sehen. Dann wollen wir mündlich miteinander reden. Friede sei mit dir! Die Freunde lassen dich grüßen. Grüße jeden einzelnen unserer Freunde! 

### Jude

[1:1] Judas, Jesu Christi Knecht und des Jakobus Bruder, begrüßt die (zum Heil) Berufenen, die mit Gott dem Vater in Liebe vereint und für Jesus Christus auserwählt sind. 
[1:2] Barmherzigkeit, Friede und Liebe werde euch reichlich zuteil! 
[1:3] Geliebte, während ich gerade mit allem Fleiß dabei bin, euch über unser gemeinsames Heil zu schreiben, sehe ich mich genötigt, euch (zunächst) in diesem Brief zu ermahnen, daß ihr für den Glauben kämpft, der den Heiligen ein für allemal überliefert worden ist. 
[1:4] Denn es haben sich gewisse Leute heimlich (bei euch) eingeschlichen, die schon früher geschildert sind als solche, die unter dieses Urteil fallen: "Ruchlos sind sie; sie mißbrauchen die Gnade unseres Gottes, um ein Lasterleben zu führen, und verleugnen unseren alleinigen Gebieter und Herrn Jesus Christus." 
[1:5] Ich möchte euch nun daran erinnern, wenn euch das alles auch schon bekannt ist, daß der Herr, der zum zweiten Mal ein Volk aus Ägyptenland errettet hat, über die Ungläubigen Verderben kommen ließ. 
[1:6] Auch gewisse Engel, die ihre Herrscherstellung nicht behauptet, sondern die ihnen zugewiesene Wohnung verlassen haben, verwahrt er in der Finsternis, wo sie mit ewigen Ketten gebunden sind, für das Gericht des großen Tages. 
[1:7] Ebenso stehen uns Sodom und Gomorra mit ihren Nachbarstädten, die ähnlich wie die eben erwähnten Engel Unzucht getrieben haben und anderem Fleisch nachgegangen sind, als warnendes Beispiel vor Augen: sie leiden das Strafgericht eines ewigen Feuers. 
[1:8] Trotzdem beflecken auch diese Träumer in ähnlicher Weise ihren Leib. Sie wollen von einer Oberhoheit nichts wissen und (voll Hohn und Spott) lästern sie überirdische Mächte. 
[1:9] Nun hat nicht einmal der Erzengel Michael, als er mit dem Teufel über Moses Leichnam in Streit und Wortwechsel geriet, ein lästerndes Urteil über ihn auszusprechen gewagt; sondern er sagte nur: "Der Herr strafe dich!" 
[1:10] Diese Leute aber lästern das, was sie gar nicht kennen. Sie folgen den sinnlichen Trieben wie die unvernünftigen Tiere, und damit richten sie sich zugrunde. 
[1:11] Weh ihnen! Sie sind auf dem Weg Kains gewandelt; aus Gewinnsucht haben sie sich in die Verführung Bileams gestürzt, und sie sind in ihrer Empörung umgekommen wie Korah. 
[1:12] Diese Menschen schmausen als Schandflecke schamlos mit bei euern Liebesmahlen und mästen sich. Sie sind Wolken ohne Wasser, die von den Winden hinweggetrieben werden. Sie gleichen Bäumen im Spätherbst, an denen man keine Frucht mehr findet. Ja sie sind zweimal erstorben und mit der Wurzel ausgerissen. 
[1:13] Wilde Meereswogen sind sie, die ihre eigene Schande ausschäumen. Irrsternen gleichen sie: die Dunkelheit der Finsternis erwartet sie auf ewig. 
[1:14] Ihnen gilt, was Henoch, Adams siebenter Nachkomme, geweissagt hat: "Der Herr", so spricht er, "ist gekommen mit viel tausend seiner heiligen Engel, 
[1:15] um über alle Gericht zu halten und alle Gottlosen zu strafen wegen all ihrer ruchlosen Werke, womit sie gefrevelt, und wegen aller Lästerworte, die sie, die gottlosen Sünder, gegen ihn geredet haben." 
[1:16] Mit ihrer Stellung unzufrieden, murren diese Leute, während sie nach ihren Lüsten wandeln. Ihr Mund führt stolze Reden, und dabei kriechen sie vor solchen Leuten, von denen sie Gewinn erhoffen. 
[1:17] Ihr aber, meine Lieben, erinnert euch der Worte, die von den Aposteln unseres Herrn Jesus Christus einst zu euch geredet sind! 
[1:18] Sie haben euch gesagt: "In der letzten Zeit werden Spötter auftreten, die nach ihren gottlosen Lüsten wandeln." 
[1:19] Dies sind Leute, die Spaltungen in den Gemeinden anrichten: sie sind seelisch und haben keinen Geist. 
[1:20] Ihr aber, meine Lieben, erbaut euch auf dem Grund eures allerheiligsten Glaubens und betet in der Kraft des Heiligen Geistes! 
[1:21] Bleibt dadurch fest in Gottes Liebe und wartet auf die Barmherzigkeit unseres Herrn Jesus Christus, die euch zum ewigen Leben führen wird! 
[1:22] Mit den Schwankenden habt Erbarmen: 
[1:23] rettet sie und reißt sie aus dem Feuer! Auch den anderen helft in erbarmender Liebe! Doch seid dabei auf der Hut: verabscheut sogar das vom Fleisch befleckte Unterkleid! 
[1:24] Dem aber, der euch vor allem Straucheln bewahren und tüchtig machen kann, unsträflich und mit Jauchzen zu erscheinen vor seiner Herrlichkeit: 
[1:25] ihm, dem alleinigen Gott, der uns errettet durch Jesus Christus, unseren Herrn, gebührt Herrlichkeit und Hoheit, Macht und Gewalt vor aller Zeit, jetzt und in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 

### Revelation of John

[1:1] Dies ist eine Offenbarung Jesu Christi: / Gott hat sie ihm gegeben, um seinen Knechten kundzutun, was bald geschehen soll; und er hat sie durch seinen Engel seinem Knecht Johannes zugesandt und bekannt gemacht. 
[1:2] Der hat dann das, was er gesehen, aufgezeichnet und bezeugt nunmehr, was Gott geredet und was Jesus Christus ihm als wahr verbürgt hat. 
[1:3] Selig ist, der die Worte dieser Weissagung vorliest, und selig sind, die sie hören und zu Herzen nehmen, was darin geschrieben ist! Denn die Zeit ist nahe! 
[1:4] Johannes entbietet den sieben Gemeinden in Asien seinen Gruß. Gnade sei mit euch und Friede von dem, der da ist, der da war und der da kommt, und von den sieben Geistern, die vor dem Thron Gottes sind, 
[1:5] und von Jesus Christus, dem zuverlässigen Zeugen dem Erstgeborenen von den Toten und dem Herrscher über die Könige der Erde! 
[1:6] Ihm, der uns geliebt und uns von unseren Sünden durch sein Blut erlöst und uns zu einem Königtum, zu Priestern für seinen Gott und Vater gemacht hat; ihm gebührt die Herrlichkeit und Macht in alle Ewigkeit! Amen. 
[1:7] Seht, er kommt in den Wolken! Jedes Auge wird ihn schauen, auch die, die ihn durchstochen haben, und bei seinem Anblick werden wehklagen alle Völker der Erde. Ja, so ist es! 
[1:8] "Ich bin das A und das O", spricht Gott der Herr, der da ist, der da war und der da kommt, der Allgewaltige. 
[1:9] Ich, Johannes, euer Bruder und euer Genosse in der Trübsal und auch in der Königsherrschaft und in der beharrlichen Hoffnung auf das Kommen Jesu, ich war auf der Insel, die Patmos heißt, weil ich Gottes Wort verkündigt und das Zeugnis von Jesus abgelegt hatte. 
[1:10] Da ward ich an des Herrn Tag vom Geist erfüllt. Ich hörte hinter mir eine laute Stimme gleich einem Posaunenschall, 
[1:11] die sprach: "Was du siehst, das schreibe in ein Buch und sende es an die sieben Gemeinden: nach Ephesus, nach Smyrna, nach Pergamus, nach Thyatira, nach Sardes, nach Philadelphia und nach Laodizea." 
[1:12] Da wandte ich mich um nach der Stimme, die mit mir redete. Und als ich mich umwandte, sah ich sieben goldene Leuchter, 
[1:13] und inmitten der Leuchter sah ich jemand, der einem Menschensohn glich: Er war bekleidet mit einem Mantel, der bis zu den Füßen reichte, und um die Brust trug er einen goldenen Gürtel. 
[1:14] Sein Haupt und seine Haare waren weiß wie weiße Wolle und wie Schnee; seine Augen waren wie eine Feuerflamme; 
[1:15] seine Füße glichen Silbererz, das im Feuerofen weißglühend geworden ist; seine Stimme klang wie das Rauschen vieler Wasser. 
[1:16] In seiner rechten Hand hielt er sieben Sterne; aus seinem Mund ging ein scharfes zweischneidiges Schwert, und sein Antlitz strahlte wie die Sonne in ihrer vollen Kraft. 
[1:17] Als ich ihn sah, sank ich wie tot zu seinen Füßen. Er aber legte seine Hand auf mich und sprach: "Fürchte dich nicht! Ich bin der Erste und der Letzte 
[1:18] und der Lebendige. Ich war tot, aber ich bin nun lebendig in alle Ewigkeit und habe die Schlüssel des Todes und der Unterwelt. 
[1:19] Schreib nun (später) auf, was du gesehen hast: das, was jetzt schon ist, und das, was einst geschehen soll! 
[1:20] (Schreib jetzt zunächst) das Geheimnis der sieben Sterne, die du in meiner rechten Hand gesehen hast, und der sieben goldenen Leuchter! Die sieben Sterne sind die Engel der sieben Gemeinden, und die sieben Leuchter sind die sieben Gemeinden. 
[2:1] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Ephesus schreibe: So spricht, der die sieben Sterne in seiner Rechten hält, die inmitten der sieben goldenen Leuchter wandelt: 
[2:2] 'Ich kenne deine Werke, deine unverdrossene Arbeit und deine Ausdauer. Ich weiß, du kannst böse Menschen nicht ertragen und hast die Leute, die sich fälschlich für Apostel ausgeben, geprüft und sie als Lügner entlarvt. 
[2:3] Du zeigst auch Ausdauer und hast um meines Namens willen standhaft gelitten und bist nicht müde geworden. 
[2:4] Aber ich habe wider dich, daß du nicht mehr in deiner ersten Liebe stehst. 
[2:5] Nimm darum zu Herzen, von welcher Höhe du gefallen bist! Ändere deinen Sinn und tu die ersten Werke! Sonst komme ich über dich und stoße deinen Leuchter von seiner Stätte, wenn du dich nicht bekehrst. 
[2:6] Dies gereicht dir noch zum Lobe: du haßt die Werke der Nikolaiten, die ich auch hasse. 
[2:7] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt! Dem Sieger will ich zu essen geben von der Frucht des Lebensbaumes, der in dem Paradies Gottes ist.' 
[2:8] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Smyrna schreibe: So spricht der Erste und der Letzte, der tot war und wieder lebt: 
[2:9] 'Ich kenne deine Trübsal und deine Armut — doch du bist reich! — und ich weiß, wie du von denen gelästert wirst, die sich selbst (mit Stolz) Juden nennen; aber in Wirklichkeit sind sie's nicht, sondern sie sind eine Satansgemeinde. 
[2:10] Fürchte dich nicht vor dem, was du noch leiden sollst! Seht, der Teufel wird einige von euch ins Gefängnis bringen, damit ihr geprüft werdet; und ihr werdet eine Trübsal von zehn Tagen zu leiden haben. Bleib mir treu bis in den Tod, dann will ich dir das (ewige) Leben als Siegeskrone geben! 
[2:11] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt! Dem Sieger soll kein Leid geschehen von dem zweiten Tod.' 
[2:12] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Pergamus schreibe: / So spricht, der das scharfe, zweischneidige Schwert trägt: 
[2:13] 'Ich weiß, wo du wohnst: da, wo des Satans Thron ist. Doch du hältst fest an meinem Namen und hast den Glauben, den ich in dir gewirkt, nicht verleugnet in jenen Tagen, als Antipas, mein treuer Zeuge, bei euch, wo der Satan wohnt, getötet wurde. 
[2:14] Doch ich habe etwas wider dich: Du hast dort Leute, die der Lehre Bileams anhangen, der den Balak unterwies, den Israeliten einen Fallstrick zu legen, so daß sie von den Götzenopfern aßen und Unzucht trieben. 
[2:15] So hast auch du in deiner Mitte Leute, die der Lehre der Nikolaiten folgen. 
[2:16] Darum ändere deinen Sinn! Sonst komme ich bald über dich und werde sie bekämpfen mit dem Schwert meines Mundes. 
[2:17] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt! / Dem Sieger will ich geben von dem verborgenen Manna, und ich will ihm geben einen weißen Stein; auf dem Stein soll ein neuer Name stehen, den niemand kennt als der Empfänger.' 
[2:18] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Thyatira schreibe: / So spricht der Sohn Gottes, der Augen hat wie eine Feuerflamme, und dessen Füße dem Silbererz gleichen: 
[2:19] 'Ich kenne deine Werke — deine Liebe, deinen Glauben, deine Dienstleistungen und deine Beharrlichkeit —, und ich weiß, du hast in letzter Zeit noch mehr gewirkt als früher. 
[2:20] Aber ich habe dies wider dich: Du läßt Isebel, dein Weib, gewähren: die gibt sich für eine Prophetin aus und verführt meine Knechte durch ihre Lehre, Hurerei zu treiben und Götzenopferfleisch zu essen. 
[2:21] Ich habe ihr Frist gegeben zur Bekehrung; doch sie will sich nicht bekehren von ihrer Unzucht. 
[2:22] Sieh, ich werfe sie aufs Krankenbett, und die mit ihr die Ehe brechen, bringe ich in große Trübsal, wenn sie sich nicht von ihren Werken bekehren. 
[2:23] Und ihre Kinder will ich des Todes sterben lassen. Denn alle Gemeinden sollen erkennen, daß ich es bin, der Nieren und Herzen erforscht; und ich will einem jeden von euch vergelten nach seinen Werken. 
[2:24] Euch anderen aber in Thyatira sage ich, allen, die dieser Lehre nicht folgen und die Tiefen Satans nicht 'erkannt' haben — wie sie sich rühmen —: Ich lege euch weiter keine Last auf. 
[2:25] Doch haltet fest an dem, was ihr schon habt, bis ich komme! 
[2:26] Wer siegt und meine Werke bis ans Ende hält, dem will ich Macht geben über die Völker, 
[2:27] und er soll sie mit eisernem Stab weiden, wie man Töpfergeschirr in Stücke bricht. 
[2:28] Diese Macht habe auch ich empfangen von meinem Vater. Und ich will ihm geben den Morgenstern. 
[2:29] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt!' 
[3:1] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Sardes schreibe: / So spricht, der die sieben Geister Gottes hat und die sieben Sterne: / 'Ich kenne deine Werke: du lebst nur dem Namen nach; in Wirklichkeit bist du tot! 
[3:2] Werde wach und stärke das, was noch da ist, und was auch schon dem Tod nahe war! Denn ich habe deine Werke nicht völlig erfunden vor meinem Gott. 
[3:3] Denke daran, mit welcher Lust du einst (das Wort) aufgenommen und gehört hast! Bewahre es und ändere deinen Sinn! Doch wachst du nicht, so will ich kommen wie ein Dieb, und du sollst nicht wissen, zu welcher Stunde ich über dich kommen werde. 
[3:4] Du hast indes noch einige Leute in Sardes, die ihre Kleider nicht befleckt haben: die sollen mit mir wandeln in weißen Kleidern, denn sie sind es wert. 
[3:5] Der Sieger soll mit weißen Kleidern geschmückt werden, und ich will seinen Namen nicht auslöschen aus dem Lebensbuch; sondern ich werde seinen Namen bekennen vor meinem Vater und vor seinen Engeln. 
[3:6] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt!' 
[3:7] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Philadelphia schreibe: / So spricht der Heilige, der Wahrhaftige, der den Schlüssel Davids hat, der öffnet, so daß niemand schließen kann, der schließt, so daß niemand öffnen darf; 
[3:8] 'Ich kenne deine Werke! Sieh, ich habe dir eine Tür aufgetan, die niemand schließen kann. Denn du hast nur eine kleine Kraft; trotzdem hast du mein Wort festgehalten und meinen Namen nicht verleugnet. 
[3:9] Sieh, ich führe dir (Anhänger) zu aus Satans Versammlung, aus dem Kreis derer, die sich Juden nennen; doch sie sind es nicht, sie lügen! Sieh, ich will sie dahin bringen, daß sie kommen und sich zu deinen Füßen niederwerfen und erkennen, daß ich dich geliebt. 
[3:10] Weil du das Wort, das zum geduldigen Warten auf mein Kommen mahnt, bewahrt hast, so will auch ich dich bewahren vor der Stunde der Versuchung, die über den ganzen Weltkreis kommen soll, um die Erdbewohner zu versuchen. 
[3:11] Ich komme bald! Halte fest, was du hast, damit dir niemand deine Krone raube! 
[3:12] Den Sieger will ich zu einer Säule in dem Tempel meines Gottes machen, und er soll seinen Platz nie mehr verlassen. Ich will auf ihn schreiben den Namen meines Gottes und den Namen der Stadt meines Gottes, des neuen Jerusalems, das aus dem Himmel herniedersteigt von meinem Gott, und meinen neuen Namen. 
[3:13] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt!' 
[3:14] Dem Engel der Gemeinde in Laodizea schreibe: / So spricht, der das Jawort ist, der treue und wahrhaftige Zeuge, der Anfang der Schöpfung Gottes: 
[3:15] 'Ich kenne deine Werke: du bist weder kalt noch warm. Ach, daß du kalt oder warm wärst! 
[3:16] So aber, weil du lau bist und weder kalt noch warm, will ich dich ausspeien aus meinem Mund. 
[3:17] Du sagst: Ich bin reich, ich habe Schätze gewonnen und bedarf nichts! Und dabei weißt du nicht, daß gerade du elend bist und jämmerlich, arm, blind und bloß. 
[3:18] Darum rate ich dir: kaufe von mir Gold, wie es geglüht aus dem Feuer kommt, damit du reich werdest, und weiße Kleider zum Anziehen, damit sich nicht die Schande deiner Blöße offenbare, und Salbe zum Bestreichen deiner Augen, damit du sehen könnest! 
[3:19] Alle, die ich liebhabe, die weise ich zurecht und züchtige ich. So raffe dich denn auf zu neuem Eifer und ändere deinen Sinn! 
[3:20] Sieh, ich stehe vor der Tür und klopfe an. Wer meine Stimme hört und mir die Tür öffnet, bei dem will ich einkehren und das Mahl mit ihm halten, und er mit mir. 
[3:21] Dem Sieger will ich geben, mit mir auf meinem Thron zu sitzen, wie auch ich den Sieg errungen habe und nun mit meinem Vater auf seinem Thron sitze. 
[3:22] Wer Ohren hat, der höre, was der Geist den Gemeinden sagt!'" 
[4:1] Dann schaute ich, und sieh, eine Tür war aufgetan im Himmel. Da rief die erste Stimme, die ich wie Posaunenschall mit mir hatte reden hören: "Steig hierher empor! Ich will dir zeigen, was hernach geschehen soll." 
[4:2] Sofort ward ich vom Geist erfüllt. Ich sah: es stand ein Thron im Himmel, und auf dem Thron saß einer. 
[4:3] Der da saß, glich an Aussehen einem Jaspis und Sarder, und ein Regenbogen war rings um den Thron, wie ein Smaragd. 
[4:4] Rings um den Thron sah ich vierundzwanzig Älteste sitzen; die waren angetan mit weißen Kleidern und hatten auf ihren Häuptern goldene Kronen. 
[4:5] Von dem Thron gingen Blitze aus und laute Donnerschläge. Sieben Feuerfackeln brannten vor dem Thron: das sind die sieben Geister Gottes. 
[4:6] Vor dem Thron war (eine weite Fläche) wie ein Meer, durchsichtig gleich Kristall. Mitten in dem Thron und um den Thron sah ich vier Lebewesen voller Augen vorn und hinten. 
[4:7] Das erste Lebewesen glich einem Löwen, das zweite glich einem Stier, das dritte hatte ein Antlitz wie ein Mensch, und das vierte glich einem fliegenden Adler. 
[4:8] Jedes der vier Lebewesen hatte sechs Flügel; ringsum und innen waren sie voll Augen, und sie sangen unaufhörlich Tag und Nacht: / Heilig, heilig, heilig ist Gott der Herr, der Allgewaltige, Er, der war und ist und kommt!" 
[4:9] Und sooft die Lebewesen Preis, Ehre und Dank darbringen dem, der auf dem Thron sitzt, der da lebt in alle Ewigkeit, 
[4:10] fallen die vierundzwanzig Ältesten nieder vor dem, der auf dem Thron sitzt, und beten ihn an, der da lebt in alle Ewigkeit. Sie legen ihre Kronen nieder vor dem Thron und sprechen: 
[4:11] "Du, unser Herr und Gott, bist würdig, den Lobpreis zu empfangen, die Ehre und die Macht. Denn du hast alle Dinge erschaffen, und weil es dein Wille war, sind sie ins Dasein eingetreten und erschaffen worden." 
[5:1] Ich sah in der rechten Hand dessen, der auf dem Thron saß, ein Buch, beschrieben auf der Innenseite und auf der Außenseite verschlossen mit sieben Siegeln. 
[5:2] Auch sah ich einen starken Engel, der rief mit lauter Stimme: "Wer ist würdig, das Buch zu öffnen und seine Siegel zu lösen?" 
[5:3] Doch niemand im Himmel, auf Erden und unter der Erde vermochte das Buch zu öffnen und hineinzusehen. 
[5:4] Da weinte ich sehr, weil niemand würdig erfunden wurde, das Buch zu öffnen und hineinzusehen. 
[5:5] Aber einer der Ältesten sprach zu mir: "Weine nicht! Sieh, es hat gesiegt der Löwe aus dem Stamme Juda, Davids Wurzelsproß, so daß er öffnen kann das Buch und seine sieben Siegel!" 
[5:6] Da sah ich inmitten des Throns und der vier Lebewesen und inmitten der Ältesten ein Lamm stehen, das aussah, als wäre es geopfert: das hatte sieben Hörner und sieben Augen — ein Sinnbild der sieben Geister Gottes, die ausgesandt sind über die ganze Erde —. 
[5:7] Es trat hinzu und nahm das Buch aus der rechten Hand dessen, der auf dem Thron saß. 
[5:8] Als es das Buch ergriffen hatte, da fielen die vier Lebewesen und die vierundzwanzig Ältesten nieder vor dem Lamm. Jeder hatte eine Harfe und goldene Schalen voller Weihrauch — die sind ein Bild von den Gebeten der Heiligen —. 
[5:9] Sie sangen ein neues Lied und sprachen: / Du bist würdig, das Buch zu nehmen und seine Siegel zu lösen; denn du bist geopfert worden und hast Menschen für Gott erkauft mit deinem Blut aus allen Stämmen, Sprachen, Völkern und Geschlechtern 
[5:10] und hast sie gemacht für unseren Gott zu Königen und Priestern, und herrschen werden sie als Könige auf Erden." 
[5:11] Dann sah ich hin: Da hörte ich die Stimme vieler Engel rings um den Thron, die Lebewesen und die Ältesten. Ihre Zahl war zehntausendmal Zehntausende und tausendmal Tausende. 
[5:12] Sie riefen mit lauter Stimme: / "Das Lamm, das geopfert ist, ist würdig, zu empfangen Macht, Reichtum, Weisheit und Kraft, Ehre, Herrlichkeit und Lob!" 
[5:13] Und alle Geschöpfe im Himmel, auf Erden, unter der Erde und auf dem Meer, ja alles, was darinnen ist, hörte ich sagen: / "Dem, der auf dem Thron sitzt, und dem Lamm, gebühren Lob und Ehre, Herrlichkeit und Kraft in alle Ewigkeit!" 
[5:14] Die vier Lebewesen sprachen: "Amen". Und die Ältesten fielen nieder und beteten an. 
[6:1] Nun sah ich, wie das Lamm das erste von den sieben Siegeln löste, und ich hörte eins der vier Lebewesen wie mit Donnerstimme rufen: "Komm!" 
[6:2] Da sah ich: es erschien ein weißes Roß. Sein Reiter hatte einen Bogen, und ihm ward ein Kranz gereicht. Dann zog er aus von Sieg zu Sieg. 
[6:3] Als das Lamm das zweite Siegel löste, hörte ich das zweite Lebewesen rufen: "Komm!" 
[6:4] Da kam ein anderes Roß hervor, von feuerroter Farbe, und seinem Reiter ward die Macht gegeben, den Frieden von der Erde wegzunehmen und die Menschen anzureizen, einander hinzumorden; es ward ihm auch ein großes Schwert gegeben. 
[6:5] Als das Lamm das dritte Siegel löste, hörte ich das dritte Lebewesen rufen: "Komm!" Da sah ich: es erschien ein schwarzes Roß, und sein Reiter hatte eine Waage in der Hand. 
[6:6] Ich hörte, wie eine Stimme in der Mitte der vier Lebewesen sagte: "Ein Maß Weizen für einen Silberling und drei Maß Gerste für einen Silberling! Dem Öl und Wein jedoch tu keinen Schaden!" 
[6:7] Als das Lamm das vierte Siegel löste, hörte ich die Stimme des vierten Lebewesens rufen: "Komm!" 
[6:8] Da sah ich: es erschien ein fahles Roß. Sein Reiter trug den Namen "Tod", und die "Unterwelt" folgte ihm auf dem Fuß. Und sie empfingen Macht über den vierten Teil der Erde, (die Menschen) zu töten durch Schwert, Hunger und Pest und durch die wilden Tiere der Erde. 
[6:9] Als das Lamm das fünfte Siegel löste, sah ich unter dem Altar die Seelen derer, die hingeschlachtet waren um des Wortes Gottes willen und wegen des Zeugnisses, das sie treu bewahrt hatten. 
[6:10] Sie riefen mit lauter Stimme und sprachen: "Wie lange, o heiliger und wahrhaftiger Herr, soll es noch währen, bis du das Gericht vollziehst und unser Blut an den Erdbewohnern rächst?" 
[6:11] Jeder von ihnen empfing ein weißes Kleid, und sie wurden aufgefordert, noch eine kurze Weile in Geduld zu warten, bis auch ihre Mitknechte ihren Lauf vollendet hätten: ihre Brüder, die ebenso wie sie den Tod erleiden sollten. 
[6:12] Dann sah ich, wie das Lamm das sechste Siegel löste. Da entstand ein starkes Erdbeben. Die Sonne wurde schwarz wie ein härener Sack. Der ganze Mond erschien wie Blut. 
[6:13] Die Sterne des Himmels fielen auf die Erde, als wenn ein Feigenbaum, von starkem Wind bewegt, seine unreifen Früchte abwirft. 
[6:14] Der Himmel entwich wie ein Buch, das man zusammenrollt; und alle Berge und Inseln wurden von ihrer Stelle gerückt. 
[6:15] Die Könige der Erde, die Gewaltigen und die Feldobersten, die Reichen und die Starken, alle Leibeigenen und alle Freien verbargen sich in die Höhlen und die Felsen der Berge 
[6:16] und sprachen zu den Bergen und Felsen: "Fallt über uns und verbergt uns vor dem Angesicht dessen, der auf dem Thron sitzt, und vor dem Zorn des Lammes! 
[6:17] Denn der große Tag ihres Zornes ist gekommen; wer kann da bestehen?" 
[7:1] Dann sah ich vier Engel stehen an den vier Enden der Erde, die hielten die vier Winde der Erde fest, damit kein Wind wehe über die Erde noch über das Meer noch über irgendeinen Baum. 
[7:2] Auch sah ich einen anderen Engel aufsteigen von Sonnenaufgang her, der trug das Siegel des lebendigen Gottes, und er rief mit lauter Stimme den vier Engeln zu, die Macht empfangen hatten, die Erde und das Meer zu beschädigen, 
[7:3] und sprach: "Beschädigt nicht die Erde noch das Meer noch die Bäume, bis wir die Knechte unseres Gottes versiegelt haben auf ihren Stirnen!" 
[7:4] Dann vernahm ich die Zahl der Versiegelten: es waren hundertvierundvierzigtausend aus allen Stämmen der Kinder Israels. 
[7:5] Aus dem Stamm Juda waren zwölftausend versiegelt, aus dem Stamm Ruben zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Gad zwölftausend. 
[7:6] Aus dem Stamm Asser zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Naphtali zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Manasse zwölftausend. 
[7:7] Aus dem Stamm Simeon zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Levi zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Isaschar zwölftausend. 
[7:8] Aus dem Stamm Sebulon zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Josef zwölftausend, aus dem Stamm Benjamin waren zwölftausend versiegelt. 
[7:9] Danach sah ich eine große Schar, die niemand zählen konnte, aus allen Geschlechtern, Stämmen, Völkern und Sprachen, die stand vor dem Thron und dem Lamm. Sie waren angetan mit weißen Kleidern und trugen Palmenzweige in den Händen. 
[7:10] Sie riefen mit lauter Stimme: / "Das Heil wird uns zuteil von unserem Gott, der auf dem Thron sitzt, und von dem Lamm." 
[7:11] Alle Engel standen rings um den Thron und um die Ältesten und die vier Lebewesen. Sie fielen vor dem Thron nieder auf ihr Angesicht, beteten Gott an 
[7:12] und sprachen: / "Ja, so ist's. Lob, Herrlichkeit und Weisheit, Dank und Ehre, Macht und Stärke gebühren unserem Gott in alle Ewigkeit. Amen." 
[7:13] Da nahm einer von den Ältesten das Wort und sprach zu mir: "Wer sind diese, die die weißen Kleider tragen, und woher sind sie gekommen?" 
[7:14] Ich antwortete ihm: "Mein Herr, du weißt es." Da sprach er zu mir: "Diese sind gekommen aus der großen Trübsal und haben ihre Kleider in des Lammes Blut gewaschen und gebleicht. 
[7:15] Darum stehen sie nun vor Gottes Thron und dienen ihm bei Tag und Nacht in seinem Tempel; und er, der auf dem Thron sitzt, wird sie in seinem Zelt schützen. 
[7:16] Sie wird nicht mehr hungern, nicht mehr dürsten; die Sonne und der Glutwind trifft sie nicht. 
[7:17] Denn das Lamm, das mitten vor dem Thron steht, wird sie weiden und leiten zu des Lebens Wasserquellen, und Gott wird alle Tränen aus ihren Augen wischen." 
[8:1] Als das Lamm das siebente Siegel löste, trat eine Stille ein im Himmel etwa eine halbe Stunde lang. 
[8:2] Ich sah die sieben Engel, die vor Gott stehen, und sie empfingen sieben Posaunen. 
[8:3] Dann kam ein anderer Engel und trat an den Altar. Der hatte ein goldenes Rauchfaß, und er empfing viel Weihrauch, damit er ihn zugleich mit den Gebeten aller Heiligen auf dem goldenen Altar vor dem Thron darbringe. 
[8:4] Und die Weihrauchwolke stieg zugleich mit den Gebeten der Heiligen aus des Engels Hand vor Gott empor. 
[8:5] Dann nahm der Engel das Rauchfaß, füllte es mit glühenden Kohlen vom Altar und schüttete es auf die Erde. Da folgten laute Donnerschläge, Blitze und Erdbeben. 
[8:6] Nun rüsteten sich die sieben Engel, die die sieben Posaunen hatten, sie zu blasen. 
[8:7] Der erste Engel stieß in die Posaune. Da kam Hagel und Feuer, mit Blut vermischt, und fiel auf die Erde nieder. Der dritte Teil der Erde verbrannte, der dritte Teil der Bäume verbrannte, und alles grüne Gras verbrannte. 
[8:8] Der zweite Engel stieß in die Posaune. Da ward eine Masse, die aussah wie ein großer, feuerflammender Berg, ins Meer geschleudert. Dadurch ward der dritte Teil des Meeres in Blut verwandelt, 
[8:9] der dritte Teil der Tiere, die im Meer lebten, starb, und der dritte Teil der Schiffe ging zugrunde. 
[8:10] Der dritte Engel stieß in die Posaune. Da fiel ein großer Stern vom Himmel, brennend wie eine Fackel. Der fiel auf den dritten Teil der Ströme und auf die Wasserquellen; 
[8:11] und des Sternes Name heißt "Wermut". Da ward der dritte Teil der Wasser zu Wermut, und viele Menschen starben von den Wassern, weil sie bitter geworden waren. 
[8:12] Der vierte Engel stieß in die Posaune. Da ward geschlagen der dritte Teil der Sonne, der dritte Teil des Mondes und der dritte Teil der Sterne, so daß ihr dritter Teil verfinstert wurde. Darum hatte nun der dritte Teil des Tages und ebenso der Nacht kein Licht. 
[8:13] Dann sah ich hin. Da hörte ich einen Adler, der hoch oben am Himmel flog, mit lauter Stimme rufen: "Weh, weh, weh den Erdbewohnern wegen der anderen Posaunenstimmen der drei Engel, die noch posaunen sollen!" 
[9:1] Nun stieß der fünfte Engel in die Posaune. Da sah ich einen Stern, der war vom Himmel her gefallen auf die Erde, und er empfing den Schlüssel zu dem Brunnen des Abgrunds. 
[9:2] Er tat des Abgrunds Brunnen auf. Da stieg ein Rauch empor aus diesem Brunnen wie eines großen Ofens Rauch, und es wurden die Sonne und die Luft verfinstert von dem Rauch des Brunnens. 
[9:3] Aus dem Rauch kamen Heuschrecken über die Erde; die empfingen Macht ähnlich wie irdische Skorpione. 
[9:4] Ihnen wurde gesagt, sie sollten dem Gras der Erde keinen Schaden tun, auch nicht dem Grün noch irgendeinem Baum, sondern nur den Menschen, die nicht Gottes Siegel an ihren Stirnen haben. 
[9:5] Aber sie durften sie nicht töten, sie sollten sie nur peinigen fünf Monate lang. Die Pein, die sie bereiteten, glich der Pein, die ein Skorpion verursacht, wenn er einen Menschen sticht. 
[9:6] In jenen Tagen werden die Menschen den Tod suchen und nicht finden; sie werden Sehnsucht haben zu sterben, doch der Tod entflieht vor ihnen. 
[9:7] Die Heuschrecken glichen Rossen, die zum Kampf gerüstet sind. Auf ihren Häuptern hatten sie einen Schmuck, der goldenen Kronen ähnlich war. Ihre Gesichter waren wie Menschengesichter, 
[9:8] ihre Haare waren so lang wie Weiberhaare, ihre Zähne glichen Löwenzähnen. 
[9:9] Sie trugen Panzer wie von Eisen. Das Rauschen ihrer Flügel klang wie das Rasseln von Kriegswagen, wenn viele Rosse in den Kampf stürmen. 
[9:10] Sie hatten Schwänze gleich Skorpionen und Stacheln; in ihren Schwänzen lag ihre Kraft, den Menschen fünf Monate lang Schaden zu tun. 
[9:11] Als König hatten sie über sich den Engel des Abgrunds; der heißt auf hebräisch Abaddón, und auf griechisch heißt er Apollyon. 
[9:12] Das erste Weh ist vorüber. Doch es kommen noch zwei Wehe hinterher. 
[9:13] Nun stieß der sechste Engel in die Posaune. Da hörte ich eine Stimme aus den vier Hörnern des goldenen Altars, der vor Gott steht, 
[9:14] die sprach zu dem sechsten Engel, der die Posaune hatte: "Laß die vier Engel los, die bei dem großen Strom Euphrat angebunden sind!" 
[9:15] Die vier Engel, die auf die Stunde, den Tag, den Monat und das Jahr bereitstanden, den dritten Teil der Menschen zu töten, wurden nun losgelassen. 
[9:16] Ihr Reiterheer hatte zweihundert Millionen Geschwader, ich hörte ihre Zahl. 
[9:17] Und dies war das Aussehen der Rosse und der Reiter, die ich in dem Gesichte sah: Die Reiter hatten rote, blaue und goldgelbe Panzer. Die Köpfe der Rosse waren wie Löwenköpfe, und aus ihren Mäulern gingen Feuer, Rauch und Schwefel. 
[9:18] Durch diese drei Plagen, das Feuer, den Rauch und den Schwefel, die aus ihren Mäulern gingen, wurde ein Drittel der Menschen getötet. 
[9:19] Denn die Kraft der Rosse liegt in ihrem Maul und in ihren Schwänzen. Ihre Schwänze sehen wie Schlangen aus und haben Köpfe, und mit diesen tun sie Schaden. 
[9:20] Die anderen Menschen, die bei diesen Plagen nicht ums Leben kamen, bekehrten sich trotzdem nicht von den Werken ihrer Hände, sondern fuhren fort, die bösen Geister anzubeten und die Götzenbilder aus Gold und Silber, Erz, Stein und Holz, die doch nicht sehen, hören und gehen können. 
[9:21] Sie bekehrten sich nicht von ihren Mordtaten, ihren Zaubereien, ihrer Hurerei und ihren Diebereien. 
[10:1] Dann sah ich einen anderen starken Engel aus dem Himmel niedersteigen. Der war bekleidet mit einer Wolke, ein Regenbogen war auf seinem Haupt, sein Antlitz strahlte wie die Sonne, und seine Füße glichen Feuersäulen. 
[10:2] In seiner Hand hatte er ein offenes kleines Buch. Er setzte seinen rechten Fuß auf das Meer, den linken auf das Land 
[10:3] und rief mit lauter Stimme, als wenn ein Löwe brüllt. Und als er rief, da ließen die sieben Donner ihre Stimme erschallen. 
[10:4] Als die sieben Donner geredet hatten, wollte ich ihre Botschaft niederschreiben. Da hörte ich eine Stimme aus dem Himmel sagen: "Versiegele, was die sieben Donner geredet haben, und schreibe es nicht nieder!" 
[10:5] Nun hob der Engel, den ich auf dem Meer und auf dem Land stehen sah, seine rechte Hand zum Himmel auf 
[10:6] und schwur bei dem, der lebt in alle Ewigkeit, der den Himmel und was darin ist, die Erde und was darauf ist und das Meer und was darin ist geschaffen hat: "Es soll jetzt kein Verzug mehr sein! 
[10:7] Sondern in den Tagen, wenn der siebente Engel sich anschickt zu posaunen, da vollendet sich der geheime Ratschluß Gottes, wie er ihn seinen Knechten, den Propheten, als Frohe Botschaft kundgetan." 
[10:8] Dann redete die Stimme, die ich vom Himmel aus gehört, ein andermal mit mir und sprach: "Geh, nimm das Buch, das offen daliegt in der Hand des Engels, der auf dem Meer und auf dem Land steht!" 
[10:9] Da ging ich zu dem Engel und bat ihn, mir das kleine Buch zu geben. Und er sprach zu mir: "Nimm und verzehre es! Es wird dir zwar in deinem Magen Bitterkeit bereiten, in deinem Mund aber wird es süß wie Honig sein." 
[10:10] So nahm ich denn das Büchlein aus des Engels Hand und aß es, und wirklich war's in meinem Mund süß wie Honig. Doch als ich es gegessen hatte, da ward es mir im Magen bitter. 
[10:11] Und eine Stimme sprach zu mir: "Du mußt noch einmal weissagen über viele Völker, Scharen, Sprachen und Könige." 
[11:1] Danach ward mir ein Rohr gegeben, einem Meßstab gleich, und eine Stimme sprach: / Steh auf und miß den Tempel Gottes mit dem Altar und denen, die dort anbeten! 
[11:2] Doch den äußeren Tempelvorhof laß aus und miß ihn nicht! Denn er ist den Heiden preisgegeben, und sie werden die heilige Stadt verwüsten zweiundvierzig Monate lang. 
[11:3] Ich will aber meinen zwei Zeugen Auftrag geben, und sie sollen weissagen zwölfhundertsechzig Tage lang, mit Säcken angetan. 
[11:4] Dies sind die beiden Ölbäume und die beiden Leuchter, die vor dem Herrn der Erde stehen. 
[11:5] Will sich jemand an ihnen vergreifen, so geht Feuer aus ihrem Mund und verzehrt ihre Feinde. Ja, will sich jemand an ihnen vergreifen, der soll auf diese Weise getötet werden. 
[11:6] Sie haben die Vollmacht, den Himmel zu verschließen, damit kein Regen falle in den Tagen ihrer Weissagung. Sie haben auch die Vollmacht, das Wasser in Blut zu verwandeln und die Erde zu schlagen mit allerlei Plagen, sooft sie wollen. 
[11:7] Wenn sie aber ihr Zeugnis vollendet haben, dann wird das Tier, das aus dem Abgrund steigt, mit ihnen kämpfen, er wird sie überwinden und töten. 
[11:8] Ihre Leichen werden liegen auf dem Marktplatz jener großen Stadt, die geistlich Sodom und Ägypten heißt, wo auch ihr Herr gekreuzigt worden ist. 
[11:9] Leute aus allen Völkern, Stämmen, Sprachen und Geschlechtern werden ihre Leichen drei und einen halben Tag daliegen sehen; aber sie werden nicht dulden, daß man ihre Leichen begrabe. 
[11:10] Denn die Erdbewohner freuen sich über ihren Tod und sind voll Jubel, ja sie werden einander Geschenke senden; denn diese beiden Propheten bereiteten den Erdbewohnern Qual. 
[11:11] Nach der halben Woche aber kam ein Lebenshauch von Gott in sie: sie stellten sich auf ihre Füße, und große Furcht erfaßte alle, die sie sahen. 
[11:12] Dann hörte ich, wie eine laute Stimme vom Himmel zu ihnen sprach: "Kommt hierher!" Da stiegen sie vor den Augen ihrer Feinde in einer Wolke zum Himmel auf. 
[11:13] Zu derselben Stunde geschah ein großes Erdbeben: der zehnte Teil der Stadt sank in Trümmer, und siebentausend Menschen fanden bei dem Erdbeben ihren Tod. Die Überlebenden aber wurden mit Furcht erfüllt und gaben dem Gott des Himmels die Ehre. 
[11:14] Das zweite Weh ist vorüber. Das dritte Weh kommt eilend. 
[11:15] Nun stieß der siebente Engel in die Posaune. Da erschallten laute Stimmen im Himmel, die sprachen: / "Die Herrschaft über die Welt gehört jetzt unserem Herrn und seinem Gesalbten, und er wird König sein in alle Ewigkeit." 
[11:16] Da fielen die vierundzwanzig Ältesten, die in Gottes Gegenwart auf ihren Thronen sitzen, auf ihr Angesicht; sie beteten Gott an 
[11:17] und sprachen: / Wir danken dir, Herr Gott, du Allgewaltiger, der ist und der da war; denn du hast deine große Macht an dich genommen und herrschst nun als König. 
[11:18] Die Völker sind in Wut geraten; darum ist dein Zorn entbrannt. Die Zeit ist da, da du die Toten richtest, den Lohn austeilst deinen Knechten, den Propheten, und den Heiligen samt allen, die deinen Nahmen fürchten, den Kleinen wie den Großen, und wo du über die Verderben bringst, die die Welt verderben." 
[11:19] Da öffnete sich der Tempel Gottes im Himmel, daß die Lade seines Bundes in seinem Tempel sichtbar wurde. Zugleich entstanden Blitze, laute Donnerschläge, Erdbeben und ein starkes Hagelwetter. 
[12:1] Dann erschien ein großes Zeichen im Himmel: ein Weib, das war mit der Sonne bekleidet, der Mond lag unter ihren Füßen, und auf ihrem Haupt trug sie eine Krone von zwölf Sternen. 
[12:2] Sie sah ihrer Niederkunft entgegen und schrie in Wehen und Kindesnöten. 
[12:3] Zugleich erschien ein anderes Zeichen im Himmel: ein großer feuerroter Drache, der hatte sieben Häupter und zehn Hörner, und auf seinen Häuptern (glänzten) sieben Kronen; 
[12:4] sein Schweif fegte den dritten Teil der Sterne des Himmels weg und warf sie nieder auf die Erde. Dieser Drache stellte sich vor das Weib, das im Begriff war zu gebären, um ihr Kindlein sofort nach der Geburt zu verschlingen. 
[12:5] Und sie gebar einen Sohn, einen kraftvollen Knaben, der alle Völker mit eisernem Stab weiden soll. Ihr Kind ward entrückt zu Gott und seinem Thron. 
[12:6] Das Weib entfloh in die Wüste: dort fand sie eine Stätte, von Gott bereitet, wo sie zwölfhundertsechzig Tage lang ernährt werden sollte. 
[12:7] Da entstand ein Kampf im Himmel: Michael und seine Engel stritten mit dem Drachen. Der Drache setzte sich zur Wehr mit seinen Engeln; 
[12:8] doch sie wurden überwunden, und ihres Bleibens war nicht länger mehr im Himmel. 
[12:9] Es ward hinabgestürzt der große Drache, die alte Schlange, die auch der Teufel oder der Satan heißt und die ganze Welt verführt; hinabgestürzt ward er zur Erde, und seine Engel mit ihm. 
[12:10] Dann hörte ich eine laute Stimme im Himmel rufen: / Jetzt sind erschienen unseres Gottes Heil und Kraft und Königreich, und sein Gesalbter hat die Macht empfangen. Denn der Verkläger unserer Brüder ist hinabgestürzt, der sie vor unserem Gott verklagt hat Tag und Nacht. 
[12:11] Sie haben über ihn gesiegt; als Waffen hatten sie des Lammes Blut und jenes Wort, durch das sie Zeugnis abgelegt. Dabei sind sie sogar bereit gewesen, ihr Leben in den Tod zu geben. 
[12:12] Darum freut euch, ihr Himmel, und alle, die ihr darin wohnt! Doch weh der Erde und dem Meer! Der Teufel ist zu euch hinabgekommen mit großem Grimm. Er weiß ja: seine Frist ist nur noch kurz." 
[12:13] Als der Drache sah, daß er hinabgestürzt war auf die Erde, verfolgte er das Weib, das den Knaben geboren hatte. 
[12:14] Das Weib aber empfing die beiden Flügel des großen Adlers, damit sie in die Wüste fliege an die ihr bestimmte Stätte, wo sie, sicher vor dem Grimm der Schlange, eine Zeit und (zwei) Zeiten und eine halbe Zeit ernährt werden sollte. 
[12:15] Da schoß die Schlange aus ihrem Maul einen Strom von Wasser hinter dem Weib her, um es in dieser Flut zu ertränken. 
[12:16] Doch die Erde kam dem Weib zu Hilfe: sie öffnete ihren Mund und verschluckte den Strom, den der Drache aus seinem Maul ergossen hatte. 
[12:17] Da ward der Drache grimmig über das Weib und ging hin, um zu streiten mit ihren anderen Kindern, die Gottes Gebote halten und das Jesuszeugnis treu bewahren. Ich trat nun an den Strand des Meeres. 
[13:1] Da sah ich aus dem Meer ein Tier aufsteigen, das hatte zehn Hörner und sieben Häupter. Auf seinen Hörnern trug es zehn Kronen, und auf seinen Häuptern standen gotteslästerliche Namen. 
[13:2] Dies Tier, das ich sah, glich einem Panther; seine Füße waren wie Bärenfüße, und sein Rachen war wie ein Löwenrachen. Und der Drache gab ihm seine Kraft, seinen Thron und große Macht. 
[13:3] Ich sah, wie eins von seinen Häuptern gleichsam einen Todesstreich empfangen hatte. Aber seine Todeswunde ward geheilt. Da beugte sich die ganze Welt bewundernd vor dem Tier. 
[13:4] Man betete den Drachen an, weil er dem Tier die Gewalt gegeben, und man betete auch das Tier an und sprach: "Wer gleicht dem Tier, und wer kann mit ihm streiten?" 
[13:5] Das Tier empfing ein Maul, das Reden ausstieß voller Stolz und Lästerung; und ihm wurde erlaubt, es zweiundvierzig Monate so zu treiben. 
[13:6] Es öffnete sein Maul zur Lästerung gegen Gott; es lästerte seinen Namen und seine Wohnung: jene, die im Himmel wohnen. 
[13:7] Es ward ihm auch erlaubt, mit den Heiligen zu kämpfen und sie zu überwinden. Ja es empfing Gewalt über alle Stämme, Völker, Sprachen und Geschlechter. 
[13:8] Alle Erdbewohner beteten es an: alle, deren Namen nicht seit Anbeginn der Welt verzeichnet sind im Lebensbuch des Lammes, das geopfert ist. 
[13:9] Wer Ohren hat, der höre: 
[13:10] Wer andere in Gefangenschaft führt, soll selbst in die Gefangenschaft wandern; wer andere mit dem Schwert tötet, soll selbst durchs Schwert getötet werden! Hier gilt es für die Heiligen, Standhaftigkeit und Treue zu beweisen. 
[13:11] Dann sah ich ein anderes Tier aufsteigen aus der Erde, das hatte zwei Hörner, ähnlich wie ein Lamm, es redete aber wie der Drache. 
[13:12] Es vollzog alle Befehle des ersten Tieres unter dessen Augen. Es brachte die Erde und ihre Bewohner dahin, das erste Tier, dessen Todeswunde heil geworden war, göttlich zu verehren. 
[13:13] Es tat auch große Wunderzeichen; sogar Feuer ließ es vor der Menschen Augen vom Himmel auf die Erde fallen. 
[13:14] Durch diese Wunderzeichen, die ihm verliehen wurden in des Tieres Gegenwart zu tun, verführte es die Erdbewohner. Ja es forderte sie auf, dem Tier, das trotz seiner Schwertwunde am Leben geblieben war, ein Standbild zu errichten. 
[13:15] Es empfing auch die Macht, dieses Bild des Tieres mit Leben zu erfüllen. Daher konnte des Tieres Bild sogar reden; und es erreichte, daß alle, die des Tieres Bild nicht anbeten wollten, getötet wurden. 
[13:16] Ja alle Leute, klein und groß, reich und arm, frei und unfrei, alle brachte es dazu, auf ihrer rechten Hand oder auf ihrer Stirn ein Zeichen anzunehmen. 
[13:17] Keiner sollte kaufen oder verkaufen dürfen, der nicht dies Zeichen hätte: entweder des Tieres Namen oder seines Namens Zahl. 
[13:18] Hier gilt es Weisheit! Wer Einsicht hat, der mag des Tieres Zahl berechnen; denn sie ist eines Menschen Zahl. Und zwar ist seine Zahl 666. 
[14:1] Ich schaute ein Gesicht: das Lamm stand auf dem Berg Zion, umgeben von hundertvierundvierzigtausend, die seinen Namen und seines Vaters Namen auf ihrer Stirn geschrieben trugen. 
[14:2] Auch hörte ich eine Stimme aus dem Himmel; die klang wie Meeresrauschen und starkes Donnerrollen. Die Stimme, die ich hörte, klang zugleich wie das Spiel von Saitenspielern, die ihre Harfen schlagen. 
[14:3] Sie sangen ein neues Lied vor dem Thron, den vier Lebewesen und den Ältesten, und niemand konnte dieses Lied erlernen als nur die Hundertvierundvierzigtausend, die von der Erde abgesondert und erkauft sind. 
[14:4] Diese haben sich nicht durch den Verkehr mit Weibern befleckt, denn sie sind (rein wie) Jungfrauen. Sie folgen dem Lamm, wohin es auch gehen mag. Sie sind aus der Menschheit erkauft worden als eine Erstlingsschar für Gott und das Lamm. 
[14:5] In ihrem Mund findet sich kein Trug; sie sind ganz ohne Fehl und Flecken. 
[14:6] Ich sah einen anderen Engel hoch oben am Himmel fliegen, der hatte den Erdbewohnern, ja allen Geschlechtern, Stämmen, Sprachen und Völkern eine seit Ewigkeit beschlossene Frohe Botschaft zu verkündigen. 
[14:7] Er rief mit lauter Stimme: "Fürchtet Gott und gebt ihm Ehre, denn die Stunde seines Gerichts ist nun da! Betet ihn an, der Himmel und Erde, Meer und Wasserquellen geschaffen hat!" 
[14:8] Ein zweiter Engel folgte ihm und sprach: / "Gefallen, gefallen ist das große Babylon, das von dem Glutwein seiner Buhlerei hat alle Völker trinken lassen!" 
[14:9] Ein dritter Engel folgte diesen beiden, der rief mit lauter Stimme: / Alle, die das Tier anbeten und sein Bild, und die ein Zeichen nehmen auf ihre Stirn oder ihre Hand, 
[14:10] die sollen trinken von dem Glutwein Gottes, der unvermischt in seinem Zornesbecher steht, und vor der heiligen Engel und des Lammes Augen in Feuer und in Schwefel Qualen leiden. 
[14:11] Der Rauch von ihrer Qual steigt auf in Ewigkeit, und ruhelos sollen sein bei Tag und Nacht die Menschen, die das Tier anbeten und sein Bild und seines Namens Zeichen an sich nehmen. 
[14:12] Hier gilt es standhaft auszuharren für die Heiligen, die treu bewahren die Gebote Gottes und den Jesusglauben." 
[14:13] Dann hörte ich eine Stimme aus dem Himmel, die sprach: "Schreibe: / 'Selig sind von nun an alle Toten, die in dem Herrn sterben!' — Ja — so spricht der Geist — sie sollen ruhen von ihren Mühen; denn ihre Werke folgen ihnen nach." 
[14:14] Ich nahm auch eine weiße Wolke wahr, und auf der Wolke sah ich einen sitzen gleich einem Menschensohn, der trug auf seinem Haupt eine goldene Krone, und eine scharfe Sichel hielt er in der Hand. 
[14:15] Da trat ein anderer Engel aus dem Tempel, der rief mit lauter Stimme zu dem, der auf der Wolke saß: "Leg deine Sichel an und ernte! Die Erntezeit ist da, denn reif geworden ist der Erde Ernte." 
[14:16] Jetzt ließ der, der auf der Wolke saß, seine Sichel über die Erde fahren, und die Erde wurde geerntet. 
[14:17] Ein anderer Engel trat aus dem Himmelstempel; auch er hielt eine scharfe Sichel. 
[14:18] Ein anderer Engel trat aus dem Altar hervor, der hatte Macht über das Feuer und sprach mit lauter Stimme zu dem, der die scharfe Sichel hatte: "Leg deine scharfe Sichel an und ernte die Trauben von dem Weinstock der Erde; denn seine Beeren sind nun reif!" 
[14:19] Da warf der Engel seine Sichel auf die Erde, er erntete die Trauben von dem Weinstock der Erde und warf sie in die große Kelter des Zornes Gottes. 
[14:20] Die Kelter ward außerhalb der Stadt getreten. Da floß Blut aus der Kelter hervor bis hinauf an die Zügel der Rosse, etwa vierzig Meilen weit. 
[15:1] Ich sah ein anderes Zeichen im Himmel, groß und wunderbar: sieben Engel mit den letzten sieben Plagen, womit sich Gottes Zorn vollendet. 
[15:2] Auch sah ich (eine weite Fläche) wie ein gläsern Meer, gemengt mit Feuer. An diesem Meer von Glas sah ich alle stehen, die in dem Kampf mit dem Tier, seinem Bild und seines Namens Zahl den Sieg errungen hatten. Sie priesen Gott auf Saitenspiel 
[15:3] und sangen das Lied Moses, des Knechtes Gottes, und des Lammes Lied mit diesen Worten: / Groß und wunderbar sind deine Werke, Herr Gott, du Allgewaltiger; gerecht und wahr sind deine Wege, du Völkerkönig! 
[15:4] Wer sollte dich nicht fürchten, Herr, nicht deinen Namen preisen? Denn du allein bist heilig. Alle Völker werden kommen und vor dir anbeten, denn dein gerechtes Walten hat sich offenbart." 
[15:5] Dann sah ich, wie sich der Tempel der himmlischen Stiftshütte öffnete. 
[15:6] Aus dem Tempel traten die sieben Engel mit den sieben Plagen. Sie trugen ein glänzend weißes Linnenkleid, und goldene Gürtel umgaben ihre Brust. 
[15:7] Eins der vier Lebewesen reichte den sieben Engeln sieben goldene Schalen, voll des Zornes Gottes, der da lebt in alle Ewigkeit. 
[15:8] Da füllte sich der Tempel mit Rauch, weil Gottes Herrlichkeit und seine Macht sich offenbarten; und niemand konnte in den Tempel gehen, bis die sieben Plagen der sieben Engel zu Ende waren. 
[16:1] Nun hörte ich eine laute Stimme aus dem Tempel zu den sieben Engeln sagen: "Geht, gießt jetzt die sieben Schalen des Zornes Gottes auf die Erde aus!" 
[16:2] Da ging der erste Engel hin und goß seine Schale auf die Erde. Da kamen bösartige, verderbliche Geschwüre auf alle, die des Tieres Zeichen trugen und sein Bild anbeteten. 
[16:3] Der zweite Engel goß seine Schale auf das Meer. Da wurde es zu Blut, wie Leichenblut, und alle Lebewesen, die im Meer waren, starben. 
[16:4] Der dritte Engel goß seine Schale auf die Flüsse und die Wasserquellen. Da wurden sie in Blut verwandelt. 
[16:5] Dann hörte ich den Engel der Gewässer sagen: "Gerecht bist du, der ist und der da war, du Heiliger, daß du also gerichtet hast! 
[16:6] Weil sie der Heiligen und Propheten Blut vergossen haben, hast du auch Blut sie trinken lassen. Sie haben's so verdient." 
[16:7] Und ich hörte den Altar sagen: "Ja, Herr Gott, du Allgewaltiger, wahrhaftig und gerecht sind deine Urteilssprüche." 
[16:8] Der vierte Engel goß seine Schale auf die Sonne, und sie empfing Gewalt, die Menschen mit Feuerglut zu quälen. 
[16:9] Da wurden die Menschen von gewaltiger Glut versengt. Trotzdem lästerten sie den Namen Gottes, der Macht hat über diese Plagen, und bekehrten sich nicht dazu, ihm Ehre zu geben. 
[16:10] Der fünfte Engel goß seine Schale auf den Thron des Tieres. Da ward sein Reich mit Finsternis bedeckt. Ja die Menschen zerbissen sich vor Schmerz die Zungen 
[16:11] und lästerten den Gott des Himmels wegen ihrer Schmerzen und Geschwüre. Aber von ihren bösen Werken bekehrten sie sich nicht. 
[16:12] Der sechste Engel goß seine Schale auf den großen Euphratstrom. Da trocknete sein Wasser aus, damit den Königen, die von Osten kommen sollen, der Weg gebahnt würde. 
[16:13] Dann sah ich aus des Drachen Maul und aus des Tieres Maul und aus dem Mund des falschen Propheten drei unreine Geister kommen, die Fröschen ähnlich waren 
[16:14] - es gibt ja böse Geister, die Wunderzeichen tun —. Die zogen aus zu den Königen der ganzen Erde, um sie zu sammeln für den Kampf, der an dem großen Tag Gottes, des Allgewaltigen, gehalten werden soll. 
[16:15] "Sieh, ich komme wie ein Dieb! Selig ist, der wacht und seine Kleider bereit hat, damit er nicht nackt gehen und seine Blöße zeigen müsse!" 
[16:16] Die bösen Geister sammelten die Könige an dem Ort, der auf hebräisch Harmagedon heißt. 
[16:17] Der siebente Engel goß seine Schale in die Luft. Da kam eine laute Stimme aus dem Tempel vom Thron her, die sprach: "Es ist geschehen!" 
[16:18] Nun folgten Blitze und laute Donnerschläge; und es entstand ein großes Erdbeben, wie noch nie eins dagewesen ist, solange Menschen auf Erden wohnen, so furchtbar und so schrecklich! 
[16:19] Die große Stadt barst in drei Teile auseinander, und die Städte der Völker sanken in Trümmer. So gedachte Gott des großen Babylon und reichte ihm dar den Becher des Glutweins seines Zornes. 
[16:20] Alle Inseln verschwanden, und Berge waren nicht mehr zu sehen. 
[16:21] Große Hagelstücke, etwa einen halben Zentner schwer, fielen auf die Menschen nieder. Aber die Menschen lästerten Gott wegen der Plage des Hagelwetters, denn diese Plage war sehr groß. 
[17:1] Da kam einer von den sieben Engeln, die die sieben Schalen hatten, redete mit mir und sprach: "Komm, ich will dir zeigen das Gericht über die große Buhlerin, die an großen Wassern wohnt, 
[17:2] mit der die Könige der Erde gebuhlt und an deren Buhlwein sich die Erdbewohner berauscht haben." 
[17:3] Dann führte er mich im Geist in eine Wüste. Dort sah ich ein Weib auf einem scharlachroten Tier sitzen. Dies Tier war ganz bedeckt mit Lästernamen und hatte sieben Häupter und zehn Hörner. 
[17:4] Das Weib war in Purpur und Scharlach gekleidet und ganz bedeckt mit Gold, Edelsteinen und Perlen. In ihrer Hand hielt sie einen goldenen Becher voller Greuel und gefüllt mit dem Schmutz ihrer Buhlerei. 
[17:5] Auf ihrer Stirn stand ein geheimnisvoller Name: Das große Babylon, die Mutter der Buhlerinnen und der Greuel auf Erden. 
[17:6] Ich sah das Weib berauscht von dem Blut der Heiligen und von dem Blut der Zeugen Jesu. Bei ihrem Anblick war ich sehr erstaunt. 
[17:7] Da sprach der Engel zu mir: "Warum bist du so erstaunt? Ich will dir kundtun das Geheimnis dieses Weibes und des Tieres mit den sieben Häuptern und den zehn Hörnern, von dem das Weib getragen wird. 
[17:8] Das Tier, das du gesehen, ist schon früher dagewesen und ist jetzt nicht mehr. Doch wird es wieder aus dem Abgrund steigen, und dann geht es für immer ins Verderben. Alle Erdbewohner, deren Namen nicht seit Anbeginn der Welt im Lebensbuch geschrieben stehen, werden staunen, wenn sie das Tier erblicken. Denn es ist schon früher dagewesen, ist jetzt nicht mehr und soll doch wieder dasein. 
[17:9] Hier gilt's, mit Weisheit nachzudenken! Die sieben Häupter bedeuten sieben Berge: auf diesen sitzt das Weib. Sie bedeuten aber auch sieben Könige. 
[17:10] Fünf von ihnen sind gefallen; der eine ist jetzt da. Der andere ist noch nicht gekommen; doch wenn er kommt, soll er nur eine kurze Weile bleiben. 
[17:11] Das Tier aber, das schon früher dagewesen und jetzt nicht mehr ist, ist selbst ein achter König; aber es ist auch einer von den sieben, und es geht ins Verderben. 
[17:12] Die zehn Hörner, die du gesehen, bedeuten zehn Könige. Sie sind noch nicht zur Macht gekommen; aber sie empfangen, wenn auch nur für eine kleine Weile, eine Herrschaft, wie sie Könige besitzen, und zwar gemeinsam mit dem Tier. 
[17:13] Diese (zehn Könige) haben einen Sinn und übertragen ihre Kraft und Macht dem Tier. 
[17:14] Sie werden mit dem Lamm kämpfen. Doch das Lamm wird sie besiegen, denn es ist der Herr aller Herren und der König aller Könige. Und seine Genossen — die Berufenen, Auserwählten und Getreuen — werden mit ihm überwinden." 
[17:15] Weiter sprach er zu mir: "Die Wasser, an deren Ufern du die Buhlerin hast sitzen sehen, bedeuten Völker und Scharen, Geschlechter und Sprachen. 
[17:16] Die zehn Hörner, die du gesehen — und das Tier selbst —, die werden die Buhlerin hassen und völlig ausplündern; ja sie werden ihr Fleisch verzehren und sie mit Feuer verbrennen. 
[17:17] Denn Gott hat es ihnen ins Herz gegeben, daß sie, um seinen Willen auszuführen, ganz in einem Sinn handeln und ihre Herrschaft so lange dem Tier übertragen, bis sich Gottes Worte erfüllt haben. 
[17:18] Das Weib, das du gesehen, ist die große Stadt, die über die Könige der Erde die Herrschaft führt." 
[18:1] Dann sah ich einen anderen Engel aus dem Himmel herniedersteigen, der war ausgerüstet mit großer Macht, so daß die Erde von dem Glanz seiner Herrlichkeit erleuchtet wurde. 
[18:2] Er rief mit gewaltiger Stimme: / Gefallen, gefallen ist Babylon, die große Stadt! Sie ist nun eine Teufelswohnung und ein Gefängnis aller unreinen Geister und ein Gefängnis aller unreinen und verhaßten Vögel. 
[18:3] Denn alle Völker haben von dem Glutwein ihrer Buhlerei getrunken; es haben mit ihr Buhlerei getrieben die Könige der Erde, und die Kaufleute auf Erden sind reich geworden durch ihre große Üppigkeit." 
[18:4] Eine andere Stimme aus dem Himmel hörte ich sagen: / Geht aus von ihr, mein Volk, damit ihr nicht teilhaftig werdet ihrer Sünden und nicht empfangt einen Teil von ihren Plagen! 
[18:5] Denn ihre Sünden reichen bis zum Himmel, und Gott gedenkt nun ihrer Frevel. 
[18:6] Tut ihr, wie sie getan, ja zahlt ihr zwiefach ihre Werke heim und schenkt ihr doppelt ein den Becher, den sie euch gereicht! 
[18:7] So sehr sie sich in Stolz erhoben und geschwelgt, so große Pein und Trauer fügt ihr zu! / Weil sie in ihrem Herzen spricht: 'Ich throne hier als Königin, bin keine Witwe und werde nimmer Trauer sehen', 
[18:8] darum werden an einem Tag ihre Plagen kommen: Tod, Leid und Hungersnot, ja Feuer soll sie niederbrennen bis zum Grund. Denn stark ist Gott der Herr, ihr Richter. 
[18:9] Es werden weinend klagen über sie die Könige der Erde, die mit ihr Buhlerei getrieben und geschwelgt, wenn sie den Rauch von ihrem Brand sehen. 
[18:10] Entsetzt von ihrer Plage, stehen sie von fern und rufen: 'Wehe, wehe! Babylon, du große, starke Stadt! In einer Stunde ist nun dein Gericht gekommen!' 
[18:11] Auch die Kaufleute der Erde werden weinend klagen über sie. / Denn niemand kauft nun ihre Waren mehr: 
[18:12] Die Waren von Gold und Silber, von Edelsteinen und Perlen, von feiner Leinwand, Purpur, Seide und Scharlach, all das edle Duftholz und Gerät von Elfenbein, all das Gerät aus feinstem Holz, aus Kupfer, Eisen und Marmor; 
[18:13] Zimt und Balsam nebst Gewürz und Salben, Weihrauch, Wein und Öl; Feinmehl und Weizen, Groß- und Kleinvieh; Rosse, Wagen und leibeigene Leute. 
[18:14] Auch all die Früchte, die dein Herz erfreuten, sind nun für dich dahin, und aller Glanz und Flitter ist dir hingeschwunden und nimmermehr zu finden. 
[18:15] Die mit solchen Waren handelten und an ihr reich geworden sind, die werden entsetzt vor ihrer Plage, von ferne stehen und unter Tränen klagen: 
[18:16] 'Weh, weh! Die große Stadt, die einst sich kleidete in feine Leinwand, Purpurstoff und Scharlach, und die von Gold, von Edelsteinen und von Perlen strotzte, 
[18:17] in einer Stunde hat sie alle Pracht verloren!' / Auch alle Steuerleute, alle Küstenfahrer, die Schiffer, und die sonst zur See beschäftigt sind, die alle blieben von ferne stehen. 
[18:18] Und als sie sahen den Rauch von ihrem Brand, da riefen sie mit lauter Stimme: 'Welche Stadt war zu vergleichen mit der großen Stadt?' 
[18:19] Sie warfen Staub auf ihre Häupter, und weinend und wehklagend riefen sie: 'Weh, weh! Die große Stadt, von deren Schätzen alle, die Schiffe auf dem Meer hatten, reich geworden sind, in einer Stunde ist sie wüst geworden!' 
[18:20] Frohlocke über ihren Sturz, o Himmel, frohlockt auch, ihr Heiligen, ihr Apostel und Propheten! Denn Gott hat euch an ihr gerächt." 
[18:21] Da nahm ein starker Engel einen Stein, der groß war wie ein Mühlstein, und schleuderte ihn ins Meer mit diesen Worten: / Mit solcher Wucht soll Babylon, die große Stadt, hinabgeschleudert werden und nimmermehr zu finden sein! 
[18:22] Kein Harfenspiel und kein Gesang, kein Flötenton und kein Trompetenschall soll fernerhin in dir erklingen, kein Künstler je in deinen Mauern wohnen! Kein Mühlrad soll in Zukunft in dir rauschen, 
[18:23] kein Licht der Lampe soll mehr in dir scheinen, kein Brautpaar soll sich mehr in deinen Mauern freuen! / Deine Kaufherren waren ja der Erde Fürsten, und alle Völker sind betört durch deine Zauberkünste. 
[18:24] In deinen Mauern ist vergossen der Propheten und der Heiligen Blut, ja aller derer Blut, die hingeschlachtet sind auf Erden." 
[19:1] Dann hörte ich, wie eine große Schar im Himmel mit lauter Stimme sang: / Halleluja! Das Heil, die Herrlichkeit und Macht gehören unserem Gott. 
[19:2] Wahrhaftig und gerecht sind seine Urteilssprüche: / Er hat die große Buhlerin gerichtet, die durch ihr Buhlen hat verderbt die Erde. / So hat er seiner Knechte Blut gerächt, das sie mit ihrer Hand vergossen." 
[19:3] Sie sangen weiter: / "Halleluja! Der Rauch von ihrem Brand steigt auf in Ewigkeit." 
[19:4] Da fielen die vierundzwanzig Ältesten und die vier Lebewesen vor Gott, der auf dem Thron sitzt, anbetend nieder und sprachen: "Amen. Halleluja!" 
[19:5] Und von dem Thron ging eine Stimme aus, die sprach: / "Preist unseren Gott, ihr seine Knechte alle; preist ihn, die ihr ihn fürchtet, beide klein und groß!" 
[19:6] Dann hörte ich, wie eine große Schar gleich Meeresrauschen und starkem Donnerrollen also sang: / Halleluja! Der Herr hat nun die Herrschaft angetreten, er, unser Gott, der Allgewaltige. 
[19:7] Laßt freudig uns frohlocken und ihm die Ehre geben! Denn des Lammes Hochzeit ist gekommen, und sein Weib hat sich bereitet. 
[19:8] Sie hat sich kleiden dürfen in glänzend reine Leinwand. Die Leinwand ist der Heiligen Gerechtigkeit." 
[19:9] Und er sprach zu mir: "Schreibe: 'Selig alle, die zu des Lammes Hochzeitsmahl geladen sind'!" Dann fuhr er fort: "Dies sind wahrhaftig Gottes Worte." 
[19:10] Da fiel ich ihm zu Füßen, um ihn anzubeten. Er aber sprach zu mir: "Tu das nicht! Ich bin (ja nur) dein Mitknecht und (der Mitknecht) deiner Brüder, die das Jesuszeugnis treu bewahren. Bete Gott an!" / Das Jesuszeugnis ist der Geist der Weissagung. 
[19:11] Darauf sah ich den Himmel offen, und es erschien ein weißes Roß. Sein Reiter heißt "Treu und Wahrhaftig"; er richtet und kämpft mit Gerechtigkeit. 
[19:12] Seine Augen leuchteten wie Feuerflammen. Auf seinem Haupt trug er viele Königskronen. Ein Name war ihm angeschrieben, den niemand kennt als er allein. 
[19:13] Das Oberkleid, das ihn umhüllte, war in Blut getaucht. Sein Name ist "Gottes Wort". 
[19:14] Die Himmelsheere, angetan mit weißer reiner Leinwand, folgten ihm auf weißen Rossen. 
[19:15] Aus seinem Mund geht hervor ein scharfes Schwert, womit er niederschlagen soll die Völker. Er wird sie mit eisernem Stab weiden, und er tritt die Kelter des Glutweins des Zornes Gottes, des Allgewaltigen. 
[19:16] Auf seinem Oberkleid, und zwar an seiner Hüfte, trägt er geschrieben diesen Namen: König der Könige und Herr der Herren. 
[19:17] Und ich sah einen Engel stehen im vollen Sonnenglanz, der rief mit lauter Stimme allen Vögeln zu, die hoch oben am Himmel flogen: "Eilt herbei und sammelt euch zu dem großen Mahl, das euch Gott bereitet! 
[19:18] Ihr sollt verzehren das Fleisch der Könige, das Fleisch der Feldobersten und das Fleisch der starken Helden, das Fleisch der Rosse und der Reiter, das Fleisch von Leuten aller Art: von Freien und Leibeigenen, von Kleinen und von Großen." 
[19:19] Dann sah ich das Tier und die Könige der Erde. Sie hatten ihre Heere versammelt, um mit dem Reiter auf dem Roß und mit seinem Heer Krieg zu führen. 
[19:20] Doch das Tier ward gefangen und mit ihm der falsche Prophet, der vor seinen Augen die Wunder getan, wodurch er die verführte, die des Tieres Zeichen trugen und sein Bild anbeteten. Lebendig wurden beide in den Feuersee geworfen, der mit Schwefel brennt. 
[19:21] Die anderen aber fielen durch das Schwert, das aus dem Mund dessen ging, der auf dem Roß saß; und alle Vögel wurden satt von ihrem Fleisch. 
[20:1] Dann sah ich einen Engel aus dem Himmel niedersteigen, der hielt den Schlüssel zum Abgrund und eine große Kette in seiner Hand. 
[20:2] Er griff den Drachen, die alte Schlange, den Teufel, den Satan, band ihn für tausend Jahre 
[20:3] und warf ihn in den Abgrund. Dann verschloß er über ihm den Eingang und legte ein Siegel darauf, damit er bis zu dem Ablauf der tausend Jahre die Völker nicht mehr verführe. Nach dieser Zeit muß er (noch einmal) für eine kleine Weile losgelassen werden. 
[20:4] Und ich sah Throne. Darauf setzten sie sich nieder, und sie empfingen Vollmacht, das Gericht zu halten. / Auch sah ich die Seelen derer, die enthauptet waren, weil sie von Jesus Zeugnis abgelegt und Gottes Wort verkündigt, sowie die Seelen jener, die das Tier und sein Bild nicht angebetet noch das Zeichen auf ihre Stirn und ihre Hand genommen hatten. Sie (alle) wurden wieder lebendig und herrschten tausend Jahre lang als Könige mit Christus. 
[20:5] - Die anderen Toten aber wurden erst nach Ablauf der tausend Jahre wieder lebendig. Dies ist die erste Auferstehung. 
[20:6] Selig und heilig ist, wer teilhat an der ersten Auferstehung! Über sie hat der zweite Tod keine Gewalt, sondern sie werden Priester Gottes und Christi sein und mit ihm in den tausend Jahren als Könige herrschen. 
[20:7] Wenn aber die tausend Jahre zu Ende sind, so wird der Satan aus seinem Gefängnis losgelassen werden. 
[20:8] Dann geht er aus, um die Völker Gog und Magog, die an den vier Enden der Erde wohnen, zu verführen und sie so zahlreich wie Sand am Meer zum Kampf zu versammeln. 
[20:9] Sie zogen hinauf über die Erde, so weit sie ist, und umringten das Heerlager der Heiligen und die geliebte Stadt. Da fiel Feuer vom Himmel und verzehrte sie. 
[20:10] Und ihr Verführer, der Teufel, ward in den Feuer- und Schwefelsee geworfen, wo auch das Tier und der falsche Prophet sind, und sie sollen Tag und Nacht gequält werden bis in alle Ewigkeit. 
[20:11] Dann sah ich einen großen, glänzenden Thron und den, der darauf saß. Vor dessen Antlitz flohen die Erde und der Himmel, und keine Stätte fand sich mehr für sie. 
[20:12] Ich sah die Toten, groß und klein, vor dem Thron stehen, und Bücher wurden aufgeschlagen. Auch ein anderes Buch, das Buch des Lebens, ward geöffnet. Und die Toten wurden gerichtet nach ihren Werken, so wie es in diesen Büchern aufgezeichnet war. 
[20:13] Das Meer gab die Toten zurück, die es barg; auch der Tod und die Unterwelt gaben ihre Toten heraus, und jeder ward gerichtet nach seinen Werken. 
[20:14] Dann wurden Tod und Unterwelt in den Feuersee geworfen. Dieser Feuersee ist der zweite Tod. 
[20:15] Wer nicht in dem Lebensbuch verzeichnet stand, der wurde in den Feuersee geworfen. 
[21:1] Dann sah ich einen neuen Himmel und eine neue Erde. Denn der erste Himmel und die erste Erde waren nicht mehr da, und das Meer war verschwunden. 
[21:2] Darauf sah ich die heilige Stadt, ein neues Jerusalem, von Gott aus dem Himmel niedersteigen, so herrlich wie eine für ihren Bräutigam geschmückte Braut. 
[21:3] Auch hörte ich eine laute Stimme von dem Thron her rufen: / Gottes Hütte ist jetzt bei den Menschen! Er wird bei ihnen wohnen, und sie sind sein Volk. Er selbst wird unter ihnen weilen als ihr Gott 
[21:4] und wird von ihren Augen alle Tränen wischen. Es wird kein Tod mehr sein, kein Trauern, keine Klage und kein Leid. Denn was einst war, ist nun vergangen." 
[21:5] Der auf dem Thron saß, sprach: "Ich mache jetzt alles neu." Dann fuhr er fort: "Schreib diese Worte nieder, denn sie sind zuverlässig und wahrhaftig!" 
[21:6] Weiter sprach er zu mir: "Es ist geschehen! Ich bin das A und das O, der Anfang und das Ende. Umsonst will ich dem Durstigen zu trinken geben von dem Quell des Lebenswassers. 
[21:7] Wer siegt, soll dies ererben: ich will sein Gott sein, und er soll mein Sohn sein. 
[21:8] Die Verzagten aber, die Ungläubigen, die Unreinen, die Mörder, die Unzüchtigen, die Zauberer, die Götzendiener und alle Lügner — die sollen ihre Stätte finden in dem See, der mit Feuer und Schwefel brennt. Das ist der zweite Tod." 
[21:9] Da kam einer von den sieben Engeln, die vorher die sieben Schalen mit den letzten sieben Plagen hatten, und sprach zu mir: "Komm, ich will dir die Braut, das Weib des Lammes zeigen!" 
[21:10] Im Geist führte er mich nun auf einen großen, hohen Berg und zeigte mir die heilige Stadt Jerusalem, wie sie von Gott aus dem Himmel herabstieg, 
[21:11] erfüllt mit Gottes Herrlichkeit. Ihr Glanz strahlte wie köstlicher Edelstein, wie durchsichtiger Jaspis. 
[21:12] Sie hatte eine große, hohe Mauer mit zwölf Toren. An den Toren standen zwölf Engel, und (in den Toren) waren Namen eingegraben: die Namen der zwölf Stämme der Kinder Israel. 
[21:13] Drei Tore lagen nach Osten, drei nach Norden, drei nach Süden und drei nach Westen. 
[21:14] Die Mauer der Stadt hatte zwölf Grundsteine; darauf standen zwölf Namen: die Namen der zwölf Apostel des Lammes. 
[21:15] Der Engel, der mit mir redete, hatte ein goldenes Meßrohr, um die Stadt, ihre Tore und ihre Mauer damit zu messen. 
[21:16] Die Stadt bildete ein Viereck, und ihre Länge war so groß wie ihre Breite. Er maß die Stadt mit seinem Rohr: das Ergebnis war dreihundert Meilen. Die Länge, die Breite und die Höhe der Stadt waren gleich. 
[21:17] Dann maß er ihre Mauer: das Ergebnis war hundertvierundvierzig Ellen, und zwar gemessen nach Menschenmaß, das auch das Maß des Engels war. 
[21:18] Die Mauer war ganz aus Jaspis und die Stadt selbst aus lauterem Gold, das durchsichtig war wie reines Glas. 
[21:19] Die Grundsteine der Stadtmauer waren mit allerlei köstlichen Edelsteinen geziert. Der erste Grundstein war aus Jaspis, der zweite aus Saphir, der dritte aus Chalzedon, der vierte aus Smaragd, 
[21:20] der fünfte aus Sardonyx, der sechste aus Sarder, der siebente aus Chrysolith, der achte aus Beryll, der neunte aus Topas, der zehnte aus Chrysopras, der elfte aus Hyazinth, der zwölfte aus Amethyst. 
[21:21] Die zwölf Tore waren zwölf Perlen; jedes Tor bestand aus einer einzigen Perle. Der Marktplatz der Stadt war aus lauterem Gold (und glänzte) wie Spiegelglas. 
[21:22] Ich sah keinen Tempel in der Stadt; denn Gott der Herr, der Allgewaltige, ist ihr Tempel und das Lamm. 
[21:23] Die Stadt braucht nicht Sonnenlicht, nicht Mondlicht; denn die Herrlichkeit Gottes strahlt in ihr, und ihre Leuchte ist das Lamm. 
[21:24] In ihrem Licht werden die Völker wandeln, und die Könige der Erde werden ihr die herrlichsten Geschenke bringen. 
[21:25] Tagsüber — denn Nacht wird's dort nicht geben — sollen ihre Tore nie geschlossen werden, 
[21:26] so daß man fort und fort die kostbaren Schätze der Völker in ihre Mauern bringen kann. 
[21:27] Doch nie darf in sie eingehen irgend etwas Unreines, besonders keiner, der Greuel übt und Lügen redet. Nur solche finden Einlaß, die in des Lammes Lebensbuch verzeichnet sind. 
[22:1] Dann zeigte mir der Engel einen Strom von Lebenswasser, klar wie Kristall, der von dem Thron Gottes und des Lammes ausging. 
[22:2] Zwischen dem Marktplatz der Stadt und dem Strom standen auf beiden Seiten Lebensbäume, die (jährlich) zwölf Arten Früchte brachten, jeden Monat ihre besondere Frucht; und die Blätter der Bäume dienten als Arznei für die Völker. 
[22:3] Dort wird es nichts mehr geben, was unter einem Fluch steht. Denn Gottes und des Lammes Thron ist in der Stadt. Seine Knechte werden ihm dort anbetend dienen, 
[22:4] sie werden sein Antlitz schauen, und sein Name wird geschrieben stehen auf ihrer Stirn. 
[22:5] Nacht wird dort nicht mehr sein. Man bedarf auch keiner Lampen, keines Sonnenlichtes; denn Gott der Herr wird sie mit seinem Licht bestrahlen. So herrschen sie als Könige in alle Ewigkeit. 
[22:6] Dann sprach er zu mir: "Diese Worte sind zuverlässig und wahrhaftig! Der Herr, der Gott der Geister der Propheten, hat seinen Engel gesandt, um seinen Knechten kundzutun, was bald geschehen soll. 
[22:7] Sieh, ich komme bald! Selig, wer die Worte der Weissagung in diesem Buch zu Herzen nimmt!" 
[22:8] Ich, Johannes, habe dies gehört und gesehen. Und als ich es gehört und gesehen hatte, da fiel ich dem Engel, der es mir gezeigt, zu Füßen, um ihn anzubeten. 
[22:9] Er aber sprach zu mir: "Tu das nicht! Ich bin (ja nur) dein Mitknecht und (der Mitknecht) deiner Brüder, der Propheten, und aller, die die Worte dieses Buches zu Herzen nehmen. Bete Gott an!" 
[22:10] Dann fuhr er fort: "Versiegele nicht die Worte der Weissagung in diesem Buch, denn die Zeit ist nahe! 
[22:11] Der Übeltäter mag noch weiter übeltun, der Schuldbefleckte mag sich weiterhin beflecken. Der Gerechte aber übe auch fernerhin Gerechtigkeit, und der Heilige halte sich auch weiter heilig!" 
[22:12] Sieh, ich komme bald und bringe meinen Lohn mit mir, um jedem zu vergelten nach seinen Werken. 
[22:13] Ich bin das A und das O, der Erste und der Letzte, der Anfang und das Ende. 
[22:14] Selig sind, die ihre Kleider waschen: die sollen von der Frucht des Lebensbaumes essen und durch die Tore eingehen in die Stadt! 
[22:15] Draußen aber bleiben die Hunde, die Zauberer, die Unzüchtigen, die Mörder, die Götzendiener und alle, die die Lüge lieben und üben. 
[22:16] Ich, Jesus, habe meinen Engel gesandt, um euch für die Gemeinden diese Offenbarung kundzutun. Ich bin der Wurzelsproß aus Davids Stamm, der helle Morgenstern. 
[22:17] Der Geist und die Braut sprechen: "Komm!" Und wer es hört, der spreche: "Komm!" Wen da dürstet, der komme; und wer es begehrt, der nehme von dem Lebenswasser umsonst! 
[22:18] Allen, die die Worte der Weissagung in diesem Buch hören, erkläre ich feierlich: Wer diesen Worten etwas zufügt, dem wird Gott die Plagen zufügen, wovon in diesem Buch die Rede ist. 
[22:19] Und wer von den Worten des Buches dieser Weissagung etwas wegnimmt, dem wird Gott seinen Anteil nehmen an dem Baum des Lebens und an der heiligen Stadt, die in diesem Buch beschrieben sind. 
[22:20] Der diese Offenbarung kundtut, spricht: "Ja, ich komme bald!" / Amen! Komm, Herr Jesus! 
[22:21] Die Gnade des Herrn Jesus Christus sei mit allen Heiligen! Amen.
