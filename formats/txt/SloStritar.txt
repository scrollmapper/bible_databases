### Psalms

[1:1] Blagor možu, ki ne hodi po sovetu krivičnih in ne stopa na grešnikov pot ter ne sedeva v zboru zasmehovalcev; 
[1:2] Nego veselje njegovo je v postavi Gospodovi, in postavo njegovo premišljuje noč in dan. 
[1:3] Je namreč kakor drevo zasajeno ob vodnih potocih, katero sad svoj rodi o svojem času, in listje njegovo ne odpada: zatorej karkoli bode počel, posrečilo se mu bode. 
[1:4] Ne tako krivični; nego kakor pleve, katere veter raznaša. 
[1:5] Zatorej ne ostanejo krivični v óni sodbi; ne grešniki v zboru pravičnih. 
[1:6] Ker Gospod pozna pravičnih pot; pot pa krivičnih izgine. 
[2:1] Zakaj hrumé narodi in ljudstva si izmišljajo prazno? 
[2:2] Zemlje kralji vstajajo in prvaki se posvetujejo skupaj zoper Gospoda in zoper maziljenca njegovega: 
[2:3] Raztrgajmo njih vezí in sè sebe vrzimo njih debele vrvi! 
[2:4] Sedeči v nebesih se smeje; zasmehuje jih Gospod. 
[2:5] Tedaj jih ogovorí v jezi svoji, in v srdu svojem jih prestraši: 
[2:6] Saj sem jaz pomazilil kralja svojega ter postavil čez Sijon, gôro svetosti svoje. 
[2:7] Oznanim naj sklep: Gospod mi je rekel: Sin si moj, jaz sem te danes rodil. 
[2:8] Prosi me, in narode ti dam v posest in kraje zemlje v pravico posesti tvoje. 
[2:9] Zdrobiš jih s šibo železno; kakor prsteno posodo jih razsuješ. 
[2:10] Zdaj torej, kralji, poslušajte; poduk sprejmite, o zemlje sodniki! 
[2:11] V svetem strahu služite Gospodu, in radujte se v trepetu! 
[2:12] Poljubite Sina, da se ne razsrdi in ne poginete na potu, ako se le kolikaj razvname jeza njegova; blagor vsem, kateri pribegajo do njega. 
[3:1] Psalm Davidov, ko je bežal pred Absalomom, sinom svojim. 
[3:2] Gospod, koliko je sovražnikov mojih, koliko jih vstaja proti meni! 
[3:3] Koliko jih govori za dušo mojo: Ni je pomoči njej v Bogu nobene. 
[3:4] Ti pa, Gospod, ščit si meni, slava moja, in glavo mojo vzdiguješ. 
[3:5] Z glasom svojim vpijočemu v Gospoda odgovoril mi je z gore svetosti svoje. 
[3:6] Jaz sem ležal in spal, zbudil sem se, ker Gospod me podpira. 
[3:7] Ne bodem se bal ljudstva tisočin, katere bodo okrog razpostavili proti meni. 
[3:8] Vstani, Gospod; reši me, moj Bog, ki si udaril vse sovražnike moje po čeljusti, zobe zdrobil krivičnim. 
[3:9] Gospodovo je rešenje; nad ljudstvom tvojim blagoslov tvoj! 
[4:1] Načelniku godbe na strune; psalm Davidov. 
[4:2] Ko te kličem, usliši me, Bog pravice moje; v stiski dal si mi prostora; milosten mi bodi in poslušaj molitev mojo. 
[4:3] Sinovi človeški, doklej bodi slava moja v nečast? ljubili bodete ničnost? hodili za lažjo? 
[4:4] Spoznajte vendar, da si je Gospod posebe odbral njega, katerega prijazno sprejema; da bode uslišal Gospod, ko ga bodem zaklical. 
[4:5] Prestrašite se in ne grešite; mislite v srci svojem, na ležišči svojem in mirujte! 
[4:6] Darujte daritve pravice, in zaupanje imejte v Gospoda. 
[4:7] Mnogi govoré: O da bi vživali dobro! Dvigni nad nas svetlobo obličja svojega, Gospod! 
[4:8] Vlij radost v srce moje, večjo nego o času, ko spravljajo žito svoje in vino svoje obilno. 
[4:9] V miru ležem in zdajci zaspim; ker ti sam, Gospod, daješ, da prebivam brez skrbi. 
[5:1] Načelniku godbe na piščali; psalm Davidov. 
[5:2] Besede moje čuj, Gospod; ozri se na premišljevanje moje. 
[5:3] Poslušaj vpitja mojega glas, kralj moj in Bog moj: ker pri tebi imam molitev. 
[5:4] Gospod, zgodaj bodeš slišal glas moj; zgodaj bodem govoril pred teboj in čakal. 
[5:5] Ker ti nisi Bog mogočni, kateri bi se radoval krivice; pred teboj ne bode prebivalo hudo. 
[5:6] Blazni ne stopajo ti pred óči; sovražiš vse, kateri delajo krivico. 
[5:7] Pogubiti hočeš nje, ki laž govoré; moža krvoželjnega in zvijačnega studi Gospod. 
[5:8] Jaz pa vnidem obdan z obilnostjo milosti tvoje v hišo tvojo; priklonim se proti hramu svetosti tvoje v svetem strahu tvojem. 
[5:9] Gospod, spremljaj me v pravici svoji zavoljo zalezovalcev mojih; pot svojo ugladi pred menoj. 
[5:10] Ker v ustih njihovih ni pravice; notranjost njih: nadloge, grob odprt njih grlo; z jezikom svojim se dobrikajo zvijačno. 
[5:11] Pokôri jih, o Bog; izpodleté naj v naklepih svojih; pahni jih dol po obilosti njih pregréh, ker upirajo se zoper tebe. 
[5:12] In veselili se bodo vsi, kateri pribegajo k tebi; na veke bodo prepevali, katerim bodeš bramba, in radovali se bodo v tebi ljubitelji tvojega imena. 
[5:13] Ker ti blagoslavljaš pravičnega, Gospod, delaš, da ga milost krije kakor ščit. 
[6:1] Načelniku godbe na strune po osmini; psalm Davidov. 
[6:2] Gospod, v jezi svoji ne pokôri me; in v srdu svojem ne tepi me. 
[6:3] Milosten mi bodi, Gospod, ker opešal sem: ozdravi me, Gospod, ker preplašene so kosti moje. 
[6:4] In duša moja je preplašena silno, ti torej, Gospod, doklej? 
[6:5] Povrni se, Gospod; otmi dušo mojo, po milosti svoji reši me. 
[6:6] Ker spomina nate ni v smrti sami; v grobu kdo te bode slavil? 
[6:7] Utrujen sem v zdihovanji svojem; storil sem, da plava vso noč postelja moja; sè solzami svojimi sem raztopil ležišče svoje. 
[6:8] Otemnelo je od žalovanja moje oko; postaralo se je med vsemi mojimi zatiralci. 
[6:9] Poberite se od mene vsi, ki delate krivico; ker Gospod posluša glas mojega joka. 
[6:10] Gospod posluša prošnjo mojo; Gospodu je prijetna molitev moja. 
[6:11] Osramoté se naj in preplašijo silno vsi sovražniki moji; vrnejo se naj, osramoté pri tej priči. 
[7:1] Pesem meševita Davidova, katero je pel Gospodu na besede Kusa Benjaminca. 
[7:2] Gospod, Bog moj, k tebi pribegam; reši me vseh preganjalcev mojih in oprosti me. 
[7:3] Da ne zgrabi kakor lev duše moje in raztrga, ko ni pomočnika. 
[7:4] Gospod, Bog moj, ako sem storil tisto, ako je krivica na rokah mojih: 
[7:5] Ako sem storil hudo v miru živečemu z menoj, ki sem mu rad pomagal, kateri me je zatiral po krivem: 
[7:6] Preganja naj sovražnik dušo mojo in dohiti ter potepta na tleh življenje moje; in storí naj, da v prahu biva slava moja. 
[7:7] Vstani, Gospod, v jezi svoji; dvigni se silno razkačen proti njim, ki me zatirajo; in čuj nad menoj, sodbo si zapovedal. 
[7:8] Torej narodov zbor naj te obdá in nad njim vrni se v višavo. 
[7:9] Gospod sodi ljudstva; sodi me, Gospod, po pravičnosti moji in po nedolžnosti moji razsodi zame. 
[7:10] Propade naj, prosim, zlo krivičnih, in pravičnega utrdi; kakor preiskuješ srca in obisti, Bog pravični. 
[7:11] Ščit moj je v Bogu, ki daje blaginjo pravičnim v srci, 
[7:12] V Bogu, ki je pravičnemu bramba in Bogu mogočnem, ki se srdi vsak dan. 
[7:13] Ako se ne izpreobrne krivični, nabrusi svoj meč; lok svoj je napél in pomeril vanj. 
[7:14] Pomeril je vanj smrtno orožje; pušice svoje zgrabi zoper divjajoče. 
[7:15] Glej, rodil bode ničemurnost; kakor je spočel nadlogo, tako bode rodil laž. 
[7:16] Vodnjak je kopal in izglobal ga; vanj je planil, v jami opravljat delo svoje. 
[7:17] Povrne se nadloga njegova na glavo njegovo in nad téme njegovo pride njegova krivica. 
[7:18] Slaviti hočem Gospoda po pravici njegovi in prepeval bodem imenu Gospoda najvišjega. 
[8:1] Načelniku godbe pri postaji Gitajski, psalm Davidov. 
[8:2] Gospod, kralj naš, kako veličastno je ime tvoje na vesoljni zemlji, kateri razodevaš nadnebeško lepoto svojo. 
[8:3] Iz ust otrok in dojencev si ustanovil si utrjeno hvalo, zavoljo sovražnikov svojih, da krotiš neprijatelja in maščevalca. 
[8:4] Ko ogledujem nebesa tvoja, prstov tvojih delo, mesec in zvezde, ki si jih napravil; 
[8:5] Kaj je človek, da se ga spominjaš, ali sin človekov, da ga obiskuješ! 
[8:6] Malo si ga sicer postavil pod angele, a venčal si ga sè slavo in veličastvom. 
[8:7] Postavil si ga čez dela svojih rók; vse si položil pod noge njegove: 
[8:8] Drobnico in goveda, kolikor jih je, in tudi poljske živali; 
[8:9] Tice pod nebom in ribe v morji; karkoli se izprehaja po morskih stezah. 
[8:10] Gospod, kralj naš, kako veličastno je ime tvoje na vesoljni zemlji! 
[9:1] Načelniku godbe, visoke do srednje, psalm Davidov. 
[9:2] Slavil bodem, Gospod, iz vsega srca svojega, oznanjal vsa čudovita dela tvoja, 
[9:3] Veselil se bodem in radoval v tebi, prepeval bodem tvojemu imenu, Najvišji: 
[9:4] Da sovražniki moji umikajoč se padajo in ginejo pred obličjem tvojim. 
[9:5] Ker sodil si pravico mojo in pravdo mojo, sedel si na prestolu, o branitelj pravice. 
[9:6] Pokaral si narode, pogubil krivičnega, ime njih si izbrisal na večne čase. 
[9:7] 0 sovražnik, konec je razdevanja na veke, in uničil si mesta njih, njih spomin je poginil. 
[9:8] A Gospod bode sedel na veke, pripravljajoč na sodbo prestol svoj. 
[9:9] In sam bode sodil svet pravično, pravde razsojal narodom po vsej pravici. 
[9:10] In Gospod bode grad na višini siromaku, grad na višini v časih, ko je v stiski. 
[9:11] Zaupanje torej bodo imeli v té, kateri poznajo ime tvoje, ker ne zapustiš, Gospod, njih, kateri te iščejo. 
[9:12] Prepevajte Gospoda, ki sedí na Sijonu, oznanjujte ljudstvom dela njegova. 
[9:13] On, ki maščuje kri v moritvi prelito, spominja se njih, ne zabi vpitja siromakov ubozih. 
[9:14] Milost mi izkaži, Gospod, ozri se v ponižanje moje od sovražnikov mojih, dvigni me izpred smrtnih vrât: 
[9:15] Da oznanjam vesoljno slavo tvojo med vrati hčere Sijonske, radujem se v blaginji tvoji. 
[9:16] Pogreznili so se narodi v jamo, katero so bili napravili; v mrežo, katero zo bili skrili, vjela se je njih noga. 
[9:17] Pokazal se je Gospod po sodbi, katero je storil; v svojem lastnem delu zapletel se je krivični; vsega pomiselka vredno! 
[9:18] Nazaj se bodo podili krivični noter do groba; vsi narodi, ki so pozabili Boga. 
[9:19] Ker siromak naj se ne pozabi nikdar: ubogih upanje ne pogine vekomaj. 
[9:20] Vstani, Gospod, da se ne ojači človek; sodba pridi nad narode pred obličjem tvojim. 
[9:21] V strah jih primi, Gospod; siloma naj spoznajo narodi, da so umrjoči. 
[10:1] Zakaj bivaš v daljavi, Gospod! zakaj se skrivaš v časih, ko smo v stiski? 
[10:2] Prevzetnost krivičnega hudo straši siromaka ubozega; zgrabijo se naj v naklepih, katere izmišljajo. 
[10:3] Ker krivični hvali dušo svojo v njenem hrepenenji, in njega, ki išče dobička, blagoslavlja, draži Gospoda. 
[10:4] Krivični v napuhu svojega obraza: On ne kaznuje, ni Boga, té so vse misli njegove. 
[10:5] Varna so pota njegova v vsakem času; previsoko so pogledu njegovemu sodbe tvoje: kateri koli so sovražniki njegovi, vanje piha žarjavico. 
[10:6] V srci svojem govori: Ne umaknem se, v nobeni dobi ne bodem v nesreči. 
[10:7] Preklinjanja polna so usta njegova in zvijač in goljufije; pod jezikom njegovim je nadlega in ničemurnost. 
[10:8] Poseda v votlini vašî, v zatišji, da bi ubil nedolžnega; oči njegove se skrivajo zoper onemoglega. 
[10:9] V zatišji preži, kakor lev v svojem brlogu; preži, da zgrabi siromaka ubozega; zgrabil bi rad siromaka ubozega, potegnil ga v mrežo svojo. 
[10:10] Sklujči se, potuhne se; in s krepkimi udi svojimi se zgrudi, kakor da so onemogli. 
[10:11] V srci svojem govori: Pozabil je Bog mogočni; obličje svoje skriva, ne ozré se nikoli. 
[10:12] Vstani, Gospod, Bog mogočni, dvigni roko svojo; ne pozabi siromakov ubozih. 
[10:13] Zakaj draži krivični Boga? v srci svojem govori, da ne bodeš térjal? 
[10:14] Zazdelo se je tebi, ko gledaš nadlego in gorjé, vzeti jih v roko svojo; brambi tvoji se izroča onemogli; siroti si tí pomočnik. 
[10:15] Zdrôbi roko krivičnemu in hudobnemu; preiskuj krivico njegovo, dokler je ne najdeš več. 
[10:16] Gospod je kralj večni; poginili so narodi sè zemlje njegove. 
[10:17] Hrepenenje krotkih si uslišal, Gospod; potolaži tem srce, nagni svoje uho, 
[10:18] Maščujoč siroto in siromaka, da ga ne bode dalje izganjal človek silovito iz dežele. 
[11:1] Načelniku godbe, Davidova. Gospod je pribežališče moje, kako govorite duši moji: Zapústi goro vašo, tičica? 
[11:2] Ker glej, tisti krivični natezajo lok, pušico svojo pokladajo na struno, da streljajo v temì na pravične v srci. 
[11:3] Ko se bodo celo stebri podirali, kaj naj počne pravični? 
[11:4] Gospod je v svetišči svetosti svoje, Gospod, katerega prestol je v nebesih, katerega oči vidijo, katerega trepalnice preiskujejo sinove človeške. 
[11:5] Gospod preiskuje pravičnega, krivičnega pa in siloljubnega sovraži srce njegovo. 
[11:6] Vsipal bode žarjavico nad krivične, ogenj in žveplo; in najviharnejši veter bode njih kupe delež. 
[11:7] Ker pravični Gospod ljubi, kar je pravično; pravičnega gleda obličje njegovo. 
[12:1] Načelniku godbe po osmini, psalm Davidov. 
[12:2] Daj rešenje, Gospod, ker minil je dobrodelnik; ker izginili so resnični izmed sinov človeških. 
[12:3] Prazno govoré drug z drugim, s priliznenimi ustnami, z vojnim srcem govoré. 
[12:4] Pokončal bode Gospod vse priliznene ustne, jezik visokobesedni; 
[12:5] Njih, ki govoré: Našega jezika pravica bode obveljala, ustne naše so v naši oblasti, kdo bi bil nam gospod? 
[12:6] Od zatiranja siromakov ubozih, od vpitja revežev vstanem skoraj, govori Gospod; pomagal bodem njemu, v katerega bode pihal žarjavico krivični. 
[12:7] Besede Gospodove so čiste besede, srebro očiščeno v izbrani prsteni posodi, osnaženo sedemkrat. 
[12:8] Ti, Gospod, ohrani jih; vsakega izmed njih brani tega rodu na veke. 
[12:9] Krivični hodijo okrog povsodi, ko se povzdiguje malopridna reč med človeškimi sinovi. 
[13:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[13:2] Doklej, Gospod? Bodeš li pozabljal me večno? Doklej bodeš skrival obličje svoje pred menoj? 
[13:3] Doklej naj skrivam naklepe svoje v srci svojem; žalovanje v prsih svojih podnevi? Doklej se bode spenjal sovražnik moj proti meni? 
[13:4] Poglej, usliši me, Gospod, moj Bog; razsvetli oči moje, da ne spavam v smrti. 
[13:5] Da ne poreče neprijatelj moj: Premagal sem ga; ne radujejo se sovražniki moji, ko bodem omahnil. 
[13:6] Ker jaz imam zaupanje v milost tvojo; raduje se naj moj duh v blaginji tvoji; prepeval bodem Gospodu, ko mi bode storil dobro. 
[14:1] Načelniku godbe; Davidova. Nespametni govori v srci svojem: Ni ga Boga: pohujšujejo, ostudna dela doprinašajo, ni ga, da bi delal dobro. 
[14:2] Gospod gleda z nebes na sinove človeške, da bi videl, je li kateri, ki bi bil razumen, ki bi iskal Boga. 
[14:3] Vsak je odstopil, izpridili so se vsi vkup; ni ga, da bi delal dobro, enega samega ne. 
[14:4] Ali si niso v svesti vsi, kateri delajo krivico, ker žró ljudstvo moje kruh jedóč, ne kličejo Gospoda? 
[14:5] Tu se preplašijo od groze, ker Bog je na strani pravičnemu rodu. 
[14:6] Naklep siromaka ubozega bodete osramotili, seveda! ker Gospod je zavetje njegovo. 
[14:7] Kdo naj dá rešenje sè Sijona Izraelu? Ko bode nazaj peljal iz sužnjosti ljudstva svojega krdelo, radoval se bode Jakob, veselil se Izrael. 
[15:1] Psalm Davidov. Gospod, kdo naj prebiva v šatoru tvojem; kdo naj stanuje na gori svetosti tvoje? 
[15:2] Kdor hodi pošteno in dela pravico ter govori resnico iz svojega srca; 
[15:3] Ne obrekuje z jezikom svojim, ne dela hudega bližnjemu svojemu, in ne sramoti svojega soseda: 
[15:4] V očeh njegovih je zaničevan krivični, česti pa njé, ki se bojé Gospoda; ko je prisegel v škodo svojo, vendar ne gane; 
[15:5] Denarja svojega ne posoja na obresti, in darila ne prejema zoper nedolžnega; kdor tako ravna, ne omahne nikdar. 
[16:1] Odlična pesem Davidova. Reši me, Bog mogočni; ker k tebi pribegam: 
[16:2] Gospodu govoriš: Gospod si moj, blaga mojega ne bodeš hranil pri sebi: 
[16:3] Svetim, ki so v deželi in veličastnim ga podeliš; na katerih je vse razveseljevanje moje. 
[16:4] Njim množijo bolečine kateri drugemu delé; daroval ne bodem njih krvavih daritev, ne jemal njih imen na ustne svoje. 
[16:5] Gospod je delež pristave moje in mojega ljudstva; ti vzdržuješ osodo mojo. 
[16:6] Mérne vrvi so mi pale v preprijetnih krajih; tudi posestvo je sprelepo, katero me je doletelo. 
[16:7] Blagoslavljal bodem Gospoda, kateri mi je dal sovèt; tudi ponoči me podučujejo obisti moje. 
[16:8] Predočujem si Gospoda neprestano; ker je na desnici moji, ne omahnem. 
[16:9] Zatorej se veseli srce moje in raduje se slava moja; tudi meso moje prebiva brez skrbi. 
[16:10] Ker duše moje ne bodeš pustil v grobu, ne pripustil ljubljencu svojemu, da vidi trohnobo. 
[16:11] Naznanjaš mi življenja stezo; najslajših radosti obilost pred obličjem tvojim, na desnici tvoji vekomaj. 
[17:1] Molitev Davidova: Čuj, Gospod, pravico, poslušaj vpitje moje; uho nagni molitvi moji brez ustnic zvijačnih. 
[17:2] Od obličja tvojega izidi pravica moja; oči tvoje naj gledajo, kar je pravično. 
[17:3] Ko bodeš preiskal srce moje, obiskal ponoči, preskušal me, ne najdeš; kar mislim, ne prestopi mojih ust. 
[17:4] Pri delih človeških, po besedi ustnic tvojih opazujem steze silovitega. 
[17:5] Ohrani korake moje na stezah svojih, da ne zaidejo moje noge. 
[17:6] Jaz te kličem, ker me slišiš, Bog mogočni; nagni k meni uho svoje, poslušaj govor moj. 
[17:7] Odloči milosti svoje, o ti, ki otimaš preganjalcev pribegajoče na desnico tvojo. 
[17:8] Hrani me kakor zenico v očesu; sè senco peroti svojih skrivaj me: 
[17:9] Zaradi krivičnih, ki me napadajo, sovražnikov mojih glavnih, ki me obdajajo. 
[17:10] Mast svojo masté, z usti svojimi govoré prevzetno: 
[17:11] Hojo našo zdaj obdajajo nam; oči svoje obračajo vpirajoč v tla. 
[17:12] Podoba je vsakega kakor leva želečega zgrabiti, in kakor mladega leva čepečega v zakotji. 
[17:13] Vstani, Gospod, prehítí obličje njegovo; trešči ga, izpuli dušo mojo z mečem svojim krivičnemu. 
[17:14] Ljudém izpuli v roko svojo, Gospod, ljudém od svetá, katerih delež je v tem življenji, katerim trebuh polniš sè skrivnim zakladom svojim; sitijo se sinovi in preobilost svojo zapuščajo otrokom svojim. 
[17:15] Jaz bodem v pravičnosti videl obličje tvoje, sitil se bodem, ko se zbudim, s podobo tvojo. 
[18:1] Načelniku godbe, Davida hlapca Gospodovega; kateri je govoril Gospodu té pesmi besede v dan, ko ga je bil rešil Gospod iz roke vseh sovražnikov njegovih, kakor iz roke Savlove. 
[18:2] In rekel je: Iz osrčja svojega bodem te ljubil, Gospod, moja krepost. 
[18:3] Gospod, skala moja in grad moj in rešitelj moj; Bog mogočni moj, pečina moja, kamor pribegam, ščit moj in blaginje moje rog, višina moja. 
[18:4] Hvaljenega kličem Gospoda in rešujem se sovražnikov svojih. 
[18:5] Obdajajo me smrtne bolečine in malopridnih hudourniki me strašijo. 
[18:6] Groba bolečine me obhajajo, smrtne zanke so mi na poti. 
[18:7] V stiski svoji kličem Gospoda, in do Boga svojega vpijem; iz svetišča svojega usliši moj glas, in vpitje moje predenj pride do ušes njegovih: 
[18:8] In stresa se in giblje zemlja, in podloge gorâ se majó; stresajo se pa, ko se mu vname jeza. 
[18:9] Dim se vali skozi nos njegov in ogenj požrešen iz ust njegovih; žarjavica goreča gre od njega. 
[18:10] In nagne nebo ter stopi dol, z mrakom pod svojimi nogami, 
[18:11] In sedeč na kerubih leti, in plava na vétrovih perotih. 
[18:12] Temo si napravi v zavetje svoje, okolo sebe za šator svoj; temotne vode, gošče gornjih oblakov. 
[18:13] Od svita pred njim prehajajo gosti oblaki njegovi, toča in žarjavica ognjena. 
[18:14] Na nebesih grmi Gospod in z višave izhaja glas njegov, toča in žarjavica ognjena. 
[18:15] Tako proži pušice svoje, razsipa jih in strele meče ter jih podi. 
[18:16] Prikazujejo se tudi najnižje struge vodâ, in razgrinjajo se podloge vesoljne zemlje od hudovanja tvojega, Gospod, od sape tvojega nosú. 
[18:17] Iz višine poseže ter me potegne gor, izvleče me iz mnogih vodâ. 
[18:18] Reši me neprijatelja mojega močnejšega, in sovražnikov mojih, ko so krepkejši od mene. 
[18:19] Srečujejo me ob času nadloge moje, tedaj mi je za palico Gospod: 
[18:20] In izpelje me na prosto; reši me, ker me ima rad. 
[18:21] Podeljuje mi Gospod po pravičnosti moji; po čistosti mojih rok mi povrača. 
[18:22] Ker se držim potov Gospodovih, ter se ne obračam krivično od svojega Boga; 
[18:23] Ker so vse sodbe njegove pred mojimi očmi; in postav njegovih ne odvračam od sebe: 
[18:24] Ker sem pošten pred njim, in se varujem, da ne ravnam krivično. 
[18:25] Povrača mi Gospod po pravičnosti moji; po čistosti mojih rok pred njegovimi očmi. 
[18:26] Z dobrotljivim izkazuješ se dobrotljivega, s poštenim možem izkazuješ se poštenega. 
[18:27] S čistim kažeš se čistega, ali popačenemu nasprotuješ. 
[18:28] Ker ti otimaš ljudstvo ubogo, prevzetne pa oči ponižuješ. 
[18:29] Dà, svetilo moje razsvetljuješ; Gospod, moj Bog razjasnjuje moje temé. 
[18:30] S teboj namreč prodiram skozi krdelo, in z Bogom svojim preskakujem zid. 
[18:31] Tega Boga mogočnega pot je poštena; govor Gospodov ves čist; ščit je vsem, kateri pribegajo k njemu. 
[18:32] Ker kdo je Bog razen Gospod? in kdo skala razen naš Bog? 
[18:33] Ta je Bog mogočni, ki me opasuje z močjo, in dela pošteno mojo pot: 
[18:34] Storivši noge moje kakor jelenom, da me stavi na višino mojo; 
[18:35] Boja uči roke moje; tako da zlomi lok jekleni roka moja. 
[18:36] Ker daješ mi ščit blaginje svoje, in desnica tvoja me podpira, in krotkost tvoja me povišuje. 
[18:37] Hoji moji razširjaš prostor moj; in členki mojih nog ne omahujejo. 
[18:38] Sovražnike svoje podim in dohajam jih; in ne povrnem se, dokler jih nisem uničil. 
[18:39] Zdrobim jih tako, da ne morejo več vstati, padajoč pod noge moje. 
[18:40] Opasuješ me namreč z močjo za vojsko; pod me podiraš nje, ki se spenjajo zoper mene. 
[18:41] In neprijateljev mojih tilnik mi podajaš; da ugonobim sovražnike svoje. 
[18:42] Vpijejo, a ni ga, da jih reši; h Gospodu, a ne usliši jih. 
[18:43] Zatorej jih razmeljem kakor prah pred vetrom; kakor blato na ulicah jih drobim. 
[18:44] Oproščaš me prepirov ljudstva; staviš me narodom na čelo; ljudstvo, katerega nisem poznal, služi mi: 
[18:45] Na sluh ušesa so mi pokorni; tujci se mi udajajo lažnjivo; 
[18:46] Tujci padajo in pritrepetavajo iz gradov svojih. 
[18:47] Gospod živi in blagoslovljena skala moja; zatorej naj se povišuje Bog blaginje moje. 
[18:48] Bog ta mogočni, ki mi daje maščevanje, in spravlja ljudstva pód me; 
[18:49] Rešuje me sovražnikov mojih; tudi nad nje, ki se spenjajo zoper mene, povzdignil si me; možu silovitemu si me iztrgal. 
[18:50] Zatorej te bodem slavil med narodi, Gospod, in prepeval bodem tvojemu imenu: 
[18:51] Da veliko blaginjo vsakoršno podeljuješ svojemu kralju, in izkazuješ milost maziljencu svojemu, Davidu in semenu njegovemu na veke. 
[19:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[19:2] Nebesa oznanjajo slavo Boga mogočnega; in delo rok njegovih kaže njih razsežje. 
[19:3] Dan dnevu bruha govorico, in noč noči kaže znanje. 
[19:4] Govorice nimajo, ne besed; in brez njih umé se njih glas. 
[19:5] Po vsej zemlji gre njih oznanilo, do kraja vesoljnega sveta šle so njih govorice; odkar je solncu šator postavil na njih. 
[19:6] Ker ono je kakor ženin, ki gre iz stanice svoje; raduje se kakor korenjak, ko se pripravlja na tek. 
[19:7] Od kraja nebá je vzhod njegov; in ték njegov do njihovih krajev; in nič ni, kar bi bilo skrito njegovemu žaru. 
[19:8] Nauk Gospodov je pošten, oživljajoč dušo; pričanje Gospodovo resnično, modrost daje nevednemu. 
[19:9] Zapovedi Gospodove so pravične, srce razveseljujejo; postava Gospodova čista, razsvetljuje oči. 
[19:10] Sveti strah Gospodov je čist, vekomaj ostane; sodbe Gospodove zgolj resnica, pravične so vse: 
[19:11] Zaželene, bolj ko zlato, in to kakor zlato prečisto, premnogo, in slajše ko med, in to ko čisti med. 
[19:12] Tedaj je bil služabnik tvoj opominjan po njih; njih poslušati je velik dobiček. 
[19:13] (Zmote, kdo bi jih razumel?) Mene odveži skrivnih. 
[19:14] Potem iz trdovratnosti potegni služabnika svojega, da ne gospoduje v meni; tedaj bodem pošten in čist velike pregrehe. 
[19:15] Po volji naj bodejo ust mojih besede, in srca mojega premišljevanje pred teboj; Gospod skala moja in rešitelj moj! 
[20:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[20:2] Usliši te naj Gospod ob času stiske; na višavo naj te postavi ime Boga Jakobovega. 
[20:3] Pošlje naj ti pomoč iz svetišča, in sè Sijona naj te podpira. 
[20:4] Dúha naj vse dari tvoje, in upepeli naj žgalno daritev tvojo. 
[20:5] Dá ti naj po srci tvojem, in izpolni naj vsak sklep tvoj. 
[20:6] Prepevajmo o blaginji tvoji; in v imenu Boga našega nosimo zastave; izpolni naj Gospod vse prošnje tvoje. 
[20:7] Zdaj spoznavam, da Gospod brani maziljenca svojega, usliši ga z nebes svetosti svoje; po največji kreposti, blaginji desnice svoje. 
[20:8] Ti vóz, in oni kónj, mi pa se spominjamo imena Gospoda, Boga našega. 
[20:9] Oni se pripogibajo in padajo; mi pa vstajamo in stojimo. 
[20:10] Gospod, reši! kralj sam naj usliši nas ob času, ko ga bodemo klicali. 
[21:1] Načelniku godbe; psalm Davidov. 
[21:2] Gospod, moči tvoje veseli se kralj, in blaginje tvoje kako se silno raduje! 
[21:3] Željo srca njegovega mu daješ, in kar so ustne njegove govorile, ne odrékaš. 
[21:4] Dà, prehitevaš ga z blagodari, na glavo njegovo pokladaš venec iz zlata prečistega. 
[21:5] Življenja te je prosil, dal si mu; tudi dnî dolgost na vedno večne čase. 
[21:6] Velika je slava njegova po blaginji tvoji; díko in veličastvo si položil nanj. 
[21:7] Ker pripravil si mu blagoslove na vekomaj; razjasnil ga z radostjo od svojega obličja. 
[21:8] Ker kralj sam upa v Gospoda; zato v zaupanji na milost Najvišjega ne omahne. 
[21:9] Z roko svojo dosežeš vse neprijatelje svoje; z desnico svojo dosežeš vse svoje sovražnike. 
[21:10] Narediš, da so kakor peč ognjena ob času srditega obličja tvojega; Gospod jih pogoltne v jezi svoji, kakor da jih ogenj uniči. 
[21:11] Sad njih pokončaš sè zemlje, in njih seme izmed sinov človeških. 
[21:12] Ker nameravali so ti hudo; izmišljali so naklep: ne morejo! 
[21:13] Ker staviš jih kakor gomilo; na strune svoje pokladaš pušice ter jih streljaš proti njih obličjem. 
[21:14] Dvigni se, Gospod, v moči svoji; pojmo in prepevajmo o hrabrosti tvoji. 
[22:1] Načelniku godbe o prvi zarji; psalm Davidov. 
[22:2] Bog moj mogočni, Bog moj mogočni, zakaj si me zapustil? daleč od blaginje moje, od stoka mojega besed? 
[22:3] Bog moj, zakaj me ne uslišiš, ko te kličem podnevi? in ponoči ni mi pokoja. 
[22:4] Saj si vendar svet, stanoviten, popolna hvala Izraelova. 
[22:5] Tebi so zaupali očetje naši; zaupali so, in osvobodil si jih. 
[22:6] K tebi so vpili, in oteti so bili, v té so zaupali in ni jih bilo sram. 
[22:7] Jaz pa sem črv, in ne mož; sramota ljudém in zaničevanje ljudstvu. 
[22:8] Vsi, ki me vidijo, namrdavajo se mi; režé se, glavó majó: 
[22:9] H Gospodu pribega, reši ga naj; otmè ga naj, ker ima veselje nad njim. 
[22:10] Saj ti si, ki si me potegnil iz materinega telesa, storil si, da sem brez skrbi živel na prsih matere svoje. 
[22:11] K tebi sem bil zagnan od rojstva, od telesa matere moje bodi Bog moj mogočni. 
[22:12] Ne bivaj daleč od mene, ko je blizu stiska, ko ni pomočnika. 
[22:13] Obdajajo me junci mnogi, krepki junci Bazanski obsipljejo me. 
[22:14] Žrelo svoje odpirajo zoper mene, kakor lev zgrabljiv in rujoveč. 
[22:15] Kakor voda se razlivam, in vse kosti moje se razklepajo; srce moje je podobno vosku, taja se v osrčji mojem. 
[22:16] Moja moč je suha kakor čepinja, in jezik moj se prijemlje neba mojega, in devaš me v smrtni prah. 
[22:17] Ker obdali so me psi; hudobnikov krdela so me obsula; prebodli so moje roke in noge moje. 
[22:18] Seštel bi lahko vse svoje kosti; oni gledajo, ozirajo se v mé. 
[22:19] Oblačila moja delé med seboj, in za suknjo mojo mečejo kocko. 
[22:20] Ti torej, Gospod, ne bivaj daleč, krepost moja, hiti na pomoč mojo. 
[22:21] Otmi meča dušo mojo, psa edino mojo. 
[22:22] Reši me žrela levovega, in rogov samorogov, uslišavši me. 
[22:23] Ime tvoje bodem oznanjal bratom svojim; sredi zbora bodem te hvalil: 
[22:24] Vi, ki se bojite Gospoda, hvalite ga; vse seme Jakobovo hvali ga; in boj se ga vse seme Izraelovo. 
[22:25] Ker ne zameta in ne zaničuje siromaštva siromakovega, in pred njim ne skriva obličja svojega; temuč ko vpije do njega, usliši ga. 
[22:26] O dobrotah tvojih bode hvala moja v zboru velikem; obljube svoje bodem opravljal v pričo njih, ki se ga bojé. 
[22:27] Jedli bodejo krotki in nasitili se; hvalili bodejo Gospoda, kateri ga iščejo; srce vaše bode živelo vekomaj. 
[22:28] Spomnijo se in povrnejo se h Gospodu vse meje zemlje, in priklonijo se pred teboj vse družine narodov. 
[22:29] Ker Gospodovo je kraljestvo samo, in gospostvo ima nad narodi. 
[22:30] Jedli bodo in priklanjali se vsi zemlje bogatini; pred njim bodejo padali, katerikoli pojdejo dol v prah; kateri ni ohranil duše svoje v življenji. 
[22:31] Teh seme bode ga čestilo, prištevalo se bode Gospodu vsak čas. 
[22:32] Prihajali bodo in oznanjali pravico njegovo ljudstvu, ki se rodi, da je pravičen. 
[23:1] Psalm Davidov; Gospod je pastir moj; slabo se mi ne more goditi. 
[23:2] Na pašnikih travnatih skrbi da ležim, poleg tihih vodâ me vodi. 
[23:3] Pokojno dela dušo mojo, po pravice stezah me vodi, zavoljo svojega imena. 
[23:4] Tudi ko bi hodil po dolini smrtne sence, ne bal bi se zlega, ker ti si z menoj; šiba tvoja in palica tvoja tolažiti me. 
[23:5] Pred menoj napravljaš mizo, sovražnikom mojim nasproti; z mazilom maziliš glavo mojo, kupa moja je polna do vrha. 
[23:6] Zgolj dobrota in milost bodeti me spremljale vse dnî življenja mojega; in pokojen bodem v hiši Gospodovi, dokler bodejo dolgi časi. 
[24:1] Psalm Davidov; Gospodova je zemlja in česar je polna, vesoljni svet, prebivalci njegovi. 
[24:2] Ker sam jo je ustanovil nad morja, in nad reke jo utrdil. 
[24:3] Kdo naj gre gor na goro Gospodovo, in kdo naj stoji na mestu svetosti njegove? 
[24:4] Kdor je nedolžnih rok in srca čistega; kateri ne dviga k ničemurnosti duše svoje, in ne priseza na goljufijo. 
[24:5] Ta dobiva blagoslov od Gospoda, in pravico od Boga blaginje svoje. 
[24:6] Ta je zarod čestilcev njegovih, ki iščejo obličje tvoje, zarod Jakobov. 
[24:7] Dvignite, vrata, glave svoje in dvignite se, večne duri, da vnide slave kralj. 
[24:8] Kdo je ta slave kralj? Gospod prekrepki in premogočni; Gospod vojskovalec premogočni, 
[24:9] Dvignite, vrata, glave svoje, dvignite, pravim, večne duri, da vnide slave kralj. 
[24:10] Kdo je ta slave kralj? Gospod vojnih krdél, on je slave kralj. 
[25:1] Pesem Davidova: K tebi, Gospod, dvigam dušo svojo. 
[25:2] Bog moj, v té zaupam, naj se ne osramotim, sovražniki moji naj se ne radujejo nad mano. 
[25:3] Tudi kdor čaka tebe, naj se ne osramoti; osramoté se naj, kateri izdajalsko ravnajo po krivem. 
[25:4] Pota svoja mi kaži, Gospod; steze svoje úči me. 
[25:5] Daj, da hodim po resnici tvoji, in úči me; ker ti si Bog blaginje moje, tebe čakam ves dan. 
[25:6] Spomni se usmiljenja svojega, Gospod, in milosti svojih, da so od vekomaj. 
[25:7] Grehov mladosti moje in pregreškov mojih ne spominjaj se; po milosti svoji spominjaj se me ti, zavoljo dobrote svoje, Gospod. 
[25:8] Dober in pravičen je Gospod: zatorej uči grešnike pot; 
[25:9] Dela, da hodijo krotki po pravici, in krotke uči pot svojo. 
[25:10] Vse steze Gospodove so milost in zvestoba njim, ki hranijo zavezo njegovo in pričanja njegova. 
[25:11] Zavoljo imena svojega, Gospod, bodeš torej prizanesel krivici moji, ker velika je. 
[25:12] Kakošen bode mož tisti, kateri se boji Gospoda, ki ga uči, katero pot naj izvoli? 
[25:13] Duša njegova bode prenočevala v dobrem, in seme njegovo bode dedovalo deželo. 
[25:14] Skrivnost Gospodova biva pri njih, ki se ga bojé, in zaveza njegova, da po izkušnji priča zanje. 
[25:15] Oči moje gledajo neprestano v Gospoda; ker on potegne iz mreže noge moje. 
[25:16] Ozri se v mé, in milost mi stóri; ker samoten sem in ubožen. 
[25:17] Stiske srca mojega se razširjajo; iz nadlog mojih potegni me. 
[25:18] Poglej siromaštvo moje in težavo mojo; in odpusti vse grehe moje. 
[25:19] Ozri se v sovražnike moje, ker močneji so; in s hudim sovraštvom me sovražijo. 
[25:20] Reši dušo mojo in otmi me; naj se ne osramotim, ker pribegam k tebi. 
[25:21] Poštenost naj me brani in pravica, ker tebe čakam. 
[25:22] Reši, Bog, Izraela vseh zatiranj njegovih. 
[26:1] Pesem Davidova. Za sodnika mi bodi, Gospod, ker jaz hodim v poštenosti svoji, in v Gospoda zaupam, da ne omahnem. 
[26:2] Izkušaj me Gospod, in preišči me; preglej obisti moje in srce moje; 
[26:3] Ker milost tvoja je pred mojimi očmi, in neprestano hodim v resnici tvoji. 
[26:4] Ne sedevam z ničemurnimi ljudmi in z licemérci se ne shajam. 
[26:5] Hudobnikov zbor sovražim, in s krivičnimi ne sedevam. 
[26:6] V nedolžnosti umivam roke svoje, in oltar tvoj obhajam, Gospod, 
[26:7] Prepevajoč hvalno pesem, in oznanjajoč vsa čuda tvoja. 
[26:8] Gospod, prebivališče ljubim hiše tvoje, in mesto, šator slave. 
[26:9] Ne pridrúži grešnikom duše moje, in možem krvoželjnim mojega življenja. 
[26:10] V njih rokah je pregreha, desnica njih je polna daril podkupnih. 
[26:11] Jaz pa hodim v poštenosti svoji; reši me in milost mi stóri. 
[26:12] Noga moja stoji na ravnem, v zborih bodem blagoslavljal Gospoda. 
[27:1] Pesem Davidova; Gospod je luč moja in blaginja moja, koga bi se bal? Gospod je življenja mojega moč, koga bi se plašil? 
[27:2] Vojskujejo se proti meni hudobniki, da pojedó moje meso, sovražniki moji in neprijatelji moji proti meni; oni se zgruzajo in padajo. 
[27:3] Ko bi šatorišče stavili proti meni, ne bi se balo srce moje; ko bi se spela vojska zoper mene, bil bi brez skrbi za to. 
[27:4] Eno sem prosil Gospoda, tega samo želim: da naj sedevam v hiši Gospodovi vse dnî življenja svojega, da gledam lepoto Gospodovo in preiskujem v svetišči njegovem. 
[27:5] Ker skriva me v koči svoji ob času nadloge; skriva me v skrivnem kraji šatora svojega, dviguje me na skalo. 
[27:6] Že se spenja glava moja nad sovražnike moje, stoječe okrog mene; da darujem v šatoru njegovem daritve z veselim hrupom, pojem in prepevam Gospodu. 
[27:7] Sliši me, Gospod, ko kličem z glasom svojim: in milost mi storí, usliši me. 
[27:8] Tvojo besedo: "Iščite obličje moje," premišlja srce moje; obličje tvoje iščem, Gospod. 
[27:9] Ne skrivaj mi obličja svojega, ne obračaj se v jezi od svojega hlapca; pomoč moja si bil, ne zapusti me in ne ostavi blaginje moje. 
[27:10] Ker oče moj in mati moja me zapuščata, Gospod pa me sprejme. 
[27:11] Uči me, Gospod, svoj pot, in vodi me po ravni stezi zavoljo njih, ki v mé preže. 
[27:12] Ne izdajaj me želji sovražnikov mojih; ker zoper mene stojé lažnjive priče, in ki pihajo silovitost; 
[27:13] Ko bi ne veroval, da bodem užival dobroto Gospodovo v deželi živečih. 
[27:14] Čakaj Gospoda, potolaži se, in pokrepčal bode srce tvoje; torej čakaj Gospoda. 
[28:1] Pesem Davidova. Tebe, Gospod, kličem, skala moja; ne delaj se gluhega obrnen od mene, da ne postanem, ako bodeš nem, od mene obrnen, podoben njim, ki v grob gredó. 
[28:2] Čuj prošenj mojih glas, ko vpijem k tebi; ko molím roke svoje proti hramu tvoje svetosti. 
[28:3] Ne potegni me med hudobne in njé, ki delajo krivico; ki govoré mir z bližnjimi svojimi, hudobija pa biva v njih srci. 
[28:4] Daj jim po njih delu, in po hudobnosti njih dejanj; po delu njih rók jim daj, povrni jim povračilo svoje. 
[28:5] Ker ne menijo se za dela Gospodova, in za stvarjenje rok njegovih: podere jih, a postavi jih ne. 
[28:6] Blagoslovljen Gospod, ker je uslišal prošenj mojih glas; 
[28:7] Gospod moč moja in ščit moj; njemu zaupa srce moje, in pomaga mi; zatorej se raduje srce moje, da ga slavim s pesmijo svojo. 
[28:8] Gospod je moč moja, in preblaga moč je Maziljenec njegov. 
[28:9] Reši ljudstvo svoje, in blagoslovi svojo last; in pasi jih ter povzdigni jih na veke. 
[29:1] Psalm Davidov. Dajajte Gospodu, sinovi mogočnih, dajajte Gospodu slavo in hvalo. 
[29:2] Dajajte Gospodu slavo njegovega imena; priklanjajte se ter izkazujte čast Gospodu v diki svetosti. 
[29:3] Glas Gospodov čez vode, glas Boga mogočnega, slavnega grmi, glas Gospodov čez mnoge vode. 
[29:4] Glas Gospodov močan, glas Gospodov krasen. 
[29:5] Glas Gospodov lomi cedre, Gospod podira tudi cedre na Libanu. 
[29:6] In dela, da skačejo kakor tele, Libanon in Sirijon, kakor mladič samorogov. 
[29:7] Glas Gospodov kreše plamene ognjene. 
[29:8] Glas Gospodov prešinja puščavo, prešinja puščavo Kadeško. 
[29:9] Glas Gospodov dela, da rodé košute, in listje otresa gozdom; ali v svetišči svojem izreka vso slavo svojo. 
[29:10] Gospod je sedel o potopu, in Gospod kralj sedi vekomaj. 
[29:11] Gospod daje moč svojemu ljudstvu; Gospod blagoslavlja ljudstvo svoje z mirom. 
[30:1] Psalm Davidov, pesem posvečevanja hiše njegove. 
[30:2] Poveličeval te bodem, Gospod, ker si me povzdignil, in sovražnikom mojim nisi dal radovati se nad mano. 
[30:3] Gospod, Bog moj, ko sem vpil do tebe, ozdravil si me. 
[30:4] Gospod, izpeljal si iz groba dušo mojo, ohranil me živega, da ne idem v grob. 
[30:5] Prepevajte Gospodu, katerim on deli milost, in slavite spomin svetosti njegove. 
[30:6] Ko je bil trenotje v jezi svoji, pride življenje po dobroti njegovi; ako se zvečer oglasi jok, zjutraj petje. 
[30:7] Ker jaz sem govoril v mirnosti svoji: Ne omahnem vekomaj. 
[30:8] Gospod, po dobroti svoji si bil na goro postavil mojo moč; ko si skrival obličje svoje, bil sem zbegan. 
[30:9] K tebi sem klical, Gospod, in Gospoda sem prosil: 
[30:10] Kaj prida bode v krvi moji, ko pojdem dol v jamo? ali te bode prah slavil? bode li oznanjal resnico tvojo? 
[30:11] Čuj, Gospod, in milost mi stórí; Gospod, bodi mi pomočnik. 
[30:12] Izpreobrnil si mi jok moj v ples; razpasal si raševnik moj in opasal me z radostjo: 
[30:13] Da ti prepeva slava in ne umolkne. Gospod, Bog moj, slavil te bodem vekomaj. 
[31:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[31:2] K tebi, Gospod, pribegam, naj se ne osramotim vekomaj; s pravico svojo osvobodi me. 
[31:3] Nagni mi uho svoje, hitro me reši; močna skala mi bodi, trden grad, da se rešim. 
[31:4] Ker skala moja si in trdnjava moja, torej zavoljo imena svojega vodi me in spremljaj me. 
[31:5] Izpelji me iz mreže, katero so skrili zoper mene: ker ti si moja moč. 
[31:6] V roko tvojo izročam svoj duh; otél si me, Gospod, Bog mogočni, resnični. 
[31:7] Sovražim nje, ki česté ničemurnosti prazne; ker jaz zaupam v Gospoda, 
[31:8] Da se bodem radoval in veselil dobrote tvoje, ko se bodeš ozrl v siromaštvo moje, spoznal duše moje stiske, 
[31:9] In ne izdal me sovražniku v roko, na široko postavil noge moje. 
[31:10] Milost mi stórí, Gospod, ker v stiski sem; od žalovanja hira oko moje, duša moja in telo moje. 
[31:11] Ker od žalosti peša življenje moje in leta moja od zdihovanja; od kazni krivice, katero trpim, hira krepost moja; in kosti moje ginejo. 
[31:12] Pri vseh sovražnikih svojih sem v sramoto, in pri sosedih svojih jako, in strah znancem svojim; zagledavši me zunaj bežé od mene. 
[31:13] V pozabljenje me zagrebava srce, kakor mrtvega; jaz sem kakor orodje potrto. 
[31:14] Ker zasramovanje čujem od mnogih, strah okrog in okrog; posvetujoč se vkup zoper mene mislijo, kako bi prestregli dušo mojo. 
[31:15] Jaz pa v té zaupam, Gospod, govoreč: Bog si moj; 
[31:16] V rokah tvojih so časi moji; potegni me iz rok sovražnikov mojih in njih, ki me preganjajo. 
[31:17] Daj, da sveti obličje tvoje nad tvojim hlapcem; reši me po milosti svoji. 
[31:18] Gospod, naj se ne osramotim, ker te kličem; osramoté se naj krivični, pogubé se v grob. 
[31:19] Neme naj postanejo ustne lažnjive, katere govoré zoper pravičnega trdó, z napuhom in zaničevanjem. 
[31:20] Kako obila je dobrota tvoja, katero hraniš njim, ki te česté; izkazuješ njim, ki pribegajo k tebi pred sinovi človeškimi! 
[31:21] Skrivaš jih v skrivališči pričujočnosti svoje pred móž napuhom; skrivaš jih v koči pred prepirom jezikov. 
[31:22] Blagoslovljen Gospod, ker mi izkazuje čudovito milost svojo; stavi me kakor v trdno mesto. 
[31:23] Jaz sem bil sicer rekel v naglici svoji; Iztrebljen sem izpred tvojih oči; vendar si slišal molitev mojih glas, ko semi vpil k tebi. 
[31:24] Ljubite Gospoda vsi, katerim izkazuje dobroto; Gospoda, ki varuje zveste, in povrača preobilno, dela reči veličastne. 
[31:25] Potolažite se, in pokrepčal bode srce vaše, vsi, ki upate v Gospoda. 
[32:1] Davidova pesem ukovita: Blagor oproščenemu pregreška, kogar greh je poravnán. 
[32:2] Blagor človeku, kateremu Gospod ne všteva krivice, in katerega duh nima v sebi zvijače. 
[32:3] Ko sem molčal, starale so se kosti moje, v stoku mojem ves dan. 
[32:4] Ker podnevi in ponoči bila je težka nad mano roka tvoja; in sok moj najboljši preobračal se je v suše poletne. 
[32:5] Greh svoj ti razodenem, in krivice svoje ne bodem pokrival (dejal sem). Izpovém se pregreškov svojih Gospodu, in ti si izbrisal kazen mojega greha. 
[32:6] Zavoljo tega bode te molil, komurkoli deliš milost, kader se zgodi; (o povodnji mnogih vodâ ne doidejo njega); 
[32:7] Ti si zavetje meni; stiske me brani; s pesmami oproščenja me obdajaj. 
[32:8] Podučeval te bodem in kazal ti, po kateri poti bodeš hodil; svetoval ti bodem, v te vpirajoč svoje oko. 
[32:9] Ne bodite kakor konj, kakor mezeg, brez razuma, katerima je z uzdo in vajetom brzdati gobec, da se, ne približa tebi. 
[32:10] Velike bolečine ima krivični; kdor pa ima zaupanje v Gospoda, njega obdaja milost. 
[32:11] Veselite se v Gospodu in radujte, pravični; in prepevajte, vsi pošteni v srci. 
[33:1] Prepevajte, pravični v Gospodu, poštenim se spodobi hvalno petje. 
[33:2] Slavite Gospoda sè strunami, s citrami in desetostrunjem mu pojte. 
[33:3] Pojte mu novo pesem, krepko bijte na strune, da doni. 
[33:4] Ker prava je beseda Gospodova; in stanovitno vse delo njegovo. 
[33:5] Pravico ljubi in sodbo; milosti Gospodove polna je zemlja. 
[33:6] Z besedo Gospodovo ustvarjena so nebesa, in z dihom ust njegovih vsa vojska nebeška. 
[33:7] Morske vode znaša kakor kup in v shrambe deva valove. 
[33:8] Gospoda naj se bojé vse dežele, pred njim naj trepetajo vsi sveta prebivalci. 
[33:9] Ker na besedo njegovo je, karkoli je, na zapoved njegovo postane. 
[33:10] Gospod uničuje narodov sklep, misli ljudstev podira. 
[33:11] Sklep pa Gospodov ostane vekomaj, misli srca njegovega od roda do roda. 
[33:12] Blagor narodu, katerega Bog je Gospod, ljudstvo, katero si je izvolil v last. 
[33:13] Z nebes gleda Gospod, vidi vse sinove človeške. 
[33:14] Z mesta prebivališča svojega gleda dol na vse zemlje prebivalce. 
[33:15] In obrazovatelj tudi njih src, pazi na vsa njihova dela. 
[33:16] Ni ga kralja, da bi se rešil z množico krdél; mogočni se ne otme z množico moči. 
[33:17] Goljufiv je konj za rešitev in z množico moči svoje ne oprosti jezdeca. 
[33:18] Glej, oko Gospodovo pazi na nje, kateri se ga bojé, na njé, kateri čakajo milosti njegove; 
[33:19] Da reši smrti njih dušo, in jih žive ohrani v lakoti. 
[33:20] Duša naša čaka Gospoda; pomoč je naša in ščit naš. 
[33:21] Ker v njem se raduje srce naše, kajti zaupamo njegovemu svetemu imenu. 
[33:22] Milost tvoja, Gospod, bodi nad nami, kakor te pričakujemo. 
[34:1] Pesem Davidova, ko je bil izpremenil lice svoje pred Abimelekom, in je bil odšel, ker ga je on podil. 
[34:2] Blagoslavljal bodem Gospoda vsak čas; vedno bode hvala njegova v ustih mojih. 
[34:3] V Gospodu se bode ponašala duša moja; čuli bodejo krotki ter se veselili; 
[34:4] Poveličujte Gospoda z menoj, in vkup povišujmo ime njegovo. 
[34:5] Iskal sem Gospoda in uslišal me je, in iz vseh strahov mojih me je rešil. 
[34:6] Kateri gledajo vanj in pritekajo, obličja njih naj se ne osramoté, govoré naj: 
[34:7] Ta ubogi je klical, in Gospod je uslišal; in rešil ga je iz vseh stisek njegovih. 
[34:8] Šatorišče stavijo angeli Gospodovi okrog njih, kateri se ga bojé, in otme jih. 
[34:9] Pokusite in vidite, da je dober Gospod; blagor možu, kateri pribega k njemu. 
[34:10] Bojte se Gospoda, svetniki njegovi, ker stradanja ni njim, ki se ga bojé. 
[34:11] Mladi levi beračijo in stradajo; kateri pa iščejo Gospoda, ne pogrešajo nobenega blaga. 
[34:12] Dejte, sinovi, poslušajte me: strah Gospodov vas bodem učil. 
[34:13] Kdo je ón mož, kateri se veseli življenja, ljubi dní, rad uživa dobro? 
[34:14] Varuj jezik svoj hudega, in ustne tvoje naj ne govoré zvijače. 
[34:15] Umikaj se hudemu in delaj dobro; išči mirú in hodi za njim. 
[34:16] Oči Gospodove pazijo na pravične, in ušesa njegova na njih vpitje. 
[34:17] Srdito pa je njim, ki delajo hudo, obličje Gospodovo, da iztrebi sè zemlje njihov spomin. 
[34:18] Ko kličejo, sliši jih Gospod, in jih iz vseh njih stisek otima. 
[34:19] Blizu je Gospod pobitim v srci; in potrte v duhu rešuje. 
[34:20] Mnoge so pravičnega nadloge, ali iz njih vseh ga reši Gospod: 
[34:21] Vse kosti njegovo ohrani, ena izmed njih se ne zlomi. 
[34:22] Krivične pa zadeva sè smrtjo nadloga, in kateri sovražijo pravičnega, pogubé se. 
[34:23] Gospod otima dušo hlapcev svojih, in ne pogubi se nobeden, ki pribega k njemu. 
[35:1] Pesem Davidova. Bojuj se, Gospod, zoper njé, ki se bojujejo z menoj; napadi jih, ki napadajo mene. 
[35:2] Zgrabi ščit veliki ali mali, in vstani v mojo pomoč: 
[35:3] In potegni sulico, in prestrezi njé, ki me preganjajo: reci duši moji: Blaginja sem tvoja. 
[35:4] Osramoté se naj in z rudečico oblijó, kateri iščejo duše moje: nazaj naj se zapodé in zarudé, kateri mi nameravajo hudo. 
[35:5] Bodejo naj kakor pleve pred vetrom, ko ga zažene angelj Gospodov. 
[35:6] Temna bodi njih pot in prepolzka, in angelj Gospodov naj jih preganja. 
[35:7] Ker po krivem mi skrivajo v jami mrežo svojo, po krivem kopljejo jamo duši moji. 
[35:8] Pride naj mu, da ne bode vedel, poguba, da ga vjame mreža njegova, katero skriva: v pogubo naj pade vanjo. 
[35:9] Tako naj se duša moja raduje v Gospodu, veseli se naj v blaginji njegovi. 
[35:10] Vse kosti moje naj govoré: Gospod, kdo je tebi enak? Siromaka otimaš iz rok močnejega od njega; siromaka, pravim, in ubožca iz rok njega, ki ga pleni? 
[35:11] Priče vstajajo krivične; česar si nisem v svesti, terjajo od mene. 
[35:12] Hudo mi vračajo za dobro, zapuščenost duši moji. 
[35:13] In vendar sem jaz, ko so bili bolni, v raševini za obleko, s postom pokoril dušo svojo, in molitev moja se je vračala v nedrije moje. 
[35:14] Kakor k bližnjemu, kakor k bratu sem hodéval neprestano, kakor žalujoč po materi hodil sem sključen v črni obleki. 
[35:15] Ko pa pešam, zbirajo se in se radujejo; zbirajo se pri meni in se plazijo, da ne čutim; parajo obleko, in ne molčé: 
[35:16] Med igralci šaljivci šegavi; sè svojimi zobmí režé proti meni. 
[35:17] Gospod, doklej bodeš gledal? Reši dušo mojo njih pogube, mladih levov edino mojo. 
[35:18] Slavil te bodem v velikem zboru, med ljudstvom obilim bodem te hvalil. 
[35:19] Naj se ne radujejo nad menoj, kateri so mi neprijatelji iz krivih vzrokov; kateri me sovražijo po krivem, naj ne mežikajo z očesom. 
[35:20] Mirú namreč ne govoré, temuč zoper pokojne v deželi izmišljajo najhujše zvijače. 
[35:21] In proti meni režé, govoreč: Prav, prav, oko naše vidi! 
[35:22] Vidiš, Gospod, ne mólči; Gospod, ne bivaj daleč od mene. 
[35:23] Zbúdi se in vstani na sodbo mojo; Bog moj in Gospod moj, na pravdo mojo. 
[35:24] Sodi me po pravici svoji, Gospod Bog moj, in naj ne radujejo se nad mano. 
[35:25] Naj ne govoré v srci svojem: Prav, duša naša; ne govoré naj: Pogoltnili smo ga. 
[35:26] Osramoté se naj in zarudé vkup, ker se veselé nesreče moje; sè sramoto naj se ogrnejo in nečastjo, kateri se povzdigujejo proti meni. 
[35:27] Prepevali bodejo in se radovali, kateri se veselé pravice moje, in govorili bodejo vedno: Poveličan Gospod, ki se veseli mirú svojega hlapca. 
[35:28] In jezik moj bode oznanjal pravičnost tvojo, ves dan hvalo tvojo. 
[36:1] Načelniku godbe; pesem hlapca Gospodovega, Davida. 
[36:2] Beseda pregrehe krivičnega je v srca mojega globočini: Pred očmi njegovimi ni strahu Božjega. 
[36:3] Slepí se v svojih očéh, ko doseže krivico svojo, katero naj bi sovražil. 
[36:4] Besede ust njegovih so prazne in zvijačne; rabiti jenja razum, da bi delal dobro. 
[36:5] Ničemurnost misli v postelji svoji, stopa na pot, ki ni dobra: hudega ne zameta. 
[36:6] Gospod, v nebesih je milost tvoja, zvestoba tvoja noter do gornjih oblakov. 
[36:7] Pravica tvoja kakor največje gore, sodbe tvoje valovi veliki; ljudî in živali ohranjaš, Gospod. 
[36:8] Kako dražestna je milost tvoja, Bog, ko sinovi človeški pribegajo v senco peróti tvojih. 
[36:9] Preobilno se napolnjujejo z obilostjo hiše tvoje, in iz potoka svojih slasti jih napajaš. 
[36:10] Ker pri tebi je življenja vir, v svetlobi tvoji uživamo svetlobo. 
[36:11] Pomóli milost svojo njim, ki te spoznavajo, in pravico svojo pravičnim v srci. 
[36:12] Ne zadeni me prevzetnega noga, in roka krivičnih naj me ne zapelje, da zaidem. 
[36:13] Ko padejo hudodelniki, zaženó se tako, da ne morejo vstati. 
[37:1] Pesem Davidova. Ne razsrdi se zaradi hudobnih, ne zavidaj njih, ki delajo krivico. 
[37:2] Ker hitro se pokosé kakor seno, in kakor nežne trave zelenje odpadejo. 
[37:3] Zaupaj v Gospoda in delaj dobro; prebivaj v deželi in v poštenosti se pasi. 
[37:4] In razveseljuj se v Gospodu, ki ti bode dal srca tvojega prošnje. 
[37:5] Izróči Gospodu svojo pot in zaupaj vanj; on bode že storil. 
[37:6] Kakor luč bode pokazal pravičnost tvojo, in pravico tvojo kakor poldan. 
[37:7] Zanašaj se na Gospoda in čakaj ga neprestano: ne razsrdi se zaradi njega, ki ima srečo na poti svoji; zaradi moža, ki doprinaša, kar misli. 
[37:8] Odjenjaj od jeze, in pústí togoto, ne razsrdi se, da bi le hudo storil. 
[37:9] Ker hudobniki se bodejo iztrebili: čakajoči pa Gospoda dedovali bodejo sami deželo. 
[37:10] In še malo, in celo ne bode krivičnega: ko bodeš ogledoval mesto njegovo, ne bode ga. 
[37:11] Krotki pa bodejo dedovali deželo, in radovali se bodejo v obilosti mirú. 
[37:12] Ko misli krivični zoper pravičnega, in škriplje sè zobmí svojimi proti njemu, 
[37:13] Smeje se mu Gospod, ker vidi, da prihaja dan njegov. 
[37:14] Meč naj so potegnili krivični in lok svoj napéli, da poderó ubozega in siromaka, da pobijejo poštene na potu: 
[37:15] Meč njihov predere njih srce, in zdrobé se njihovi loki. 
[37:16] Dobro je vsakemu pravičnemu malo, bolje nego obilost mnogim krivičnim. 
[37:17] Ker roke krivičnih se zdrobé, pravične pa podpira Gospod. 
[37:18] Gospod pozna čase poštenih, tako da bode posest njihova vekomaj. 
[37:19] Osramoté se ne o hudem času; temuč nasitijo se o lakoti času, 
[37:20] Ko krivični poginejo in sovražniki Gospoda kakor kar je drazega v jagnjetih, kakor to mine v dim, minejo oni. 
[37:21] Na pósodo jemlje krivični, a vrniti ne more; pravični pa je milosten in daruje: 
[37:22] Ker blagoslovljeni po njem podedovajo deželo, prokleti pa po njem pogubé se. 
[37:23] Gospod stavi stopinje možu, katerega poti se raduje. 
[37:24] Ko pada, ne zvrne se; ker Gospod podpira roko njegovo. 
[37:25] Otrok sem bil, postaral sem se tudi, ali videl nisem pravičnege zapuščenega tako, da bi kruha iskalo seme njegovo. 
[37:26] Ves dan deli milost in posoja, in v blagoslovu je seme njegovo. 
[37:27] Odstopi od hudega, in delaj dobro; tako prebivaj vekomaj. 
[37:28] Ker Gospod ljubi pravico, in ne zapusti njih, katerim je dobrovoljen; na veke se ohrani, seme pa krivičnih se iztrebi. 
[37:29] Pravični bodo podedovali deželo, in prebivali bodo večno v njej. 
[37:30] Pravičnega usta premišljajo modrost, in jezik njegov govori pravico. 
[37:31] V srci njegovem je postava njegovega Boga, noga njegova ne omahuje na hojah svojih. 
[37:32] Krivični pa zalezuje pravičnega in želi ga umoriti. 
[37:33] Gospod ga ne zapusti v roki njegovi, ne dovoli, da se obsodi, ko se sodi. 
[37:34] Pazi na Gospoda in drži se poti njegove: tedaj te povzdigne, da bodeš podedoval deželo, videl krivičnih pogubo. 
[37:35] Videl sem krivičnega, ko je pognal z veliko močjo, in se razvijal kakor domače drevo zeleneče. 
[37:36] Potem je minil, in glej, ni ga bilo več: ker iskal sem ga, a našel se ni. 
[37:37] Opazuj poštenega, in glej pravičnega, konec tega moža je mir. 
[37:38] Grešniki pa se pogubljajo vsi vkup; konec krivičnih se iztrebi. 
[37:39] Ker blaginja njih je od Gospoda, moč njih o času stiske. 
[37:40] In pomaga jim Gospod ter otima jih; otima jih krivičnih ter jih ohranja, ker pribegajo k njemu. 
[38:1] Psalm Davidov za spomin. 
[38:2] Gospod, v srdu svojem ne dólži me, in v togoti svoji ne pokôri me. 
[38:3] Ker pušice tvoje so zasajene v mé, in nadme si spustil roko svojo. 
[38:4] Nič celega ni na mesu mojem zavoljo srdú tvojega; mirú ni v mojih kostéh zavoljo greha mojega. 
[38:5] Ker krivice moje presezajo glavo mojo, kakor težko breme; pretežke so, da bi jih prenašati mogel. 
[38:6] Segnjile so in usmradile se bule moje, zavoljo nespameti moje. 
[38:7] Mučim se, krivim se presilno, ves dan pohajam v črni obleki. 
[38:8] Ker drob moj je poln prisada, tako da ni nič celega na mesu mojem. 
[38:9] Oslabljen sem in potrt presilno; tulim od stokanja svojega srca. 
[38:10] Gospod, pred teboj je vse hrepenenje moje; in zdihovanje ni ti skrito. 
[38:11] Srce moje utriplje, zapušča me moja krepost, in luč mojih očî, tudi one niso v moji oblasti. 
[38:12] Prijátelji moji in bližnji moji stojé nadlogi moji nasproti, in sorodniki moji stojé od daleč. 
[38:13] Stavijo pa zanke, kateri iščejo duše moje: in kateri iščejo hudega meni, govoré nadloge in izmišljajo ves dan zvijače. 
[38:14] Jaz pa jih ne slišim kakor gluh, in kakor nem ne odprem svojih ust. 
[38:15] Ampak sem kakor ón, ki ne sliši, in kateremu ní dokazov v ustih. 
[38:16] Ker tebe čakam, Gospod; da me ti uslišiš, Gospod, Bog moj. 
[38:17] Ker pravim: Naj se ne radujejo nad menoj; ko omahuje noga moja, naj se ne povzdigujejo proti meni, 
[38:18] Ako bodem jaz za omahnenje pripravljen, in bolečina moja bode vedno pred mano. 
[38:19] Ker krivico svojo oznanjam, skrbi me moj greh. 
[38:20] Neprijatelji pa moji krepčajo se živi, in množijo se, kateri me sovražijo iz krivih vzrokov. 
[38:21] In vračajoč hudo za dobro nasprotujejo mi, zato ker hodim za dobrim. 
[38:22] Ne zapústi me, Gospod, Bog moj; ne bivaj daleč od mene. 
[38:23] Hiti na pomoč mojo, Gospod, blaginja moja! 
[39:1] Načelniku godbe Jedutunov, psalm Davidov. 
[39:2] Rekel sem: Pazil bodem na pota svoja, da ne grešim z jezikom svojim; uzdo bodem imel okrog svojih ust, dokler bode krivični pred menoj. 
[39:3] Umolknil sem bil molčeč, tih sem bil tudi dobremu; ali hujšala se je bolečina moja. 
[39:4] Ko pa se je vnemalo srce moje v meni, ko je v premišljevanji mojem užigal se ogenj, govoril sem z jezikom svojim: 
[39:5] Daj, da zvem, Gospod, konec svoj, kaj je mera mojih dní, zvem, kako sem trpežen. 
[39:6] Glej, po dlan dolge si naredil dnî moje, in čas moj je kakor nič pred teboj, zares, prava ničevost je vsak človek, še tako trden. 
[39:7] Zarés, kakor senca mine človek, zares, zastonj tako ropotajo; zbira vsak, a ne vé, kdo bode to prejel. 
[39:8] A kaj še čakam, Gospod? up moj je v tebi. 
[39:9] Vseh pregreh mojih reši me, nespametnim na sramoto ne izpostavi me. 
[39:10] Umolknem, ne zinem, ker ti si storil. 
[39:11] Odvrni od mene udarec svoj, od udarca roke tvoje jaz omahujem. 
[39:12] Ako bi s kaznimi po krivičnosti pokoril vsakega, uničil bi kakor mola, kar je vrednega v njem: zares, ničevost je vsak človek. 
[39:13] Čuj molitev mojo, Gospod, in vpitje moje; uho nagni solzam mojim, ne delaj se gluhega; ker tujec sem pred teboj, naselnik kakor vsi očetje moji. 
[39:14] Odstopi od mene, da se okrepčam: ko še ne odhajam, da me ne bode več. 
[40:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[40:2] Stanovitno sem čakal Gospoda, kateri je nagnivši se k meni slišal vpitje moje. 
[40:3] In izpeljavši me iz jezera viharnega, iz blatne luže, postavil je nogo mojo na skalo, utrdil korake moje. 
[40:4] V usta moja je položil novo pesem, hvalno pesem našemu Bogu: videli bodo mnogi in bali se ter zaupali v Gospoda, govoreč: 
[40:5] Blagor možu, kateri stavi v Gospoda zaupanje svoje, ter se ne ozira v prevzetnike in lažnjivce. 
[40:6] Mnoga čuda svoja nam ti deliš, Gospod, Bog moj, in misli svoje za nas: nihče, ko jih pregledujem, ni tebi enak; če jih bodem oznanjal in pripovedoval, preštevilna so, da bi jih naštel. 
[40:7] Daritve in darú se nisi veselil, ušesa si mi prebodel; žgalne žrtve in daritve za greh nisi zahteval. 
[40:8] Tedaj sem rekel: Glej, tu sem; v zvitku knjige je pisano o meni: 
[40:9] Veseli me delati voljo tvojo, Bog moj; in postava tvoja je v mojem osrčji. 
[40:10] Pravico oznanjam v zboru velikem; glej, ustnam svojim ne branim, Gospod, ti veš. 
[40:11] Pravice tvoje ne skrivam v srci svojem: zvestobo tvojo in blaginjo tvojo pravim; ne prikrivam milosti tvoje in resnice tvoje velikemu zboru. 
[40:12] Ti, Gospod, ne odtezaj mi usmiljenja svojega; milost tvoja in resnica tvoja naj me hraniti vedno. 
[40:13] Ker obdajajo me in napadajo nadloge brez števila; dohajajo me krivice moje tako, da pregledati ne morem; več jih je, ko glave moje làs; tudi srce moje me zapušča. 
[40:14] Blagovoli me oteti, Gospod; na pomoč mojo hiti, Gospod! 
[40:15] Osramoté se naj in z rudečino oblijó vsi vkup, ki iščejo duše moje, da jo pogubé; umaknejo se naj in onečastijo, kateri se veselé moje nadloge. 
[40:16] Zapuščeni naj bodo za plačilo sramote svoje, kateri pravijo meni: Prav, prav! 
[40:17] Veselé se naj in radujejo v tebi vsi, kateri te iščejo; govoré naj vedno: Poveličuj se Gospod, kateri ljubijo blaginjo tvojo. 
[40:18] Ubog sem res in potreben, ali Gospod misli name: pomoč si moja in rešitelj moj: Bog moj, ne múdi se. 
[41:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[41:2] Blagor mu, kdor se spominja siromaka, govoreč: O času nadloge bode ga otél Gospod. 
[41:3] Gospod ga bode rešil, ohranil življenju; srečen bode na zemlji, in ne izdajaj ga želji sovražnikov njegovih. 
[41:4] Gospod naj ga podpira na postelji slabosti: vse ležišče njegovo vsled bolezni njegove preméni, 
[41:5] Ko govorim: Gospod, milost mi stóri, ozdravi dušo mojo, ker tebi sem grešil. 
[41:6] Sovražniki moji so slabo govorili o meni: Kdaj bode umrl in bode izginilo ime njegovo? 
[41:7] Ko je tedaj prihajal obiskat me kdó, govorilo je laž srce njegovo; zbiralo si je krivico: šel je ven in právil. 
[41:8] Vkup so šepetali zoper mene vsi sovražniki moji; zoper mene so izmišljali, kar bi mi bilo v zlo, govoreč: 
[41:9] Stvar silno malopridna tiči v njem globoko, in ker leži, več ne vstane. 
[41:10] Tudi mož, ki je živel v miru z menoj, v katerega sem zaupal, kateri je jedel mojo jed, vzdignil je peto proti meni. 
[41:11] Ti pa, Gospod, storí mi milost, in zbúdi me, da jim povrnem. 
[41:12] 
[41:13] 
[41:14] 
[42:1] Načelniku godbe med nasledniki Koretovimi; ukovita. 
[42:2] Kakor jelen koprni po vodnih potokih, tako duša moja koprni po tebi, Bog. 
[42:3] Žejna je duša moja Boga, mogočnega, živega, govoreč: Kdaj se približam, da se prikažem pred obličjem Božjim? 
[42:4] Solzé moje so mi za hrano podnevi in ponoči; ko se mi pravi vsak dan: Kje je, tvoj Bog? 
[42:5] To mi je v mislih, ko izlivam v sebi dušo svojo, da bi se bil izprehajal v krdelu, hodil z njimi noter do hiše Božje z glasom petja in hvale, v praznični množici. 
[42:6] Kaj si pobita, duša moja, in tako ropočeš v meni? Upaj v Boga, ker še ga bodem slavil in vso blaginjo njegovega obličja. 
[42:7] Bog moj, pobita je v meni duša moja; zatorej se spominjam tebe iz dežele Jordanove in Hermonske, z male gorice. 
[42:8] Brezno kliče brezno o slapov tvojih glasu; vse vodé tvoje in valovi tvoji pridirajo in valé se čez me. 
[42:9] Podnevi pošlje Gospod milost svojo, in ponoči hvalno pesem svojo k meni; v molitvi svoji k Bogu mogočnemu življenja mojega prebijem. 
[42:10] Govoril bodem Bogu mogočnemu, skali svoji: Zakaj me pozabljaš? zakaj hodim žalujoč zaradi zatiranja sovražnikovega? 
[42:11] Suhe kosti moje napadajo, sramoté me sovražniki moji, govoré mi vsak dan: Kje Bog je tvoj? 
[42:12] Kaj si pobita, duša moja, in kaj tako ropočeš v meni? Upaj v Boga, ker še ga bodem slavil, vso blaginjo obličja mojega in mojega Boga. 
[43:1] Maščuj me, Bog, in prevzemi pravdo mojo; ljudstva hudobnega, moža zvijačnega in krivičnega reši me. 
[43:2] Ker ti si Bog moči moje, zakaj bi me zamétal? zakaj bi žalujoč hodil neprestano zaradi zatiranja sovražnikovega? 
[43:3] Pošlji luč svojo in resnico svojo, oné naj me spremljati, pripeljati naj me na goro svetosti tvoje, in v šatore tvoje. 
[43:4] Da stopim pred oltár Božji, pred Boga mogočnega, veselje radosti moje, in te slavim sè strunami, o Bog, Bog moj. 
[43:5] Kaj si pobita, duša moja, in kaj tako ropočeš v meni? Upaj v Boga, ker še ga bodem slavil, vso blaginjo obličja mojega in mojega Boga. 
[44:1] Načelniku godbe med nasledniki Koretovimi; ukovita. 
[44:2] 0 Bog, z ušesi svojimi smo slišali, očetje naši so nam pravili, káko delo si storil o njih časih, časih nekdanjih. 
[44:3] Z roko svojo si izgnal narode in naselil njé: pokoril si ljudstva in razširil njé. 
[44:4] Niso namreč z mečem svojim dobili dežele v oblast, in njih dlan ni jim dala blaginje; nego desnica tvoja in dlan tvoja in obličja tvojega luč; ker blagovoljen si jim bil. 
[44:5] Ti sam si kralj moj, o Bog; pošlji vsakoršno blaginjo Jakobu. 
[44:6] S teboj bodemo z rogom udarili sovražnike svoje; z imenom tvojim bodemo pogazili njé, ki se spenjajo v nas. 
[44:7] Ker na lok svoj se ne zanašam, in meč moj ne bode me rešil. 
[44:8] Ko nas bodeš otél neprijateljev naših, in osramotil sovražnike naše, 
[44:9] Hvalili bodemo ves dan Boga, ime tvoje bodemo slavili vekomaj. 
[44:10] In vendar si nas zavrgel in onečastil, ker nisi hodil z našimi vojskami. 
[44:11] Storil si, da smo se umaknili sovražniku, in neprijatelji naši si plenijo. 
[44:12] Predal si nas kakor drobnico za hrano, in med ljudstva si nas razkropil. 
[44:13] Prodal si ljudstvo svoje za malo, in povišal nisi cene njegove. 
[44:14] Izpostavil si nas v sramoto sosedom našim, v zasramovanje in zasmehovanje njim, ki nas obdajajo. 
[44:15] Za pregovor si nas postavil ljudstvom, v majanje z glavo med narodi. 
[44:16] Ves dan mi je nečast moja pred očmi, in obličja mojega sramota me pokriva; 
[44:17] Zaradi glasú zasramovalca in preklinjalca; zaradi sovražnika in maščevalca. 
[44:18] Vse to nas je zadelo, in vendar te ne zabimo; in lažnjivo se ne vedemo zoper zavezo tvojo. 
[44:19] Ne odmika se srce naše, in stopinja naša ne zavija v stran od steze tvoje: 
[44:20] Če tudi si nas potrl v kraj sômov in pokril nas z mrtvaško senco. 
[44:21] Ako bi bili pozabili imena Boga našega, ali razpeli roke svoje proti bogu mogočnemu tujemu, 
[44:22] Ali bi ne bil Bog tega preiskal? Ker on pozná srca skrivnosti. 
[44:23] Ali zavoljo tebe nas pobijajo vsak dan; cenijo nas kakor drobnico za klanje. 
[44:24] Zbúdi se, zakaj bi spal, Gospod? vstani, ne zametaj nas na večno. 
[44:25] Zakaj bi skrival obličje svoje, pozabljal nadloge naše in stiske naše? 
[44:26] Ker v prah je ponižano življenje naše, tál se tišči trebuh naš. 
[44:27] Vstani na pomoč nam, in reši nas zavoljo milosti svoje. 
[45:1] Načelniku godbe med nasledniki Koretovimi, na šestero strun, prijateljic pesem ukovita. 
[45:2] Iz srca mojega vre dobra beseda; pel bodem pesmi svoje o kralji, z jezikom svojim in peresom, ročen pisar. 
[45:3] Mnogo lepši si ustvarjen od sinóv človeških; miloba je razlita po ustnah tvojih; zatôrej te je Bog blagoslovil vekomaj. 
[45:4] Meč svoj opaši okolo ledja, o premočni; meč slave svoje in dike svoje. 
[45:5] In z diko svojo srečno jahaj z besedo resnice, in izrekaj pravico, in stavi si spomenike sè strašnimi deli desnice svoje. 
[45:6] Z ostrimi pušicami tvojimi bodo padala pód te ljudsta, po volji bodo padali sovražniki kraljevi. 
[45:7] Prestol tvoj, o Bog, je na večne čase; žezlo pravično je žezlo tvojega kraljestva. 
[45:8] Ljubiš pravico, in krivico sovražiš; zatorej te je pomazilil Bog, Bog tvoj z oljem veselja pred tvojimi tovariši. 
[45:9] Mira in aloe in kasija so vsa oblačila tvoja, ko izhajaš iz svetišč slonokoščenih, pred njimi, ki razveseljujejo. 
[45:10] Hčere kraljeve so med dragimi tvojimi; žena tvoja je postavljena tebi na desno z odličnim zlatom Ofirskim. 
[45:11] Čuj, hči, in glej, in nagni uho svoje, ter pozabi ljudstva svojega in hiše očetove svoje. 
[45:12] In radoval se bode kralj lepote tvoje; in ker je kralj tvoj, pokloni se njemu. 
[45:13] Tedaj bodejo hčere Tirske z darilom molile obličje tvoje, bogati med ljudstvom. 
[45:14] Vsa čestita je notri hči kraljeva, v obleki predelani zlatom. 
[45:15] S Frigijskimi ogrinjali nesó jo h kralju; device prijateljice za njo peljejo se k tebi. 
[45:16] Vodijo jih z največjim veseljem in radovanjem, stopajo v grad kraljevi. 
[45:17] Na mestu roditeljev tvojih bodejo sinovi tvoji: za prvake jih postaviš po vsej deželi. 
[45:18] Oznanjal bodem ime tvoje v vsaki dobi; zatorej te bodejo slavila ljudstva na vedno večno čase. 
[46:1] Načelniku godbe med nasledniki Koretovimi, po visoki godbi, hvalna pesem. 
[46:2] Bog nam je zavetje in moč; pomoč v stiskah najkrepkejša. 
[46:3] Zato bi se ne bali, ako bi se premaknila zemlja, ali ko bi se gore pogreznile v globočino morja. 
[46:4] Šumele bi, kalile se vodé njih vseh, gibale se goré od njegovega vzdigovanja. 
[46:5] Reka, potoki njeni razveseljujejo mesto Božje, kraj presveti, Najvišjega prebivališče. 
[46:6] Bog je v sredi njegovi, ne gane se; Bog mu pomaga rano zjutraj. 
[46:7] Ko hrumé narodi, gibljejo se kraljestva, oglasi se on, taja se zemlja. 
[46:8] Gospod vojnih krdel je z nami, grad je nam Bog Jakobov. 
[46:9] Pridite, glejte dela Gospodova, kako razgraja po zemlji! 
[46:10] Vojske mirí noter do skrajnosti zemlje, lok lomi in sulico krši, vozove sežiga z ognjem. 
[46:11] Govoreč: Stojte in spoznajte, da sem jaz Bog; da se bodem poveličeval med narodi, poveličeval na zemlji. 
[46:12] Gospod vojnih krdél je z nami, grad nam Bog Jakobov. 
[47:1] Načelniku gódbe; med nasledniki Koretovimi, psalm. 
[47:2] Vsa ljudstva ploskajte z roko, ukajte Bogu z donečim glasom. 
[47:3] Ker Gospod najvišji, čestiti, kralj velik je nad vso zemljo. 
[47:4] V hlev goni ljudstva, v naš kraj, in narode v kraj naših nóg. 
[47:5] Odbira nam posestvo naše, diko Jakoba, katerega ljubi nad vse. 
[47:6] Gor gré Bog z veselim glasom, Gospod s trombe bučanjem. 
[47:7] Prepevajte Bogu, prepevajte; prepevajte kralju našemu, prepevajte! 
[47:8] Ker vse zemlje kralj je Bog, prepevajte s pesmijo ukovito! 
[47:9] Bog kraljuje nad narodi; Bog sedí na prestolu svetosti svoje. 
[47:10] Radovoljni se zbirajo iz ljudstev, ljudstvo Boga Abrahamovega, ker Božje so hrambe dežele; silno je vzvišen. 
[48:1] Pesem in psalm naslednikom Koretovim. 
[48:2] Velik je Gospod in hvaljen silno, v mestu Boga našega, na gori svetosti svoje: 
[48:3] V lepoti kraja, veselji vse zemlje, na gori Sijonski, na severni strani v mestu kralja vélikega. 
[48:4] Bog v dvorih njegovih spoznava se za grad. 
[48:5] Ker, glej, sešli so se kralji, šli so vkup. 
[48:6] Sami so videli, vkup so strmeli, zmedli so se, izbežali urno. 
[48:7] Trepet jih je obšel tam, bolečina kakor porodnico. 
[48:8] Z burjo razbijaš ladije morske. 
[48:9] Kakor smo slišali, tako smo videli v mestu Gospoda vojnih krdél, v mestu Boga našega; Bog ga utrjuje na veke. 
[48:10] Milost tvojo premišljamo, o Bog, sredi tvojega svetišča. 
[48:11] Kakor ime tvoje, tako je slava tvoja noter do krajev zemlje; pravice je polna desnica tvoja. 
[48:12] Veselí se naj gora Sijonska, radujejo se hčere Judove zavoljo sodeb tvojih. 
[48:13] Obhajajte Sijon, in obdajajte ga; štejte stolpe njegove. 
[48:14] Upirajte misli svoje na trdnjavo, povzdignite oči k dvorom njegovim, da oznanjate prihodnjemu rodu. 
[48:15] Ker ta je naš Bog na vedno večne čase; ta nas bode vodil noter do smrti. 
[49:1] Načelniku godbe med nasledniki Koretovimi, psalm. 
[49:2] Čujte to, vsa ljudstva, poslušajte, vsi sveta prebivalci: 
[49:3] Nizki in visoki; bogatin in siromak enako. 
[49:4] Usta moja bodejo govorila razno modrost, in srca mojega premišljevanje mnogotero razumnost. 
[49:5] Uho svoje nagnem k priliki, na strunah bodem razodeval uganko svojo. 
[49:6] Kaj bi se bal o hudem času, da me ne obdá sledóv mojih krivica, 
[49:7] Njih, ki zaupajo v mogočnost svojo, in se ponašajo v obilosti svojega bogastva? 
[49:8] Brata nikakor ne more odkupiti nihče, ne dati Bogu odkupnine njegove. 
[49:9] (Drag namreč je njih življenja odkup, dà, ni ga vekomaj!) 
[49:10] Da bi živel še večno, ne izkusil trohnobe. 
[49:11] Vidi namreč, da mrjó modri, enako pogine nespametni in neumni, in drugim pušča bogastvo svoje. 
[49:12] Menili so, da se hiše njih stavijo za veke, prebivališča njih za vse rodove, ko so jih imenovali po svojih imenih po deželah. 
[49:13] In vendar človek v časti ne bode ostal; podoben postane živalim, ki poginejo. 
[49:14] Ta je njih pot, njih upanje; in nasledniki njih odobravajo njih usta. 
[49:15] Kakor živino pasla jih bode smrt razpostavljene v grobu, dokler jim gospodujejo pravični tisto jutro, in obliko njih pokonča pekel, iz prebivališča njegovega. 
[49:16] Ali Bog bode rešil dušo mojo groba, ko me bode sprejel mogočno. 
[49:17] Ne bój se, ko kdo bogat postane, ko se pomnoži domača slava njegova; 
[49:18] Ker v smrti ne vzame nič tega sè seboj; za njim ne pojde slava njegova. 
[49:19] Ko bode blagoslavljal dušo svojo v življenji svojem, in te bodejo slavili, ker si privoščiš: 
[49:20] Da pride noter do dobe očetov svojih, vekomaj vendar ne bodejo uživali luči. 
[49:21] Človek, ki je v čisli a ni razumen, podoben je živini, katera pogine. 
[50:1] Psalm Asafu; Bog mogočni, Bog Gospod govori in kliče zemljo od vzhoda solnčnega do zahoda. 
[50:2] Sè Sijona, najvišje lepote, proseva Bog. 
[50:3] (Pridi, naš Bog, in ne delaj se gluhega); ogenj razsaja pred njim, in silno viharno je okrog njega. 
[50:4] Nebesa kliče od zgoraj, in zemljo, da sodi ljudstvo svoje: 
[50:5] Zberite mi jih, katerim sem delil milost, kateri so storili zavezo z menoj po daritvi. 
[50:6] Ko so nebesa oznanjala pravico njegovo, da je Bog sodnik, 
[50:7] Čuj, ljudstvo moje, in govoril bodem, Izrael, in na pričo te klical; Bog, Bog naj bodem tvoj. 
[50:8] Ne zavoljo daritev tvojih te bodem svaril, da naj bodejo žgalne daritve tvoje vedno pred menoj. 
[50:9] Ne sprejmem iz hiše tvoje junca, kozličev iz tvojih ograj. 
[50:10] Ker moja je vsaka gozdna zver, živali v gorah tisoč, 
[50:11] Vse tiče gorske poznam, in živali poljske so v moji oblasti. 
[50:12] Ko bi bil gladen, ne rekel bi tebi; ker moja je zemlja vesoljna in njena obilost. 
[50:13] Ali živim o mesu krepkih juncev, ali pijem kozlov kri? 
[50:14] Hvalo daruj Bogu, in najvišjemu opravljaj obljube svoje. 
[50:15] In kliči me o času stiske; rešil te bodem, da me čestiš. 
[50:16] Krivičnemu pa pravi Bog: Kaj da naštevaš zapovedi moje in jemlješ zavezo mojo v svoja usta? 
[50:17] Ker ti sovražiš poštenje, in besede moje si vrgel zá se. 
[50:18] Kakor hitro vidiš tatú, sprijazniš se z njim; in s prešestniki je delež tvoj. 
[50:19] Usta svoja rabiš za húdo, in z jezikom svojim spletaš zvijačo. 
[50:20] Sedé obrekuješ svojega brata, sina matere svoje sramotiš. 
[50:21] Ko si to počel, delal sem se gluhega; zato meniš, da sem prav tebi podoben: svarim te in govorim ti v óči. 
[50:22] Pázite vendar na to vi, ki zábite Boga, da ne zgrabim in ga ne bode, da bi rešil. 
[50:23] Kdor daruje hvalo, česti me, in kdor uravnava pot, storil bodem, da uživa blaginjo Božjo. 
[50:24] 
[51:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov, 
[51:2] Ko je prišel k njemu Natan prerok, potem ko se je bil sešèl z Betsebo. 
[51:3] Milosten mi bodi, o Bog, po dobroti svoji; po obilosti svojega usmiljenja izbriši pregrehe moje. 
[51:4] Dobro me operi krivice moje, in greha mojega očisti me. 
[51:5] Ker pregrehe svoje jaz spoznavam, in greh moj biva mi vedno pred očmi. 
[51:6] Tebi, tebi samemu sem grešil, in storil kar se zlo vidi v tvojih očeh; da se opravičiš v govorih svojih; čist si, kader ti sodiš. 
[51:7] Glej, v krivici sem storjen in v grehu me je spočela mati moja. 
[51:8] Glej, resnice se raduješ v osrčji; in skrivaj si mi razodél modrost svojo. 
[51:9] Očisti me z isopom, da bodem čist; operi me, da bodem bel nad sneg. 
[51:10] Stóri, da čujem veselje in radost, radujejo se kosti, katere si potrl. 
[51:11] Skrij srdito obličje svoje grehom mojim, in vse krivice moje izbriši. 
[51:12] Srce mi čisto ustvari, Bog, in duh krepak ponovi v meni. 
[51:13] Ne zavrzi me izpred svojega obličja; in svojega svetega duha ne jemlji od mene nazaj. 
[51:14] Daj mi nazaj veselje blaginje svoje; in z duhom blagodušnosti podpiraj me. 
[51:15] Učil bodem krivičnike pota tvoja, da se grešniki povrnejo k tebi. 
[51:16] Reši me krvi, o Bog, Bog blaginje moje; jezik moj naj poje pravico tvojo. 
[51:17] Gospod, odpri moje ustne, in usta moja bodejo oznanjala hvalo tvojo. 
[51:18] Ker ne veseliš se daritve; nočeš, da dajem žgalni dar. 
[51:19] Daritve Božje so duh potrt; srca potrtega in pobitega, o Bog, ne zametaš. 
[51:20] Oblagodari po dobri volji Sijon; sezidaj zidovje Jeruzalemsko. 
[51:21] Tedaj se bodeš veselil daritev pravice, žgalnih in celih daritev; tedaj bodo pobožni pokladali junce na tvoj oltar. 
[52:1] Načelniku godbe, pesem Davidova ukovita. 
[52:2] Ko je Doeg Idumejec prišel in naznanil Savlu ter rekel mu: David je obiskal hišo Abimelekovo. 
[52:3] Kaj se šopiriš v hudobi, o mogočni? Milost Boga mogočnega trpi vsak dan. 
[52:4] Bridkosti izmišljene napravljaš z jezikom svojim; podoben je ostri britvi, ti zvijače snovatelj! 
[52:5] Hudo ljubiš bolj ko dobro, laž bolj ko govoriti pravico, presilno. 
[52:6] Ljubil si vse besede pogubne, jezik zvijačen. 
[52:7] Tudi to Bog mogočni podere na vekomaj; zgrabi te in izdere iz šatora; in s kórena te izpuli iz dežele živečih, presilno. 
[52:8] To bodejo videli pravični v Božjem strahu, in njemu se smijali: 
[52:9] Glej onega moža, ki si ni bil vzel Boga za brambo; nego zanašal se je na bogastva svojega obilost, in utrjal se v hudobi svoji. 
[52:10] Jaz pa, kakor oljka zeleneča v hiši Božji, zaupam milosti Božji na vedno večne čase. 
[52:11] Slavil te bodem vekomaj, ker si storil to; in čakal bodem imena tvojega, ker si dober, pred njimi, katerim deliš milost. 
[53:1] Načelniku godbe na piščal; pesem Davidova ukovita. 
[53:2] Nespametni govori v srci svojem: Ni ga Boga; pohujšujejo in ostudno krivico doprinašajo, ni ga, da bi delal dobro. 
[53:3] Bog z neba gleda dol na sinove človeške, da bi videl, je li kateri, da bi bil razumen, da bi iskal Boga. 
[53:4] Vsak je odstopil, izpridili so se vsi vkup: ni ga, da bi delal dobro, ne enega samega. 
[53:5] Ali si niso v svesti, kateri delajo krivico, ker žró ljudstvo moje kruh jedóč, ne kličejo Boga? 
[53:6] Tam se preplašijo od groze, kjer ni groze; ker Bog razsuje kosti vsakega, kateri ima šatorišče svoje zoper tebe; osramotiš jih, ker Bog jih zameta. 
[53:7] O kdó naj dá blaginjo sè Sijona Izraelu? Ko bode nazaj peljal iz sužnjosti ljudstva svojega krdelo, veselil se bode Jakob, radoval se Izrael. 
[54:1] Načelniku godbe na strune; pesem Davidova, ukovita. 
[54:2] Ko so prišli Zifejci in rekli Savlu: Ali ne tiči David pri nas? 
[54:3] Bog, zavoljo imena svojega reši me, in po kreposti svoji potegni se zame. 
[54:4] Bog, čuj molitev mojo, uho nagni besedam mojih ust. 
[54:5] Ker tujci spenjajo se proti meni in silovitniki iščejo življenje moje; Boga nimajo pred očmi. 
[54:6] Glej, Bog mi pomaga, Gospod je med njimi, ki podpirajo življenje moje. 
[54:7] Sovražnikom mojim vrni tisto zlo, po resničnosti svoji jih pokončaj. 
[54:8] Obilo ti bodem daroval; slavil bodem ime tvoje, Gospod, ker je dobro. 
[54:9] Ker reši me vsake stiske, in sovražnike moje gleda moje oko. 
[55:1] Načelniku godbe na strune, pesem Davidova ukovita, 
[55:2] Sliši, Bog, molitev mojo, in prošnji moji se ne skrivaj! 
[55:3] Ozri se v mé in usliši me; glasno jokam v premišljevanji in zdihujem: 
[55:4] Zavoljo glasú sovražnikovega, zavoljo krivičnega stiske; ker v mé obračajo krivico, in srditi me preganjajo sè srčnim sovraštvom. 
[55:5] Srce moje me boli v meni, in smrtni strahovi me obhajajo. 
[55:6] Strah in trepet me napada, in groza me pokriva. 
[55:7] Tako da pravim: O da bi mi dal kdó perot kakor golobu; zletel bi, kjer bi mogel prebivati. 
[55:8] Glej, kar najdalje bi pobegnil, prebivat v puščavi. 
[55:9] Hitreje bi pobegnil od vetra viharnega, od vrtinca. 
[55:10] Pogúbi, Gospod, razdeli njih jezik; ker silovitost in prepir vidim v mestu. 
[55:11] Podnevi in ponoči ga obdajajo na zidovji njegovem; in krivica in hudobnost sta sredi njega. 
[55:12] Težave so sredi njega, in ne umakneta se z ulic njegovih goljufija in zvijača. 
[55:13] Ker ne nasprotnik me sramotí, to bi prenašal; ne sovražnik moj se spenja proti meni, njemu bi se skril: 
[55:14] Temuč tí, človek, meni enak, vodnik moj in znanec moj, 
[55:15] Ki sva skupaj sladkó se posvetovala, v hišo Božjo hodila z množico. 
[55:16] Napadla jih bode smrt terjalka, živi pogreznejo se v grob; ker hudobija je, kjer bivajo oni, v njih sredi. 
[55:17] Jaz bodem klical Boga, in Gospod me bode rešil. 
[55:18] Zvečer in zjutraj in o poludné bodem premišljal in stokal, dokler ne bode slišal mojega glasu. 
[55:19] Rešil je življenje moje, da se ne vojskujejo zoper mene, postavil ga v mir; ko so z mnogimi krdeli vojskovali se, bili so poleg mene. 
[55:20] Slišal bode Bog mogočni in jih zarotil, kakor ostane vekomaj; v katerih ni prememb in se ne bojé Boga. 
[55:21] Roko svojo steza nad njé, ki živé v miru med seboj, oskrunja zavezo svojo. 
[55:22] Sladke so, maslene besede njegove, a vojska tiči v njegovem srci; mehkeji od olja so njegove besede, ali goli meči. 
[55:23] Nad Gospoda zváli, karkoli ti dá, in on te bode podpiral; nikdar ne pripustí pravičnemu, da omahne. 
[55:24] Ti torej, Bog, pahneš jih v jamo gnjilobe: ljudje krvoločni in zvijačni ne doživé dní svojih polovice, jaz pa bodem tebi zaupal. 
[56:1] Načelniku godbe, o duši, ki silo trpi od tujcev krdela, odlična pesem Davidova, ko so ga prijeli Filistejci v Gatu. 
[56:2] Milosten mi bodi, Bog, ker rohneč me preganja človek, ves dan me stiska oblegovatelj. 
[56:3] Rohné zalezovalci moji vés dan, ker mnogo jih je; z višave naj mi pomagajo borilci. 
[56:4] Ko se bodem bal, zaupal bodem v tebe. 
[56:5] V Bogu bodem hvalil besedo njegovo; v Boga bodem zaupal, ne bodem se bal: Kaj naj bi mi storilo meso? 
[56:6] Ves dan žalijo mojo stvar; zoper mene merijo vse njih misli v hudo. 
[56:7] Zbirajo, skrivajo se oni; na moj sled prežé, kakor ki iščejo življenje moje. 
[56:8] Poleg krivičnosti jim stóri, v jezi pahni ljudstva, Bog. 
[56:9] Ti imaš sešteto tavanje moje; v meh svoj deni vsako solzo mojo, ali bi jih ne imel seštetih? 
[56:10] Tedaj se povrnejo sovražniki moji nazaj; tisti dan, ko bodem vpil: To vém, da mi bode Bog na strani. 
[56:11] V Bogu bodem hvalil besedo, v Gospodu hvalil besedo. 
[56:12] V Boga zaupam, ne bodem se bal; kaj bi mi storil človek? 
[56:13] Z menoj bodejo, o Bog, obljube tvoje; zahvaljeval se bodem tebi. 
[56:14] Ker dušo mojo otimaš smrti; ali bi ne rešil nóg mojih padca? da neprestano hodim pred Bogom v tega življenja luči. 
[57:1] Načelniku godbe: "Ne pogubi", Davidova pesem odlična, ko je bežal pred Savlom v brlog. 
[57:2] Milosten mi bodi, Bog, milosten mi bodi; ker k tebi je pribežala duša moja, in v senco peroti tvojih hočem pribežati, dokler ne minejo težave. 
[57:3] Klical bodem Boga najvišjega, mogočnega, ki zvršuje za me. 
[57:4] Poslal bode z nebes rešit me, osramotil bode njega, ki me rohneč preganja silovito. Poslal bode Bog milost svojo in resnico svojo. 
[57:5] Jaz sem med levi groznimi, med požigalci ležim, med ljudmi, katerih zobje so sulice in pušice, in jezik njih je oster meč. 
[57:6] Povišaj se nad nebesa, o Bog; nad vso zemljo v slavi svoji. 
[57:7] Mrežo so bili nastavili stopinjam mojim; potlačil je bil dušo mojo; jamo so bili skopali pred menoj, vanjo padajo silno. 
[57:8] S povzdignenim srcem svojim, o Bog, s povzdignenim srcem bodem pel in prepeval: 
[57:9] Vstani, slava moja, vstanite brenklje in strune, budil bodem sè zarijo; 
[57:10] Slavil te bodem med ljudstvi, Gospod; prepeval med narodi; 
[57:11] Velika je do nebés milost tvoja, in noter do gornjih oblakov resnica tvoja. 
[57:12] Povišaj se nad nebesa, o Bog; nad vso zemljo v slavi svoji. 
[58:1] Načelniku godbe: "Ne pogubi"; Davidova pesem odlična. 
[58:2] Ali zares, o krdelo, govorite pravico? po pravici sodite, sinovi človeški? 
[58:3] Ne, celo iz srca počenjate krivice; v tej deželi tehtate rok svojih silovitost. 
[58:4] V stran zavijajo krivični od rojstva; tavajo od materinega telesa laž govoreč. 
[58:5] Strup imajo podoben kačjemu strupu; kakor gada gluhega, ki si maši uho svoje. 
[58:6] Kateri ne posluša glasú mrmrajočih, njega, ki zna zagovarjati jako. 
[58:7] O Bog, zdróbi jim zobe v njih ustih; mladih levov kočnike poderi, Gospod! 
[58:8] Stopé se naj kakor voda, odidejo naj neprestano; njemu, ki napenja pušice svoje, izpremené se naj kakor v klasje pušice. 
[58:9] Kakor polž, ki se topi, bode naj vsak, kakor žene splav, kakor ki niso videli solnca. 
[58:10] Ko se ne bode še čutilo trnje vaše, trnje ščipkovo, tako zeleno kakor suho podrl bode vse. 
[58:11] Radoval se bode pravični, ko bode videl maščevanje; noge svoje bode umival v krivičnega krvi. 
[58:12] In človek poreče: Vendar ima sad pravični, vendar je sodnik na zemlji! 
[59:1] Načelniku godbe: "Ne pogubi"; Davidova pesem odlična; ko je bil poslal Savel može, ki so ogledavali hišo njegovo, da bi ga umorili. 
[59:2] Reši me sovražnikov mojih, moj Bog; nad nje, ki se spenjajo v méne, povzdigni me. 
[59:3] Reši me njih, ki delajo krivico, in ljudî krvoločnih otmi me. 
[59:4] Ker, glej, življenje moje zalezujejo, shajajo se zoper mene krepki, brez hudobije moje, brez greha mojega, Gospod! 
[59:5] Brez krivice moje se zbirajo in pripravljajo: vstani meni naproti in ozri se. 
[59:6] Ti torej, Gospod, Bog vojnih krdél, Bog Izraelov, zbúdi se, obiskat vse one narode: ne bodi milosten nikomur, ki dela krivico, nezvesto. 
[59:7] Povračajo se zvečer; bevkajo kakor pes, in obdajajo mesto. 
[59:8] Glej, bljujejo z usti svojimi, z mečem na ustnah svojih; ker kdo sliši? pravijo. 
[59:9] Ti pa, Gospod, bodeš se jim smijal, zasmehoval bodeš vse tiste narode. 
[59:10] Ko ima on moč, gledal bodem v té, ker Bog je moj grad. 
[59:11] Bog milosti moje bode me prestregel; Bog storí, da bodem gledal sovražnike svoje. 
[59:12] Ne pobij jih, da ne pozabijo rojaki moji; izženi jih s krepostjo svojo, in pahni jih dol, ščit naš, Gospod! 
[59:13] Greh njih ust je njih ustnic beseda; ko bodejo vjeti v napuhu svojem, tedaj naj oznanjajo od prekletstva, tedaj od slabosti. 
[59:14] Pokončaj v srdu, pokončaj, da jih ne bode več; vedó naj, da Bog gospoduje v Jakobu do mej zemlje. 
[59:15] Ko se povračajo zvečer, bevkajo naj kakor pes, in obdajajo mesto. 
[59:16] Sami se naj gonijo, da bi jedli; ko ne bodejo nasíteni, tedaj primorani naj bodejo prenočevati. 
[59:17] Jaz pa bodem prepeval moč tvojo, in pel bodem do vsakega jutra milost tvojo, da si ti mi bil grad moj in pribežališče, ko sem bil v stiski. 
[59:18] O moč moja, tebi bodem prepeval, da je Bog grad moj, Bog milosti moje. 
[60:1] Načelniku godbe, na šestostrunje pričanja, pesem odlična Davidova, za uk. 
[60:2] Ko se je boril sè Sirci Mezopotamijskimi, in Sirci Zobejskimi in je Joab vrnivši se pobil Edomejcev v solni dolini dvanajst tisoč. 
[60:3] O Bog, zavrgel si nas bil, raztrgal nas, srdit si bil, povrni se nam. 
[60:4] Zmajal si bil deželo, razdrobil jo; sceli kosove njene, ker omahuje. 
[60:5] Storil si bil, da je ljudstvo tvoje čutilo trdóst, dál si nam bil piti grozo kakor vino. 
[60:6] Dal si njim, ki se tebe bojé, zastavo, katero naj rabijo, zaradi resnice mogočno. 
[60:7] Da se rešijo ljubljenci tvoji; reši z desnico svojo in usliši me. 
[60:8] Bog je govoril po svetosti svoji, radoval se bodem; v delež dobim Sihem, in dolino Sukotsko merim. 
[60:9] Moj je Gilead in moj Manase in Efraim glave moje moč, Juda postavodajalec moj. 
[60:10] Moab umivalnica moja, na Edomejca vržem čevelj svoj, nad máno, Palestina, ukaj! 
[60:11] Kdo bi me popeljal v mesto trdno, kdo bi me peljal noter do Edomeje? 
[60:12] Ali nisi bil ti, Bog, zavrgel nas; da nisi hodil, Bog, med našimi vojskámi? 
[60:13] Daj nam pomoč zoper sovražnika; ker ničeva je pomoč človeška. 
[60:14] V Bogu delajmo vrlo, in on bode poteptal sovražnike naše. 
[61:1] Načelniku godbe na strune, pesem Davidova. 
[61:2] Sliši Bog, vpitje moje, ozri se v molitev mojo. 
[61:3] Od skrajnosti dežele te kličem, ko se pogreza srce moje; na skalo, ki bodi višja od mene, pelji me. 
[61:4] Ker bil si mi pribežališče, stolp krepak zoper sovražnika. 
[61:5] Bival bodem v šatoru tvojem na veke; pribežal bodem pod peróti tvojih zatišje. 
[61:6] Ker ti, Bog, si poslušal obljube moje, dal si dedovino spoštujočim ime tvoje. 
[61:7] Dni dodaj dnevom kraljevim; leta njegova naj bodejo kakor mnogih rodov. 
[61:8] Ostane naj vekomaj pred Bogom; milost in zvestobo pripravi, da naj ga varujeti. 
[61:9] Tako bodem prepeval tvojemu imenu večno, opravljajoč vsak dan obljube svoje. 
[62:1] Načelniku godbe v Jedutunu, psalm Davidov. 
[62:2] Samo v Bogu počiva duša moja, od njega je moja blaginja. 
[62:3] Samo on je skala moja in blaginja moja; grad moj, ne omahnem mnogo. 
[62:4] Doklej bodete snovali težave nad moža? pobiti bodete vsi, podobni nagnenemu zidu, ograji omajani. 
[62:5] Samo z visokosti njegove pahniti ga ukrepljejo, veselé se laži; z usti svojimi blagoslavljajo, znotraj v sebi pa preklinjajo hudo. 
[62:6] Samo v Bogu počivaj, duša moja, ker od njega je upanje moje. 
[62:7] Samo on je skala moja in blaginja moja, grad moj; ne omahnem. 
[62:8] V Bogu je blaginja moja in slava moja; krepka skala moja, pribežališče moje je v Bogu. 
[62:9] Zaupajte mu vsak čas, o ljudstvo; pred njim izlijte srce svoje: Bog nam je v pribežališče. 
[62:10] Sama ničevost so prostega človeka otroci, laž so odličnega moža otroci; na tehtnico vkup položeni, poskočili bi nad ničevost. 
[62:11] Ne zaupajte zatiranju, in zaradi ropa ne bodite prevzetni; ako se množi bogastvo, ne navezujte nanj srca. 
[62:12] Enkrat je govoril Bog, dvakrat sem slišal isto, da je moč Božja, 
[62:13] In da je milost tvoja, Gospod, da bodeš ti povrnil vsakemu po delu svojem. 
[63:1] Psalm Davidov, ko je bil v puščavi Judovi. 
[63:2] O Bog, Bog mogočni si moj, zgodaj te iščem; dušo mojo žeja po tebi; po tebi hrepeni moje meso, v deželi suhi in onemogli brez vodá: 
[63:3] Gledati tvojo moč in slavo: tvojo, kakor sem te gledal v svetem kraji. 
[63:4] (Ker milost tvoja je boljša od življenja), hvalijo naj te ustne moje. 
[63:5] Tako te bodem blagoslavljal v življenji svojem, v imenu tvojem bodem povzdigaval svoje roke. 
[63:6] Kakor tolšče in masti bode se nasitila duša moja, in z blagoglasnimi ustnami bodo te hvalila usta moja. 
[63:7] Ko se spomnim tebe na ležišči svojem, čujem in premišljam tebe: 
[63:8] Da si bil velika pomoč meni, tako da sem prepeval v senci tvojih peroti; 
[63:9] Ko se duša moja tebe drži in gre za teboj, podpira me desnica tvoja. 
[63:10] Zatorej bodejo oni, ki iščejo pogubljenja duše moje, prišli v najspodnje kraje zemlje. 
[63:11] Storili bodo, da vsak iz med njih pogine z mečem; lesicam bodejo delež. 
[63:12] Kralj pa sam bode se radoval v Bogu; ponašal se bode, kdorkoli priseza pri njem, ko se bodejo zamašila usta laž govorečim. 
[64:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[64:2] Čuj, o Bog, glas moj, ko premišljujem; strahu sovražnikovega varuj življenje moje. 
[64:3] Skrivaj me skrivnemu naklepu hudobnih, ropotanju njih, ki delajo krivico: 
[64:4] Ki brusijo kakor meč jezik svoj, napenjajo kakor pušico svojo bridko besedo. 
[64:5] S kopjem napadajo poštenjaka iz zakotja; nenadoma ga napadajo s kopjem in se ne bojé. 
[64:6] Potrjujejo si reč hudobno; o skrivanji zank govoré; pravijo: Kdo bi jih videl? 
[64:7] Preiskujejo krivice; oslabeli smo po tem, kar so tako zvito preiskali; tako globoko je osrčje moža in srce. 
[64:8] Ali ko jih bode Bog napadel s kopjem, pušica nagla bodejo njih udarci. 
[64:9] In storili bodejo, da sè samim jezikom svojim udarijo sebe; razkropljeni se bodejo spustili v beg, kdorkoli jih bode videl. 
[64:10] Katerikoli pa ljudjé se bojé, oznanjali bodo delo Božje in dejanje njegovo stavili pred óči. 
[64:11] Veselil se bode pravični v Gospodu, in pribežal k njemu; ponašali se bodo vsi, ki so pravega srca. 
[65:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov, pesem. 
[65:2] Tebi gré gotova hvala, o Bog, ki si na Sijonu, in tebi je opravljati obljubo. 
[65:3] O ki slušaš molitev, noter do tebe pride vse meso. 
[65:4] Premagale so me bile hudobije, grehe naše tí opiraš. 
[65:5] Blagor mu, kogar izvoliš in pripuščaš, da bode prebival v vežah tvojih: sitimo se z dobroto hiše tvoje, sè svetimi rečmi tvojega svetišča. 
[65:6] Čestitljive reči nam govoriš v pravici, o Bog blaginje naše; zaupanje vseh dalnjih pokrajin zemlje in morja. 
[65:7] Gore utrjuješ v kreposti svoji, z močjo opasan. 
[65:8] Šum morja strahuješ, šum vodá njegovih, in narodov hrup; 
[65:9] Ki delaš, da prepevajo jutranje vzhode in večerne prebivalci pokrajin, boječ se znamenj tvojih. 
[65:10] Obiskuješ to zemljo in je želiš, močno jo bogatiš; s potokom Božjim polnim vodé; pripravljaš njih žito, ko si jo tako obdelal. 
[65:11] Razore njene namakaš, brazde njene poravnavaš; z deževjem jo raztapljaš, kal njeno blagoslavljaš. 
[65:12] Venčaš dobrote svoje leto, in sledovi tvoji kapljajo maščobo. 
[65:13] Kapljajo v ograje puščave in z radostjo se ogrinjajo griči. 
[65:14] Pašniki se odevajo s čedami, in doline se pokrivajo s pšenico; ukajoč delajo in tudi pojó. 
[66:1] Načelniku godbe, pesem in psalm. Ukajte Bogu, vsi zemljani. 
[66:2] Prepevajte slavo njegovega imena; slavo pridevajte hvali njegovi. 
[66:3] Govorite Bogu: Kako čestitljiv si v delih svojih: zavoljo obilosti moči tvoje se ti lažnjivo udajajo sovražniki tvoji. 
[66:4] Vsi zemljani naj se ti klanjajo in ti prepevajo; prepevajo naj tvojemu imenu, presilno. 
[66:5] Pridite in glejte dela Božja; čestitljiv je v dejanji proti sinovom človeškim. 
[66:6] Morje izpreminja v suho; reko so pregazile noge, tam smo radovali se v njem. 
[66:7] Z močjo svojo gospoduje vekomaj; oči njegove gledajo narode: kateri so uporni, naj se ne povišujejo preveč pri sebi! 
[66:8] Blagoslavljajte Boga našega, ljudstva, in glas hvale njegove naj se razlega; 
[66:9] Kateri je dušo našo nazaj postavil v življenje, in ne pripusti, da omahnejo noge naše. 
[66:10] Potem, ko si nas izkušal, Bog, raztopil si nas, kakor se topi srebro. 
[66:11] Peljal si nas v samo mrežo; dél si nam podprsnico okolo ledja. 
[66:12] Storil si, da je sédel človek na glavo našo, šli smo skozi ogenj in skozi vodo; slednjič si nas pripeljal do té sitosti. 
[66:13] Sè žgalnimi darovi pojdem v hišo tvojo in opravim svoje obljube, 
[66:14] Katere so izrekle odprte ustne moje, in govorila moja usta v stiski moji. 
[66:15] Žgalne darí tolstih ovnov bodem ti daroval s kadilom; pripravil vole s kozli, močno. 
[66:16] Pridite, poslušajte, kateri koli se bojite Boga, da povem, kaj je storil duši moji. 
[66:17] Njega sem klical sè svojimi usti, in povišan sem bil za govore svojega jezika. 
[66:18] Ako bi se bil v krivico obrnil sè srcem svojim, Gospod bi ne bil slišal. 
[66:19] Ali vendar slišal je Bog, ozrl se v prošnje moje glas. 
[66:20] Blagoslovljen Bog, kateri ni zavrgel prošnje moje in mi ni odtegnil milosti svoje. 
[67:1] Načelniku godbe na strune, psalm in pesem. 
[67:2] Bog nam stórí milost in blagoslavljaj nas, razsvetli naj obličje svoje proti nam. 
[67:3] Da spoznamo na zemlji tvoj pot, v vseh narodih blaginjo tvojo. 
[67:4] Slavé te naj ljudstva, Bog, slavé te ljudstva vsa. 
[67:5] Veselé se naj in pojó narodi, ko bodeš prav sodil ljudstva, in narode same bodeš vodil po zemlji mogočno. 
[67:6] Slavé te naj ljudstva, Bog, slavé te ljudstva vsa. 
[67:7] Zemlja daje sad svoj; blagoslovi nas Bog, naš Bog: 
[67:8] Blagoslóvi nas Bog, in bojé se ga naj vse meje zemljé. 
[68:1] Načelniku godbe, Davidov psalm in pesem. 
[68:2] Ko vstane Bog, razkropé se neprijatelji njegovi, in srditi sovražniki njegovi bežé pred njegovim obličjem. 
[68:3] Kakor bi puhnil dim, puhneš jih, kakor se staja vosek v ognji, izginejo krivični izpred Božjega obličja. 
[68:4] Pravični pa se veséli radujejo pred Bogom, in se veselé v radosti. 
[68:5] Pojte Bogu, prepevajte njegovemu imenu; povišujte ga, ki sedí v sami lepoti, ime mu je Gospod, in radujte se pred njim. 
[68:6] Oče je sirotam in bramba vdovam, Bog v prebivališči svetosti svoje. 
[68:7] Bog stavi v rodovino samotarje; izpeljuje zvezane iz vezî; in uporniki prebivajo v kraji presuhem. 
[68:8] O Bog, ko si hodil pred ljudstvom svojim, ko si stopal po samoti izvrstno; 
[68:9] Tresla se je zemlja, tudi nebesa so se rosila od pričujočnosti Božje, sam Sinaji od pričujočnosti Božje, Boga Izraelovega. 
[68:10] Dež preobilen si rosil, Bog; posestvo svoje, in to hirajoče, si oživljal. 
[68:11] Tvoji so krdeloma prebivali v njem; ti ga pripravljaš po dobroti svoji onemu ubozemu siromaku, Bog. 
[68:12] Bog je dajal govor; one, ki so oznanjale, dejale so v veliki vojni: 
[68:13] Kralji vojnih krdél bežé, bežé; in ona, ki biva domá, plén deli. 
[68:14] Če ste tudi ležali med dvema kupoma kamenja, bodete podobni perotim goloba srebrom kritega, katerega pérje je iz rumenega zlata izkopanega. 
[68:15] Ko bode vsemogočni razkropil kralje v tej deželi, bodeš bel kakor sneg na Salmonu, 
[68:16] Največji gori, gori Basanski; gori grbasti, gori Basanski. 
[68:17] Zakaj bi se podrle, grbaste gore? té gorske kraje želi Bog za sedež svoj, Gospod tudi bode prebival v njih vekomaj. 
[68:18] Vozov Božjih je dvakrat deset tisoč, tisoč in tisoč: Gospod z njimi, Gospod Sinaji v svetišči. 
[68:19] Dvigajoč se v višavo dobil si v pest vjetnikov množino, prejemajoč dal si darí ljudém; tudi upornike bivajoč dobivaš v pest, Gospod Bog. 
[68:20] Blagoslovljen Gospod, kateri nas vsak dan obklada z darovi; Bog ón mogočni, blaginja naša. 
[68:21] Bog ón mogočni nam je Bog mogočni, za vsakatero blaginjo, in Gospodovi so izhodi zoper smrt sámo. 
[68:22] Samo Bog razbija glavo sovražnikov svojih; téme lasato njega, ki hodi neprestano v krivicah svojih. 
[68:23] Rekel je bil Gospod: Iz Basana pripeljem nazaj, nazaj pripeljem iz globočin morjá, 
[68:24] Da razbijajoč pomočiš nogo svojo v kri; jezik psov svojih v kri sovražnika vsakega izmed njih. 
[68:25] Ko so videli hojo tvojo, o Bog, hojo mojega Boga mogočnega, kralja mojega, kateri je v svetišči; 
[68:26] Šli so spredaj pevci, potem godci; med deklicami, ki so bíle na tambure. 
[68:27] V zborih blagoslavljajte Boga, Gospoda, kateri ste iz vira Izraelovega. 
[68:28] Ondi bodi Benjamin mali in gospodar njih; prvaki Judovski in njih krdela, prvaki Zabulonovi, Naftalijevi prvaki. 
[68:29] Bog tvoj zapoveduje, da bodi krepák; okrepčaj, o Bog, ker si deloval v nas, 
[68:30] Iz svetišča svojega zavoljo Jeruzalema. Tebi prinesó kralji darilo. 
[68:31] Pogúbi krdelo trstonosno, čedo krepkih juncev s teleti ljudstev, ki se na videz udaje s kosovi srebra; razkropi ljudstva, ki jih vojske veselé. 
[68:32] Pridejo naj velikaši iz Egipta, Etiopija naj hitro pošlje rok svojih dar Bogu. 
[68:33] Kraljestva zemeljska, pojte Bogu; prepevajte Gospodu silno, 
[68:34] Kateri sedí v starodavnih nebés nebesih: glej, z glasom svojim daje glas krepak od sebe. 
[68:35] Dajajte moč Bogu, veličastvo njegovo je nad Izraelom, in moč njegova v gornjih oblakih. 
[68:36] Strašán si, o Bog, iz svetišč svojih; Bog mogočni Izraelov sam daje moč in sile temu ljudstvu: slava Bogu! 
[69:1] Načelniku godbe na šestero strun, pesem Davidova. 
[69:2] Reši me, Bog, ker vode mi prihajajo noter do duše, 
[69:3] Pogrezam se v blato pregloboko; kjer ni trdnega pod nogo; zahajam v globočine vodâ; in val poplaveč me požira. 
[69:4] Trudim se vpijoč, suši se grlo moje; oči moje pešajo, ko upam v svojega Boga. 
[69:5] Več jih je ko glave moje lâs, ki me sovražijo po krivem; mogočneji so, ki me hočejo ubiti, ki so mi sovražniki po krivici; tedaj me silijo vrniti, česar nisem vzel. 
[69:6] O Bog, ti poznaš nespamet mojo, in krivice moje niso ti skrite. 
[69:7] Ne bodi jih mene sram, kateri čakajo tebe; Gospod, Bog vojnih krdél, rudečica naj ne oblije zaradi mene njih, ki iščejo tebe, Bog Izraelov. 
[69:8] Ker zavoljo tebe prenašam zasmehovanje; sramota pokriva obličje moje. 
[69:9] Tujec sem postal bratom svojim, in neznan matere moje sinovom. 
[69:10] Ker gorečnost za hišo tvojo me razjéda, in zasmehovanje njih, ki tebe zasmehujejo, mene zadeva. 
[69:11] Ko jokajoč pokorim s postom dušo svojo, tedaj se mi to šteje za najhujšo sramoto. 
[69:12] Ko se oblačim v raševino, tedaj sem jim v pregovor. 
[69:13] O meni govoričijo vkup sedeči pri vratih, in pesmi pojó, ko pijejo opojno pijačo. 
[69:14] O meni torej je prošnja moja tá do tebe, Gospod: čas je milosti, Bog, po obilnosti milosti svoje usliši me, po blagi zvestobi svoji. 
[69:15] Potegni me iz blata, in naj se ne pogreznem; otet naj bodem sovražnikov svojih, in iz globočin vodâ. 
[69:16] Valovje vodâ naj me poplaveč ne odnese, in globočina naj me ne pogoltne, in jama naj ne zapre ust svojih nad mano. 
[69:17] Usliši me, Gospod, ker dobra je milost tvoja; po obilosti usmiljenja svojega ozri se v mé. 
[69:18] In ne skrivaj obličja svojega svojemu hlapcu; ker v stiski sem, hiti, usliši me! 
[69:19] Približaj se duši moji, ótmi jo; zavoljo sovražnikov mojih réši me. 
[69:20] Ti poznaš zasramovanje moje in mojo sramoto ter nečast mojo; pred teboj so vsi sovražniki moji. 
[69:21] Zasramovanje tare srce moje, tako da sem bolan; in ko ga čakam, da bi me miloval, nikogar ni; ali tolažiteljev, vendar ne najdem jih. 
[69:22] Dà, za živež mi dajó želča, in v žeji moji dajó mi piti octa. 
[69:23] Njih miza bodi pred njimi za zanko, in za povračila, za zadrgo. 
[69:24] Otemné naj njih oči, da ne vidijo; in daj, da ledja njih omahujejo neprestano. 
[69:25] Razlij na nje jezo svojo, in srd tvoj naj jih dohiti. 
[69:26] Pusti naj bodejo njih gradovi, v šatorih njih ne bodi prebivalca. 
[69:27] Ker preganjajo njega, kateregi si tí udaril, in po bolečini prebodencev tvojih spletajo pripovedke. 
[69:28] Pridevaj kazen kazni njih krivici, in naj ne pridejo v pravico tvojo. 
[69:29] Izbrišejo naj se iz življenja knjige, in s pravičnimi naj se ne zapisujejo. 
[69:30] Jaz pa ubožen in trpeč, blaginja tvoja, Bog, postavila me bode na višavo. 
[69:31] Hvalil bodem ime Božje s pesmijo, in poveličeval ga bodem sè zahvaljevanjem, 
[69:32] Kar se bode bolje zdelo Gospodu, ko vol, junec rogat z razklanimi parklji. 
[69:33] Ko bodejo to videli krotki, veselili se bodo; in oživelo bode srce vaše, ki iščete Boga. 
[69:34] Ker Gospod se ozira na potrebne, in jetnikov svojih ne zameta. 
[69:35] Hvalila ga bodo nebesa in zemlja, morja in karkoli lazi po njih. 
[69:36] Ker Bog otima Sijon in zida z nova mesta Judovska, da stanujejo tam, in podedujejo ono deželo. 
[69:37] Nasledniki, pravim, hlapcev njegovih naj jo posedajo, in ljubitelji imena njegovega naj prebivajo v njej, 
[70:1] Načelniku godbe, pesem Davidova, za spomin. 
[70:2] Bog, otet me, Gospod, pomagat mi híti. 
[70:3] Osramoté se naj in z rudečico oblijó, kateri iščejo duše moje; zavrnejo se naj in onečastijo, ki se veselé nesreče moje. 
[70:4] Umikajo se naj za plačílo sramote svoje, kateri govoré: Prav, prav! 
[70:5] Veselé se naj in radujejo v tebi vsi, ki te iščejo, in govoré naj vedno: Poveličuj se Bog, kateri ljubijo blaginjo tvojo. 
[70:6] Jaz pa sem ubožen in potreben, o Bog; híti za voljo mene, in pomoč moja bodi, rešitelj moj; Gospod, ne múdi se. 
[71:1] K tebi, Gospod, pribegam, sram me ne bodi nikdar. 
[71:2] Po pravici tvoji ótmi me in oprosti me; nagni k meni uho svoje in réši me. 
[71:3] Bodi mi skala, na kateri naj prebivam, kamor naj zahajam vedno; zapoved si dal, da naj se rešim, ker skala moja si in trdnjava moja. 
[71:4] Bog moj, reši me iz roke njegove, ki dela nepravično in neusmiljeno. 
[71:5] Ker ti si nada moja, Bog Gospod; upanje moje od moje mladosti. 
[71:6] Nate se opiram od poroda; od osrčja matere moje odtrgal si me tí; v tebi je hvala moja neprestano. 
[71:7] Kakor čudo bil sem mnogim; tako si mi krepko zavetje. 
[71:8] Napolnijo naj se s hvalo tvojo usta moja, ves dan sè slavo tvojo. 
[71:9] Ne zavrzi me o starosti času; ko peša krepost moja, ne zapústi me; 
[71:10] Ker sovražniki moji govoré o meni, in oni, ki prežé na dušo mojo, posvetujejo se vkup, 
[71:11] Govoreč: Bog ga zapušča, podite in zgrabite ga; ker ni ga, da bi ga rešil. 
[71:12] Bog, ne bivaj daleč od mene, Bog moj, na pomoč mi hiti. 
[71:13] Osramoté se naj in poginejo nasprotniki duše moje; pokrijejo naj se z nečastjo in sramoto, kateri iščejo hudega meni. 
[71:14] Jaz pa sem v nadi neprestano o vsej hvali tvoji, in bodem stanoviten. 
[71:15] Usta moja hočejo oznanjati pravico tvojo, vsak dan blaginjo tvojo: dasi ne znam števil njenih. 
[71:16] Poprijel se bodem vsake kreposti, Bog Gospod; oznanjal bodem pravico samega tebe. 
[71:17] Bog, učil si me od mladosti moje, in do sedaj sem oznanjal čuda tvoja. 
[71:18] Torej tudi toliko časa, ko sem star in siv, Bog, ne zapústi me; dokler bodem oznanjal roko tvojo temu rodu, vsakemu prihodnjemu rodu krepost tvojo. 
[71:19] Ker pravica tvoja, Bog, seza do višav; ker stvari delaš velike, Bog; kdó je tebi enak? 
[71:20] Ker potem ko si dal, da sem izkusil stiske velike in hude, poživljaš me zopet, in iz brezen zemlje daješ da zopet vstajam. 
[71:21] Velikost mojo množiš, in ustaviš se ter me tolažiš. 
[71:22] Tudi jaz te bodem slavil sè strunami, in zvestobo tvojo, moj Bog; prepeval ti bodem s citrami, o svetnik Izraelov! 
[71:23] Pevale bodo ustne moje, ko ti bodem prepeval, in duša moja, k si jo otél. 
[71:24] Tudi jezik moj bode vsak dan oznanjal pravico tvojo, ker bodo se sramovali, ker sè sramoto bodo obliti, ki iščejo hudega meni. 
[72:1] Za Salomona: Bog, sodbe svoje kralju daj in pravico svojo sinu kraljevemu. 
[72:2] Sodi naj ljudstvo tvoje pravično, in uboge tvoje po pravici. 
[72:3] Mir naj ljudstvu gore rodé, in griči zavoljo pravice. 
[72:4] Rešil bode ljudstva siromake, otél ubogih sinove, a zdrobil zatiralca. 
[72:5] Čestili te bodejo, dokler bode solnce, in dokler bode trajal mesec do večnega róda. 
[72:6] Kakor ko pride dež nad travo pokošeno, ko deževje, moča zemlji, 
[72:7] Bode v cvetu o času njegovem pravični, in mirú obilost, dokler da ne bode meseca. 
[72:8] In gospodoval bode od morja do morja in od reke do mej zemljé. 
[72:9] Pred njim se bodo klanjali in čestili ga tujci; in prah bodejo lizali sovražniki njegovi. 
[72:10] Kralji morski in otočani nosili mu bodejo darí; kralji iz Sabeje in Sabe prinesó mu darilo. 
[72:11] Dâ, klanjali se bodo vsi kralji; vsi narodi mu bodejo služili. 
[72:12] Ker rešil bode ljudstvo vpijoče, in ubozega, kateremu ne bode pomočnika. 
[72:13] Prizanašal bode siromaku in potrebnemu, in duše potrebnih bode rešil. 
[72:14] Zvijače in silovitosti bode otél njih dušo; tako draga je njih kri v očeh njegovih. 
[72:15] Torej, dokler bode živel, dajal mu bode zlata Sabejskega, in prosil bode zanj neprestano, ves dan ga blagoslavljal. 
[72:16] Kjer bode peščica pšenice na zemlji, na vrhu gorâ, majal se bode kakor Libanon sad njegov, in cveli bodejo meščani kakor trava zemeljska. 
[72:17] Imé njegovo bode vekomaj; dokler bode solnce, poganjalo bode ime njegovo; in blagoslavljajoč se v njem bodo ga blagrovali vsi narodi. 
[72:18] Slava Gospodu, Bogu, Izraelovemu, kateri sam dela čuda. 
[72:19] In blagoslovljeno ime slave njegove vekomaj, in slave njegove naj se napolni vsa zemlja; zgôdi se, in zgôdi se! 
[72:20] Konec je molitev Davidovih, sina Izajevega. 
[73:1] Psalm Asafov. Dá, dober je Bog Izraelu, čistim v srci. 
[73:2] Jaz pa, malo da se niso izpotaknile noge moje, skoraj nič, da niso izpodrsnili koraki moji, 
[73:3] Ko sem zavidal blazne, gledal krivičnih blagostanje, 
[73:4] Ker ni ga vozla notri do njih smrti, temuč tolsta je njih moč. 
[73:5] V trudu človeškem niso, in z drugimi ljudmi ne tepó jih nadloge. 
[73:6] Zatorej jih obdajajo prevzetnosti verige, pokriva jih kakor dika silovitost. 
[73:7] Svétiti se jim od tolšče obé očesi, kipé misli srčne. 
[73:8] Kužni so, in hudobno govoré zatiranje, in z višave govoré. 
[73:9] V nebo dvigajo usta svoja, in jezik njih prehaja zemljo. 
[73:10] Zatorej se vrača sem ljudstvo njegovo, ko se čaše, vode polne, iztiskajo jim, 
[73:11] Da pravijo: Kako bi poznal Bog mogočni? ali bi bilo znanje v višavi? 
[73:12] Glej tiste krivične, kako mirni vekomaj množijo močí. 
[73:13] Vendar zastonj čistim svoje srce, in v snagi umivam rok svoje; 
[73:14] Ko me tepe vsak dan, in pokora moja mi je gotova vsako jutro. 
[73:15] Ako rečem: Pravil bodem to; glej, izdajalec bi bil zarodu tvojih sinov. 
[73:16] Ako bi mislil spoznati to, težavno se mi je zdelo v mojih očéh; 
[73:17] Dokler sem stopil v svetišča Boga mogočnega, zagledal njih konec. 
[73:18] Ali na polzlo jih staviš, mečeš jih dol v podrtije. 
[73:19] Kako ginejo v zapuščenost, kakor v hipu minejo, konec jih je v grozah. 
[73:20] Kakor sanje, ko se je zbudil kdo: Bog, ko se zbudiš, zaničuješ njih podobo. 
[73:21] Ko se razdraži srce moje, in ko sem se v ledvicah svojih samega zbadal, 
[73:22] Tedaj sem bil brezpameten, ko nisem vedel: kakor živina bil sem pri tebi. 
[73:23] Zatorej bodem jaz vedno s teboj; prijel si roko desno mojo. 
[73:24] Sè sovetom svojim me spremljaj, da me potem v slavo sprejmeš. 
[73:25] Kdo bi mi bil v nebesih razen tebe? in razen tebe se nikogar ne veselim na zemlji. 
[73:26] Ko peša meso moje in srce moje, skala srca mojega in delež moj je Bog vekomaj. 
[73:27] Ker glej, kateri so daleč od tebe, ginejo; pokončaš ga, kdor koli se s prešestvovanjem izneveri tebi. 
[73:28] Meni torej je dobro, da sem blizu Bogu; v Gospoda stavim svoje pribežališče, da oznanjam vsa dela tvoja. 
[74:1] Pesem ukovita, Asafu. Zakaj, Bog, zametaš vekomaj, vedno kadí se jeza tvoja v čedo paše tvoje! 
[74:2] Spomni se občine svoje; da si prej pridobil, odkupil rod posesti svoje, da je to gora Sijonska, na kateri si prebival. 
[74:3] Vzdigni noge svoje na večne podrtije, na vse zlo, kar ga dela sovražnik v svetem kraji. 
[74:4] Rujoveč so sovražniki tvoji sredi zbirališč tvojih postavili znamenja svoja, za znamenja. 
[74:5] Za plemenitega so imeli izmed njih vsakega, kakor je dvigal kvišku nad zapleteno lesovje sekire. 
[74:6] Še zdaj bijejo izdolbene podobe njegove vkup s kolom in s kladivi. 
[74:7] Zažgali so svetišča tvoja, pahnili so na tla in oskrunili prebivališče tvojega imena. 
[74:8] Rekli so v srci svojem: Zgrabimo ga vsi vkup; zapalili so vsa zbirališča Boga mogočnega, in pahnili jih na tla. 
[74:9] Znamenj naših ne vidimo, ni več preroka, in ni ga pri nas, ki bi vedel, doklej. 
[74:10] Doklej, o Bog, bode zasramoval sovražnik, dražil bode neprijatelj ime tvoje vekomaj? 
[74:11] Zakaj odtezaš roko svojo, in desnico svojo? Iz srede nedrija svojega strahúj. 
[74:12] Saj Bog je kralj moj že od nekdaj, delajoč blaginjo sredi zemlje. 
[74:13] Ti si razklal v moči svoji morje; razbil si zmajem glave v vodah. 
[74:14] Ti si razbil somu glave, dajal si hrane samemu ljudstvu, potujočemu skozi puščavo. 
[74:15] Ti si odprl studenec in potok; ti posušaš reke mogočne. 
[74:16] Tvoj je dan, in tvoja noč; ti si napravil luč njeno in solnce. 
[74:17] Ti si postavil vse meje zemlji; samo poletje in zimo napravil si tí. 
[74:18] Spomni se vendar tega, da sovražnik zasramuje, o Gospod, in da ljudstvo nespametno draži ime tvoje. 
[74:19] Ne dajaj tistemu krdelu življenja grlice svoje, krdela ubozih svojih ne pozabi vekomaj. 
[74:20] Ozri se na zavezo, ker napolnjeni so najskrivnejši kraji zemlje, silovitosti so jama. 
[74:21] Kdor je ponižan, naj se ne vrne zmeden; ubogi in potrebni naj hvalita ime tvoje. 
[74:22] Vstani, o Bog; potegni se za pravdo svojo; spomni se zasramovanja svojega, katero ti dela nespametni vsak dan. 
[74:23] Ne pozabi glasú sovražnikov svojih; ropota spenjajočih se v té, ki se množi vedno. 
[75:1] Načelniku godbe: "Ne pogubi!" psalm Asafu in pesem. 
[75:2] Slavimo te, Bog, slavimo; ker blizu je ime tvoje, čuda tvoja oznanjamo. 
[75:3] Ko bodem sprejel zbor, sodil bodem najbolj pravično. 
[75:4] Zemlje in vseh njenih prebivalcev stebre omajane utrdil bodem jaz. 
[75:5] Govoreč blaznim: Ne bodite blazni, in krivičnim: Ne dvigujte roga. 
[75:6] Ne dvigujte roga svojega zoper Najvišjega; ne govorite s trdim vratom. 
[75:7] Ker od vzhoda ali od zahoda, tudi od puščave ni povišanja. 
[75:8] Temuč Bog sodnik: tega poniža, onega poviša. 
[75:9] Ker čaša je v roki Gospodovi in vino kalno, polno mešanice, iz katere je izlil; vendar goščo njeno, katero bodo iztisnili, pili bodo vsi krivični na zemlji. 
[75:10] Jaz torej naj oznanjam vekomaj, prepevam Bogu Jakobovemu: 
[75:11] In vse rogove bodem polomil krivičnim; zvišajo naj se pravičnemu rogovi. 
[76:1] Načelniku godbe na strune, psalm Asafu in pesem. 
[76:2] Plemenit je v Judi Bog, v Izraelu veliko ime njegovo. 
[76:3] V Salemu je koča njegova, in prebivališče na Sijonu. 
[76:4] Ondi je zlomil loke bliskajoče, ščit in meč in vojsko presilno. 
[76:5] Svetál si postal, veličasten, z gorâ plenjenja. 
[76:6] V plen so se dali krepki v srci; spali so spanje svoje; tako da niso našli nobeni možje vojaki svojih rók. 
[76:7] Od hudovanja tvojega, o Bog Jakobov, onemogel je voz in konj. 
[76:8] Ti, tí si strašán, ali bi kdo obstal pred teboj, odkar se jeziš? 
[76:9] Z neba daješ, da se čuje sodba, zemlja se boji in se je umirila, 
[76:10] Ko vstane na sodbo Bog, branit vse krotke na zemlji. 
[76:11] Ker srd človeški te slaví, z ostanki srda opasuješ svoje. 
[76:12] Delajte in opravljajte obljube Gospodu Bogu svojemu; katerikoli stojé okolo njega, prinesó naj mu dar strašnemu, 
[76:13] Kateri žanje napuh prvakov, strašán zemeljskim kraljem. 
[77:1] Načelniku godbe, naslednikov Idutunskih; psalm Asafov. 
[77:2] Glas moj gre do Boga, ko zavpijem; glas moj do Boga, da nagne uho k meni. 
[77:3] Ob času stiske svoje iščem Gospoda; roka moja je ponoči polita neprestano, duša moja se brani pripustiti tolažbo. 
[77:4] Spominjam se Boga, ko trepetam in stokam; premišljam, ko duh moj omaguje presilno. 
[77:5] Ko mi ne daš zatisniti očî, zbegan sem, tako da povedati ne morem. 
[77:6] Čase premišljujem starodavne, prejšnjih vekov leta. 
[77:7] Spominjam se godbe svoje ponočnje; v srci svojem premišljam, in duh moj preiskuje govoreč: 
[77:8] Ali bi vekomaj zametal Gospod; ali ne bode dalje dobrovoljen? 
[77:9] Ali bi vekomaj opešala milost njegova; konec bilo govora od roda do roda? 
[77:10] Ali bi bil pozabil Bog mogočni deliti milost; ali bi zapiral v jezi usmiljenje svoje? 
[77:11] Slednjič pravim: To me slabi, ko se je izpremenila Najvišjega desnica. 
[77:12] Spominjal so bodem dejanj Gospodovih; dà, spominjal se bodem od starodavnosti vseh čudežev tvojih. 
[77:13] In premišljal bodem vsakatero délo tvoje; o dejanjih tvojih bodem pripovedoval: 
[77:14] O Bog, v svetosti je steza tvoja, kdo je Bog mogočni kakor Bog? 
[77:15] Ti, o Bog mogočni, čudoviti, pokazal si moč svojo na narodih. 
[77:16] Rešil si z roko ljudstvo svoje, sinove Jakobove, tudi Jožefa. 
[77:17] Videle so te vode, Bog, videle so te vode in se tresle, dà, potresla so se brezna. 
[77:18] Izlili so oblaki vode, glas so zagnali gornji oblaki; priletele so tudi pušice tvoje. 
[77:19] Bobnel je grom tvoj v tistem krogu, razsvetljali so bliski vesoljni svet; potresla se je zemlja in trepetala. 
[77:20] Skozi morje pot tvoja, in steza tvoja skozi prostorne vode, kjer sledovi tvoji niso znani, 
[77:21] Vodil si kakor čedo ljudstvo svoje, po Mojzu in Aronu. 
[78:1] Pesem ukovita Asafova. Poslušaj, ljudstvo moje, nauk moj; nagnite uho svoje govoru mojih ust. 
[78:2] V priliki odprem usta svoja; od sebe dam skrivnosti časov nekdanjih, 
[78:3] Kar smo slišali in znali, ko so nam pravili pradedje naši. 
[78:4] Prikrivali ne bodemo njih otrokom, naslednjemu rodu, da oznanjajo hvalo Gospodovo in moč njegovo, in čudovita dela njegova, katera je storil. 
[78:5] Ker ustanovil je pričanje v Jakobu in postavil zakon v Izraelu, ko je zapovedal pradedom našim, oznanjati svojim otrokom. 
[78:6] Da vedó, naslednji rod, otroci prihodnji, in vstanejo ter oznanjajo otrokom svojim. 
[78:7] Upanje svoje naj stavijo v Boga, in ne pozabijo naj dejanj Boga mogočnega, temuč hranijo naj zapovedi njegove. 
[78:8] In ne bodejo naj kakor njih pradedje, rod trdovraten in uporen; rod, kateri ni popravil srca svojega, in katerega duh ni bil stanoviten proti Bogu mogočnemu, 
[78:9] Kakor nasledniki Efrajmovi, kateri oboroženi streljajo z lokom in hrbte obračajo ob času bitve. 
[78:10] Ohranili niso zaveze Božje, in branili so se hoditi po zakonu njegovem, 
[78:11] Pozabivši dejanj njegovih, in čudovitih del njegovih, katera jim je bil pokazal. 
[78:12] Pred pradedi njihovimi je delal čuda, v deželi Egiptovski, na polji Taniškem. 
[78:13] Razklal je bil morje, da jih je prepeljal čez, in postavil je vode, kakor kùp. 
[78:14] In spremljal jih je z oblakom podnevi, in vso noč sè svetlim ognjem. 
[78:15] Razklal je bil skale v puščavi, da bi pijačo pripravil v valovih preobilo. 
[78:16] Valove je izpeljal iz skale, in vode dol spuščal kakor reke. 
[78:17] Vendar so dalje grešili še zoper njega, in dražili Najvišjega v sami suhi deželi. 
[78:18] In izkušajoč Boga mogočnega v srci svojem, térjali so jedi po svojega srca želji. 
[78:19] In grdo govoreč zoper Boga, rekli so: "Ali bi mogel Bog mogočni napraviti mizo v tej puščavi? 
[78:20] Glej, tako je udaril skalo, da so tekle vode, in potoki so se udrli, ali bi mogel dati tudi živeža? ali bi pripravil mesa svojemu ljudstvu?" 
[78:21] Zato je Gospod slišal in se razjaril; in ogenj se je bil vnel zoper Jakoba, in jeza je tudi gorela zoper Izraela. 
[78:22] Ker niso verovali v Boga, in niso zaupali v blaginjo njegovo. 
[78:23] Dasi je bil zapovedal gornjim oblakom zgoraj in odprl vrata nebeška, 
[78:24] In dežil nad nje máno za jed in dajal žito nebeško; 
[78:25] Kruh najmočnejših je jedel vsak; popotnico jim je pošiljal do sitega. 
[78:26] Zagnal je sever na nebesih, in z močjo svojo pripeljal jug. 
[78:27] Ko je dežil nad nje meso kakor prah, in kakor morski pések tiče krilate; 
[78:28] Metal jih je med šatore, okolo prebivališč svojih. 
[78:29] In jedli so in bili so nasiteni močno, in česar so poželeli, prinesel jim je. 
[78:30] Še niso bili iznebili se poželenja svojega, še je bila jed njih v njihovih ustih; 
[78:31] Ko je jeza Božja goreča proti njim morila med najmočnejimi iz med njih in pokončavala mladeniče Izraelske. 
[78:32] Po vsem tem so še grešili in niso verovali zavoljo čudovitih dél njegovih. 
[78:33] Zatorej je pogubljal v ničemurnosti njih dní, in njih leta v strahu. 
[78:34] Ko jih je pobijal, ako so popraševali po njem in izpreobrnivši se zjutraj iskali Boga mogočnega, 
[78:35] Spomnivši se, da je bil Bog njih skala in Bog mogočni najvišji njih rešnik; 
[78:36] Če tudi so ga hoteli varati z usti svojimi, in so z jezikom svojim lagali se njemu, 
[78:37] In srce njihovo ni bilo obrneno proti njemu, in niso bili stanovitni v zavezi njegovi: 
[78:38] Vendar je on usmiljen opíral krivico, tako da jih ni pogubil; in odvračal je svoj srd obilo, in ní vnemal vse jeze svoje, 
[78:39] Spomnivši se, da so meso, veter, ki gre in se ne vrne. 
[78:40] Kolikokrat so ga razdražili v puščavi; žalili so ga v samoti! 
[78:41] Ki so hitro izkušali Boga mogočnega, in žalili Svetega Izraelovega. 
[78:42] Ne spomnivši se roke njegove, dné, ko jih je bil otél sovražnika. 
[78:43] Ko je v Egiptu delal znamenja svoja, in čuda svoja na polji Taniškem. 
[78:44] Ko je v kri izpremenil njih potoke, in reke njih, da bi ne mogli piti. 
[78:45] Izpustil je nad njé živali krdelo, da bi jih pokončalo, in žabe, da jih uničijo. 
[78:46] In dal je njih sad murnu in kobilici njih delo. 
[78:47] Pobil je s točo njih trte in smokve njih z ognjem, ki je pokončal vse, kamor je prišel. 
[78:48] Dal je tudi isti toči njih živali, in njih čede žarjavici ognjeni. 
[78:49] Izpustil je nad nje jeze svoje žar, srd in nevoljo in stisko, pošiljajoč oznanovalce nesreče. 
[78:50] Pretehtal je k jezi svoji pot, smrti ni ubranil njih življenja; in živali njih izročil je kugi. 
[78:51] In udaril je vse prvorojeno v Egiptu; prvino moči v šatorih Kamovih. 
[78:52] In prepeljal je kakor ovce ljudstvo svoje, in vodil jih je kakor čede po puščavi. 
[78:53] In peljal jih je varno tako, da se niso bali, potem ko je bilo morje pokrilo njih sovražnike. 
[78:54] Pripeljal jih je do meje svetosti svoje, gore té, katero je pridobila desnica njegova. 
[78:55] Izgnal je izpred njih obličja narode in storil, da so pripali vrvi posesti in prebivali so v njih šatorih Izraelovi rodovi. 
[78:56] Vendar so izkušali in razdražili Boga najvišjega, in pričanj njegovih niso se držali. 
[78:57] Temuč obrnili so se ter ravnali izdajalsko, kakor njih pradedje; obrnili so se kakor lok goljufen, 
[78:58] Ker dražili so ga z višinami svojimi in svojimi maliki, do ljubosumnosti so ga razvneli. 
[78:59] Slišal je Bog in se razsrdil, in zavrgel je silno Izraela. 
[78:60] Tako, da je zapustivši prebivališče v Silu, šator, katerega je bil postavil med ljudmi, 
[78:61] Dal v sužnjost svojo moč, in slavo svojo sovražniku v pest. 
[78:62] In izročil je meču ljudstvo svoje, ker se je bil razsrdil zoper posestvo svoje. 
[78:63] Ogenj je pokončal mladeniče njegove, in device njegove niso se hvalile. 
[78:64] Duhovniki njegovi padli so pod mečem, in vdove njegove niso jokale. 
[78:65] Potem se je zbudil Gospod, kakor da bi bil spal, kakor korenjak, pojoč po vinu. 
[78:66] In udaril je sovražnike svoje nazaj; sramoto večno jim je naložil. 
[78:67] Slednjič je zavrgel šator Jožefov in rodú Efrajmovega ni izvolil. 
[78:68] Izvolil pa je rod Judov, goro Sijonsko, da bi jo ljubil. 
[78:69] Zidal je enako najvišjim gradovom svetišče svoje, namreč v deželi, katero je utrdil. 
[78:70] In izvolil je Davida hlapca svojega, in vzel ga iz ograje čede, 
[78:71] Peljal ga je od doječih, da bi pasel Jakoba, ljudstvo svoje in Izraela, posestvo svoje, 
[78:72] Kateri jih je pasel po poštenosti srca svojega, in vodil jih je z najvišjo razumnostjo svojih rok. 
[79:1] Psalm Asafu. O Bog, prišli so narodi v posestvo tvoje, oskrunili so hram svetosti tvoje, v groblje izpremenili so Jeruzalem. 
[79:2] Dali so hlapcev tvojih truplo za hrano tičem nebeškim; meso njih, katerim si milosten, zemeljskim zverém. 
[79:3] Prelivali so kri njihovo kakor vodo okrog Jeruzalema, in ni ga bilo, da bi pokopaval. 
[79:4] V zasramovanje smo sosedom našim, v zasmehovanje in norčevanje njim, kateri so okolo nas. 
[79:5] Doklej, Gospod? bodeš-li jezil se večno? bode li gorela kakor ogenj gorečnost tvoja? 
[79:6] Izlij srd svoj nad one narode, kateri te ne spoznavajo, in nad kraljestva, katera ne kličejo tvojega imena. 
[79:7] Ker pojedli so Jakoba, in razdejali so prebivališče njegovo. 
[79:8] Ne spomínjaj se zoper nas krivic preteklih časov, hiti naj in prehití nas usmiljenje tvoje, ker obožali smo silno. 
[79:9] Pomagaj nam, Bog, blaginje naše, zavoljo česti svojega imena, in reši nas ter prizanesi nam grehe naše zavoljo svojega imena. 
[79:10] Zakaj naj bi govorili oni narodi: "Kje je njih Bog?" Znano bodi med onimi narodi pred našimi očmi maščevanje krvi prelite hlapcev tvojih. 
[79:11] Pred obličje tvoje naj pride zdihovanje jetnika, po velikosti roke svoje stóri, da ostanejo, kateri se že izročajo smrti. 
[79:12] Povrni torej sosedom našim sedemkrat v njih naročje sramoto njih, katero so ti delali, Gospod. 
[79:13] In mi ljudstvo tvoje, in čeda paše tvoje, bodemo slavili te večno; od roda do roda bodemo oznanjali hvalo tvojo. 
[80:1] Načelniku godbe na šestero strun: psalm pričanja Asafu. 
[80:2] O pastir Izraelov, poslušaj, ki vodiš Jožefa kakor čedo, sedeč na Kerubih prisvéti! 
[80:3] Pred Efrajmom, Benjaminom in Manasom zbudi moč svojo in pridi in prinesi nam polno blaginjo svojo. 
[80:4] Bog, pomagaj nam zopet na noge; daj, da sveti obličje tvoje, in rešeni bomo. 
[80:5] Gospod, Bog vojnih krdél, doklej bodeš kadil proti molitvi svojega ljudstva? 
[80:6] Paseš jih sè solznim kruhom, in piti jim daješ sólz obilo mero. 
[80:7] Prepuščaš nas v prepir sosedom našim, in sovražniki naši zasmehujejo nas. 
[80:8] O Bog vojnih krdel, pomagaj nam zopet na noge, in daj, da sveti obličje tvoje, rešeni bomo. 
[80:9] Trto si bil prestavil iz Egipta, pregnal si bil ljudstva, da bi jo zasadil. 
[80:10] Pospravil si bil pred njo, in storil si, da je poganjala korenine svoje, in napolnila je bila deželo. 
[80:11] Gore so se pokrivale sè senco njeno, in mladik njenih cedre največje. 
[80:12] Stezala je veje svoje noter do morja, in do reke mladike svoje. 
[80:13] Zakaj si podrl ograje njene, tako da jo obirajo vsi popotniki? 
[80:14] Izpodriva jo gozdna svinja, in žival poljska jo objeda. 
[80:15] O Bog vojnih krdél, povrni se skoraj, ozri se z nebes ter glej, in obišči to trto, 
[80:16] In mladiko, katero je bila vsadila desnica tvoja, in to zavoljo sina, katerega si potrdil sebi. 
[80:17] Posmojena je z ognjem, odrezana; od hudovanja obličja tvojega ginejo. 
[80:18] Roka tvoja bodi nad možem desnice tvoje, sinom človeškim, katerega si potrdil sebi. 
[80:19] In umaknili se ne bodemo od tebe; v življenji nas ohrani, da kličemo ime tvoje. 
[80:20] Gospod Bog vojnih krdél, pomagaj nam na noge; daj, da sveti obličje tvoje, in rešeni bomo. 
[81:1] Načelniku godbe pri Gitaji, pesem Asafu. 
[81:2] Pojte Bogu, móči naši, vpijte Bogu Jakobovemu. 
[81:3] Primite psalmovanje in vzemite boben, strune prijetne in brenklje. 
[81:4] Trobite o mlaji, o vseh stalnih praznikih, o godovih naših. 
[81:5] Ker ustanovljeno je v Izraelu, postava od Boga Jakobovega, 
[81:6] Kateri jo je za pričanje postavil v Jožefu, ko je šel proti deželi Egiptovski, kjer sem slišal govor neznan; 
[81:7] "Odtegnil sem", pravi, od bremena ramo njegovo; roke njegove ločile so se od čebriča. 
[81:8] Ko si vpil v oni stiski, rešil sem te, uslišal sem te v gromovem zakotji; izkušal sem te do vodâ Meribskih. 
[81:9] Poslušaj, ljudstvo moje, in spričeval ti bodem, o Izrael, ako me bodeš poslušal. 
[81:10] Ako ne bode v tebi boga mogočnega tujega, in se ne bodeš klanjal bogu mogočnemu tujerodnemu. 
[81:11] Jaz sem Gospod, Bog tvoj, ki sem dal, da si prišel gor iz dežele Egiptovske; razširi usta svoja in napolnim jih. 
[81:12] Ali ljudstvo moje ni poslušalo glasu mojega, in Izrael mi ni bil pokoren. 
[81:13] Zatorej sem jih izpustil, da naj hodijo po srca svojega volji, govoreč: Gredó naj sè svojimi krivimi naklepi. 
[81:14] O ko bi me bilo poslušalo ljudstvo moje, ko bi bili Izraelci hodili po mojih potih! 
[81:15] Kar mahoma bi bil potlačil njih neprijatelje, ko bi bil v njih sovražnike obrnil roko svojo. 
[81:16] Sovražniki Gospodovi bi se bili lažnjivo vdali njemu, in njih čas bi bil vekomaj. 
[81:17] Dà, živil bi ga bil z maščobo pšenično, tudi z medom iz skale bi te bil sitil. 
[82:1] Psalm Asafu. Bog biva v zboru Boga mogočnega, med oblastvi sodi. 
[82:2] Doklej bodete sodili krivično, in potezali se za hudobne? 
[82:3] Sodite za ubozega in siroto; nesrečnega in siromaka opravičite. 
[82:4] Oprostite ubozega in potrebnega, iz roke krivičnih rešite. 
[82:5] Ne vedó in ne pazijo, v temi hodijo neprestano; majó se vsi strebri zemlje. 
[82:6] Jaz pravim: "Bogovi ste, in najvišjega sinovi vi vsi: 
[82:7] Todà, umrli bodete kakor navaden človek; tudi kakor kateri iz med ónih poglavarjev bodete padli." 
[82:8] Vstani, o Bog, sodi zemljo; ti namreč imaš posest med vsemi narodi. 
[83:1] Pesem in psalm Asafu. 
[83:2] O Bog, ne molči, ne delaj se gluhega, in ne mirúj, o Bog mogočni! 
[83:3] Ker glej, neprijatelji tvoji ropotajo, in sovražniki tvoji dvigujejo glavo. 
[83:4] Zoper ljudstvo tvoje prekanjeno delajo naklep; in posvetujejo se zoper skrite tvoje. 
[83:5] Rekoč: Dejte, potrebimo jih, da ne bodejo narod, da se ne bode več imenovalo ime Izraelovo. 
[83:6] Ker naklep so storili z enakimi srci; zoper tebe so sklenili zavezo. 
[83:7] Šatori Idumejcev in Izmaeličanov, Moabljani in Agarenci; 
[83:8] Gebaljani in Amonjani in Amalečani; Palestinjani s Tira prebivalci. 
[83:9] Tudi Asirijan se jim je pridružil; roka so sinovom Lotovim. 
[83:10] Stóri jim kakor Madijanom, kakor Sisaru, kakor Jabinu ob potoku Kisonu, 
[83:11] Ki so bili pokončani pri Endoru; postali so zemlje gnoj. 
[83:12] Naredi njih plemenitnike same kakor Oreba, in kakor Zeba; kakor Zebaha in Salmuna vse njih poglavarje, 
[83:13] Kateri pravijo: Pridobimo prebivališča Božja. 
[83:14] Bog moj, naredi jih kakor kolo, kakor pleve pred vetrom. 
[83:15] Kakor ogenj požiga gozd, in kakor plamen vnema gore, 
[83:16] Tako jih pódi z viharjem svojim; in z vrtincem svojim jih preplaši. 
[83:17] Sè sramoto napolni njih obličje; da se bode iskalo ime tvoje, o Gospod. 
[83:18] Rudečica naj jih oblije, in zbegajo naj se večno; sramujejo se naj in poginejo; 
[83:19] Da se spozná, da si ti, kateremu edinemu je ime Gospod, vzvišen nad vesoljno zemljo. 
[84:1] Načelniku godbe pri Giteji, sinovom Koretovim psalm. 
[84:2] Kako ljuba so prebivališča tvoja, o Gospod vojnih krdél! 
[84:3] Duša moja hrepeni in koprni, priti v veže Gospodove; srce moje in meso moje vpijeta v hrepenenji po živem Bogu mogočnem. 
[84:4] Celo vrabec najde dom in lastovka si gnezdo, da v njem izvali mladiče svoje – o oltarji tvoji, o Gospod vojnih krdél, kralj moj in Bog moj! 
[84:5] Blagor jim, ki so prebivali v hiši tvoji, ki te zdaj še hvalijo! 
[84:6] Blagor človeku, kateremu je dano v tebi stopati na steze tvoje po srca svojega želji. 
[84:7] Kateri gredé po murbini dolini, imajo njega za studenec, katere tudi pokriva dež blagoslova, 
[84:8] Kateri hodijo od zbora do zbora, ki se prikaže pred Bogom na Sijonu. 
[84:9] Gospod, Bog vojnih krdél, čuj molitev mojo; poslušaj, o Bog Jakobov! 
[84:10] Ščit naš, poglej, o Bog; in glej maziljenca svojega obličje! 
[84:11] Ker boljši en dan v vežah tvojih, nego tisoč drugjé; raji hočem stopati čez prag v hiši Boga mojega, nego prebivati v krivice šatorih. 
[84:12] Ker solnce in ščit je Gospod, Bog; milost in slavo daje Gospod; dobrega ne krati njim, ki hodijo v poštenosti. 
[84:13] O Gospod vojnih krdél, blagor človeku, kateri ima zaupanje v tebe! 
[85:1] Načelniku godbe med sinovi Koretovimi, psalm. 
[85:2] Blagovoljen si bil, Gospod, deželi svoji; nazaj si bil pripeljal sužnje krdelo Jakobovo. 
[85:3] Odpustil si bil krivico ljudstvu svojemu, pokril si bil ves njih greh. 
[85:4] Potolažil si bil ves srd svoj, odvrnil, da ni kipela, jezo svojo. 
[85:5] Postavi nas v prejšnji stan, o Bog blaginje naše; in potolaži nevoljo svojo proti nam. 
[85:6] Ali se bodeš večno jezil nad nami? raztezal jezo svoje od roda do roda? 
[85:7] Ali ne bodeš vrnivši se nazaj nas postavil v življenje, da se ljudstvo tvoje raduje v tebi? 
[85:8] Pokaži nam, Gospod, milost svojo; in daj nam blaginjo svojo. 
[85:9] Poslušal bodem, kaj govori, Bog ón mogočni Gospod, ker mir govori proti ljudstvu svojemu, in proti njim, katerim je milosten; ali k nespameti naj se ne povrnejo. 
[85:10] Res, blizu je njim, ki se njega bojé, blaginja njegova; slava bode prebivala v deželi naši. 
[85:11] Milost in zvestoba se srečati; pravica in mir se poljubita. 
[85:12] Zvestoba požene iz zemlje, in pravica pogleda z nebés. 
[85:13] Tudi Bog bode dal, kar je dobro, da zemlja naša obrodi svoj sad. 
[85:14] Storil bode, da pojde pravica pred njim, ko postavi noge svoje na pot. 
[86:1] Molitev Davidova: Nagni, Gospod, uho svoje; usliši me, ker siromak sem in ubožen. 
[86:2] Reši dušo mojo, ker tisti sem, kateremu deliš milost; reši hlapca svojega, ti Bog moj, ko imam zaupanje v tebe. 
[86:3] Milost mi izkaži, Gospod; ker kličem te ves dan. 
[86:4] Razveseli dušo svojega hlapca; ker do tebe, Gospod, povzdigujem dušo svojo. 
[86:5] Ti namreč, Gospod, si dober in prizanašaš, in obilen v milosti vsem, ki te kličejo. 
[86:6] Čuj molitev mojo, Gospod; in poslušaj prošenj mojih glas. 
[86:7] O času stiske svoje te kličem, ker uslišuješ me. 
[86:8] Ni ti enakega med vsemi bogovi, o Gospod; in dél ni tvojim enakih. 
[86:9] Vsi narodi, katerim jih deliš, prihajajočim, klanjajo se pred teboj, in čast dajó tvojemu imenu. 
[86:10] Ker velik si in čudovit, ti sam si Bog. 
[86:11] Uči me, Gospod, pot svoj; hodim naj dalje v resnici tvoji; zberi srce moje, da se boji tvojega imena. 
[86:12] Slavil te bodem, Gospod Bog moj, iz vsega svojega srca; in čestil bodem imé tvoje vekomaj. 
[86:13] Ker velika je milost tvoja do mene, in rešil si dušo mojo iz spodnjega groba. 
[86:14] O Bog, prevzetniki se spenjajo zoper mene, in silovitnikov krdela iščejo življenja mojega, ker te nimajo pred očmi. 
[86:15] Ti pa, Gospod, Bog mogočni, usmiljen si in milosten; potrpežljiv in obilen v milosti in zvestobi. 
[86:16] Ozri se v mé, in milost mi stórí; daj moč svojo hlapcu svojemu, in reši dekle svoje sina. 
[86:17] Stóri znamenje nad menoj v dóbro; da naj vidijo sovražniki moji in se sè sramoto oblijó, ko mi bodeš ti, Gospod, pomagal, in potolažil me. 
[87:1] Sinom Koretovim psalm in pesem. Ustanovo svojo med svetosti gorami, 
[87:2] Vrata Sijonska ljubi Gospod nad vsa prebivališča Jakobova. 
[87:3] Prečastno je karkoli se slaví o tebi, o mesto Božje! 
[87:4] Imenujem Egipčana in Babilonca med njimi, ki me poznajo; glej, Palestinca, in Tirca z Etijopjanom, da je ta rojen ravno tam; 
[87:5] Zato se bode govorilo o Sijonu: Ta in ón mož jé rojen v njem; in on sam bode ga utrdil, Najvišji. 
[87:6] Gospod bode prišteval popisujoč ljudstva: ta je rojen ravno tam odlično. 
[87:7] Zatorej pojó enako in se radujejo vsi studenci življenja mojega v tebi. 
[88:1] Pesem in psalm med sinovi Koretovimi, načelniku godbe, da se poje na piščali, ukovit Emana Ezrajičana. 
[88:2] O Gospod, Bog blaginje moje, podnevi kličem in ponoči v pričo tebe. 
[88:3] Pred obličje tvoje pridi molitev moja, nagni uho svoje mojemu vpitju. 
[88:4] Ker nasitena je z nadlogami duša moja, in življenje moje se bliža grobu. 
[88:5] Prištevam se njim, ki gredó v grob; podoben sem možu, katerega zapušča krepost. 
[88:6] Prištevam se mrtvim, odločen; kakor prebodeni ležeči v grobu, katerih se ne spominjaš več, kateri so uničeni s tvojo roko. 
[88:7] Pokladaš me v grob, izmed vseh najglobočji, v najtamnejših, v krajih globokih. 
[88:8] Nad menoj leži jeza tvoja, dà, z vsemi valovi svojimi, ki me napadajo, pobijaš me presilno. 
[88:9] V stran od mene odvračaš znance moje, daješ me njim v najhujšo gnjusobo; tako zajetega, da pobegniti ne morem. 
[88:10] Oko moje žaluje od bridkosti; kličem te, Gospod, ves dan; k tebi razpenjam roke svoje. 
[88:11] Bodeš-li mrtvim delal dejanje čudovito? ali bodejo mrtvi vstali, da bi te slavili mogočno? 
[88:12] Ali bi naj se v grobu oznanjala milost tvoja, zvestoba tvoja v pogubi? 
[88:13] Ali naj bi se v temini spoznalo čudovito dejanje tvoje, in pravica tvoja v pozabljivosti deželi? 
[88:14] In vendar jaz vpijem, Gospod, k tebi, in vsako jutro te prehiteva molitev moja. 
[88:15] Zakaj me zametaš, o Gospod; skrivaš mi obličje svoje? 
[88:16] Ubožen sem in umrjoč od potresa, strahove tvoje prenašam in sem zbegan, 
[88:17] Jeze tvoje gredó čez mé, plašenje tvoje me uničuje. 
[88:18] Obdajajo me kakor vode ves dan; obsezajo me vkup. 
[88:19] Od mene v stran odvračaš prijatelja in tovariša; znancem svojim sem v tamnem kraji. 
[89:1] Ukovita pesem Etana Ezrajičana. 
[89:2] Milosti Gospodove bodem prepeval vekomaj; od roda do roda bodem oznanjal z usti svojimi zvestobo tvojo. 
[89:3] Ker preverjen sem, da se bode vekomaj slavila milost tvoja; v samih nebesih bodeš utrdil zvestobo svojo, s katero si rekel: 
[89:4] Sklenil sem zavezo z izvoljenim svojim, prisegel sem Davidu, svojemu hlapcu. 
[89:5] Da bodem na vekomaj utrdil seme tvoje in stavil prestol tvoj od roda do roda. 
[89:6] Zatorej slavé nebesa čudovito delo tvoje, Gospod; in zvestobo tvojo v zboru svetnikov. 
[89:7] Kdo namreč naj se enako čisla v gornjem oblaku Gospodu; primerja se Gospodu med sinovi mogočnih? 
[89:8] Bog mogočni je strašán v zboru svetnikov, in čestit nad vse, kar ga obdaja. 
[89:9] O Gospod, Bog vojnih krdél, kdo je tebi enako mogočen, Gospod? Ker zvestoba tvoja te ogrinja! 
[89:10] Ti gospoduješ nad morja ponosom; ko se spenjajo valovi njegovi, ti jih krotiš. 
[89:11] Ti si zdrobil, kakor prebodenega, Egipčana; z roko svoje moči si razkropil sovražnike svoje. 
[89:12] Tvoja so nebesa in tvoja zemlja; vesoljni svet in česar je poln ustanovil si tí. 
[89:13] Sever in jug, katera si ti ustvaril, Tabor in Hermon prepevajo o imenu tvojem. 
[89:14] Ti imaš roko z močjo; krepka je tvoja roka, vzvišena desnica tvoja. 
[89:15] Pravica in sodba sta za prebivališče tvojemu prestolu; milost in zvestoba hodita pred tvojim obličjem. 
[89:16] Blagor ljudstvu, katero pozna trombe glas, hodi v svetlobi obličja tvojega, Gospod! 
[89:17] V imenu tvojem radujejo se ves dan, in dvigujejo se v pravici tvoji. 
[89:18] Ker slava si njih móči, in po blagovoljnosti tvoji dviguje se naš rog. 
[89:19] Gospod namreč je naš ščit in svetnika Izraelovega, našega kralja. 
[89:20] Tedaj si v prikazni nagovoril njega, kateremu milost deliš, ter mu rekel: "Pomoč sem napravil zoper močnega, povzdignil izvoljenega iz ljudstva. 
[89:21] Našel sem Davida, svojega hlapca; pomazilil sem ga sè svetim oljem svojim. 
[89:22] Z njim bodi stanovitna roka moja, in dlan moja naj ga krepča. 
[89:23] Ne bode ga stiskal sovražnik, in krivici udani ga ne ne bode žalil. 
[89:24] Temuč starem izpred njegovega obličja neprijatelje njegove, in sovražnike udarim. 
[89:25] Tako mu bode pomagala zvestoba moja in milost moja, da se bode v mojem imenu povzdignil rog njegov. 
[89:26] Ker nad morje položim roko njegovo, in nad reke njegovo desnico. 
[89:27] On me bode klical: Ti oče moj; Bog moj mogočni in skala blaginje moje! 
[89:28] In jaz ga postavim za prvorojenca, povišanega nad zemeljske kralje. 
[89:29] Vekomaj mu ohranim milost svojo, in zaveza moja mu bode zvesta. 
[89:30] In vekomaj postavim seme njegovo in prestol njegov kakor so dnevi nebeški. 
[89:31] Ako zapusté sinovi njegovi zakon moj, ne bodo hodili v sodbah mojih, 
[89:32] Ako oskrunijo postave moje, in se ne držé zapovedi mojih: 
[89:33] Obiskal bodem sè šibo njih pregreho; z udarci njih krivico. 
[89:34] Milosti pa svoje mu ne odtegnem, in lagal ne bodem zoper zvestobo svojo. 
[89:35] Oskrunil ne bodem zaveze svoje, ne izpremenil ust svojih besede. 
[89:36] Enkrat sem prisegel pri svetosti svoji, Davidu ne bodem lagal: 
[89:37] Da bode večno seme njegovo, in prestol njegov kakor solnce pred mano. 
[89:38] Kakor luna bode stanoviten vekomaj, in kakor priče zveste na gornjem oblaku." 
[89:39] Ti pa si zavrgel in zaničeval; razsrdil si se proti maziljencu svojemu. 
[89:40] Zaničeval si hlapca svojega zavezo, oskrunil in vrgel na tla venčanje njegovo. 
[89:41] Podrl si vse ograje njegove; trdnjave njegove si izpostavil razdrobljenju. 
[89:42] Plenili so ga vsi popotniki, v zasramovanje je sosedom svojim. 
[89:43] Povzdignil si sovražnikov njegovih desnico, razveselil vse neprijatelje njegove. 
[89:44] Skrhal si tudi meča njegovega ostrino, in utrdil ga nisi v vojski. 
[89:45] Storil si, da mine bleščoba njegova, in prestol njegov si pahnil na tla. 
[89:46] Okrajšal si dnî mladosti njegove; pokril si ga sè sramoto. 
[89:47] Doklej, Gospod? bodeš li se skrival vekomaj? gorela bode kakor ogenj jeza tvoja? 
[89:48] Spomni se mene, kako sem kratkih dni, kaj bi bil zastonj ustvaril vse otroke človeške? 
[89:49] Kateri mož bi živel tako, da ne izkusi smrti, reši se sam groba? 
[89:50] Kje so milosti one nekdanje, Gospod, katere si bil prisegel Davidu po zvestobi svoji? 
[89:51] Spomni se, Gospod, sramote hlapcev svojih, da nosim v naročji svojem zasramovanje vseh ljudstev največjih, 
[89:52] S katerim so sramotili sovražniki tvoji, Gospod, s katerim so sramotili maziljenca tvojega stopinje. 
[89:53] Slava Gospodu vekomaj, zgódi se, še enkrat, zgódi se! 
[90:1] Molitev Mojzesova, moža Božjega: O Gospod, ti si nam bil prebivališče od roda do roda, 
[90:2] Ko niso bile še rojene gore, in nisi bil naredil zemlje in vesoljnega sveta, dà od vekomaj do vekomaj Bog si tí mogočni. 
[90:3] Pripraviš človeka tako daleč, da je potrt, govoreč: "Povrnite se, sinovi človeški!" 
[90:4] Ker če tisoč lét preide, v tvojih očéh so, kakor včerajšnji dan, in straža nočna. 
[90:5] S povodnjo jih pokončaš, spanje so, zjutraj so kakor seno, ki mine. 
[90:6] Zjutraj, ko se je razcvelo, mine; pokosi in posuši se zvečer. 
[90:7] Ker ginemo od jeze tvoje, in srd tvoj nas plaši: 
[90:8] Pred oči si staviš krivice naše, skrivnosti naše v luč svojega obličja. 
[90:9] Ker vsi dnevi naši ginejo v srdu tvojem; leta naša nam tekó misli enaka. 
[90:10] V samih dnevih lét naših je sedemdeset let; ali (ako smo prav krepki) osemdeset let; celo kar je v njih najboljše, polno je truda in težav; ko to hitro mine, odletimo. 
[90:11] Kdo spozna jeze tvoje moč, ali srdú tvojega po strahu tvojem? 
[90:12] Šteti nas úči naše dni tako, da dobimo srce modro. 
[90:13] Vrni se, Gospod! Doklej! in kesaj se zavoljo hlapcev svojih. 
[90:14] Nasiti nas vsako jutro z milostjo svojo, da pojemo in se radujemo vse svoje dni. 
[90:15] Razveséli nas, kakor si nas ponižaval mnogo dnî; mnogo let smo izkušali húdo. 
[90:16] Očitno bodi hlapcem tvojim delo tvoje, in lepota tvoja med njih sinovi. 
[90:17] Na strani nam bodi prijetnost Gospoda, Boga našega, in delo naših rok podpiraj v nas; sámo delo, pravim, naših rok podpiraj. 
[91:1] Zaupajoč v zavetji Najvišjega, v senci Vsemogočnega neprestano prenočujoč 
[91:2] Pravim: V Gospodu je pribežališče moje in grad moj; Bog moj je, kateremu zaupam. 
[91:3] Ker on te bode rešil iz zanke tičarjeve, iz kuge pogubne. 
[91:4] S perotjo svojo te bode branil, ko bodeš pribežal pod peroti njegove; ščit in bran je zvestoba njegova. 
[91:5] Ne boj se nočnega strahú, pušice, ki leta podnevi; 
[91:6] Pogube, ki lazi v temi, ne kuge, ki razsaja o poludné. 
[91:7] Pade jih na eni strani tvoji tisoč, in desetkrat tisoč na desni tvoji, k tebi ne pride. 
[91:8] Samo z očmi Svojimi bodeš pogledal in videl bodeš grešnikov povračilo. 
[91:9] Ko bodeš ti Gospoda, Boga pribežališča mojega, Najvišjega postavil za prebivališče svoje, 
[91:10] Ne bode priložnosti, da te zadene húdo, in šiba se ne približa tvojemu šatoru. 
[91:11] Ker angelom svojim bode zapovedal zate, da te hranijo po vseh potih tvojih; 
[91:12] Držé te z obema rokama, da ne zadeneš z nogo svojo ob kamen. 
[91:13] Po divjem levu bodeš hodil in po kači, teptal bodeš leva mladiča in zmaja. 
[91:14] "Ker je proti meni nagnen v ljubezni (pravi Bog), zato ga bodem otél; na višavo ga bodem postavil, ker pozna, ime moje. 
[91:15] Kakor hitro me zakliče, uslišim ga; na strani mu bodem v stiski; otel ga bodem in počastil. 
[91:16] Nasitil ga bodem z dolgostjo lét, storil bodem, da uživa blaginjo mojo." 
[92:1] Psalm in pesem, v sobote dan. 
[92:2] Dobro je slaviti Gospoda, in prepevati tvojemu imenu, o Najvišji! 
[92:3] Oznanjati vsako jutro milost tvojo, in zvestobo tvojo vsako noč; 
[92:4] Na desetostrunje in na brenklje, na strune s premišljevanjem. 
[92:5] Ker razveseljuješ me, Gospod, z delom svojim; prepeval bodem o dejanjih tvojih rôk. 
[92:6] Kako velika so dela tvoja, Gospod; silno globoke so misli tvoje! 
[92:7] Mož neumen ne spozna, in nespameten ne zapazi tega, 
[92:8] Ko poganjajo krivični kakor trava in cvetó vsi, ki delajo krivico, zgodi se, da se pogubé vekomaj. 
[92:9] Ti pa, o Najvišji, si vekomaj. 
[92:10] Ker glej, sovražniki tvoji, Gospod, ker glej, sovražniki tvoji ginejo; razkropé se vsi, ki delajo krivico. 
[92:11] Rog moj pa zvišuješ kakor samorogov, oblivajoč me z oljem prisnim. 
[92:12] To gleda oko moje na zalezovalcih mojih, ušesa moja poslušajo o njih, ki se spenjajo v mé. 
[92:13] Kakor palma bode zelenel pravični, kakor cedra na Libanu bode rasel. 
[92:14] Vsajeni v hiši Gospodovi, v vežah Boga našega bodo poganjali mladike. 
[92:15] V obilosti bodejo živeli še v sivosti, debeli bodejo in zeleneči; 
[92:16] In oznanjali, da je pravičen Gospod, skala moja, in da ni nobene krivice v njem. 
[93:1] Gospod kraljuje z veličastvom oblečen, Gospod oblečen, z močjo se opasuje; utrjuje se vesoljni svet, da ne omahne. 
[93:2] Stanoviten je prestol tvoj, od onega časa, od vekomaj ti kraljuješ. 
[93:3] Naj dvigujejo reke, o Gospod, dvigujejo naj reke šum svoj; dvigujejo naj reke bobnenje svoje: 
[93:4] V šumu mnogih vodâ, ko se valé veličastni valovi morjá, veličastneji je Gospod v višavi. 
[93:5] Pričanja tvoja so trdna jako; v hiši tvoji je lepa svetost, o Gospod, na dnî dolžavo. 
[94:1] 0 mogočni Bog maščevanj, Gospod, o mogočni Bog maščevanj, prisvéti! 
[94:2] Dvigni se, o zemlje sodnik; daj povračilo prevzetnim. 
[94:3] Doklej prevzetni, Gospod, doklej se bodejo radovali prevzetni? 
[94:4] Ustili se in govorili prevzetno, ponašali se vsi, ki delajo krivico? 
[94:5] Zatirali ljudstvo tvoje, Gospod, in ponižávali tvoje posestvo? 
[94:6] Morili vdovo in tujca, in ubijali sirote? 
[94:7] Govoreč: Ne vidi Gospod, in ne zapazi Bog Jakobov. 
[94:8] Čujte, o najneumnejši v ljudstvu, in najnespametnejši, kdaj bodete razumni? 
[94:9] Ali on, ki je vsadil uho, ali bi on ne slišal? ali on, ki je naredil oko, ali bi ne videl? 
[94:10] Ali on, ki pokori narode, ali bi ne grajal; ki uči ljudî modrosti, ali bi ne spoznal? 
[94:11] Gospod pozna misli človeške, da so zgolj ničemurnost. 
[94:12] Blagor možu, katerega pokoriš, Gospod; in katerega učiš po zakonu svojem. 
[94:13] Da mu pripraviš pokoj od dnî nadloge, ko se koplje krivičnemu jama. 
[94:14] Ker Gospod ne zavrže ljudstva svojega, in posestva svojega ne zapusti. 
[94:15] Temuč noter do pravice se povrne sodba, in za njo vsi, ki so pravega srca. 
[94:16] Kdo bi bil vstal záme zoper hudodelnike? kdo bi se bil postavil zame zoper one, ki delajo krivico? 
[94:17] Ko bi mi ne bil Gospod, polna pomoč, malo da bi ne bilo življenje moje prebivalo v kraji molčanja. 
[94:18] Ko pravim: Omahuje noga moja, milost tvoja, o Gospod, me podpira. 
[94:19] Ko so mnoge misli moje pri meni, tolažbe tvoje razveseljujejo dušo mojo. 
[94:20] Ali bi se družil s teboj prestol nadlog, njega, ki me nadleguje zoper postavo? 
[94:21] Njih, ki se četoma zbirajo proti pravičnega duši, in obsojajo kri nedolžnih? 
[94:22] Dà, Gospod mi je za grad, in Bog moj za skalo mojega pribežališča, 
[94:23] On obrača proti njim njih krivico, in njih hudobnost jih pokončuje, pokončuje jih Gospod, naš Bog. 
[95:1] Dejte, prepevajmo Gospodu, ukajmo skali blaginje naše! 
[95:2] Pojdimo pred obličje njegovo sè zahvaljevanjem, s psalmi mu ukajmo. 
[95:3] Ker Bog mogočni velik je Gospod, in velik kralj nad vse bogove. 
[95:4] V roki njegovi so najglobočji sledovi zemlje, v njegovi oblasti so gorâ moči. 
[95:5] Njegovo je sámo morje, ker on ga je naredil, in súha zemlja, katero so ustvarile roke njegove. 
[95:6] Pridite, priklonimo se in padimo na tla; pripognimo kolena pred Gospodom, kateri nas je naredil. 
[95:7] Ker on je Bog naš, mi pa ljudstvo paše njegove, in čeda vodbe njegove; danes če slišite glas njegov, 
[95:8] "Ne okamenite srca svojega, kakor v prepiru, kakor o dnevi izkušnjave v puščavi. 
[95:9] Ko so me izkušali očetje vaši: izkusili so me in spoznali delo moje. 
[95:10] Štirideset let sem imel preglavico s tistim rodom govoreč: Ljudstvo so srca tavajočega, in potov mojih ne poznajo. 
[95:11] Njim sem prisegel v jezi svoji, da ne vnidejo v pókoj moj." 
[96:1] Pójte Gospodu novo pesem, po vsej zemlji pojte Gospodu. 
[96:2] Pojte Gospodu, blagoslavljajte ime njegovo, od dné do dné slavite blaginjo njegovo. 
[96:3] Oznanjujte med narodi čast njegovo, med vsemi ljudstvi čudovita dela njegova. 
[96:4] Velik je Gospod in hvaljen silno, čestit nad vse bogove. 
[96:5] Ker vsi bogovi ljudstev so maliki, Gospod pa je naredil nebesa. 
[96:6] Slava in lepota sta pred njim, moč in veličastvo v svetišči njegovem. 
[96:7] Dajajte Gospodu, ljudstev rodovine, dajajte čast in hvalo Gospodu. 
[96:8] Dajajte Gospodu slavo njegovemu imenu; prinesite dar, in pridite k vežam njegovim. 
[96:9] Uklanjajte se Gospodu v diki svetosti; vsa zemlja trepetaj pred obličjem njegovim. 
[96:10] Govorile med narodi: Gospod kraljuje, utrdil se bode tudi vesoljni svet, da ne omahne; sodil bode ljudstva pravično. 
[96:11] Veselila se bodo nebesa, in zemlja se bode radovala: šumelo bode morje, in kar je v njem. 
[96:12] Radovalo se bode polje in kar je na njem; tedaj bode prepevalo vse drevje v gozdu; 
[96:13] Pred obličjem Gospodovim, ko bode prišel; ker sodit pride zemljo; sodil bode vesoljni svet po pravici, in ljudstva po zvestobi svoji. 
[97:1] Gospod kraljuje, radúj se zemlja, veselé se naj pokrajine premnoge. 
[97:2] Oblaki in temà ga obdajajo; pravica in sodba kraj njegovega prestola. 
[97:3] Ogenj hodi pred njim in požiga okrog sovražnike njegove. 
[97:4] Bliski razsvetljujejo vesoljni svet njegov, vidi in trese se zemlja. 
[97:5] Goré se topé kakor vosek vpričo Gospoda, vpričo vse zemlje gospodarja. 
[97:6] Nebesa oznanjajo pravico njegovo; tako da vidijo vsa ljudstva čast njegovo. 
[97:7] Osramoté se naj vsi, ki se ponašajo z maliki; klanjajo naj se mu vsi angeli. 
[97:8] Čuje in veseli se naj Sijon, in radujejo se hčere Judovske, zavoljo sodeb tvojih, Gospod. 
[97:9] Ti namreč si Gospod, vzvišen nad vso zemljo; silno povišan si nad vse angele. 
[97:10] Kateri ljubite Gospoda, sovražite húdo; duše svojih, katerim izkazuje milost, hrani, iz rok krivičnih jih otima. 
[97:11] Luč se je rodila pravičnemu, in poštenim v srci radost. 
[97:12] Veselite se, pravični v Gospodu, in slavite spomin svetosti njegove. 
[98:1] Psalm. Pojte Gospodu novo pesem, ker storil je čudovita dela; blaginjo mu je prinesla desnica njegova, in dlan njegova, in roka njegove svestosti. 
[98:2] Naznanil je Gospod blaginjo svojo, vpričo narodov samih razodel je pravico svojo. 
[98:3] Spomnil se je milosti svoje in zvestobe svoje proti hiši Izraelovi; vse pokrajine zemlje vidijo Boga našega blaginjo. 
[98:4] Ukajte Gospodu, vsa zemlja; s kričanjem pojte in prepevajte. 
[98:5] Prepevajte Gospodu sè strunami, sè strunami in psalmovanjem. 
[98:6] S trombami in bučanjem trobite pred kraljem Gospodom. 
[98:7] Morje šúmi in kar je v njem, vesoljni svet in prebivalci njegovi. 
[98:8] Reke naj ploskajo z rokami, vkup naj pojó goré, 
[98:9] Pred Gospodom, ki gré sodit zemljo; sodil bode vesoljni svet pravično, in ljudstva po pravici. 
[99:1] Gospod kraljuje, trepetajo naj ljudstva, sedeč na Kerubih kraljuje, majaj se zemlja! 
[99:2] Kraljuje Gospod na Sijonu velik, in visok je nad vsa ljudstva. 
[99:3] Slavé naj ime tvoje veliko, čestito je in sveto. 
[99:4] Ti tudi kralj premočni, ki ljubiš sodbo; ti ustanavljaš, kar je pravično; sodbo in pravico doprinašaš ti v Jakobu. 
[99:5] Povišujte Gospoda, Boga našega, in priklanjajte se do podnožja nog njegovih; ker svet je. 
[99:6] Mojzesa in Arona z duhovniki svojimi in Samuela z njimi, ki so klicali ime njegovo, uslišal je Gospod, takoj ko so ga klicali. 
[99:7] V oblačnem stebru jih je ogovoril, ko so hranili pričanja njegova, in postavo, katero jim je bil dal. 
[99:8] 
[99:9] 
[100:1] Psalm v zahvaljevanje. Ukajte Gospodu vsi prebivalci zemlje! 
[100:2] Čestite Gospoda z radostjo; s petjem pridite pred obličje njegovo. 
[100:3] Spoznajte, da je Gospod Bog, on je nas ustvaril (ne pa mí sebe), ljudstvo svoje in čredo paše svoje. 
[100:4] Vnidite skozi vrata njegova sè zahvaljevanjem, s hvalo v veže njegove; zahvaljujte se mu, blagoslavljajte ime njegovo! 
[100:5] Ker dober je Gospod, vekomaj je njegova milost; in od roda do roda zvestoba njegova. 
[101:1] Psalm Davidov: Milost in pravico bodem pel, tebi, o Gospod, prepeval. 
[101:2] Zapazil bodem na poštenem potu, ko prideš k meni; neprestano bodem hodil v poštenosti svojega srca v hiši svoji. 
[101:3] Stavil si ne bodem pred óči stvari pregrešne; delo njih sovražim, ki zavijajo v stran, držalo se me ne bode. 
[101:4] Izprijeno srce bode daleč od mene; hudega ne bodem poznal. 
[101:5] Njega, ki pred menoj skrivno obrekuje bližnjega svojega, bodem iztrebil; človeka s prevzetnim očesom, srcem napihnenim ne bodem mogel trpeti. 
[101:6] Oči moje bodo se vpirale na resnične v deželi, da naj sedajo z menoj; kdor hodi po poštenem potu, on bode mi stregel. 
[101:7] Stanoval ne bode v moji hiši, kdor dela zvijačo; kdor govori laž, ne bode obstal pred mojimi očmi. 
[101:8] Vsako jutro bodem iztrebil vse krivične iz dežele, da potrebim iz mesta Gospodovega vse, ki delajo krivico. 
[101:9] 
[102:1] Molitev za ubozega, ko je v stiski in pred Gospoda izliva premišljevanje svoje. 
[102:2] Gospod, čuj molitev mojo, in vpitje moje pridi do tebe. 
[102:3] Ne skrivaj mi obličja svojega, ko sem v stiski; nagni mi uho svoje, ko kličem; naglo me usliši. 
[102:4] Ker ginejo kakor dim dnevi moji; in kosti moje se sušé kakor pogorišče. 
[102:5] Zadeto vene kakor trava srce moje, ker pozabljam použivati svojo jed. 
[102:6] Od glasú zdihovanja mojega drži se kost moja mojega mesa. 
[102:7] Podoben sem pelikanu v puščavi; kakor sova sem v podrtinah. 
[102:8] Vedno sem podoben samotnemu vrabcu na strehi. 
[102:9] Ves dan me sramoté sovražniki moji; zoper mene divjajoč prisezajo pri meni. 
[102:10] Ker pepel jem kakor kruh; in pijače svoje mešam z jokom. 
[102:11] Zaradi nevolje tvoje in srdite jeze tvoje; ker vzdignil si me in vrgel me na tla. 
[102:12] Dnevi moji so podobni senci, ki se je nagnila; in jaz sem se posušil kakor trava. 
[102:13] Ti pa, Gospod, ostajaš vekomaj, in spomin tvoj od roda do roda. 
[102:14] Ti bodeš vstal in usmilil se Sijona, ker čas je storiti mu milost, ker prišel je čas določeni, 
[102:15] Ko se naj hlapci tvoji veselé njegovega kamenja, in milost storé njegovemu prahu; 
[102:16] Da česté narodi ime Gospodovo, in vsi kralji zemlje čast tvojo. 
[102:17] Ko bode Gospod zidal Sijon in prikazal se v časti svoji, 
[102:18] Ozrl se bode v nazega molitev, in ne bode zametal njih molitve. 
[102:19] Zapiše se naj to naslednjemu rodu, da ljudstvo poživljeno hvali Gospoda. 
[102:20] Ker pogledal bode z višave svetosti svoje Gospod, ozrl se z nebés na zemljo. 
[102:21] Da usliši jetnika zdihovanje, da oprosti njé, ki se že izdajajo smrti; 
[102:22] Da oznanjajo na Sijonu ime Gospodovo, in hvalo njegovo v Jeruzalemu, 
[102:23] Ko se zbirajo ljudstva in kralji čestit Gospoda. 
[102:24] Pobija sicer na tem poti moči moje, dnî moje krajša, 
[102:25] Ali govorim: Bog moj mogočni, ne vzemi me v sredi mojih dnî; skozi vse rodove so dnevi tvoji, 
[102:26] Predno si ustanovil zemljo, in so bila nebesa delo tvojih rok; 
[102:27] Tisto bode prešlo, ti pa ostaneš; tisto, pravim, vse postara se kakor oblačilo; kakor obleko jih izpremeniš in izpremené se. 
[102:28] Ti pa si isti, in let tvojih ni konca. 
[102:29] Sinovi hlapcev tvojih bodo prebivali, in njih seme se utrdi pred teboj. 
[103:1] Davidova. Blagoslavljaj, duša moja, Gospoda; in vse osrčje moje svetost njegovo. 
[103:2] Blagoslavljaj, duša moja, Gospoda; in ne pozabi nobene dobrote njegove, 
[103:3] Kateri ti odpušča vse tvoje krivice, kateri ozdravlja vse bolezni tvoje; 
[103:4] Kateri otima iz jame življenje tvoje, kateri te odeva z milostjo in usmiljenjem; 
[103:5] Kateri napolnjuje z vsem dobrim usta tvoja, da se hraniš čilega kakor orel, kakor otročja leta tvoja. 
[103:6] Kar je pravično, dela Gospod, in sodbe vsem zatiranim. 
[103:7] Razodel je Mojzesu pota svoja, naslednikom Izraelovim svoja dela. 
[103:8] Usmiljen je in milosten Gospod; potrpežljiv in obilen v dobrotah. 
[103:9] Ne prepira se vekomaj; in večno ne hrani jeze. 
[103:10] Ne dela nam po grehih naših, in ne povrača nam po naših krivicah; 
[103:11] Temuč, kakor visoka so nebesa nad zemljo, močna je milost njegova proti njim, kateri se ga bojé. 
[103:12] Kakor daleč je vzhod od zahoda, daleč od nas odvrača pregreške naše. 
[103:13] Kakor se usmili oče otrok, usmili se Gospod njih, ki se ga bojé. 
[103:14] Ker on pozna podobo našo, spominja se, da smo prah. 
[103:15] Da so senu podobni človeka dnevi, kakor poljska cvetica, tako on cveté. 
[103:16] Ko veter potegne čeznjo, skoraj je ni, in je ni več zagledati na mestu njenem. 
[103:17] Milost pa Gospodova je od veka do veka proti njim, ki se ga bojé, in pravica proti vnukom. 
[103:18] Proti njim, ki hranijo zavezo njegovo, in proti njim, ki se spominjajo njegovih zapovedi, da jih izpolnjujejo. 
[103:19] Gospod je v nebesih postavil prestol svoj, in kraljestvo njegovo gospoduje ljudém. 
[103:20] Blagoslavljajte Gospoda, angeli njegovi, premogočni v moči, ki izpolnjujete besedo njegovo in poslušate glas njegove besede. 
[103:21] Blagoslavljajte Gospoda, vse vojske njegove, služabniki njegovi izpolnjujoči voljo njegovo. 
[103:22] Blagoslavljajte Gospoda, vsa dela njegova po vseh krajih njegovega gospostva; blagoslavljaj, duša moja Gospoda! 
[104:1] Blagoslavljaj, duša moja Gospoda. Gospod, Bog moj, velik si silno, lepoto in veličastvo si oblekel. 
[104:2] Odevaš se z lučjo kakor z obleko; nebesa razpenjaš kakor zagrinjalo; 
[104:3] Kateri stavi v vode gornje hrame svoje; kateri nareja oblake za voz svoj, kateri hodéva po vetrov perotih, 
[104:4] Kateri dela vetrove za poslance svoje, za služabnike svoje ogenj plameneči, 
[104:5] Ustanovil je zemljo na podstave njene, da se ne gane na vedno večne čase. 
[104:6] Z breznom si jo bil odél kakor z odejo, ko so vode stale čez gore. 
[104:7] Na karanje tvoje so pobegnile, pred groma tvojega glasom bežale so urno. 
[104:8] Dvignile so se gore, pogreznile se doline na mesto, katero si jim bil ustanovil. 
[104:9] Mejo si postavil, da ne idejo čez, da se ne povrnejo, pokrit zemljo; 
[104:10] Kateri izpuščaš studence po dolinah, da hodijo med gorami. 
[104:11] Napajajo naj vse poljske živali; žejo svojo gasé divji osli. 
[104:12] Poleg njih prebivajo tice nebeške, glasijo se iz med listja. 
[104:13] Kateri móči goré iz gornjih hramov svojih, da se sè sadom dél tvojih zemlja pase. 
[104:14] Daješ, da seno raste živini, in zelišče človeku za rabo, da jemlje hrano iz zemlje; 
[104:15] Kateri z vinom razveseljuje srce človeku; z oljem svetlo dela čelo, in z jedjo podpira srce človeku. 
[104:16] Siti se drevje Gospodovo; cedre na Libanonu, katere je vsadil; 
[104:17] (Kjer gnezdijo tički), jelke prebivališče štorklji, 
[104:18] Gore previsoke divjim kozlom, skale prebivališče gorskim mišim. 
[104:19] Postavil je mesec za čase gotove, solnce, ki pozna záhod svoj. 
[104:20] Temé narejaš, da je noč, ko prilezejo vse gozdne živali. 
[104:21] Mladi levi rjoveč po plenu, in iskajoč od Boga mogočnega hrane svoje. 
[104:22] O solnčnem vzhodu se poskrijejo in ležé v brlogih svojih. 
[104:23] Človek gre na delo svoje, in na polje svoje do večera. 
[104:24] Kako veličastna so dela tvoja, o Gospod; kako modro si jih naredil vsa; kako polna je zemlja posesti tvoje! 
[104:25] V morji samem velikem in prostornem: tu so lazeče živali, in brez števila živali z velikimi male. 
[104:26] Tod hodijo ladije; som, katerega si ustvaril, igrá se v njem. 
[104:27] Vse tó čaka tebe, da jim daš živeža o svojem času. 
[104:28] Ko jim daješ ti, pobirajo; ko jim odpreš roko svojo sitijo se z dobroto. 
[104:29] Ko jim skriješ obličje svoje, zbegajo se; ko jim vzameš sapo, ginejo in povračajo se v svoj prah. 
[104:30] Ko izpuščaš sapo svojo, oživljajo se, obličje obnavljaš zemlji. 
[104:31] Čast bodi Gospodu vekomaj; raduj se, Gospod, v delih svojih! 
[104:32] Ko pogleda na zemljo, trese se ona; ko se dotakne gorâ, kadé se. 
[104:33] Pel bodem Gospodu v življenji svojem; prepeval Bogu svojemu, dokler bodem. 
[104:34] Prijetno bode o njem premišljevanje moje, radoval se bodem jaz v Gospodu. 
[104:35] Izginejo naj grešniki sè zemlje, in krivičnih več ne bódi; blagoslavljaj, duša moja, Gospoda. Aleluja! 
[105:1] Slavite Gospoda, razglasujte ime njegovo; med ljudstvi oznanjujte dejanja njegova. 
[105:2] Pojte mu, prepevajte mu, razgovarjajte se o vseh čudovitih delih njegovih. 
[105:3] Hvalite se v svetem imenu njegovem; veseli se naj srce njih, ki iščejo Gospoda. 
[105:4] Iščite Gospoda in moči njegove; iščite vedno njegovega obličja. 
[105:5] Spominjajte se čudovitih del njegovih, katera je storil; čudežev njegovih in sodbâ ust njegovih. 
[105:6] O seme Abrahama, njegovega hlapca; o izvoljeni sina njegovega Jakoba! 
[105:7] Ta je Gospod, Bog naš, po vsej zemlji so sodbe njegove. 
[105:8] Spominja se vekomaj zaveze svoje, besede, katero je zapovedal na tisoč rodov, 
[105:9] Katero je sklenil z Abrahamom, in prisege svoje Izaku, 
[105:10] Katero je dal Jakobu v postavo; Izraelu v vedno zavezo. 
[105:11] Govoreč: Tebi hočem dati deželo Kanaansko, vrvco posesti vaše. 
[105:12] Dasí je bilo ljudî malo, prav malo, in tujci v njej, 
[105:13] In so hodili od naroda do naroda, iz kraljestva k drugemu ljudstvu; 
[105:14] Ni dovolil zatíratí jih nikomur; dà, strahoval je zavolje njih kralje: 
[105:15] Ne dotaknite se maziljencev mojih, in ne storite žalega prerokom." 
[105:16] Ko je bil poklical lakot nad deželo, in kruhu strl vso podporo; 
[105:17] Poslal je bil moža pred njimi odličnega; kateri je bil v sužnjost prodan, Jožefa. 
[105:18] Noge njegove so vklenili z vezjo, v železo se je on podal. 
[105:19] Noter do časa, ko je imela priti beseda njegova; govor Gospodov ga je potrdil. 
[105:20] Poslal je kralj in velel ga razvezati; in poglavar ljudstev ga je oprostil. 
[105:21] Postavil ga je za gospoda družini svoji, in za poglavarja vsej svoji posesti, 
[105:22] Da bi zvezaval kneze po volji svoji, in podučeval njih starejšine. 
[105:23] Nato je prišel Izrael v Egipt, in Jakob je tujčeval po deželi Kamovi. 
[105:24] Ko je bil tam storil Bog, da je bilo ljudstvo njegovo silno rodovitno, in ga je bil močnejšega naredil od sovražnikov njegovih, 
[105:25] Izpremenil je njih srce, da so sovražili ljudstvo njegovo, da so naklepe delali zoper hlapce njegove. 
[105:26] Poslal je Mojzesa, hlapca svojega, Arona, katerega je bil izvolil. 
[105:27] Razlagala sta pred njimi besede znamenj njegovih, in čudežev v deželi Kamovi. 
[105:28] Poslal je temé, in otemnile so jo, in upirala se niso znamenja zoper besedo njegovo. 
[105:29] Izpremenil je bil v kri njih vodé, in pokončal je bil njih ribe. 
[105:30] Obilo je rodila njih dežela žab, ki so napadle kraljev samih stanice. 
[105:31] Ko je izrekel, prišlo je krdelo živali; uši na vso njih pokrajino. 
[105:32] Dež jim je naredil v točo, ogenj silno plameneč v njih kraji. 
[105:33] S tem je zadel njih trte in njih smokve, in polomil njih pokrajine drevesa. 
[105:34] Ko je izrekel, prišla je kobilica in hrošč, in ta brez števila. 
[105:35] On je požrl vso travo njih kraja, in požrl sad njih dežele. 
[105:36] Slednjič je udaril vse prvorojeno v njih kraji; prvino vse njih moči. 
[105:37] Tedaj jih je izpeljal sè srebrom in zlatom, in ni ga bilo, da bi pešal, med njih rodovi. 
[105:38] Veselili so se Egipčani, ko so izhajali tí; ker njih strah jih je bil obšel. 
[105:39] Razgrnil je oblak za odejo, in ogenj, da je noč razsvetljeval. 
[105:40] Prosili so, in poslal jim je prepelic, in s kruhom nebeškim jih je sitil. 
[105:41] In odprl je skalo, in pritekle so vode, ter šle so po suhih krajih, kakor reka. 
[105:42] Ker se je spominjal besede svetosti svoje, z Abrahamom, hlapcem svojim. 
[105:43] Zató je izpeljal ljudstvo svoje, z veseljem, s petjem izvoljene svoje. 
[105:44] In dal jim je kraje narodov, in delo ljudstev so posedli; 
[105:45] Da se držé postav njegovih, in hranijo zakone njegove. 
[106:1] Aleluja! Slavite Gospoda, ker je dober, ker je vekomaj milost njegova. 
[106:2] Kdo bi dopovedal najvišjo moč Gospodovo, oznanil vso hvalo njegovo? 
[106:3] O blagor jim, ki se držé postave té, ki delajo pravico vsak čas! 
[106:4] Spomni se me, Gospod, po blagovoljnosti, katero izkazuješ svojemu ljudstvu, obišči me z blaginjo svojo. 
[106:5] Da uživam izvoljenih tvojih dobroto, da se radujem radosti naroda tvojega; da se s posestjo tvojo ponašam. 
[106:6] Grešili smo z očeti svojimi: krivično smo delali, ravnali hudobno. 
[106:7] Očetje naši niso umeli v Egiptu čudovitih dél tvojih; spominjali se niso milosti tvojih obilosti; temuč priliko so dajali izpremeniti jih pri morji, ko so stopali v morje trstovito. 
[106:8] Vendar jih je rešil zavoljo imena svojega, da bi pokazal svojo moč. 
[106:9] Ker zarotil je trstovito morje, in posušilo se je; in peljal jih je skozi valove kakor skozi puščavo. 
[106:10] Tako jih je rešil roke sovražnikove; otel jih je neprijateljeve roke. 
[106:11] Pokrile pa so vode njih sovražnike; eden izmed njih ni ostal. 
[106:12] Da sì so verjeli besedam njegovim, peli hvalo njegovo, 
[106:13] Pozabili so naglo dél njegovih; čakali niso sveta njegovega. 
[106:14] Ampak iz poželjivosti v puščavi izkušali so Boga mogočnega v samoti. 
[106:15] Tako da je podelivši jim, kar so prosili, poslal kugo nad nje. 
[106:16] Potem ko so bili nevoščljivi Mojzesu v šatorji, Aronu svetniku Gospodovemu, 
[106:17] Odprla se je zemlja in požrla Datana in zagrnila je drhal Abiramovo. 
[106:18] In vnel se je ogenj v njih drhal, in s plamenom požgal krivične. 
[106:19] Naredili so tele na Horebu, in klanjali so se podobi. 
[106:20] In premenivši čast svojo v podobo vola, ki travo jé, 
[106:21] Pozabili so Boga mogočnega, rešitelja svojega, kateri je bil storil velike reči v Egiptu, 
[106:22] Čudovita dela v deželi Kamovi, strašna pri trstovitem morji. 
[106:23] Zatorej je rekel, da jih bode pogubil; ko bi ne bil Mojzes, izvoljenec njegov, stopil v ón predór pred njim, da bi odvrnil jezo njegovo, da jih ne pogubi. 
[106:24] Zavrgli so tudi zaželeno deželo, ne verujoč besedi njegovi. 
[106:25] In godrnjaje v šatorih svojih niso poslušali glasú Gospodovega. 
[106:26] Zatorej je dvignil roko svojo ter prisegel, da jih podere v sami puščavi. 
[106:27] In da podere seme njih med narodi, in razkropi jih po deželah. 
[106:28] Razen tega so se združili tudi z malikom Peorjem, in jedli mrtvih daritve. 
[106:29] Klicali so tako Boga v nevoljo z deli svojimi, da je pridrla nad nje nadloga. 
[106:30] Dokler ni vstal Pineas in storil sodbo, ter je bila ustavljena tista nadloga; 
[106:31] Kar se mu je štelo za pravico, od roda do roda vekomaj. 
[106:32] Enako so razdražili gorečo jezo pri vodah prepira, tako da se je slabo godilo Mojzesu zavoljo njih. 
[106:33] Ko so bili razdražili duha njegovega, in je izgovoril z ustnami svojimi razdraženje svoje: 
[106:34] Pokončali niso onih ljudstev, za katera jim je bil zapovedal Gospod; 
[106:35] Ampak pomešali so se z onimi narodi in naučili se njih dél. 
[106:36] In čestili so njih podobe, katere so bile njim v izpotiko. 
[106:37] Ker darovali so sinove svoje in hčere svoje hudobnim duhovom; 
[106:38] In prelivali so nedolžno kri, kri sinov svojih in hčer svojih, katere so darovali podobam Kanaanskim, tako da je bila zemlja onečiščena z njih moritvami. 
[106:39] In oskrunjali so se sè svojimi deli; prešestvovali z dejanji svojimi. 
[106:40] Zatorej se je razsrdil Gospod nad ljudstvom svojim in studil svojo posest, 
[106:41] Tako da jih je dal v roko narodom, da bi jim gospodovali njih sovražniki, črtilci, 
[106:42] In jih zatirali njih neprijatelji, in da bi se poniževali pod njih roko. 
[106:43] Mnogokrat jih je rešil, dasì so ga bili razsrdili z naklepom svojim, in so bili ponižani zavoljo krivice svoje. 
[106:44] Ozrl se je na njih stisko, slišal je njih vpitje. 
[106:45] In spomnivši se zá nje zaveze svoje, kesal se je po obilosti milosti svojih; 
[106:46] Tako da jim je izkazal usmiljenje pred vsemí, kateri so jih v sužnjosti imeli. 
[106:47] Reši nas, Gospod, Bog naš, in zberi nas izmed tistih narodov, da slavimo sveto ime tvoje, in se s hvaljenjem priporočamo v hvali tvoji, 
[106:48] Blagoslovljen Gospod, Izraelov Bog, od veka do veka in vse ljudstvo naj govori: Aleluja! 
[107:1] Slavite Gospoda, ker dober je; ker vekomaj je dobrota njegova! 
[107:2] Govoré naj rešenci Gospodovi, katere je rešil iz stiske; 
[107:3] Katere je zbral iz dežél od vzhoda in od zahoda, od severja in od morja. 
[107:4] Tavali so po puščavi, po potih samotnih, mesta za prebivališče niso našli; 
[107:5] Lačni in žejni, njih duša je hirala v njh. 
[107:6] Klicali so Gospoda v stiski svoji; iz njih nadloge jih je rešil. 
[107:7] In vodil jih je po pravem potu, da so prišli v prebivališča mesto. 
[107:8] Slavé naj pred Gospodom milost njegovo, in čudovita dela njegova pri sinovih človeških: 
[107:9] Da on siti dušo potrebno, in dušo gladno napolnjuje z dobrim. 
[107:10] Kateri sedevajo v temoti in smrtni senci, v bridkosti sponah in v železu, 
[107:11] Ker so dali priliko, izpremeniti besedo Boga mogočnega, in zavrgli so sklep Najvišjega, 
[107:12] Srce njih ponižuje s tisto nadlogo; omahujejo in nihče ne pomaga. 
[107:13] Klicali so Gospoda v stiski svoji; rešil jih je iz njih nadloge. 
[107:14] Izpeljal jih je iz temin in smrtne sence, raztrgal je njih vezí. 
[107:15] Slavé naj pri Gospodu milost njegovo, in čudovita dela njegova pri sinovih človeških. 
[107:16] Da on razbija bronasta vrata, in razlomi zapahe železne. 
[107:17] Nespametni, zavoljo pota pregrehe, zavoljo krivic svojih so v bridkosti. 
[107:18] Njih srce studi vsako hrano; bližajo se smrtnim durim. 
[107:19] Klicali so Gospoda v stiski svoji, rešil jih je iz njih nadloge. 
[107:20] Poslal je besedo svojo in ozdravil jih; in rešil iz njih jam. 
[107:21] Slavé naj pri Gospodu milost njegovo, in čudovita dela njegova pri sinovih človeških. 
[107:22] In darujejo naj hvalne daritve ter oznanjajo s petjem dela njegova. 
[107:23] Kateri so šli na morje v ladijah, in so opravljali delo na širnih vodah; 
[107:24] Oni vidijo dela Gospodova in čuda njegova v globočini: 
[107:25] Kako ukaže in naplavi vihar, kateri dviguje valove njegove, 
[107:26] Kako se spenjajo do neba, in padajo v globočine; njih duša koprni v nadlogi; 
[107:27] Opotekajo se in gibljejo kakor pijani; in vsa njih spretnost gine. 
[107:28] Klicali so Gospoda v stiski svoji, rešil jih je iz njih nadloge. 
[107:29] Premenil je vihar v tišino, in utihnili so njih valovi. 
[107:30] In vesele, ko so potihnili valovi, peljal jih je v brodišče zaželeno. 
[107:31] Slavé naj pri Gospodu milost njegovo, in dela čudovita njegova pri sinovih človeških. 
[107:32] In poveličujejo naj ga v zboru ljudstva, in v seji starejšin naj ga hvalijo. 
[107:33] Reke izpreminja v puščavo, in vode tekoče v tla suhotna; 
[107:34] Zemljo rodovitno v solnato zavoljo hudobnih prebivalcev njenih. 
[107:35] Puščavo izpreminja v stoječo vodo in zemljo suhotno v vode tekoče. 
[107:36] Storivši, da prebivajo tam lakotni, in ustanové mesto za prebivališče, 
[107:37] In da posejejo njive in zasadé vinograde ter prideljujejo sad rodoviten. 
[107:38] Blagoslavlja jih tako, da se množijo silno, in živine njih ne zmanjšuje. 
[107:39] A zmanjšujejo se in uklanjajo hudobni v stiski in žalovanji, 
[107:40] Ko izliva zaničevanje nad prvake in dela, da tavajo po praznoti brez potov. 
[107:41] In stavi na višavo siromaka, in kakor čedo množi rodovine. 
[107:42] Vidijo naj pravični in se veselé; vsa malopridnost pa zapri usta svoja. 
[107:43] Kdorkoli je moder, vidi to in pazi na milost Gospodovo. 
[108:1] Pesem in psalm Davidov. 
[108:2] Z radostnim srcem svojim, o Bog, bodem pel in prepeval, tudi slava moja. 
[108:3] Vstanite, brenklje in citre; zbudim se sè zarijo. 
[108:4] Slavil te bodem med ljudstvi, Gospod; in prepeval ti bodem med narodi: 
[108:5] Velika je nad nebesa milost tvoja, in noter do gornjih oblakov resnica tvoja. 
[108:6] Povzdigni se nad nebesa, o Bog; in čez vso zemljo slava tvoja! 
[108:7] Da se rešijo izvoljeni tvoji, pomagaj z desnico svojo in usliši me. 
[108:8] Bog jo govoril po svetosti svoji; radoval se bodem, v dél dobodem Sihem, in dolino Sukotsko merim. 
[108:9] Moj je Gilead, moj Manase, in Efrajm moč glave moje, Juda poveljnik moj. 
[108:10] Moab umivalnik moj; čez Edom vržem svoj čevelj; proti Palestini bodem ukal. 
[108:11] Kdo me popelje v utrjeno mesto, kdo me popelje do Edoma? 
[108:12] Ali nisi bil ti, o Bog, zavrgel nas? da nisi hodil, o Bog, med našimi vojskami? 
[108:13] Daj nam pomoč zoper sovražnika; drugače je ničevost pomoč človeška. 
[108:14] V Bogu delajmo vrlo, in on bode poteptal sovražnike naše. 
[109:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. O Bog hvale moje, ne delaj se gluhega. 
[109:2] Ker usta krivičnega in usta zvijačna so so odprla zoper mene; govorila so zoper mene z lažnjivim jezikom. 
[109:3] In z besedami sovražnimi so me obdali; pobijajo me po krivem. 
[109:4] Nasprotovali so mi za ljubezen mojo, s katero sem bil v molitvi, 
[109:5] Vračajoč mi hudo za dobro, in sovraštvo za ljubezen mojo. 
[109:6] Daj mu krivičnega za gospoda, kateri mu naj nasprotujoč stoji na desni. 
[109:7] Ko pride pred sodbo, odide naj obsojen; in molitev njegova bodi mu v greh. 
[109:8] Malo bodi dnî njegovih; drugi dobodi službo njegovo. 
[109:9] Otroci njegovi bodijo sirote, in vdova žena njegova. 
[109:10] In neprestano naj se klatijo in beračijo otroci njegovi, in iščejo naj miloščine iz krajev svojih zapuščenih. 
[109:11] Odrtnik naj zagrabi, karkoli ima, in tujci naj uplenijo delo njegovo. 
[109:12] Ne bodi mu nikogar, da mu dobroto pomolí, in ne bodi ga, da izkaže milost sirotam njegovim. 
[109:13] Pokončan bodi zarod njegov, v drugem rodu bodi izbrisano njih ime. 
[109:14] V spominu bodi krivica očetov njegovih pri Gospodu; in greh matere njegove se ne izbriši. 
[109:15] Bodo naj vedno pred Gospodom, da iztrebi sè zemlje njih spomin. 
[109:16] Zato ker se ni domislil izkazovati milost, ampak preganjal je moža ubozega in potrebnega in žalujočega, da ga usmrti; 
[109:17] In želel je, da ga zadene prokletstvo, in ni se veselil blagoslova, temuč, da naj bode daleč od njega. 
[109:18] Da se obleče s prokletstvom, kakor z oblačilom svojim, in da vnide kakor voda vanj, in kakor olje v kosti njegove 
[109:19] Pridi mu, kakor sè suknjo naj se ogrinja, in kakor s pasom naj se opasuje z njim vedno. 
[109:20] To bodi plačilo nasprotujočih meni od Gospoda, in njih, kateri hudo govoré zoper dušo mojo. 
[109:21] Ti pa, o Gospod, izkazuj mi milost zavoljo imena svojega, ker je dobra milost tvoja, reši me. 
[109:22] Ker ubožen sem in potreben, in srce moje je prebodeno sredi mene. 
[109:23] Kakor senca, ko se nagiblje, odhajati sem primoran; kakor kobilico me podé. 
[109:24] Kolena moja se šibé od posta, in meso moje hujša, ker je pošla debelost. 
[109:25] Vrhu tega sem jim jaz v zasramovanje; ko me vidijo, majó z glavo svojo. 
[109:26] Pomagaj mi, o Gospod, Bog moj, reši me po milosti svoji. 
[109:27] Spoznajo naj, da je ta roka tvoja, da si ti, Gospod, to storil. 
[109:28] Preklinjajo naj, ti blagoslavljaj; ko se osramoté, kateri so vstali, veseli se naj hlapec tvoj. 
[109:29] Z nečastjo naj se odenejo nasprotniki moji, in ogrnejo se naj kakor s plaščem sè sramoto svojo. 
[109:30] Slavil bodem močno z usti svojimi Gospoda, in sredi mnogih bodem ga hvalil. 
[109:31] Ker stoji na desni siromaku, da ga reši njih, ki mu odsojajo življenje. 
[110:1] Psalm Davidov. Rekel je Gospod Gospodu mojemu: "Sédi meni na desni, dokler ne denem sovražnikov tvojih nogam tvojim za podnožje." 
[110:2] Palico močno tvojo bode poslal Gospod sè Sijona, govoreč: Gospoduj sredi sovražnikov svojih. 
[110:3] Ljudstvo tvoje je radovoljno o dnevi tvojih čét; v lepih krajih svetosti od materinega telesa bode ti mladosti tvoje rosa. 
[110:4] Prisegel je Gospod, in ne bode se kesal: Ti si duhovnik vekomaj po redu Melhizedekovem." 
[110:5] Gospod na desni tvoji potare kralje o dnevi jeze svoje. 
[110:6] Sodil bode narode napolnjujoč z mrliči; razbijal glavo v premnogih krajih. 
[110:7] Iz potoka bode pil na potu, zatorej dvigne glavo. 
[111:1] Alejuja! Slavil bodem Gospoda iz vsega srca, v zboru pravičnih in shodu. 
[111:2] Velika dela Gospodova, razložena vsem, kateri se jih veselé, 
[111:3] Slavno in krasno delo njegovo, in pravico njegovo, ki ostane vekomaj. 
[111:4] Spomin je napravil s čudeži svojimi; milosten in usmiljen je Gospod. 
[111:5] Jedi je dal njim, ki se ga bojé; spominjal se vekomaj zaveze svoje. 
[111:6] Moč del svojih je naznanil ljudstvu svojemu, dal jim je posest narodov; 
[111:7] Dela rok njegovih so resnica in pravica; stanovitne vse zapovedi njegove, 
[111:8] Utrjene na večno in vekomaj, storjene zvesto in pravično. 
[111:9] Rešenje je poslal ljudstvu svojemu in na vekomaj sklenil zavezo svojo; sveto in čestito je ime njegovo. 
[111:10] Vir modrosti je strah Gospodov; najbolji uspeh vsem, ki delajo tako; hvala njegova ostane vekomaj. 
[112:1] Aleluja! Blagor mu, kdor, koli se boji Gospoda, v zapovedih njegovih raduje se močno. 
[112:2] Mogočno bode na zemlji seme njegovo; pravičnih rod se blagoslavlja. 
[112:3] Moč in bogastvo v hiši njegovi in pravica njegova ostane vekomaj. 
[112:4] V temi blišči luč pravičnih; milosten je, usmiljen in pravičen. 
[112:5] Kdor je dober, darí deli milostno in posoja; svoje reči vlada po dolžnosti. 
[112:6] Ker vekomaj ne omahne; v večnem spominu je pravični. 
[112:7] Hudega glasu se ne boji, z mirnim srcem svojim zaupajoč v Gospoda. 
[112:8] V srci svojem podprt se ne boji, dokler ne vidi hudega na sovražnikih svojih. 
[112:9] Razsiplje, daje potrebnim, pravica njegova ostane vekomaj; rog njegov se dviguje v časti. 
[112:10] Krivični pa vidi in se huduje, sè zobmí svojimi škripajoč koprní; krivičnih želja bode minila. 
[113:1] Aleluja! Hvalite hlapci Gospodovi, hvalite ime Gospodovo! 
[113:2] Blagoslovljeno bodí ime Gospodovo, od zdaj na vekomaj! 
[113:3] Od vzhoda solnčnega do zahoda, hvaljeno ime Gospodovo! 
[113:4] Vzvišen nad vse narode je Gospod, nad sama nebesa slava njegova. 
[113:5] Kdo je enak Gospodu, Bogu našemu, kateri prebiva visoko? 
[113:6] Kateri nizko dol gleda, v nebesih in na zemlji. 
[113:7] Iz prahu povišuje ubozega, iz blata dviguje siromaka. 
[113:8] Posaja ga med prvake, med ljudstva svojega prvake. 
[113:9] Daje, da ona, ki je bila nerodovitna v družini, sedí mati otrok vesela. Aleluja. 
[114:1] Ko je izhajal Izrael iz Egipta, družina Jakobova izmed ljudstva tujega jezika: 
[114:2] Bil je Juda svetišče njegovo, Izrael gospostvo njegovo. 
[114:3] Morje samo je videlo in bežalo, Jordan sam se je obrnil nazaj. 
[114:4] Sami hribi so poskakovali kakor ovni, kakor mlada jagnjeta griči. 
[114:5] Kaj ti je bilo, morje, da si bežalo? o Jordan, da si se obrnil nazaj? 
[114:6] O hribi, zakaj bi poskakovali kakor ovni? griči kakor jagnjeta mlada? 
[114:7] Pred obličjem Gospodovim potresi se zemlja; pred obličjem Boga Jakobovega, 
[114:8] Kateri izpremeni samo skalo v stoječo vodo; kremenje v studenec vodâ. 
[115:1] Ne nam, Gospod, ne nam; temuč imenu svojemu daj čast, zavoljo milosti svoje, zavoljo zvestobe svoje. 
[115:2] Zakaj bi govorili narodi: Kje je sedaj njih Bog? 
[115:3] Saj Bog naš je v samih nebesih, storí, karkoli mu je po volji. 
[115:4] Maliki njih sreberni in zlati, delo rok človeških, 
[115:5] Usta imajo, pa ne govoré; oči, pa ne vidijo; 
[115:6] Ušesa imajo, pa ne slišijo; nos imajo, pa ne duhajo; 
[115:7] Roke, pa ne tipajo; noge, pa ne hodijo; z grlom svojim ne črhnejo. 
[115:8] Podobni so njim, ki jih delajo, kdorkoli jim zaupa. 
[115:9] Izrael, zaupaj Gospodu; pomoč je tém in ščit je tém. 
[115:10] Vi iz družine Aronove, zaupajte Gospodu, pomoč je tém in ščit je tém. 
[115:11] Boječi se Gospoda zaupajte Gospodu, pomoč je tém in ščit je tém. 
[115:12] Gospod spomnivši se nas bode blagoslavljal; blagoslavljal družino Izraelovo, blagoslavljal družino Aronovo. 
[115:13] Blagoslavljal boječe se Gospoda, male in velike vred. 
[115:14] Množil vas bode Gospod, vas in otroke vaše. 
[115:15] Blagoslovljeni bodete Gospodu, kateri je narodil nebo in zemljo. 
[115:16] Sama nebesa, nebesa so Gospodova; in zemlja, katero je dal sinom človeškim. 
[115:17] Ne kateri so umrli, hvalijo Gospoda; ne katerikoli gredó dol v kraj molčanja, 
[115:18] Ampak mi bodemo blagoslavljali Gospoda; od sedaj do vekomaj. Aleluja! 
[116:1] Dovolj mi je, da Gospod usliši glas moj, molitve moje. 
[116:2] Ker je uho svoje nagnil meni, zatorej ga bodem klical svoje dni. 
[116:3] Ko me obdajajo smrtne bolečine, in me obhajajo grobne stiske; nadlogo in žalost nahajam. 
[116:4] Če kličem ime Gospodovo, govoreč: "Rotim te, Gospod, reši dušo mojo!" 
[116:5] Milosten je Gospod, in pravičen, Bog naš, pravim, usmiljen. 
[116:6] Preproste rešuje Gospod; ko sem ponižan, prinese mi blaginjo. 
[116:7] Povrni se v pokoj svoj, duša moja, ker Gospod je dobrotljiv tebi. 
[116:8] Ker si otél mene samega smrti, oči moje sólz, nogo mojo padca, 
[116:9] Neprestano bodem hodil pred Gospodom, v krajih živečih. 
[116:10] Veroval sem, ko sem hotel to govoriti; jaz sem bil aboten čez mero. 
[116:11] Jaz sem rekel hiteč: Vsak človek je lažnjiv. 
[116:12] Kaj naj povrnem Gospodu? Vse dobrote njegove me premagujejo. 
[116:13] Čašo vse blaginje bodem povzdignil in slavil ime Gospodovo, 
[116:14] Obljube svoje opravljajoč Gospodu, skôraj pred vsem ljudstvom njegovim. 
[116:15] Draga je pred obličjem Gospodovim smrt njih, katerim izkazuje milost. 
[116:16] Prosim, Gospod, ko sem jaz hlapec tvoj, hlapec tvoj sem, dekle tvoje sin; raztrgal si vezí moje: 
[116:17] Tebi naj darujem hvalno daritev, in slavim ime Gospodovo. 
[116:18] Obljube svoje bodem opravljal Gospodu skoraj pred vsem ljudstvom njegovim; 
[116:19] V vežah hiše Gospodove, sredi tebe, Jeruzalem. Aleluja! 
[117:1] Hvalite Gospoda vsi narodi, slavite ga vsa ljudstva. 
[117:2] Ker obveljala je do nas milost njegova, in zvestoba Gospodova vekomaj. Aleluja! 
[118:1] Slavite Gospoda, ker dober je, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[118:2] Reci sedaj Izrael, da je vekomaj milost njegova. 
[118:3] Rekó naj sedaj, kateri so iz rodovine Aronove, da je vekomaj milost njegova. 
[118:4] Rekó naj sedaj, kateri se bojé Gospoda, da je vekomaj milost njegova. 
[118:5] Iz stiske same sem klical Gospoda, odgovoril je in postavil me na širjavo Gospod. 
[118:6] Gospod mi je na strani; ne bodem se bal, kaj bi mi storil človek? 
[118:7] Gospod mi je na strani z mojimi pomočniki; zatorej jaz zaničujem sovražnike svoje. 
[118:8] Boljše je pribegati h Gospodu, nego zaupanje imeti v kakega človeka. 
[118:9] Boljše je pribegati h Gospodu, nego zaupanje imeti v prvake. 
[118:10] Vsi narodi so me bili obdali; ali v imenu Gospodovem sem jih uničil. 
[118:11] Zopet in zopet so me bili obdali, ali v imenu Gospodovem sem jih uničil. 
[118:12] Obdali so me bili kakor čebele; ugasnili so kakor trnjev ogenj, ker v imenu Gospodovem sem jih uničil. 
[118:13] Močno si me bil pahnil, da bi padel; ali Gospod mi je bil na pomoč. 
[118:14] Moč moja in pesem Gospod, on mi je bil v blaginjo. 
[118:15] Glas petja in blaginje je v šatorih pravičnih, govoreč: Desnica Gospodova dela vrlo. 
[118:16] Desnica Gospodova povzdignena, desnica Gospodova dela vrlo. 
[118:17] Ne bodem umrl, ampak živel, da oznanjam dela Gospodova. 
[118:18] Ostro me je pokoril Gospod; ali smrti ni me izdal. 
[118:19] Odprite mi vrata pravice, da vnidem skozi njé in slavim Gospoda. 
[118:20] Ta so prava vrata do Gospoda, skozi katera vhajajo pravični. 
[118:21] Slavil te bodem, ker si me uslišal in bil mi v blaginjo. 
[118:22] Kamen, katerega so bili zavrgli zidarji, on je za vogelni kamen. 
[118:23] Od Gospoda je on, čudovit je v naših očéh. 
[118:24] Ravno ta dan je storil Gospod, radujmo in veselimo se v njem. 
[118:25] Prosim, Gospod, reši zdaj; prosim, Gospod, dobro srečo daj zdaj. 
[118:26] Slava mu, ki gre v imenu Gospodovem; blagoslavljamo vas, iz hiše Gospodove, 
[118:27] Boga mogočnega Gospoda, ki nas je razsvetlil. Zvezujte daritve praznične z vrvmi noter do oltarjevih rogóv. 
[118:28] Bog mogočni si moj, zato te bodem slavil, Bog moj, bodem te poviševal. 
[118:29] Slavite Gospoda, ker dober je, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[119:1] Blagor poštenim na potu, kateri hodijo po postavi Gospodovi. 
[119:2] Blagor njim, ki hranijo pričanja njegova, ki ga iščejo iz vsega srca. 
[119:3] Kateri tudi ne delajo krivice, ampak hodijo po potih njegovih. 
[119:4] Ti si zapovedal ukaze svoje, da naj se spolnjujejo pridno. 
[119:5] O da bi bila pota moja obernena spolnjevat postave tvoje! 
[119:6] Tedaj se ne osramotim, ko bodem gledal vse zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:7] Slavil te bodem s pravim srcem; učil se sodbâ pravice tvoje. 
[119:8] Postave tvoje bodem spolnjeval, ne zapusti me tako! 
[119:9] Kako bode deček čistil stezo svojo? Držeč se je poleg besede tvoje. 
[119:10] Iz vsega srca svojega te iščem, ne daj, da izgrešim zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:11] V srci svojem hranim govor tvoj, da ne grešim zoper tebe. 
[119:12] Ti blagoslavljeni Gospod, uči me postave svoje. 
[119:13] Z ustnami svojimi preštevam vse pravice tvojih ust, 
[119:14] Veselim se pota pričanj tvojih, kakor vseh zakladov. 
[119:15] Zapovedi tvoje premišljujem in gledam steze tvoje. 
[119:16] V postavah tvojih se razveseljujem, besede tvoje ne zabim. 
[119:17] Dobroto podéli hlapcu svojemu, dokler živim spolnjujem naj besedo tvojo. 
[119:18] Odgrni oči moje, da gledam čuda po zakonu tvojem. 
[119:19] Tujec sem na tej zemlji, ne skrivaj mi zapovedi svojih. 
[119:20] Ginem od hrepenenja po pravicah tvojih vsak čas. 
[119:21] Ti pogubljaš prevzetne, proklete, kateri izgrešajo zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:22] Odvali od mene sramoto in zaničevanje, ker hranim pričanja tvoja. 
[119:23] Tedaj prvaki sedé in govoré zoper mene, hlapec tvoj premišlja postave tvoje. 
[119:24] Tedaj so pričanja tvoja razveseljevanja moja, svetovalci moji. 
[119:25] V prahu tiči življenje moje, živega me ohrani po besedi svoji. 
[119:26] Pota svoja sem prešteval, in ti si me uslišal; úči me postave svoje. 
[119:27] Daj, da umem pot zapovedi tvojih, da premišljam čuda tvoja. 
[119:28] Od otožnosti solzi duša moja, dvigni me po besedi svoji. 
[119:29] Krivičnosti pot odvrni od mene, in zakon svoj mi podéli milostno. 
[119:30] Resnice pot volim, sodbe tvoje imam pred očmi. 
[119:31] Držim se pričanj tvojih, Gospod; ne daj, da se osramotim. 
[119:32] Po potih zapovedi tvojih bodem tekal, ko bodeš razširil srce moje. 
[119:33] Uči me, Gospod, postav tvojih pót, katero bodem hranil do konca. 
[119:34] Daj, da umem, da hranim zakon tvoj, in da ga spolnjujem iz vsega srca. 
[119:35] Daj, da hodim po zapovedi tvojih poti, ker tá me razveseljuje. 
[119:36] Nagni srce moje k postavam svojim, in ne k dobičku. 
[119:37] Odvrni oči moje, da ne gledajo ničemurnosti; po potih tvojih daj da živim. 
[119:38] Stóri govor svoj hlapcu svojemu, kateri je vdan strahu pred teboj. 
[119:39] Odvrni sramoto mojo, katere se bojim, ker dobre so pravice tvoje. 
[119:40] Glej, ukazov tvojih želim, v pravici tvoji daj mi živeti. 
[119:41] Ko mi bodejo prišle milosti tvoje, Gospod; blaginja tvoja po govoru tvojem, 
[119:42] Odgovoril bodem njemu, ki me sramoti, kakor je; ker zaupanje imam v besedo tvojo. 
[119:43] Ali od ust mojih ne odvzemi besede svoje resnične; ker pravic tvojih čakam. 
[119:44] In spolnjeval bodem zakon tvoj vedno, vekomaj in vekomaj. 
[119:45] In neprestano bodem hodil po sami širjavi, ker povelj tvojih iščem. 
[119:46] In govoril bodem o pričanjih tvojih pred kralji, in ne bode me sram. 
[119:47] In razveseljujoč se v zapovedih tvojih, katere ljubim, 
[119:48] Dvignil bodem roke svoje do povelj tvojih, katera ljubim, in premišljeval postave tvoje. 
[119:49] Spomni se besede svoje s hlapcem svojim, o kateri si mi dal upanje. 
[119:50] To je tolažilo moje v bridkosti moji; da me govor tvoj oživlja. 
[119:51] Prevzetniki se mi posmehujejo silno, od postave tvoje ne zavijem. 
[119:52] Spominjam so sodbà tvojih od vekomaj, Gospod, in samega sebe tolažim. 
[119:53] Vihar me grabi od krivičnih, ki zapuščajo zakon tvoj. 
[119:54] Prepevanju predmet so mi postave tvoje v kraji popotovanj mojih. 
[119:55] Ponoči se spominjam imena tvojega, Gospod; in zakon tvoj spolnjujem. 
[119:56] To je tolažba meni, da hranim zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:57] Delež moj si, Gospod, pravim, da spolnjujem besede tvoje. 
[119:58] Obličje tvoje molim iz vsega srca svojega; milost mi izkaži po govoru svojem. 
[119:59] Pota svoja premišljam, da obračam noge svoje po pričanjih tvojih. 
[119:60] Hitim in se ne mudim spolnjevat zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:61] Krdela krivičnih me plenijo, a postave tvoje ne zabim. 
[119:62] O polunoči vstajam slavit te, zavoljo zapovedi tvojih pravičnih. 
[119:63] Tovariš sem vsem, kateri te česté in spolnjujejo povelja tvoja. 
[119:64] Milosti tvoje, o Gospod, polna je zemlja; postave svoje me úči. 
[119:65] Dobro si storil hlapcu svojemu, Gospod; po besedi svoji. 
[119:66] Izvrstnost pameti in vednosti me úči; ker zapovedim tvojim verujem. 
[119:67] Ko nisem še govoril, motil sem se; sedaj pa spolnjujem govor tvoj. 
[119:68] Dober si in dobrotljiv, úči me postave svoje. 
[119:69] Ko zvijačo napravljajo zoper mene prevzetniki, jaz iz vsega srca hranim povelja tvoja. 
[119:70] Debelí se kakor z mastjo njih srce; jaz se zakona tvojega radujem. 
[119:71] Na dobro mi je bila bridkost, da bi se učil postav tvojih. 
[119:72] Boljši mi je zakon tvojih ust nego mnogo tisoč zlatnikov in srebernikov. 
[119:73] Roke tvoje so me naredile in napravile me; storí me razumnega, da se učim povelj tvojih. 
[119:74] Boječi se tebe naj me vidijo ter se veselé, ker imam v besedi tvoji nado svojo. 
[119:75] Spoznavam, Gospod, da so pravične sodbe tvoje; in da si me v zvestobi ponižal. 
[119:76] Pridi skoraj milost tvoja, da me tolaži, po govoru tvojem s tvojim hlapcem. 
[119:77] Dojdejo naj mi usmiljenja tvoja, da živim; ker zakon je vse razveseljevanje moje. 
[119:78] Osramoté se naj prevzetniki, ker mi hudo delajo po krivem, ko premišljujem povelja tvoja. 
[119:79] Povrnejo se naj k meni boječi se tebe in poznajoči pričanja tvoja. 
[119:80] Srce moje bode pošteno v postavah tvojih, da se ne osramotim. 
[119:81] Duša moja koperni po blaginji tvoji; v besedi tvoji imam nado. 
[119:82] Oči moje koperné po govoru tvojem, ko govorim: Kedaj me bodeš potolažil? 
[119:83] Dasì sem podoben mehu v dimu, postav tvojih nisem pozabil. 
[119:84] Koliko bode dnî hlapca tvojega? Kedaj bodeš sodil nje, ki me preganjajo? 
[119:85] Jame mi kopljejo prevzetniki, kateri se ne ravnajo po zakonu tvojem. 
[119:86] Vsa povelja tvoja zgolj resnica; po krivem me preganjajo, pomagaj mi. 
[119:87] Skoraj so me uničili vrženega na tla; jaz pa se nísem izneveril postavam tvojim. 
[119:88] Po milosti svoji ohrani me živega, da spolnjujem pričanja tvojih ust. 
[119:89] Vekomaj, o Gospod, biva beseda tvoja v nebesih, 
[119:90] Od roda do roda zvestoba tvoja; ko si ustanavljal zemljo, stala je ona. 
[119:91] Po sodbah tvojih stoji vse še danes; ker vse ono služi tebi. 
[119:92] Ako bi ne bil zakon tvoj vse razveseljevanje moje, zdavnaj že bi bil poginil v nadlogi svoji. 
[119:93] Vekomaj ne pozabim povelj tvojih, ker z njimi hraniš me živega. 
[119:94] Tvoj sem, hrani me, ker povelj tvojih iščem. 
[119:95] Ko me čakajo krivični, da me pogubé, pregledujem pričanja tvoja. 
[119:96] Sleherne popolnosti vidim da je konec; povelje tvoje pa je obširno silno. 
[119:97] Kako ljubim zakon tvoj! ves dan je premišljevanje moje. 
[119:98] Modrejšega od sovražnikov mojih me dela po poveljih tvojih; ker vekomaj mi je na strani. 
[119:99] Razumnejši postajam od vseh učenikov svojih; ker pričanja tvoja so premišljevanje moje. 
[119:100] Razumnejši sem od starcev, ker hranim povelja tvoja. 
[119:101] Od vsake hudobne steze zadržujem noge svoje, da spolnjujem besedo tvojo. 
[119:102] Od sodbâ tvojih se ne ganem, ker ti me učiš. 
[119:103] Kako sladki so mojemu grlu govori tvoji! sladkejši od medú ustom mojim. 
[119:104] Po poveljih tvojih sem razumen, zatorej sovražim vsako stezo krivičnosti. 
[119:105] Svetilo nogi moji je beseda tvoja, in poti moji luč. 
[119:106] Prisegel sem, kar bodem držal, da bodem spolnjeval pravične sodbe tvoje. 
[119:107] Ponižan sem silno, Gospod; živega me ohrani, po besedi svoji. 
[119:108] Prostovoljne daritve ust mojih sprejemaj, prosim, Gospod; in pravice svoje me úči. 
[119:109] Duša moja je vedno v roki moji; vendar ne zabim tvojega zakona. 
[119:110] Mogočni krivičniki mi stavijo zanko, vendar od povelj tvojih ne zajdem. 
[119:111] Pričanja tvoja imam vekomaj, ker so veselje mojemu srcu. 
[119:112] Srce svoje nagibljem, da spolnjuje postave tvoje, vekomaj, večno! 
[119:113] Misli druge sovražim, zakon pa tvoj ljubim. 
[119:114] Zatišje si moje in ščit moj; v besedi tvoji imam nado. 
[119:115] Umaknite se od mene, hudobni, da hranim ukaze svojega Boga. 
[119:116] Podpiraj me po govoru svojem, da živim; in ne osramoti me v nadi moji. 
[119:117] Podpiraj me, da bodem otét, in da gledam vedno na postave tvoje. 
[119:118] Vse, kateri izgrešujejo postave tvoje, teptaš; ker krivična je njih zvijača. 
[119:119] Kakor žlindro odpravljaš vse krivične sè zemlje; zatorej ljubim pričanja tvoja. 
[119:120] Od strahú pred teboj trepeče meso moje; tako me je strah tvojih sodbâ. 
[119:121] Po sodbi delam in pravici; ne izročaj me njim, ki me stiskajo. 
[119:122] Porok bodi hlapcu svojemu na dobro; da me ne zatirajo prevzetni. 
[119:123] Oči moje koperné po blaginji tvoji, in po pravičnem govoru tvojem. 
[119:124] Ravnaj po milosti svoji s hlapcem svojim; in postave svoje me úči. 
[119:125] Hlapec sem tvoj, storí me razumnega, da spoznam pričanja tvoja. 
[119:126] Čas je, da dela Gospod; v nič dévajo zakon tvoj. 
[119:127] Zatorej bolj ljubim ukaze tvoje, ko zlato in sicer najčistejše. 
[119:128] Zato spoznavam vse ukaze za prave; vsako stezo krivičnosti sovražim. 
[119:129] Čudovita so pričanja tvoja; zatorej jih hrani duša moja. 
[119:130] Dohod besed tvojih razsvetljuje; z razumnostjo podučuje preproste. 
[119:131] Usta svoja raztezam in sopiham; ker želján sem ukazov tvojih. 
[119:132] Ozri se v mé in storí mi milost; kakor je prav proti njim, kateri ljubijo ime tvoje. 
[119:133] Noge moje utrdi v govoru svojem, in ne daj da gospoduje kaka krivica z menoj. 
[119:134] Otmi me zatiranja ljudî, da spolnjujem postave tvoje. 
[119:135] Daj, da sveti tvoje obličje pred hlapcem tvojim; in úči me postave svoje. 
[119:136] Potoki vodâ tekó iz mojih oči, zaradi njih, ki ne spolnjujejo tvojega zakona. 
[119:137] Pravičen si, Gospod, in raven v sodbah svojih. 
[119:138] Ukazal si pravična pričanja svoja, in silno zvesta. 
[119:139] Od gorečnosti svoje ginem, ker besede tvoje zabijo sovražniki moji. 
[119:140] Čist je govor tvoj močno; zatorej ga ljubi hlapec tvoj. 
[119:141] Majhen sem jaz in zaničevan; povelj tvojih ne zabim, 
[119:142] Pravice tvoje, vedne pravice, in postave tvoje resnične. 
[119:143] Zatiranje in stiska me obhajati; ukazi tvoji so razveseljevanje moje. 
[119:144] Pravica pričanj tvojih je vekomaj; razumnega me naredi, da živim. 
[119:145] Ko te kličem iz vsega srca, usliši me, Gospod, da hranim postave tvoje. 
[119:146] Ko te kličem, reši me, da spolnjujem pričanja tvoja. 
[119:147] Préd te pridem v somraku, da vpijem; v besedo tvojo imam upanje. 
[119:148] Oči moje prehitujejo straže, premišljat govor tvoj. 
[119:149] Glas moj poslušaj po milosti svoji, Gospod; po sodbah svojih ohrani me živega, 
[119:150] Ko se bližajo pregrehe učenci, ki so daleč od zakona tvojega, 
[119:151] Blizu si, Gospod; in vsi ukazi tvoji so resnica. 
[119:152] Zdavnaj vem o pričanjih tvojih, da si jih ustanovil vekomaj. 
[119:153] Ozri se v nadlogo mojo, in reši me; ker zakona tvojega ne zabim. 
[119:154] Prevzemi pravdo mojo in reši me; po govoru svojem ohrani me živega. 
[119:155] Daleč od krivičnih bodi blaginja, ker ne iščejo postav tvojih. 
[119:156] Usmiljenje tvoje je obilo, Gospod; po sodbah tvojih, ohrani me živega. 
[119:157] Dasì je mnogo preganjalcev mojih in sovražnikov mojih, od pričanj tvojih ne krenem. 
[119:158] Kakor hitro vidim izdajalce, mučim z gnjusom samega sebe, ker se ne držé govora tvojega. 
[119:159] Glej, da ljubim povelja tvoja, Gospod; po milosti svoji ohrani me živega. 
[119:160] Preblaga beseda tvoja je sama resnica; in vekomaj je vsaka pravična sodba tvoja. 
[119:161] Ko me preganjajo po nedolžnem prvaki; boji se besede tvoje moje srce. 
[119:162] Veselim se govora tvojega; kakor kdor je našel plen obilen. 
[119:163] Krivičnost sovražim in studim, zakon tvoj ljubim. 
[119:164] Sedemkrat te hvalim na dán za pravične sodbe tvoje. 
[119:165] Velik mir imajo, kateri ljubijo zakon tvoj, in ní jim izpotike. 
[119:166] Blaginje tvoje čakam, Gospod; in ukaze tvoje spolnjujem. 
[119:167] Duša moja spolnjuje pričanja tvoja, in ljubim jih močno. 
[119:168] Povelja tvoja spolnjujem in pričanja tvoja, ker vsa pota moja so pred teboj. 
[119:169] Vpitje moje se bližaj tvojemu obličju, Gospod; po besedi svoji naredi me umnega. 
[119:170] Molitev moja pridi pred obličje tvoje; po govoru svojem otmi me. 
[119:171] Hvala bodo vrela z ustnic mojih, ko me bodeš učil postave svoje. 
[119:172] Jezik moj bode prepeval govor tvoj, da so prepravične vse zapovedi tvoje. 
[119:173] V pomoč mi bodi na strani roka tvoja; ker volim povelja tvoja. 
[119:174] Po blaginji tvoji hrepenim, Gospod; in zakon tvoj je vse razveseljevanje moje. 
[119:175] Živi duša moja, da hvali tebe; in sodbe tvoje naj pomagajo meni. 
[119:176] Potikam se kakor ovca izgubljena, išči svojega hlapca; ker povelj tvojih ne zabim. 
[120:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Gospoda sem klical v največji stiski svoji, in uslišal me je. 
[120:2] Gospod, reši me ustne lažnjive, zvijačnega jezika. 
[120:3] Kaj naj ti dá, ali kaj pridene jezik zvijačni? 
[120:4] Besede podobne ostrim pušicam mogočnega, primérne žarjavici brinjevi. 
[120:5] Gorjé meni, ker popotujem toliko časa, stanujem kakor prebivalci šatorov Kedarski. 
[120:6] Predolgo zdí se duši moji da je prebivala pri sovražniku mirú. 
[120:7] Jaz ljubim mir, ali ko govorim, kličejo oni na boj. 
[121:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Oči svoje naj bi povzdignil na one gore? Od kod naj mi pride pomoč? 
[121:2] Pomoč moja bodi od Gospoda, kateri je naredil nebesa in zemljo. 
[121:3] Naj ne dopusti, da omahne noga tvoja, varuh tvoj naj ne spí. 
[121:4] Glej, ne dremlje in ne spí varuh Izraelov. 
[121:5] Gospod varuh tvoj, Gospod je senca tvoja na desni roki tvoji. 
[121:6] Podnevi te ne bode zadevalo solnce, ali mesec ponoči. 
[121:7] Gospod te bode varoval vsega zlega, varoval bode dušo tvojo. 
[121:8] Gospod bode varoval hojo tvojo, od tega časa do vekomaj. 
[122:1] Pesem preizvrstna Davidova. Veselim se tega, ker se mi pravi: Pojdimo v hišo Gospodovo. 
[122:2] Noge naše stojé med vrati tvojimi, o Jeruzalem! 
[122:3] Jeruzalem, prelepo zidan, mesto, katero je popolnem zvezano med sabo. 
[122:4] Kamor hodijo rodovi, rodovi Gospodovi po pričanji Izraelcev, slavit ime Gospodovo. 
[122:5] Ker tam stojé prestoli pravice, prestoli hiše Davidove. 
[122:6] Prosite mir Jeruzalemu govoreč: Mirni naj bodejo kateri ljubijo tebe. 
[122:7] Mir bodi v ozidji tvojem, pokoj v palačah tvojih. 
[122:8] Zavoljo bratov mojih in prijateljev mojih govorim sedaj: Mir v tebi! 
[122:9] Zavoljo hiše Gospodove, Boga našega, pripravim ti dobro. 
[123:1] Pesem preizvrstna. K tebi dvigam oči svoje, o ti, ki sediš v nebesih! 
[123:2] Glej, kakor hlapcev oči gledajo na roke gospodov svojih, kakor dekle oči na roke gospodinje svoje, tako oči naše v Gospoda, Boga našega, dokler nas ne pomilosti. 
[123:3] Pomilosti nas, Gospod, pomilosti; ker dovolj je, siti smo zaničevanja. 
[123:4] Dovolj je sita duša naša; tisto zasmehovanje onim pokojnim, tisto zaničevanje prevzetnim! 
[124:1] Pesem preizvrstna Davidova. Ako bi nam Gospod ne bil pomagal, reci zdaj Izrael; 
[124:2] Ako bi nam Gospod ne bil pomagal, ko so vstajali zoper nas ljudje, 
[124:3] Žive bi nas bili tedaj pogoltnili, ko je njih jeza togotila se zoper nas. 
[124:4] Tedaj bi nas bile poplavile one vode; hudournik bi bil šel čez nas. 
[124:5] Tedaj bi bil šel čez nas hudournik vode silno prevzetne. 
[124:6] Blagoslovljen Gospod, ki nas ni izpostavil za plen njih zobom! 
[124:7] Duša naša je bila kakor tičica oteta tičarjev zanke; iz zanke pretrgane smo bili mi oteti. 
[124:8] Pomoč naša v imenu Gospoda, ki je naredil nebesa in zemljo! 
[125:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Kateri zaupajo Gospodu, podobni so gori Sijonski, ki se ne gane, vekomaj ostane. 
[125:2] Kakor obdajajo Jeruzalem gore, tako obdaja Gospod ljudstvo svoje; od tega časa na vekomaj. 
[125:3] Ker šiba krivice ne počiva nad deležem pravičnih; da ne iztegnejo pravični na nobeno krivico rok svojih. 
[125:4] Blagoslovi, Gospod, dobre in pravične v srcih svojih. 
[125:5] Kateri pa zavijajo na kriva pota svoja, pokori jih naj Gospod z njimi, ki delajo krivico. Mir Izraelu! 
[126:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Ko je peljal Gospod množico vjetnikov Sijonskih nazaj, bili smo kakor katerim se sanja. 
[126:2] Tedaj so se smeha napolnila usta naša, in jezik naš s petjem; tedaj se je reklo med narodi: Veličastne reči dela Gospod z njimi! 
[126:3] Veličastne reči dela Gospod z nami, veseli smo. 
[126:4] Pelji nazaj, Gospod, množico vjetnikov naših, kakor presilne vode v suho deželo. 
[126:5] Kateri so sejali sè solzami, žanjejo naj s petjem. 
[126:6] Kateri je pridobljeno seme noseč hodil neprestano jokaje, vrne se naj s petjem domóv noseč snope svoje. 
[127:1] Pesem preizvrstna za Salomona. Ako Gospod ne zida hiše, zastonj bi se trudili zanjo zidarji; ako Gospod ne varuje mesta, zastonj bi bil priden čuvaj. 
[127:2] Zastonj vam bodijo, kateri vstajajo pred svitom, ki sedévajo pozno, ki uživajo jed bolečin; tako daje ljubljencu svojemu spanje. 
[127:3] Glej, posest Gospodova so sinovi; plačilo sad telesni. 
[127:4] Kakor pušice v močnega roki, tako so dečki. 
[127:5] Blagor možu, kateri bode napolnil tul z njimi; ne bode jih sram, temuč sovražnike pokončajo v njih vratih. 
[128:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Blagor mu, kdorkoli se boji Gospoda, kateri hodi po potih njegovih. 
[128:2] Delo namreč rok svojih bodeš užival, srečen bodeš in dobro ti bode. 
[128:3] Žena tvoja kakor trta rodovitna na strani hiše tvoje; sinovi tvoji, kakor mlade oljke, obdajali bodo mizo tvojo. 
[128:4] Glej, tako bode blagoslovljen kateri se boji Gospoda! 
[128:5] Blagoslavlja te Gospod sè Sijona; uživaj torej srečo Jeruzalemsko vse dnî svojega življenja. 
[128:6] In poglej sinov svojih otroke; mir nad Izraelom! 
[129:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Mnogo so me stiskali od mladosti moje, govori naj sedaj Izrael. 
[129:2] Mnogo so me stiskali od mladosti moje; vendar me niso zmogli. 
[129:3] Po hrbtu so mi orali orači, potegnili so vsako črto svojo. 
[129:4] Gospod pravični presekal je debele vrvi krivičnih. 
[129:5] Osramotili se bodo in nazaj pognali vsi sovražniki Sijonovi. 
[129:6] Bodo kakor seno na strehah, katero usahne, predno se izdere, 
[129:7] S katerim ne napolni roke svoje žanjec, ali naročja svojega, kdor veže snope. 
[129:8] In ne porekó mimo gredoči: Blagoslov Gospodov bodi z vami; blagoslavljamo vas v imenu Gospodovem. 
[130:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Iz globočin sem te klical, Gospod: 
[130:2] Gospod, poslušaj glas moj; ušesa tvoja naj pazijo na prošinj mojih glas. 
[130:3] Ako bodeš na krivice gledal, Gospod, kdo bi mogel obstati? 
[130:4] Ker pri tebi je odpuščenje, da te česté v svetem strahu. 
[130:5] Čakal sem Gospoda, čakala je duša moja; tudi v besedi njegovi imam nado. 
[130:6] Srce moje hrepeni po Gospodu, bolj ko straže po jutru, ki čujejo noter do jutra. 
[130:7] Nado imej Izrael v Gospodu, ker pri Gospodu je milost, in pri njem največ rešenja. 
[130:8] In on bode rešil Izrael vseh krivic njegovih. 
[131:1] Pesem preizvrstna Davidova. Gospod, visok ni bil moj duh in ne povzdignene moje očí; in nisem se lotil reči velikih ali visokih, bolj ko se spodobi meni. 
[131:2] Ali nisem pomiril in utešil srca svojega, podoben njemu, ki se odstavlja od mleka pri materi svoji: podobno odstavljenemu od mleka bilo je pri meni srce moje. 
[131:3] Nado imej Izrael v Gospodu, od tega časa na vekomaj! 
[132:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Spominjaj se, Gospod, Davida, z vso bridkostjo njegovo. 
[132:2] Da je prisegel Gospodu, obljubil mogočnemu Bogu Jakobovemu 
[132:3] "Ne pojdem v hišo svoje šator, stopil ne bodem v ležišče postelje svoje; 
[132:4] Spanja ne bodem dal svojim očém, dremanja trepalnicam svojim: 
[132:5] Dokler ne najdem mesta za Gospoda, bivališča za mogočnega Boga Jakobovega." 
[132:6] Glej, slišali smo, da je bilo v Efratski deželi; našli smo ga bili v pokrajinah Jarovih. 
[132:7] Bližamo se šatorom njegovim, priklanjamo se pred nog njegovih podnožjem. 
[132:8] Vstani, Gospod, v svoj počitek, ti in skrinja moči tvoje. 
[132:9] Duhovniki tvoji naj se oblečejo s pravico, in pojó naj, katere milostno sprejemlješ. 
[132:10] Zavoljo Davida, hlapca svojega, ne odvrni maziljenca svojega obličja. 
[132:11] Prisegel je Gospod Davidu resnico, od katere ne bode odstopil, govoreč: "Od telesa tvojega sadú bodem posadil na prestol tvoj. 
[132:12] Ako se bodo držali zaveze moje sinovi tvoji in pričanj mojih posameznih, katera jih bodem učil, bodo tudi njih sinovi vekomaj sedeli na prestoli tvojem." 
[132:13] Ker Gospod je izvolil Sijon, želel si ga je za prebivališče svoje: 
[132:14] "To je počitek moj vekomaj, tu bodem prebival, ker to sem si želel. 
[132:15] Brašno njegovo bodem mogočno blagoslovil; potrebne njegove bodem nasitil z jedjo. 
[132:16] In duhovnike njegove bodem oblekel z blaginjo, in katere v nji blagovoljno sprejemam, bodejo peli. 
[132:17] Tam bodem storil, da bode poganjal rog Davidov, kjer sem pripravil svetilo maziljencu svojemu. 
[132:18] Sovražnike njegove bodem oblekel sè sramoto, nad njim pa bode cvèlo venčanje njegovo. 
[133:1] Pesem preizvrstna Davidova. Glej, kako dobro, in kako prijetno, da vkup prebivajo bratje! 
[133:2] Kakor ono najbolje mazilo razlito čez glavo, cedeče se na brado, brado Aronovo, ki seza dol do roba obleke njegove. 
[133:3] Kakor rosa na Hermonu, kakor katera kaplje nad gore Sijonske, ker tja pošilja Gospod blagoslov svoj, življenje vekomaj. 
[134:1] Pesem preizvrstna. Glejte, blagoslavljajte Gospoda, vsi hlapci Gospodovi, kateri stojite v hiši Gospodovi vsako noč. 
[134:2] Povzdignite roke svoje sveto in blagoslavljajte Gospoda. 
[134:3] Blagoslavjal te bode sè Sijona Gospod, kateri je naredil nebesa in zemljo. 
[135:1] Aleluja! Hvalite ime Gospodovo, hvalite gospodovi hlapci! 
[135:2] Kateri stojite v hiši Gospodovi, v vežah hiše našega Boga. 
[135:3] Hvalite Gospoda, ker dober je Gospod; prepevajte imenu njegovemu, ker je prijetno. 
[135:4] Ker Jakoba si je izvolil Gospod, Izraela v svojo last. 
[135:5] Ker jaz vem, da je velik Gospod, in kralj naš nad vse bogove. 
[135:6] Karkoli mu je po volji, stori Gospod; v nebesih in na zemlji, po morjih in vseh breznih. 
[135:7] Ki pripelje sopare od kraja zemlje, bliske dela z dežjem, vetrove jemlje iz zakladnic svojih. 
[135:8] Ki je udaril prvorojeno v Egiptu, od ljudî in od živine. 
[135:9] Poslal je znamenja in čuda v sredo tvojo, Egipt, zoper Faraona in zoper vse hlapce njegove. 
[135:10] Kateri je udaril narode mogočne, in pobil silne kralje. 
[135:11] Sihona, kralja Amorejskega in Oga, kralja Basanskega, in vsa kraljestva Kanaanska. 
[135:12] In dal je njih deželo v posest, v posest Izraelu, svojemu ljudstvu. 
[135:13] O Gospod, ime tvoje je vekomaj; Gospod, spomin tvoj od roda do roda. 
[135:14] Ker Gospod sodi ljudstvo svoje, žal mu je kmalu za hlapce svoje. 
[135:15] Maliki narodov zlati in srebrni, rok človeških dela, 
[135:16] Usta imajo, ali ne govoré, oči, ali ne vidijo. 
[135:17] Ušesa imajo, ali ne slišijo; tudi sape ni nič v njih ustih. 
[135:18] Podobni njim bodejo, kateri jih delajo; kdorkoli vanje zaupa. 
[135:19] Hiša Izraelova, blagoslavljajte Gospoda! hiša Aronova, blagoslavljajte Gospoda! 
[135:20] Hiša Levijeva, blagoslavljajte Gospoda; Gospoda boječi se, blagoslavljajte Gospoda; 
[135:21] "Slava Gospodu sè Sijona, ki prebiva v Jeruzalemu! Aleluja!" 
[136:1] Slavite Gospoda, ker dober je, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:2] Slavite bogov Boga, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:3] Slavite gospodov Gospoda, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:4] Njega, ki dela čudovita dela, velika sam, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:5] Kateri je naredil z umnostjo nebesa; ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:6] Kateri razpenja zemljo nad vodami, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:7] Kateri je naredil luči veliko, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:8] Solnce, da gospoduje podnevi, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:9] Mesec sè zvezdami, da gospodujejo ponoči, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:10] Kateri je udaril Egipčane v njih prvorojenih, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:11] In izpeljal je Izraela iz med njih, ker vekomaj je milost njegova; 
[136:12] Z močno pestjo in z iztegneno roko, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:13] Kateri je razdelil morje trstovito na kose, ker vekomaj je milost njegova; 
[136:14] In peljal Izraela po sredi njegovi, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:15] In podrl je Faraona in krdela njegova v morje trstovito, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:16] Kateri je peljal ljudstvo svoje skozi puščavo, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:17] Kateri je udaril kralje velike, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:18] In pobil je kralje veličastne, ker vekomaj je milost njegova: 
[136:19] Sihona, kralja Amorejskega, ker vekomaj je milost njegova; 
[136:20] In Oga, kralja Basanskega, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:21] In dal je njih deželo v posest, ker vekomaj je milost njegova; 
[136:22] Posest Izraelu, svojemu hlapcu, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:23] Kateri v ponižanji našem spominja se nas, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:24] In otima nas sovražnikov naših, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:25] Ki daje hrane vsemu mesu, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[136:26] Slavite Boga mogočnega nebes, ker vekomaj je milost njegova. 
[137:1] Ob rekah Babilonskih, ondi smo sedeli ter jokali, spominjajoč se Sijona. 
[137:2] Na vrbe v deželi obesili smo strune svoje, 
[137:3] Dasì so tam hoteli od nas veselih pesmi, ki so nas odpeljavali vjete, in ki so mučili nas govoreč: Pojte nam katero pesmi Sijonskih. 
[137:4] Kako bi bili peli pesem Gospodovo v tujcev deželi? 
[137:5] Če pozabim tebe, Jeruzalem, pozabi naj se desnica moja. 
[137:6] Jezik moj naj se mi prijemlje neba, ako se ne spominjam tebe, ako ne povzdigujem Jeruzalema nad glavo radosti svoje. 
[137:7] Spomni se, Gospod, zoper Edomejce dneva Jeruzalemskega; kateri so rekli: "Razvalite, razvalite; dokler bode kaj podzidja v njem!" 
[137:8] Rod Babilonski naj se pokončá; blagor mu, kdor ti bode povrnil hudodelstvo, katero si nam storil. 
[137:9] Blagor, kdor zgrabi in razdrobi otroke tvoje ob skalo! 
[138:1] Davidova. Slavil te bodem iz vsega srca svojega; v pričo oblastev bodem ti prepeval. 
[138:2] Priklanjal se bodem proti svetišču svetosti tvoje, in slavil ime tvoje, zavoljo milosti tvoje in zavoljo tvoje zvestobe; ker poveličuješ z vsem imenom svojim govor svoj. 
[138:3] Kateri dan sem vpil, tisti dan si me uslišal; storil si, da me je povzdignila v srci mojem moč. 
[138:4] Slavili te bodo, Gospod, vsi kralji zemeljski, ko bodo slišali govor tvojih ust. 
[138:5] In peli bodo s potov Gospodovih, da je velika slava Gospodova. 
[138:6] Dasì je vzvišen Gospod, vendar gleda na nizkega; dasi visok, spoznava iz daljave. 
[138:7] Ako hodim po sredi stiske, ohraniš me živega; v obraz sovražnikov mojih iztegneš roko svojo, in desnica tvoja me ohrani. 
[138:8] Gospod naj doprinese zame; Gospod, milost tvoja je vekomaj; od rok svojih dél ne odjenjaj! 
[139:1] Načelniku godbe: psalm Davidov. Gospod, preiskuješ me in spoznavaš. 
[139:2] Ti poznavaš sedenje moje in vstajanje moje; misel mojo umeš od daleč. 
[139:3] Hojo mojo in ležo mojo obsezaš, in znana so ti vsa pota moja. 
[139:4] Ko ni še govor na jeziku mojem, glej, Gospod, poznaš ga vsega. 
[139:5] Zadaj in spredaj me obdajaš, in name pokladaš roko svojo. 
[139:6] Prečudovita je vednost tvoja, da bi te varal; visoka je, ne morem je preseči. 
[139:7] Kam naj grem pred duhom tvojim, ali kam naj bežim pred tvojim obličjem? 
[139:8] Ko bi stopil na nebesa, tam si; ali bi ležišče izbral v grobu, glej tu si. 
[139:9] Ko bi si vzel zarije peroti, da bi prebival na pokrajini morja, 
[139:10] Tudi tja bi me spremljala tvoja roka, in zgrabila bi me desnica tvoja. 
[139:11] Ko bi pa rekel: Temé me bodo vsaj pokrile kakor z mrakom; vendar noč je svetloba okolo mene. 
[139:12] Tudi temé ne morejo tako omračiti, da bi ti ne videl skozi; ampak noč razsvetljuje kakor dan, tako so temé kakor luč. 
[139:13] Ti namreč imaš v lasti ledvice moje; pokrival si me v telesu matere moje. 
[139:14] Slavim te zato, ker ogledujoč tista dela strmim, čudovita dela tvoja predobro pozna srce moje. 
[139:15] Skrita ni tebi moja moč, odkar sem ustvarjen bil na skrivnem; umetno narejen, kakor v zemlje globočinah. 
[139:16] Testo moje vidijo tvoje oči, in v knjigi tvoji je pisano vse to; od kar se je narejalo, ko ni bilo še nič tega. 
[139:17] Zatorej pri meni, o kako dražestne so misli tvoje, o Bog mogočni! Kako preobila njih števila! 
[139:18] Našteval bi jih, a več jih je ko peska, čujem naj še s teboj. 
[139:19] O da bi pokončal, o Bog, krivičnega; in može krvoločne, rekoč: Poberite se izpred mene. 
[139:20] Kateri zoper tebe govoré pregrešno; kateri povzdigujejo nično sovražnike tvoje. 
[139:21] Ali ne sovražim, o Gospod, sovražnikov tvojih, in se ne mučim v zaničevanji do njih, ki se spenjajo zoper tebe? 
[139:22] S popolnim sovraštvom jih sovražim; za neprijatelje so meni. 
[139:23] Preiskuj me, Bog mogočni, in spoznaj srce moje; izkusi me in spoznaj misli moje. 
[139:24] In glej, hodim li po potu, tebi nadležnem; in vodi me po večnem potu. 
[140:1] Načelniku godbe, psalm Davidov. 
[140:2] Reši me, Gospod, hudobnih ljudî; mož presilovitih brani me, 
[140:3] Kateri mislijo hudo v srci; vsak dan se shajajo – na vojsko. 
[140:4] Brusijo jezik svoj, podoben kačjemu; strup gadji je pod njih ustnami. 
[140:5] Reši me, Gospod, rok krivičnih, mož presilovitih brani me, ki mislijo izpodbiti mi noge. 
[140:6] Skrivali so mi prevzetniki zanko in vrvi; razgrinjali mi mrežo poleg pota. 
[140:7] Rekel sem Gospodu; Bog mogočni si moj; čuj, Gospod, molitev mojih glas. 
[140:8] Gospod, Bog, moč blaginje moje; glavo si mojo pokril o boja času. 
[140:9] Ne dopústi, Gospod, kar želi krivični; pregrešne misli njegove ne pospešuj; povzdigovali bi se presilno. 
[140:10] Glave njih, ki me obdajajo, – ustnic njih nadloga naj jih pokrije. 
[140:11] Žarjavica pridi nadnje; v ogenj naj jih vrže, v jame, da ne vstanejo. 
[140:12] Mož prokleti ne utrdi se na zemlji; mož silovitosti, njega naj udari pogin. 
[140:13] Vem, da bode Gospod pravdo vodil siromaku, pravico potrebnim. 
[140:14] Dà, pravični bodo slavili ime tvoje; pošteni sedeli pred tvojim obličjem. 
[141:1] Psalm Davidov. O Gospod, kličem te, hiti k meni; čuj glas moj, ko te kličem. 
[141:2] Molitev moja pridi kakor kadilo pred te; povzdigovanje mojih rok kakor dar večerni. 
[141:3] Zloži Gospod, opazuj usta moja; straži karkoli izhaja z ustnic mojih. 
[141:4] Ne daj, da se srce moje nagne k hudobni reči, dela doprinašat po krivici z možmi, ki delajo krivico; tudi naj ne uživam njih slaščic. 
[141:5] Udari naj me nazaj pravični, milost bode, in posvari me, mazilo bode izvrstno; ne brani se glava moja; čim bolj, tem bolj bode: molitev moja v njih nesrečah. 
[141:6] Ali planejo dol raz skale njih sodniki; dasi umejo, da so govori moji prijetni. 
[141:7] Kakor bi kdo razsekal in razklal zemljo, raztresejo se naše kosti, v groba žrelo. 
[141:8] Ko se v té, Gospod, ozirajo moje oči, k tebi pribegnem, ne zapústi duše moje. 
[141:9] Reši me zadrge, katero so mi razpeli, in zank njih, ki delajo krivico. 
[141:10] Padejo naj v mreže svoje vsi krivični, jaz pa pojdem mimo. 
[142:1] Pesem ukovita Davidova, ko je bil v jami, molitev. 
[142:2] Z glasom svojim kličem Gospoda; z glasom svojim prosim pred Gospodom. 
[142:3] Pred njim iztresam premišljevanje svoje; stisko svojo oznanjam pred njim. 
[142:4] Ko je omagoval moj duh v meni, takrat si ti spoznal stezo mojo, ko so mi skrivali zanko, kamorkoli sem popotoval. 
[142:5] Ozri se na desno in poglej; ni ga, da bi me poznal; izginilo mi je zavetje, ni ga, da bi skrbel za življenje moje. 
[142:6] K tebi kličem, Gospod, govoreč: Ti si zavetje moje, delež moj v deželi živečih. 
[142:7] Poslušaj vpitje moje, ker ponižan sem silno; otmi me njih, ki me preganjajo, ker močnejši so od mene. 
[142:8] Izpelji iz zapora življenje moje, da slavim ime tvoje; obdajali me bodo pravični, ko mi bodeš izkazal dobroto. 
[143:1] Psalm Davidov. O Gospod, sliši molitev mojo; ušesa nagni k prošnjam mojim; po zvestobi svoji usliši me, po pravici svoji. 
[143:2] In ne hodi v sodbo s hlapcem svojim, ker pravičen bi ne bil pred teboj nihče, ki živi. 
[143:3] Sovražnik namreč preganja dušo mojo; tlači na tla krdelo moje; dela, da sedevam v teminah; smo, kakor mrliči nekdaj. 
[143:4] Tako, da duh moj v meni omaguje; sredi mene zdí se samo sebi zapuščeno srce moje. 
[143:5] Spominjam se dnî nekdanjih, premišljujem vse delo tvoje, dejanje tvojih rok preudarjam. 
[143:6] Roke svoje razprostiram proti tebi; duša moja, kakor zemlja razsušena, hrepeni po tebi: 
[143:7] Hiti, usliši me, Gospod, duh moj hira; ne skrivaj mi obličja svojega, ker podoben postajam njim, ki gredó v grob dol. 
[143:8] Daj, da slišim zgodaj milost tvojo, ker v té imam zaupanje; naznani mi pot, po kateri bodem hodil, ker do tebe povzdigujem srce svoje. 
[143:9] Otmi me sovražnikov mojih, Gospod; pri tebi sem skrit. 
[143:10] Uči me delati voljo tvojo, ker ti si moj Bog, z dobrim duhom svojim spremljaj me po ravni zemlji. 
[143:11] Zavoljo imena svojega, Gospod, ohrani me živega; zavoljo pravice svoje izpelji iz stiske dušo mojo. 
[143:12] In zavoljo milosti svoje iztrebi sovražnike moje, pokončaj vse, ki stiskajo dušo; ker jaz sem hlapec tvoj. 
[144:1] Davidova. Blagoslovljen bodi Gospod, skala moja, kateri uči boj roke moje, prste moje vojsko; 
[144:2] Milost moja in grad moj; višava moja in rešitelj moj: pomočnik, ščit moj, do katerega pribegam, ki mi podložno dela ljudstvo moje. 
[144:3] Gospod, kaj je človek, da ga spoznaš, sin umrjoči, da se zmeniš zanj? 
[144:4] Človek je podoben ničemurnosti, dnevi njegovi so kakor mimo gredočega senca. 
[144:5] Gospod, nagni nebesa svoja ter stopi dol; dotakni so tistih gorâ, in kadé se naj. 
[144:6] Strelo zaženi in razkropi jih; proži pušice svoje in izbegaj jih. 
[144:7] Iztegni roko svojo z višave; reši me in otmi me iz mnogih vodâ, iz tujcev roke. 
[144:8] Njih usta govoré nično, in njih desnica je krivičnosti desnica. 
[144:9] Bog, novo pesem bodem ti pel; na deseterostrunje bodem ti prepeval. 
[144:10] Tebi, ki daješ blaginjo kraljem, otimaš Davida, hlapca svojega, od hudobnega meča. 
[144:11] Réši me in otmi me iz tujcev roke, katerih usta govoré nično, in njih desnica je krivičnosti desnica. 
[144:12] Da bodo sinovi naši kakor rastline dobro zrejene v nežni dobi svoji, in hčere naše kakor vogelni kameni obdelani v svetišči. 
[144:13] Žitnice naše polne naj dajo obilen živež; naše ovce naj tisočero rodévajo, tisočkrat naj bodo pomnožene v stajah naših. 
[144:14] In voli naši predebeli; nič napada, nič izpada, in tožbe naj ne bode v ulicah naših. 
[144:15] Blagor onemu ljudstvu, kateremu se tako godi; blagor ljudstvu, kogar Bog je Gospod. 
[145:1] Hvala Davidova. Poviševal te bodem, Bog moj, kralj; in blagoslavljal bodem ime tvoje vekomaj in vekomaj. 
[145:2] Vsak dan te bodem blagoslavljal, in hvalil ime tvoje vekomaj in vekomaj. 
[145:3] Velik je Gospod in hvale vreden jako; dà, velikosti njegove ni preiskati. 
[145:4] Rod naj rodú slavi dela tvoja; kakor ona oznanjajo vsakotero mogočnost tvojo. 
[145:5] Lepoto in slavo tvojega veličastva, in čudovite stvari tvoje bodem oznanjal. 
[145:6] In moč čudovitih dél tvojih naj slavé; in posamezna velika dela tvoja bodem pripovedoval. 
[145:7] Spomin obile dobrote tvoje naj vrè iz njih; pravico tvojo naj pojó. 
[145:8] Milosten in usmiljen je Gospod; potrpežljiv in velik v milosti. 
[145:9] Dober je Gospod vsem; in usmiljenje njegovo v vseh delih njegovih. 
[145:10] Slavé te naj, Gospod, vsa dela tvoja; in blagoslavljajo te naj, katerim milost izkazuješ. 
[145:11] Slavo kraljestva tvojega naj slavé, in naznanjajo mogočnost tvojo. 
[145:12] Da sinom človeškim oznanjajo mogočnost njegovo, in slavo in lepoto njegovega kraljestva. 
[145:13] Kraljestvo tvoje je vseh vekov kraljestvo, in gospostvo tvoje od roda do roda. 
[145:14] Gospod podpira vse padajoče, in kvišku pomaga vsem omahujočim. 
[145:15] Vseh oči gledajo v té; ti jim daješ jedi o svojem času. 
[145:16] Roko svojo odpreš in nasitiš karkoli živi, po volji. 
[145:17] Pravičen je Gospod po vseh potih svojih, in dobrotljiv v vseh svojih delih. 
[145:18] Blizu je Gospod vsem, ki ga kličejo; vsem, kateri ga kličejo v zvestobi. 
[145:19] Voljo spolnjuje boječim se njega; vpitje njih sliši in daje jim blaginjo. 
[145:20] Gospod hrani vse, kateri ga ljubijo; vse hudobne pa pogublja. 
[145:21] Hvalo Gospodovo naj govoré usta moja; in vse meso naj blagoslavlja sveto ime njegovo, vekomaj in vekomaj. 
[146:1] Aleluja! Hvali, duša moja, Gospoda. 
[146:2] Hvalil bodem Gospoda v življenji svojem; prepeval bodem Bogu svojemu, dokler bodem. 
[146:3] Ne imejte zaupanja v prvake, v sina človeškega, pri katerem ni blaginje. 
[146:4] Duh njegov izide, povrne se v zemljo svojo; isti dan minejo misli njegove. 
[146:5] Blagor, komur je na pomoč Bog mogočni Jakobov; katerega nada je v Gospodu, njegovem Bogu, 
[146:6] Kateri je naredil nebesa in zemljo, morje in kar je v njiju, kateri hrani zvestobo vekomaj. 
[146:7] Kateri dela pravico zatiranim, hrane daje lačnim, Gospod oprašča jetnike. 
[146:8] Gospod odpira očí slepim, Gospod vzdiguje potrte, Gospod ljubi pravične. 
[146:9] Gospod brani tujce, siroto in vdovo podpira; pot pa hudobnih razdira. 
[146:10] Vladal bode Gospod vekomaj; Bog tvoj, o Sijon, od roda do roda. Aleluja! 
[147:1] Hvalite Gospoda; ker dobro je prepevati Bogu našemu; ker prijetno, spodobno je hvaljenje. 
[147:2] Zidar Jeruzalema Gospod, Izraelce zbira razkropljene. 
[147:3] On ozdravlja potrte v srci in obvezuje v njih bolečinah. 
[147:4] Prešteva zvezd število, kliče jih, kolikor jih je, po imenih. 
[147:5] Velik je Gospod, Bog naš, in mnoga moč njegova, razumnost njegova brezmerna. 
[147:6] Krotke podpira Gospod, hudobne potiska noter do tal. 
[147:7] Pojte hvalne pesmi Gospodu, na strune prepevajte našemu Bogu. 
[147:8] On zagrinja z gostimi oblaki nebesa; dež napravlja zemlji, daje, da seno rodevajo gore. 
[147:9] Živež svoj daje živini, mladim krokarjem, ki čivkajo. 
[147:10] Moči konjeve se ne veseli, stegna odličnega moža mu niso po volji; 
[147:11] Po volji so Gospodu boječi se njega, kateri imajo nado v milosti njegovi. 
[147:12] S hvalo slávi Jeruzalem Gospoda, hvali Boga svojega, o Sijon. 
[147:13] Ker zapahe tvojih vrát utrjuje, sinove tvoje blagoslavlja sredi tebe. 
[147:14] Mir daje pokrajinam tvojim, z mozgom pšenice te siti. 
[147:15] Ko pošlje govor svoj na zemljo, urno izteče beseda njegova. 
[147:16] Sneg daje kakor volno, slano razsiplje kakor pepél. 
[147:17] Led svoj meče dol, kakor koščke; pred mrazom njegovim kdo prebije? 
[147:18] Besedo svojo pošlje in jih raztaja; kakor hitro pihne veter svoj, iztekó vodé. 
[147:19] Besede svoje naznanja Jakobu; postave svoje in pravice svoje Izraelu. 
[147:20] Ni storil tako nobenemu narodu; zatorej ne poznajo tistih pravic. Aleluja. 
[148:1] Aleluja! Hvalite Gospoda, nebeščani, hvalite ga v višavah. 
[148:2] Hvalite ga vsi angeli njegovi, hvalite ga vse vojske njegove. 
[148:3] Hvalita ga solnce in mesec; hvalite ga vse svetle zvezde. 
[148:4] Hvalite ga nebes nebésa, in vode, katere so nad tem nebom. 
[148:5] Hvali naj ime Gospodovo, kar je na povelje njegovo ustvarjeno bilo takoj. 
[148:6] Kar je ustanovil vekomaj, na veke; dal je zapoved, katere naj nobeno ne prestopi. 
[148:7] Hvalite Gospoda, zemeljske stvari; zmaji in brezna vsa. 
[148:8] Ogenj in toča, sneg in sopara, veter viharni spolnjujoč besedo njegovo. 
[148:9] Same gore in hribi, drevesa rodovitna, cedre vse; 
[148:10] Same zveri in živina vsa, laznina in tiči krilati. 
[148:11] Kralji zemeljski in narodi vsi; knezi in vsi zemljé sodniki. 
[148:12] Mladeniči in tudi device, starci z dečki 
[148:13] Hvalijo naj ime Gospodovo, ker vzvišeno je njega samega ime; lepota njegova nad zemljo in nebo. 
[148:14] In rog povišuje svojemu ljudstvu, hvalo vseh, katere sprejema prijazno, Izraelcev, ljudstva bližnjega njemu. Aleluja! 
[149:1] Aleluja! Pojte Gospodu pesem novo; hvalo njegovo v zboru njih, katere sprejema prijazno. 
[149:2] Veséli se Izrael v njem, ki ga je ustvaril; sinovi Sijonski naj se radujejo v kralji svojem. 
[149:3] Hvalijo naj ime njegovo s piščaljo; z bobnom in strunami naj mu prepevajo. 
[149:4] Ker milosten je Gospod z ljudstvom svojim; krotke diči z blaginjo. 
[149:5] Radujejo se naj v slavi prijazno sprejeti; pojó naj na ležiščih svojih, 
[149:6] Hvalo povišujočo Boga mogočnega v grlu svojem, in meč dvorezni v roki svoji. 
[149:7] Da se mašujejo nad narodi, ljudstva pokoré. 
[149:8] Da zvežejo z verigami njih kralje; in njih plemenitnike z vezmi železnimi. 
[149:9] Da nad njimi spolnijo pisano pravico; kar je čast vsem onim, katere sprejema prijazno. Aleluja! 
[150:1] Aleluja! Hvalite Boga, mogočnega o svetosti njegovi; hvalite ga v veličastva njegovega gradu. 
[150:2] Hvalite ga o obili mogočnosti njegovi, hvalite ga po velikem veličastvu njegovem. 
[150:3] Hvalite ga s trombe glasom; hvalite ga z brenkljami in strunami. 
[150:4] Hvalite ga z bobnom in piščaljo, hvalite ga z orgljami. 
[150:5] Hvalite ga s cimbali donečimi, hvalite ga sè sistri. 
[150:6] Vsaka duša hvali naj Gospoda! Aleluja!

### Matthew

[1:1] Bukve rodú Jezusa Kristusa, sina Davidovega, sina Abrahamovega. 
[1:2] Abraham je rodil Izaka; Izak je pa rodil Jakoba; Jakob je pa rodil Juda in brate njegove. 
[1:3] Juda je pa rodil Faresa in Zara s Tamaro; Fares je pa rodil Ezroma; Ezrom je pa rodil Arama. 
[1:4] Aram je pa rodil Aminadaba; Aminadab je pa rodil Naasona; Naason je pa rodil Salmona. 
[1:5] Salmon je pa rodil Booza z Rahabo; Booz je pa rodil Obeda z Ruto; Obed je pa rodil Jeseja. 
[1:6] A Jesej je rodil Davida kralja. David kralj je pa rodil Solomona z Urijevo. 
[1:7] Solomon je pa rodil Roboama; Roboam je pa rodil Abija; Abija je pa rodil Aza. 
[1:8] Aza je pa rodil Jozafata; Jozafat je pa rodil Jorama; Joram je pa rodil Ozija. 
[1:9] Ozija je pa rodil Joatama; Joatam je pa rodil Aliaza; Aliaz je pa rodil Ezehija. 
[1:10] Ezehija je pa rodil Manaseja; Manasej je pa rodil Amona; Amon je pa rodil Jozija. 
[1:11] A Jozija je rodil Johonija in brate njegove, za selitve Babilonske. 
[1:12] Po selitvi Babilonskej pa: Jehonija je rodil Salatijela; Salatijel je pa rodil Zorobabeljna. 
[1:13] Zorobabelj je pa rodil Abijuda; Abijud je pa rodil Elijahima; Elijahim je pa rodil Azorja. 
[1:14] Azor je pa rodil Sadoka; Sadok je pa rodil Ahima; Ahim je pa rodil Elijuda. 
[1:15] Elijud je pa rodil Eleazarja; Eleazar je pa rodil Matana; Matan je pa rodil Jakoba. 
[1:16] A Jakob je rodil Jožefa moža Marije, iz ktere se je rodil Jezus, ki se imenuje Kristus. 
[1:17] Vseh rodov torej od Abrahama do Davida, štirinajst rodov; in od Davida do selitve Babilonske, štirinajst rodov; in od selitve Babilonske do Kristusa, štirinajst rodov. 
[1:18] Jezus Kristusovo rojstvo je bilo pa tako: Ko je bila namreč mati njegova Marija zaročena Jožefu, predno sta se sešla, najde se, da je noseča od svetega Duha. 
[1:19] Jožef pa mož njen, ker je bil pravičen in je ni hotel očitno sramotiti, hotel jo je skrivaj popustiti. 
[1:20] In ko je to pomislil, glej, prikaže mu se v spanji angelj Gospodov, govoreč: Jožef, sin Davidov! ne boj se vzeti Marije žene svoje; kajti kar se je v njej začelo, od Duha je svetega. 
[1:21] Rodila bo pa sina, in imenuj ime njegovo Jezus; kajti on bo odrešil ljudstvo svoje njih grehov. 
[1:22] Vse to se je pa zgodilo, da se izpolni, kar je rekel Gospod po preroku, kteri pravi: 
[1:23] "Glej, devica bo noseča, in rodila bo sina, in imenovali bodo ime njegovo Emanuel," kar se tolmači: Bog z nami. 
[1:24] Prebudivši se pa Jožef iz spanja, storí, kakor mu je angelj Gospodov ukazal, in vzeme ženo svojo. 
[1:25] In ni je poznal, dokler ni rodila sina svojega prvenca; in dá mu ime Jezus. 
[2:1] Ko se je pa Jezus v Betlehemu Judejskem rodil, v dnéh Heroda kralja, glej, pridejo od vzhoda modrijani v Jeruzalem, 
[2:2] Govoreč: Kje je kralj Judovski, ki se je rodil? Kajti videli smo zvezdo njegovo na vzhodu, pa smo prišli, da mu se poklonimo. 
[2:3] Slišavši pa to kralj Herod, prestraši se, in ves Jeruzalem ž njim. 
[2:4] In zbravši vse vélike duhovne in ljudske pismarje, povpraševal jih je, kje se ima Kristus roditi. 
[2:5] Oni mu pa rekó: V Betlehemu Judejskem; kajti tako je napisal prerok: 
[2:6] "In ti, Betlehem, zemlja Judova, nikakor nisi najmanji med knezi Judovimi; kajti iz tebe bo izšel vojvoda, kteri bo pasel narod moj Izraelski." 
[2:7] Tedaj pokliče Herod skrivaj modrijane, in pozvé od njih na tanko, kedaj se je zvezda prikazala. 
[2:8] In poslavši jih v Betlehem, reče: Pojdite in na tanko izprašajte za dete; a ko ga najdete, sporočite mi, da tudi jaz pridem in mu se poklonim. 
[2:9] Oni pa, zaslišavši kralja, odidejo. In glej, zvezda, ktero so bili videli na vzhodu, šla je pred njimi, dokler ni prišla in se ustavila nad mestom, kjer je bilo dete. 
[2:10] Ko pa ugledajo zvezdo, razveselé se z zeló velikim veseljem. 
[2:11] In pridejo v hišo, in najdejo dete z Marijo materjo njegovo; in padejo, ter mu se poklonijo; in odpró zaklade svoje, ter mu prinesó darove: zlato in kadilo in miro. 
[2:12] In opomenjeni v spanji, naj se ne vračajo k Herodu, odidejo po drugej poti v svoj kraj. 
[2:13] Ko so pa oni odpotovali, glej, prikaže se angelj Gospodov Jožefu v spanji, govoreč: Vstani in vzemi dete in mater njegovo, pa beži v Egipet, in bodi tam, dokler ti ne povem; kajti Herod bo iskal deteta, da bi ga pogubil. 
[2:14] On pa vstane in vzeme dete in mater njegovo po noči, in odide v Egipet. 
[2:15] In bil je tam do Herodove smrti; da se izpolni, kar je rekel Gospod po preroku, kteri pravi: "Iz Egipta sem poklical sina svojega." 
[2:16] Tedaj se Herod, videvši, da so ga modrijani prekanili, zeló raztogotí, ter pošlje in pomori po Betlehemu in po vseh predelih njegovih vse otročiče po dve leti in niže, po času, ki ga je na tanko pozvedel od modrijanov. 
[2:17] Tedaj se je izpolnilo, kar je rekel prerok Jeremija, govoreč: 
[2:18] "Glas se je slišal v Rami, mnogo jokú in veka in krika; Rahel je plakala za svojimi otroci, in ni se hotela utolažiti, ker jih ni." 
[2:19] Ko je pa Herod umrl, glej, prikaže se v spanji angelj Gospodov Jožefu v Egiptu, 
[2:20] Govoreč: Vstani in vzemi dete in mater njegovo, in pojdi v zemljo Izraelsko; kajti pomrli so, kteri so iskali detetove duše. 
[2:21] On pa vstane in vzeme dete in mater njegovo, in pride v zemljo Izraelsko. 
[2:22] Slišavši pa, da kraljuje v Judeji Arhelaj mesto Heroda očeta svojega, zbojí se tje iti; opomenjen pa v spanji, odide v predele Galilejske. 
[2:23] In prišedši tje, nastani se v mestu, ktero se imenuje Nazaret; da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po prerokih: "Nazarečan se bo imenoval." 
[3:1] V tisti dnéh pa pride Janez Krstnik, ter je v puščavi Judejskej oznanjeval, 
[3:2] In govoril: Spokorite se; kajti približalo se je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[3:3] Kajti ta je, za kogar je povedal prerok Izaija, govoreč: "Glas vpijočega v puščavi: Pripravite pot Gospodu; poravnajte steze njegove." 
[3:4] On pa, Janez, imel je obleko svojo iz kamelje dlake, in pas usnjat okoli ledja svojega; a živež njegov je bil: kobilice in med divji. 
[3:5] Tedaj je izhajal k njemu ves Jeruzalem in vsa Judeja in vsa okolica Jordanska. 
[3:6] In on jih je krščeval v Jordanu, in izpovedovali so grehe svoje. 
[3:7] Ko pa vidi mnogo Farizejev in Saducejev, da gredó h krstu njegovemu, reče jim: Gadja zalega! kdo vam je pokazal, kako ubežite prihodnjej jezi? 
[3:8] Rodite torej vreden sad pokore. 
[3:9] In ne domišljujte si, da bi govorili v sebi: Abrahama imamo za očeta; kajti pravim vam, da more Bog iz tega kamenja obuditi Abrahamu sinove. 
[3:10] Uže pa stojí tudi sekira drevju pri korenini: vsako drevo torej, ktero ne rodí dobrega sadú, posekalo se bo in vrglo na ogenj. 
[3:11] Jaz vas krščujem z vodo za pokoro; a ta, ki gre za menoj, močneji je od mene, kteremu nisem vreden obutala ponesti. On vas bo krstil z Duhom svetim in ognjem. 
[3:12] Njemu je lopata v roki njegovej, in očedil bo gumno svoje, in pospravil bo pšenico svojo v žitnico, a plevo bo spalil z neugasljivim ognjem. 
[3:13] Tedaj pride Jezus iz Galileje k Janezu na Jordan, da ga on krsti. 
[3:14] Janez mu je pa branil, govoreč: Meni je treba, da me ti krstiš, pa hodiš ti k meni? 
[3:15] Jezus pa odgovorí in mu reče: Pusti sedaj! kajti tako nam je treba izpolniti vsako pravico. Tedaj ga pustí. 
[3:16] In krstivši se Jezus, stopi precej iz vode; in glej, nebesa mu se odpró, in Duha Božjega vidi, da shaja ko golob, in pride na-nj. 
[3:17] In glej, glas z nebes, govoreč: Ta je sin moj ljubljeni, kteri je po mojej volji. 
[4:1] Tedaj odpelje Duh Jezusa v puščavo, da ga izkuša hudič. 
[4:2] In postivši se štirideset dnî in štirideset nočî, postane naposled lačen. 
[4:3] Pa pristopi k njemu izkušnjavec, in reče: Če si sin Božji, reci, naj postane to kamenje kruh. 
[4:4] On pa odgovorí in reče: Pisano je: "Ne bo živel človek o samem kruhu, nego o vsakej besedi, ktera izhaja iz ust Božjih." 
[4:5] Tedaj ga vzeme hudič v sveto mesto, in postavi ga na vrh tempeljna, 
[4:6] In reče mu: Če si sin Božji, vrzi se dol; kajti pisano je: "Angeljem svojim bo zapovedal za te, in vzeli te bodo na roke, da se kje z nogo svojo ne udariš o kamen." 
[4:7] Reče mu Jezus: Zopet je pisano: "Ne izkušaj Gospoda Boga svojega." 
[4:8] Zopet ga vzeme hudič na zeló visoko goro, in pokaže mu vsa kraljestva sveta in njih slavo, 
[4:9] In reče mu: Vse to bom tebi dal, če padeš in mi se pokloniš. 
[4:10] Tedaj mu reče Jezus: Poberi se, satan! kajti pisano je: "Poklanjaj se Gospodu Bogu svojemu, in njemu edinemu služi." 
[4:11] Tedaj ga hudič pustí; in glej, angelji pristopijo, ter so mu stregli. 
[4:12] Slišavši pa Jezus, da je Janez izdan, odide v Galilejo. 
[4:13] In zapustivši Nazaret, pride in se nastani v Kapernaumu pri morji, v predelih Zabulona in Neftalima. 
[4:14] Da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po preroku Izaiji, kteri pravi: 
[4:15] "Zemlja Zabulonova in zemlja Neftalimova, na poti k morju za Jordanom, poganska Galileja, 
[4:16] Narod, ki je sedel v temi, videl je veliko svetlobo; in kteri so sedeli v smrtnej deželi in senci, zasvetila jim je luč." 
[4:17] Odtlej je jel Jezus učiti in praviti: Spokorite se; kajti približalo se je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[4:18] Hodé pa Jezus ob morji Galilejskem, ugleda dva brata, Simona, ki se imenuje Peter, in Andreja brata njegovega, da mečeta mreže v morje; bila sta namreč ribiča. 
[4:19] In reče jima: Pojdita za menoj, in naredil bom, da bosta lovca ljudî. 
[4:20] Ona pa precej popustita mreže, in odideta za njim. 
[4:21] In odšedši odtod dalje, ugleda druga dva brata, Jakoba sina Zebedejevega, in Janeza brata njegovega, v ladji z Zebedejem nju očetom, da krpata mreže svoje; in pokliče ju. 
[4:22] Ona pa precej popustita ladjo in očeta svojega, in odideta za njim. 
[4:23] In hodil je Jezus okoli po vsej Galileji, učeč po njih shajališčih, in oznanjujoč evangelj kraljestva, in uzdravljajoč vsako bolezen in vsako slabost med narodom. 
[4:24] In glas o njem izide po vsej Siriji, in prinesó mu vse bolnike, z različnimi boleznimi in mukami, in obsedence, in mesečne, in mrtvoudne; in ozdravi jih. 
[4:25] In za njim je šlo mnogo ljudstva iz Galileje, in iz Deseterih mest, in iz Jeruzalema, in iz Judeje, in z one strani Jordana. 
[5:1] Ko pa vidi ljudstvo, stopi na goro; in ko se je usedel, pristopijo k njemu učenci njegovi. 
[5:2] Pa odpre usta svoja, ter jih je učil, govoreč; 
[5:3] Blagor ubogim v duhu; ker njih je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[5:4] Blagor jim, kteri žalujejo; ker oni se bodo utolažili. 
[5:5] Blagor krotkim; ker oni bodo podedovali zemljo. 
[5:6] Blagor lačnim in žejnim pravice; ker oni se bodo nasitili. 
[5:7] Blagor usmiljenim; ker oni bodo usmiljenje našli. 
[5:8] Blagor jim, kteri so čistega srca; ker oni bodo Boga videli. 
[5:9] Blagor mirovitim; ker oni se bodo sinovi Božji imenovali. 
[5:10] Blagor pregnanim za voljo pravice; ker njih je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[5:11] Blagor vam, kedar vas zasramoté in preženó in rekó vse hudo zoper vas, za voljo mene, pa lažejo. 
[5:12] Radujte se in veselite, ker je plačilo vaše v nebesih veliko. Kajti tako so pregnali preroke, ki so bili pred vami. 
[5:13] Vi ste sol zemlji. Če pa sol znorí, s čim se bo osolila? Za nič več ni, razen da se iztrese ven, in jo ljudje poteptajo. 
[5:14] Vi ste svetilo svetu. Mesto, ktero stojí vrhu gore, ne more se skriti. 
[5:15] Tudi ne užigajo sveče in jo devljejo pod mernik, nego na svečnik: ter sveti vsem, kteri so v hiši. 
[5:16] Tako naj se sveti vaše svetilo pred ljudmi, da vidijo vaša dobra dela, in slavé očeta vašega, ki je na nebesih. 
[5:17] Ne mislite, da sem prišel podirat postavo ali preroke; nisem prišel podirat, nego izpolnjevat. 
[5:18] Resnično vam pravim: Dokler ne prejde nebo in zemlja, ne bo izginila ne najmanja črka ali pičica iz postave, dokler se vse ne zgodí. 
[5:19] Kdorkoli torej eno najmanjih teh zapovedi popači, in ljudí tako naučí, imenoval se bo v nebeškem kraljestvu najmanji; kdorkoli jo pa izpolni, in naučí, ta se bo velik imenoval v nebeškem kraljestvu. 
[5:20] Kajti pravim vam, da če ne bo pravičnost vaša veča, nego pismarjev in Farizejev, ne boste prišli v nebeško kraljestvo. 
[5:21] Slišali ste, da je rečeno starim: Ne ubij; kdor pa ubije, kriv bo sodbe. 
[5:22] A jaz vam pravim, da vsak, kdor se brez razloga jezí na brata svojega, kriv bo sodbe; kdorkoli pa reče bratu svojemu: Raka! kriv bo zbora; a kdorkoli reče: Prismoda! kriv bo peklenskega ognja. 
[5:23] Če torej prineseš dar svoj k oltarju, in se tam spomeniš, da ima brat tvoj nekaj zoper tebe: 
[5:24] Pusti dar svoj tam pred oltarjem, pa pojdi, pomiri se poprej z bratom svojim, in potem pridi in prinesi dar svoj. 
[5:25] Sprijazni se z zopernikom svojim naglo, dokler si ž njim na poti, da te zopernik ne izročí sodniku, in te sodnik ne izročí hlapcu, in ne boš vržen v ječo. 
[5:26] Resnično ti pravim: Ne boš izšel odtod, dokler ne plačaš zadnjega solda. 
[5:27] Slišali ste, da je rečeno starim: Ne prešestvuj. 
[5:28] A jaz vam pravim, da vsak, kdor pogleda na ženo, da je poželí, prešestvoval je uže ž njo v srcu svojem. 
[5:29] Če te pa oko tvoje desno pohujšuje, izderi ga, in vrzi od sebe; kajti bolje ti je, da pogine eden udov tvojih, nego da bo vse telo tvoje vrženo v pekel. 
[5:30] In če te desna tvoja roka pohujšuje, odseci jo, in vrzi od sebe; kajti bolje ti je, da pogine eden udov tvojih, nego da bo vse telo tvoje vrženo v pekel. 
[5:31] Rečeno je pa: Kdorkoli popustí ženo svojo, naj jej dá ločilno pismo. 
[5:32] A jaz vam pravim, da kdorkoli popustí ženo svojo, razen za voljo prešestvovanja, zapeljuje jo v prešestvovanje; in kdorkoli popuščeno vzeme, prešestvuje. 
[5:33] Zopet ste slišali, da je rečeno starim: Ne prisegaj po krivem; izpolni pa Gospodu prisege svoje. 
[5:34] A jaz vam pravim, da ne prisegajte nikakor: ne pri nebu, ker je prestol Božji; 
[5:35] Ne pri zemlji, ker je podnožje nogam njegovim; ne pri Jeruzalemu, ker je mesto vélikega kralja. 
[5:36] Tudi pri glavi svojej ne prisegaj, ker ne moreš ne enega lasú narediti belega ali črnega. 
[5:37] Govorica vaša pa bodi: Dá, dá; ne, ne. Kar je pa več od tega, to je od hudega. 
[5:38] Slišali ste, da je rečeno starim: Oko za oko, in zob za zob. 
[5:39] A jaz vam pravim, da se ne upirajte hudemu: nego če te kdo udari po desnem licu, nastavi mu tudi drugo; 
[5:40] In kdor se hoče s teboj pravdati, in suknjo tvojo vzeti, pustí mu tudi plašč; 
[5:41] In če te kdo prisili eno miljo, pojdi ž njim dve. 
[5:42] Kdor te prosi, daj mu; in kdor hoče od tebe na posodbo, ne odreci mu. 
[5:43] Slišali ste, da je rečeno: Ljubi bližnjega svojega, in sovraži sovažnika svojega. 
[5:44] A jaz vam pravim: Ljubite sovražnike svoje; blagoslovite tiste, kteri vas preklinjajo; delajte dobro tistim, kteri vas mrzé; in molite za tiste, kteri vas stiskajo in preganjajo: 
[5:45] Da boste sinovi očeta svojega, ki je na nebesih. Kajti on veleva solncu svojemu, da vzhaja nad hudobnimi in dobrimi, in daje dež pravičnim in nepravičnim. 
[5:46] Kajti če ljubite tiste, kteri ljubijo vas, kakošno plačilo boste imeli? Ne delajo li tega tudi mitarji? 
[5:47] In če ljubite samo brate svoje, kaj delate preveč? Ne delajo li tudi mitarji tako? 
[5:48] Bodite vi torej popolni, kakor je popoln oče vaš, ki je na nebesih. 
[6:1] Pazite, da ne boste dajali miloščine svoje pred ljudmi, da bi vas oni videli; sicer nimate plačila pri očetu svojem, ki je na nebesih. 
[6:2] Kedar torej daješ miloščino, ne trobi pred seboj, kakor delajo hinavci po shajališčih in po ulicah, da jih hvalijo ljudjé. Resnično vam pravim: Prejeli so plačilo svoje. 
[6:3] Ti pa, kedar daješ miloščino, ne vé naj levica tvoja, kaj dela desnica tvoja: 
[6:4] Da bo miloščina tvoja na skrivnem. In oče tvoj, ki vidi na skrivnem, on ti bo povrnil očitno. 
[6:5] In kedar moliš, ne bodi kakor hinavci, da radi po shajališčih in po uličnih oglih stojé in molijo, da se pokažejo ljudém. Resnično vam pravim, da so prejeli plačilo svoje. 
[6:6] Ti pa, kedar moliš, vnidi v hram svoj, in zapri duri svoje, ter se pomoli očetu svojemu na skrivnem. In oče tvoj, ki vidi na skrivnem, povrnil ti bo očitno. 
[6:7] Kedar pa molite, ne govorite mnogo, kakor pogani; kajti oni mislijo, da bodo uslišani za voljo obilnih besed svojih. 
[6:8] Ne primerjajte se torej njim; kajti oče vaš vé, česa vam je treba, predno ga vi prosite. 
[6:9] Zatorej molite vi takole: Oče naš, ki si na nebesih; posveti se ime tvoje; 
[6:10] Pridi kraljestvo tvoje; zgodi se volja tvoja, kakor na nebu, tudi na zemlji; 
[6:11] Kruh naš vsakdanji daj nam danes; 
[6:12] In odpusti nam dolge naše, kakor tudi mi odpuščamo dolžnikom svojim; 
[6:13] In ne vpelji nas v izkušnjavo, nego reši nas zlega; ker tvoje je kraljestvo in moč in slava na vekomaj. Amen. 
[6:14] Kajti če odpuščate ljudém njih grehe, odpustil bo tudi vam oče vaš nebeški. 
[6:15] Če pa ne odpuščate ljudém njih grehov, tudi oče vaš ne bo odpustil vaših grehov. 
[6:16] Kedar se pa postite, ne bodite žalostni, kakor hinavci; ker grdé obraze svoje, da se pokažejo ljudém, da se postijo. Resnično vam pravim, da so prejeli plačilo svoje. 
[6:17] Ti pa, kedar se postiš, namaži glavo svojo, in obraz svoj umij: 
[6:18] Da te ne bodo videli ljudjé, da se postiš, nego oče tvoj, ki je na skrivnem. In oče tvoj, ki vidi na skrivnem, povrnil ti bo očitno. 
[6:19] Ne nabirajte si zakladov na zemlji, kjer molj in rja razjeda, in kjer tatovi podkopujejo in kradejo. 
[6:20] Nego nabirajte si zaklade na nebu, kjer ne molj ne rja ne razjeda, in kjer tatovi ne podkopujejo in ne kradejo. 
[6:21] Kajti kjer je zaklad vaš, tam bo tudi srce vaše. 
[6:22] Sveča telesu je oko. Če je torej oko tvoje prosto, svetlo bo vse telo tvoje; 
[6:23] Če je pa oko tvoje hudobno, temno bo vse telo tvoje. Če je torej luč, ki je v tebi, tema, kakošna bo ta tema? 
[6:24] Nikdor ne more dvema gospodoma služiti: kajti ali bo enega mrzil, in drugega ljubil; ali enega cenil, in drugega zaničeval. Ne morete Bogu služiti in mamonu. 
[6:25] Za to vam pravim: Ne skrbite za življenje svoje, kaj boste jedli in kaj boste pili; tudi ne za telo svoje, kaj boste oblekli. Mar ni življenje več, kakor hrana; in telo več, kakor obleka? 
[6:26] Poglejte na tice nebeške, da ne sejejo in ne žanjejo in tudi ne spravljajo v žitnice, in oče vaš nebeški jih živí. Mar niste vi mnogo bolji od njih? 
[6:27] Kdo od vas pa skrbeč, more postavi svojej primakniti en komolec? 
[6:28] In za obleko kaj skrbite? Poglejte na lilije na polji, kako rastejo; ne trudijo se in ne predejo. 
[6:29] Pravim vam pa, da se tudi Solomon v vsej slavi svojej ni oblekel, kakor teh ena. 
[6:30] Če pa travo na polji, ktera danes stojí, in jutri se meče v peč, Bog tako oblači, mar ne mnogo bolj vas, maloverni? 
[6:31] Ne skrbite torej, in ne govorite: Kaj bomo jedli? ali kaj bomo pili? ali kaj bomo oblekli? 
[6:32] Kajti vsega tega iščejo pogani. Saj oče vaš nebeški vé, da vsega tega potrebujete. 
[6:33] Nego iščite najprej kraljestva Božjega in pravice njegove, in vse to vam se bo pridalo. 
[6:34] Ne skrbite torej za jutri; kajti jutri bo skrbel za svoje. Dosti ima dan svojega zlega. 
[7:1] Ne sodite, da vam se ne bo sodilo. 
[7:2] Kajti s kakoršno sodbo sodite, sodili bodo vam; in s kakoršno mero merite, odmerjalo se bo vam. 
[7:3] Kaj pa vidiš troho v očesu brata svojega, bruna pa v očesu svojem ne čutiš? 
[7:4] Ali kako porečeš bratu svojemu: Čaj, da izderem troho iz očesa tvojega, in glej, bruno je v očesu tvojem? 
[7:5] Hinavec! izderi poprej bruno iz očesa svojega, in tedaj boš videl izdreti troho iz očesa brata svojega. 
[7:6] Ne dajte svetega psom; in ne pomečite biserjev svojih pred svinje, da jih ne poteptajo z nogami svojimi, in se obrnejo, ter vas raztrgajo. 
[7:7] Prosite, in dalo vam se bo; iščite, in našli boste; trkajte, in odprlo vam se bo. 
[7:8] Kajti vsak, kdor prosi, prejema; in kdor išče, nahaja; in kdor trka, odpiralo mu se bo. 
[7:9] Ali kdo izmed vas je človek, kogar če prosi sin njegov kruha, da mu bo dal kamen? 
[7:10] In če prosi ribe, da mu bo dal kačo? 
[7:11] Če torej vi, ki ste hudobni, znate dobre darove dajati otrokom svojim, koliko več bo dal oče vaš, ki je na nebesih, dobrega tistim, kteri ga prosijo? 
[7:12] Vse torej, kar hočete, da ljudjé vam storé, tako storite tudi vi njim; kajti to je postava in preroki. 
[7:13] Vnidite skozi tesna vrata. Kajti prostorna so vrata, in široka je pot, ktera pelje v pogubo, in mnogo jih je, kteri po njej hodijo. 
[7:14] Kajti tesna so vrata, in ozka je pot, ktera pelje v življenje, in malo jih je, kteri jo najdejo. 
[7:15] Varujte se pa lažnjivih prerokov, kteri prihajajo k vam v ovčjih oblačilih, znotrej so pa grabljivi volkovi. 
[7:16] Po njih sadovih jih boste poznali. Bere li se s trnja grozdje, ali z osata smokve? 
[7:17] Tako vsako dobro drevo dober sad rodi; slabo drevo pa slab sad rodí. 
[7:18] Dobro drevo ne more slabega sadú roditi, in slabo drevo ne more dobrega sadú roditi. 
[7:19] Vsako drevo, ktero ne rodí dobrega sadú, posekalo se bo in vrglo na ogenj. 
[7:20] Torej po njih sadovih jih boste poznali. 
[7:21] Ne bo prišel vsak, kdor mi pravi: Gospod! Gospod! v nebeško kraljestvo; nego kdor izpolnjuje voljo očeta mojega, ki je na nebesih. 
[7:22] Veliko mi jih poreče tisti dan: Gospod! Gospod! ali nismo v tvoje ime prerokovali, in s tvojim imenom hudičev izganjali, in s tvojim imenom mnogo čudežev storili? 
[7:23] In tedaj jim bom povedal: Nikoli vas nisem poznal; pojdite od mene, hudodelniki! 
[7:24] Vsak torej, kdor sliši te moje besede in po njih dela, njega bom primeril modremu možu, kteri je sezidal hišo svojo na skali. 
[7:25] In padla je ploha, in prišle so reke, in zapuhali so vetrovi in se zagnali v tisto hišo, in ni padla: kajti bila je postavljena na skalo. 
[7:26] In vsak, kdor sliši te moje besede, in po njih ne dela, podoben bo neumnemu možu, kteri je sezidal hišo svojo na pesku. 
[7:27] In padla je ploha, in prišle so reke, in zapuhali so vetrovi in udarili v tisto hišo, in padla je: in pad nje je bil grozen. 
[7:28] In zgodí se, ko je končal Jezus te Besede, čudilo se je ljudstvo nauku njegovemu; 
[7:29] Kajti učil jih je, kakor kdor ima oblast, a ne kakor pismarji. 
[8:1] In ko je stopil z gore, šlo je za njim mnogo ljudstva. 
[8:2] In glej, gobavec pride, ter mu se je poklanjal, govoreč: Gospod! če hočeš, moreš me očistiti. 
[8:3] In stegnivši Jezus roko, dotakne se ga, govoreč: Hočem, očisti se! In precej mu se je očistila goba. 
[8:4] In reče mu Jezus: Glej, da nikomur ne poveš; nego pojdi, pokaži se duhovnu, in prinesi dar, ki ga je ukazal Mojzes, njim za pričo. 
[8:5] Ko pa vnide Jezus v Kapernaum, pristopi k njemu stotnik, proseč ga, 
[8:6] In govoreč: Gospod! hlapec moj leží domá božjasten in se grozno muči. 
[8:7] In Jezus mu reče: Jaz bom prišel in ga bom uzdravil. 
[8:8] In stotnik odgovorí, in reče: Gospod! nisem vreden, da vnideš pod streho mojo; nego reci le besedo, in hlapec moj bo ozdravel. 
[8:9] Kajti tudi jaz sem človek pod oblastjo, in imam pod seboj vojake. Pa velim temu: Pojdi! in gre; in drugemu: Pridi! in pride; in hlapcu svojemu: Stóri to! in storí. 
[8:10] Slišavši pa to Jezus, začudi se, in reče tistim, ki so šli za njim: Resnično vam pravim, tudi v Izraelu nisem našel tolike vere. 
[8:11] Pravim vam pa, da jih bo mnogo prišlo od vzhoda in zahoda, in sedeli bodo z Abrahamom in Izakom v nebeškem kraljestvu; 
[8:12] A sinovi kraljestva se bodo izgnali v najkrajnjo temo: tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[8:13] In Jezus reče stotniku: Pojdi, in kakor si veroval, naj ti se zgodí. In hlapec njegov je ozdravel od tega časa. 
[8:14] In Jezus pride v Petrov dom, in vidi taščo njegovo, da leží in jo trese mrzlica. 
[8:15] In dotakne se njene roke, in mrzlica jo pustí; in vstala je, ter jim je stregla. 
[8:16] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, prinesó mu mnogo obsedencev; pa izžene duhove z besedo, in uzdravi vse bolnike. 
[8:17] Da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po preroku Izaiji, kteri pravi: "On je vzel slabosti naše, in ponesel je bolezni." 
[8:18] Ko pa vidi Jezus mnogo ljudstva okoli sebe, ukaže iti na drugo stran. 
[8:19] Pa pristopi k njemu en pismar in mu reče: Učenik! šel bom za teboj, kamorkoli odideš. 
[8:20] In reče mu Jezus: Lisice imajo brloge, in tice nebeške gnezda; a sin človečji nima kje glave nasloniti. 
[8:21] A nekdo drugi učencev njegovih mu reče: Gospod! dovoli mi najprej, da grem in pokopljem očeta svojega. 
[8:22] Jezus mu pa reče: Pojdi za menoj, in pustí, naj mrliči pokopljejo mrliče svoje. 
[8:23] Ter stopi v ladjo, in za njim vstopijo učenci njegovi. 
[8:24] In glej, vihar velik vstane na morji, tolik, da zakrijejo valovi ladjo; on je pa spal. 
[8:25] In pristopivši učenci njegovi, zbudé ga, govoreč: Gospod! otmi nas; pogibljemo. 
[8:26] In reče jim: Kaj ste boječi, maloverni? Tedaj vstane, zapretí vetrovom in morju, in velika tihota nastane. 
[8:27] Ljudjé se pa začudijo, in rekó: Kdo neki je ta, da so mu tudi vetrovi in morje pokorni? 
[8:28] In ko pride na drugo stran, v pokrajino Gergezensko, srečata ga dva obsedenca, ktera sta prišla iz grobov in sta bila tako huda, da ni mogel nihče po tistej poti mimo iti. 
[8:29] In glej, pa zakričita, in rečeta: Kaj imaš z nami, Jezus, sin Božji? Si li sém prišel, da bi nas pred časom mučil? 
[8:30] In daleč od nju se je pasla velika čreda svinj. 
[8:31] Hudiči so ga pa prosili, govoreč: Če nas izganjaš, dovoli nam, da odidemo v čredo svinj. 
[8:32] In reče jim: Pojdite! In oni izidejo, ter odidejo v čredo svinj. In glej, vsa čreda se zakadí z brega v morje, in potonejo v vodi. 
[8:33] Pastirji pa zbežé, in prišedši v mesto, naznanijo vse, in za obsedence. 
[8:34] In glej, vse mesto izide Jezusu naproti. In ko ga ugledajo, zaprosijo, naj odide iž njih krajev. 
[9:1] In stopivši v ladjo, prepelje se, in pride v svoje mesto. 
[9:2] In glej, prinesó mu mrtvoudnega, kteri je ležal na postelji. In videč Jezus njih vero, reče mrtvoudnemu: Zaupaj, sin! odpuščajo ti se grehi tvoji. 
[9:3] In glej, nekteri od pismarjev rekó v sebi: Ta preklinja Boga, 
[9:4] In videč Jezus njih misli, reče: Za kaj mislite hudobno v srcih svojih? 
[9:5] Kaj je namreč laže, reči: Odpuščajo ti se grehi; ali reči: Vstani, in hodi? 
[9:6] Da boste pa vedeli, da ima sin človečji oblast odpuščati na zemlji grehe, (tedaj velí mrtvoudnemu:) Vstani in vzemi svojo posteljo, in pojdi na dom svoj. 
[9:7] Pa vstane in odide na dom svoj. 
[9:8] Ko pa ljudstvo to vidi, začudijo se, in hvalijo Boga, ki je dal ljudém tako oblast. 
[9:9] In gredé dalje odtod, ugleda človeka, da sedí na mitnici, Matevža po imenu, in reče mu: Pojdi za menoj! Pa vstane in odide za njim. 
[9:10] In zgodí se, ko je sedel v hiši za mizo, in glej, mnogo mitarjev in grešnikov je prišlo, in sedeli so z Jezusom in učenci njegovimi. 
[9:11] In ko Farizeji to vidijo, rekó učencem njegovim: Za kaj učenik vaš z mitarji in grešniki jé? 
[9:12] Slišavši pa to Jezus, reče jim: Ne potrebujejo zdravi zdravnika, nego bolni. 
[9:13] Pojdite pa, in naučite se, kaj se pravi: "Milosti hočem, in ne darú." Nisem prišel namreč klicat pravičnih, nego grešnike na pokoro. 
[9:14] Tedaj pristopijo k njemu Janezovi učenci, govoreč: Za kaj se mi in Farizeji mnogo postimo, tvoji se pa učenci ne postijo? 
[9:15] In reče jim Jezus: Morejo li svatje jokati, dokler je ženin ž njimi? Prišli bodo pa dnevi, ko jim se bo ženin odvzel, in tedaj se bodo postili. 
[9:16] Nikdor pa ne prišiva zaplate iz novega sukna na staro obleko; kajti zaplata njena bo odtrgla od obleke še nekaj, in luknja bo veča. 
[9:17] In novega vina ne vlijajo v stare mehove; sicer mehovi popokajo, in vino se izlije, in mehovi se pokazé: nego novo vino vlijajo v nove mehove, in oboje se ohrani. 
[9:18] Ko jim je to govoril, glej, pride starešina, ter mu se je poklanjal, govoreč: Hči moja je ravnokar umrla; ali pridi, in položi na njo roko svojo, in oživela bo. 
[9:19] In Jezus vstane in odide za njim, on in učenci njegovi. 
[9:20] In glej, žena, ktera je imela krvotok dvanajst let, pristopi od zadi in se dotakne robú obleke njegove. 
[9:21] Kajti djala je sama pri sebi: Če se le obleke njegove dotaknem, ozdravela bom. 
[9:22] Jezus se pa obrne in jo ugleda, ter reče: Zaupaj, hčer! vera tvoja ti je pomagala. In žena je ozdravela od tega časa. 
[9:23] In prišedši Jezus v starešinovo hišo, ugleda piskače in ljudstvo, ktero je hrumelo, 
[9:24] In reče jim: Odstopite! kajti deklica ni umrla, nego spí. In posmehovali so mu se. 
[9:25] Ko je pa ljudstvo izgnal, vnide in jo prime za roko; in deklica vstane. 
[9:26] In ta zgodba se razglasí po vsej tistej zemlji. 
[9:27] In ko je šel Jezus dalje odtod, šla sta za njim dva slepca, in vpila sta, govoreč: Usmili se naju, sin Davidov! 
[9:28] Ko pa pride v hišo, pristopita slepca k njemu. In Jezus jima reče: Verujeta li, da morem to storiti? Rečeta mu: Dà, Gospod! 
[9:29] Tedaj se dotakne njunih očî, govoreč: Po vaju veri naj se vama zgodí! 
[9:30] In njune očí se odpró. In Jezus jima zapretí, in reče: Glejta, da nihče ne zvé. 
[9:31] Ona pa izideta in ga razglasita po vsej tistej zemlji. 
[9:32] Ko sta pa ona izšla, glej, pripeljejo mu mutca, kteri je bil obseden. 
[9:33] In ko je hudiča izgnal, mutec spregovori. In ljudstvo se začudi, in reče: Nikoli se ni kaj takega v Izraelu videlo. 
[9:34] Farizeji so pa govorili: S poglavarjem hudičev izganja hudiče. 
[9:35] In hodil je Jezus po vseh mestih in vaséh, učeč po njih shajališčih, in oznanjujoč evangelj kraljestva, in ozdravljajoč vsako bolezen in vsako slabost med narodom. 
[9:36] Ko pa vidi ljudstvo, zasmilijo mu se; kajti bili so zapuščeni in razkropljeni kakor ovce, ktere nimajo pastirja. 
[9:37] Tedaj reče učencem svojim: Žetve je mnogo, ali delalcev malo; 
[9:38] Prosite torej gospodarja žetve, naj pošlje delalcev na žetev svojo. 
[10:1] In poklicavši svojih dvanajst učencev, dá jim oblast nad nečistimi duhovi, da jih izganjajo, in da uzdravljajo vsako bolezen in vsako slabost. 
[10:2] Dvanajsterih aposteljnov imena so pa ta: Prvi Simon, ki se imenuje Peter, in Andrej brat njegov; Jakob sin Zebedejev, in Janez brat njegov; 
[10:3] Filip, in Jernej; Tomaž, in Matevž mitar; Jakob sin Alfejev, in Lebej s priimkom Tadej. 
[10:4] Simon Kananičan, in Juda Iškarijan, kteri ga je tudi izdal. 
[10:5] Teh dvajnast pošlje Jezus, in zapové jim, govoreč: Ne hodite na pogansko pot, in ne vnidite v Samarijansko mesto, 
[10:6] Marveč pojdite k izgubljenim ovcam Izraelove hiše. 
[10:7] Hodé pa oznanjujte, in pravite: Približalo se je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[10:8] Bolnike uzdravljajte, gobavce očiščajte, mrtve obujajte, hudiče izganjajte: zastonj ste prejeli, zastonj dajte. 
[10:9] Ne jemljite zlata, ne srebra, ne denarja v pasu svojem; 
[10:10] Ne torbe na pot, ne dveh plaščev, ne obutala, ne palice: kajti vreden je delalec svoje hrane. 
[10:11] V kterokoli mesto ali vas pa vnidete, pozvedite, kdo v njej je vreden; in tam ostanite, dokler ne izidete. 
[10:12] Ko pa vnidete v hišo, pozdravite jo. 
[10:13] In če je hiša vredna, pride naj mir vaš na njo; če pa ni vredna, vrne naj se mir vaš k vam. 
[10:14] In če vas kdo ne sprejme, in tudi besed vaših ne posluša, izidite iz tiste hiše ali tistega mesta, in otresite prah z nog svojih. 
[10:15] Resnično vam pravim: Laže bo Sodomskej in Gomorskej zemlji v dan sodbe, nego tistemu mestu. 
[10:16] Glej, jaz vas pošiljam kakor ovce sred volkov: bodite torej razumni kakor kače, in priprosti kakor golobje. 
[10:17] Varujte se pa ljudî; kajti izročevali vas bodo sodnijam, in po shajališčih svojih vas bodo bičali. 
[10:18] Popeljejo vas pa tudi pred vladarje in kralje za voljo mene, njim in narodom za pričo. 
[10:19] Kedar vas pa izročé, ne skrbite, kako in kaj bi govorili; kajti dalo vam se bo tisti čas, kako in kaj boste govorili. 
[10:20] Ker ne boste govorili vi, nego duh očeta vašega bo govoril v vas. 
[10:21] Izdajal bo pa brat brata v smrt, in oče sina; in otroci bodo vstali zoper roditelje, in morili jih bodo. 
[10:22] In sovražili vas bodo vsi za voljo imena mojega; kdor pa pretrpí do kraja, ta se bo zveličal. 
[10:23] Kedar vas pa v tem mestu preženó, bežite v drugo. Kajti resnično vam pravim: Ne boste prehodili mest Izraelovih dotlej, ko pride sin človečji. 
[10:24] Ni ga učenca nad učenika, tudi ne hlapca nad gospodarja svojega. 
[10:25] Dovolj je učencu, da postane kakor učenik njegov, in hlapec kakor gospodar njegov. Če so pa hišnega gospodarja imenovali Belzebula, koliko bolj domače njegove? 
[10:26] Ne bojte se jih torej: ker nič ni prikritega, kar se ne bo odkrilo; in skrivnega, kar se ne bo zvedelo. 
[10:27] Kar vam pravim v temi, povejte na svetlem; in kar slišite na uho, razglasite s streh. 
[10:28] In ne bojte se tistih, kteri ubijajo telo, duše pa ne morejo ubiti; bojte se pa marveč tistega, kteri more dušo in telo pogubiti v peklu. 
[10:29] Mar se ne prodajata dva vrabca za vinar? pa ne eden od nju ne pade na zemljo brez očeta vašega. 
[10:30] Vam so pa tudi lasjé na glavi vsi prešteti. 
[10:31] Ne bojte se torej; vi ste bolji od mnogo vrabcev. 
[10:32] Vsak torej, kdor spozná mene pred ljudmí, spoznal bom tudi jaz njega pred očetom svojim, ki je na nebesih. 
[10:33] Kdorkoli pa zatají mene pred ljudmí, zatajil bom tudi jaz njega pred očetom svojim, ki je na nebesih. 
[10:34] Ne mislite, da sem prišel, da prinesem mir na zemljo; nisem prišel, da prinesem mir, nego meč. 
[10:35] Kajti prišel sem, da ločim človeka od očeta njegovega, in hčer od matere njene, in nèvesto od tašče njene. 
[10:36] In sovražniki človeku bodo domačini njegovi. 
[10:37] Kdor ljubi očeta ali mater bolj nego mene, ni mene vreden; in kdor ljubi sina ali hčer bolj nego mene, ni mene vreden; 
[10:38] In kdor ne vzeme križa svojega, in gre za menoj, ni mene vreden. 
[10:39] Kdor življenje svoje najde, izgubil ga bo; in kdor življenje svoje izgubí za voljo mene, našel ga bo. 
[10:40] Kdor sprejema vas, sprejema mene; in kdor sprejema mene, sprejema tistega, kteri me je poslal. 
[10:41] Kdor sprejema preroka v ime preroka, prejel bo preroško plačilo; in kdor sprejema pravičnega v ime pravičnega, prejel bo plačilo pravičnega. 
[10:42] In če kdo napojí enega od teh malih samo s kupico studenčnice v ime učenca, resnično vam pravim, ne bo izgubil plačila svojega. 
[11:1] In zgodí se, ko je nehal Jezus dvanajsterim učencem svojim naročati, odide odtod, da uči in oznanjuje po njih mestih. 
[11:2] Slišavši pa Janez v ječi Kristusova dela, pošlje dva svojih učencev, 
[11:3] Ter mu reče: Si li ti tisti, ki ima priti, ali naj čakamo drugega? 
[11:4] In Jezus odgovorí in jima reče: Pojdita, in sporočita Janezu, kar slišita in vidita. 
[11:5] Slepci spregledujejo, in hromi hodijo; gobavci se očiščajo, in gluhi slišijo; mrtvi vstajajo, in ubogim se oznanjuje evangelj: 
[11:6] In blagor mu, kdor se od mene ne pohujša. 
[11:7] In ko ta dva odideta, začne Jezus ljudstvu o Janezu govoriti: Kaj ste izšli v puščavo, da vidite? Trst, ki ga veter maje? 
[11:8] Ali kaj ste izšli, da vidite? Človeka oblečenega v mehka oblačila? Glej, kteri nosijo mehka oblačila, tisti so po kraljevih dvorih. 
[11:9] Ali kaj ste izšli, da vidite? Preroka? Dà, pravim vam, in več ko preroka. 
[11:10] Kajti ta je, za kogar je pisano: "Glej, jaz pošiljam angelja svojega pred obličjem tvojim, kteri bo pripravil pot tvojo pred teboj." 
[11:11] Resnično vam pravim: Ni vstal izmed tistih, kteri so rojeni od žen, veči od Janeza Krstnika; kdor je pa v nebeškem kraljestvu najmanji, veči je od njega. 
[11:12] Od dnî Janeza Krstnika doslej se pa nebeško kraljestvo s silo jemlje; in tisti, kteri ga s silo jemljó, pridobivajo ga. 
[11:13] Kajti vsi preroki in postava so prerokovali do Janeza. 
[11:14] In če hočete verovati, on je Elija, kteri ima priti. 
[11:15] Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[11:16] Komu bom pa primeril ta rod? Podoben je otrokom, kteri po ulicah posedajo, in tovarišem svojim vpijejo, 
[11:17] In pravijo: Piskali smo vam, in niste plesali; tarnali smo, in niste jokali. 
[11:18] Kajti prišel je Janez, in ne jé in ne pije, pa pravijo: Hudiča ima! 
[11:19] Prišel je sin človečji, in jé in pije, pa pravijo: Glej človeka požeruha in pijanca, prijatelja mitarjev in grešnikov! In modrost so opravičil' nje otroci. 
[11:20] Tedaj začne Jezus ponošati mestom, v kterih se je zgodilo največ njegovih čudežev, ker se niso spokorila. 
[11:21] Gorjé ti, Korazim! Gorjé ti Betsajda! Kajti ko bi se bili v Tiru in Sidonu zgodili čudeži, ki so se zgodili v vama, bila bi se davno v žaklji in pepelu spokorila. 
[11:22] Ali pravim vam: Tiru in Sidonu bo v dan sodbe laže nego vama. 
[11:23] In ti, Kapernaum! ki si se do neba povzdignil, zagnan boš noter do pekla; kajti ko bi se bili v Sodomi zgodili čudeži, ki so se zgodili v tebi, prebila bi bila do današnjega dne. 
[11:24] Ali pravim vam, da bo Sodomskej zemlji v dan sodbe laže, nego tebi. 
[11:25] V ta čas odgovorí Jezus in reče: Zahvaljujem ti, oče! gospodar neba in zemlje, da si to prikril modrim in razumnim, in si je razodel nedoraslim. 
[11:26] Dà, Oče! ker tako je bila volja tvoja. 
[11:27] Vse mi je izročil oče moj: in nikdor ne pozna sina razen oče; in tudi očeta ne pozna nikdor, razen sin, in komurkoli če sin razodeti. 
[11:28] Pridite k meni vsi, kteri se trudite in ste otovorjeni, in jaz vas bom upokojil. 
[11:29] Vzemite jarem moj na se, in naučite se od mene, ker sem krotek in pokoren s srcem: in našli boste pokoj dušam svojim. 
[11:30] Kajti jarem moj je blag, in breme moje je lahko. 
[12:1] V tem času je šel Jezus v soboto skozi setve; učenci njegovi pa postanejo lačni, in začnó klasje trgati in jesti. 
[12:2] Ko pa Farizeji to vidijo, rekó mu: "Glej, učenci tvoji delajo, kar se v soboto ne sme delati. 
[12:3] On jim pa reče: Niste li brali, kaj je storil David, ko se je ulakotil on in kteri so bili ž njim? 
[12:4] Kako je šel v hišo Božjo in je snedel postavljene kruhe, kterih ni smel nihče jesti, razen edini duhovni? 
[12:5] Ali niste li brali v postavi, da skrunijo v soboto duhovni v tempeljnu soboto, in niso krivi? 
[12:6] Pravim vam pa, da je tu veči od tempeljna. 
[12:7] Ko bi pa vedeli, kaj se pravi: "Milosti hočem, in ne darú," ne bi obsojevali nedolžnih. 
[12:8] Kajti sin človečji je gospodar tudi sobote. 
[12:9] In odide odtod, in pride v njih shajališče. 
[12:10] In glej, bil je tu človek, kteri je imel suho roko. In vprašajo ga, govoreč: Ali se sme v soboto zdraviti? da bi ga zatožili. 
[12:11] On jim pa reče: Kdo med vami je človek, kteri ima eno ovco, in če mu ta pade v soboto v jamo, da je ne bo zgrabil in izvlekel? 
[12:12] In koliko bolji je človek od ovce? Zatorej se sme v soboto dobro delati. 
[12:13] Tedaj reče človeku: Stegni roko svojo! Pa stegne, in zdrava je bila kakor druga. 
[12:14] Farizeji pa izidejo in se posvetujejo za-nj, kako bi ga pogubili. 
[12:15] Jezus pa zvé, in odide odtod. In za njim je šlo mnogo ljudstva, in uzdravi jih vse. 
[12:16] In zapretí jim, naj ga ne razglasé, 
[12:17] Da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po preroku Izaiji, kteri pravi: 
[12:18] "Glej, hlapec moj, ki sem ga izvolil; ljubljeni moj, ki je duši mojej po volji: duh svoj bom položil na-nj, in oznanjeval bo sodbo narodom. 
[12:19] Ne bo se prepiral, ne vpil; in nikdor ne bo slišal glasú njegovega po ulicah. 
[12:20] Nalomljenega trsta ne bo prelomil, in vnetega lanú ne bo pogasil, dokler ne pridobí sodbi zmage. 
[12:21] In v ime njegovo bodo zaupali narodi." 
[12:22] Tedaj mu pripeljejo obsedenca, kteri je bil slep in mutast. In uzdravi ga, da je slepec in mutec govoril in videl. 
[12:23] In vse ljudstvo se je zavzemalo, govoreč: Ali ni ta sin Davidov? 
[12:24] Slišavši pa to Farizeji, rekó: Ta ne izganja hudičev, razen z Belzebulom poglavarjem hudičev. 
[12:25] Jezus je pa vedel njih misli, in reče jim: Vsako kraljestvo, ktero se je samo zoper sebe razdvojilo, opustelo bo; in vsako mesto ali dom, kteri se je sam zoper sebe razdvojil, ne bo obstal. 
[12:26] In če satan izganja satana, razdvojil se je sam zoper sebe: kako bo terej obstalo kraljestvo njegovo? 
[12:27] In če jaz z Belzebulom izganjam hudiče, s čegavo pomočjo izganjajo sinovi vaši? Za to vam bodo oni sodniki. 
[12:28] Če pa jaz s pomočjo Duha Božjega izganjam hudiče, prišlo je torej k vam kraljestvo Božje. 
[12:29] Ali kako more kdo močnemu priti v hišo in mu pohištvo pobrati, če močnega poprej ne zveže? in tedaj bo okradel hišo njegovo. 
[12:30] Kdor ni z menoj, proti meni je; in kdor z menoj ne zbira, razsiplje. 
[12:31] Za to vam pravim: Vsak greh in vsaka kletvina se bo odpustila ljudém; kletvina zoper Duhá se pa ne bo odpustila ljudém. 
[12:32] In če reče kdo besedo zoper sina človečjega, odpustilo mu se bo; kdor pa reče zoper svetega Duha, ne bo mu se odpustilo, ne v tem veku ne v prihodnjem. 
[12:33] Ali vsadite dobro drevo, in sad njegov bo dober; ali vsadite slabo drevo, in sad njegov bo slab: kajti drevo se pozná po sadu. 
[12:34] Gadja zalega! kako morete dobro govoriti, ko ste hudobni? kajti usta govoré od preobilnosti srca. 
[12:35] Dober človek prinaša iz dobrega zaklada srca dobro; in hudoben človek prinaša iz hudobnega zaklada hudobno. 
[12:36] Pravim vam pa, da za vsako prazno besedo, kterokoli rekó ljudjé, dali bodo za njo odgovor v dan sodbe. 
[12:37] Kajti s svojimi besedami se boš opravičil, in s svojimi besedami se boš obsodil. 
[12:38] Tedaj mu odgovoré nekteri od pismarjev in Farizejev in rekó: Učenik! znamenje hočemo od tebe videti. 
[12:39] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Hudobni in prešestni rod išče znamenja; ali ne bo mu se dalo znamenje, razen znamenje preroka Jonata. 
[12:40] Kakor je bil namreč Jona v kitovem trebuhu tri dní in tri nočí, tako bo sin človečji v srcu zemlje tri dní in tri nočí. 
[12:41] Možjé Ninivljani bodo vstali na sodbo s tem rodom, in obsodili ga bodo; kajti spokorili so se po pridigi Jonata; in glej, tu je veči od Jonata. 
[12:42] Južna kraljica bo vstala na sodbo s tem rodom, in obsodila ga bo; kajti prišla je od kraja sveta, da sliši Solomonovo modrost; in glej, tu je veči od Solomona. 
[12:43] Izšedši pa duh nečisti iz človeka, hodi po suhih krajih, in išče pokoja; in ne najde ga. 
[12:44] Tedaj reče: Vrnil se bom v dom svoj, odkoder sem izšel. Ter pride, in najde praznega, očejenega in olepšanega. 
[12:45] Tedaj odide in vzeme s seboj sedem drugih duhov, hujih od sebe, ter vnidejo, in tu prebivajo: in poslednje bo temu človeku huje od prvega. Tako bo tudi temu hudobnemu rodu. 
[12:46] Ko je pa še ljudstvu govoril, glej, mati njegova in bratje njegovi so stali zunaj, in radi bi bili ž njim govorili. 
[12:47] In nekdo mu reče: Glej, mati tvoja in bratje tvoji stojé zunaj, in radi bi s teboj govorili. 
[12:48] On pa odgovorí, in reče tistemu, ki mu je povedal: Kdo je mati moja? in kdo so bratje moji? 
[12:49] In stegnivši roko svojo na učence svoje, reče: Glej, mati moja in bratje moji! 
[12:50] Kajti kdorkoli izpolni voljo očeta mojega, ki je na nebesih, on je brat moj in sestra in mati. 
[13:1] Tisti dan je pa izšel Jezus iz hiše, in sedel je pri morji. 
[13:2] In zbere se pri njem mnogo naroda, toliko, da stopi v ladjo in sede; in vse ljudstvo je stalo na bregu. 
[13:3] In pripoveda jim v prilikah mnogo, govoreč: Glej, izšel je sejalec sejat. 
[13:4] In ko je sejal, padlo je nekaj zrnja poleg ceste; in priletele so tice in so ga pozobale. 
[13:5] Drugo je pa padlo na skalnata tla, kjer ni imelo mnogo zemlje; in precej je pognalo, ker ni imelo globoke zemlje. 
[13:6] Ko je pa vzšlo solnce, ovenelo je; in ker ni imelo korenine, usahnilo je. 
[13:7] Drugo je pa padlo v trnje; in trnje je zraslo in ga udušilo. 
[13:8] Drugo je pa padlo na dobro zemljo, in dajalo je sad, nekaj po sto, nekaj pa po šestdeset, a nekaj po trideset. 
[13:9] Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[13:10] Pa pristopijo učenci in mu rekó: Za kaj jim v prilikah govoriš? 
[13:11] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Vam je dano, da spoznate skrivnosti nebeškega kraljestva, njim pa ni dano. 
[13:12] Kajti kdor ima, dalo mu se bo, in preveč mu bo; kdor pa nima, odvzelo mu se bo tudi to, kar ima. 
[13:13] Za to vam govorim v prilikah, ker tisti, kteri vidijo, ne vidijo, in tisti, kteri slišijo, ne slišijo, in ne umejo. 
[13:14] In na njih se izpolnjuje prerokovanje Izaija, ktero pravi: "S sluhom boste slišali, in ne boste umeli; in z očmi boste gledali, in ne boste videli. 
[13:15] Kajti temu ljudstvu je srce okamenelo, in z ušesi težko slišijo, in očí svoje so zatisnili: da ne bi kedaj z očmi videli, in z ušesi slišali, in s srcem umeli in se spreobrnili, in bi jih ozdravil." 
[13:16] Blagor pa vašim očém, da vidijo, in vašim ušesom, da slišijo. 
[13:17] Kajti resnično vam pravim, da so mnogi preroki in pravični želeli videti, kar vi vidite, in niso videli; in slišati, kar vi slišite, in niso slišali. 
[13:18] Čujte torej vi priliko o sejalcu! 
[13:19] Vsakemu, kdor besedo o kraljestvu sliši, pa je ne ume, pride hudoba, in ukrade, kar je posejano v srcu njegovem; ta je, ki je posejan poleg ceste. 
[13:20] Ki je pa posejan na skalnatih tléh, ta je, kdor besedo sliši in jo precej z veseljem sprejema; 
[13:21] Ali nima korenine v sebi, nego je nestanoviten. Ko pa nastane stiska ali preganjanje za voljo besede, pohujšuje se precej. 
[13:22] Ki je pa posejan v trnji, ta je, kdor besedo sliši; ali skrb tega svetá in ničemurnost bogastva uduší besedo, in brez sadú ostane. 
[13:23] Ki je pa posejan na dobro zemljo, ta je, kdor besedo sliši in umé; kdor torej rodí sad, in donaša nekteri po sto, nekteri pa po šestdeset, a nekteri po trideset. 
[13:24] Predloží jim drugo priliko, govoreč: Nebeško kraljestvo je podobno človeku, kteri je posejal dobro seme na njivi svojej. 
[13:25] Ko so pa ljudjé spali, prišel je njegov sovražnik, in posejal je kukolj po pšenici, in odšel. 
[13:26] Ko je pa zrastla trava in je donesla sad, pokaže se tudi kukolj. 
[13:27] Pa pridejo hišnega gospodarja hlapci in mu rekó: Gospod! nisi li dobrega semena posejal na svojej njivi? Odkod se je pa vzel kukolj? 
[13:28] On jim pa reče: Sovražnik človek je to storil. Hlapci mu pa rekó: Hočeš li, da gremo in ga izplevemo? 
[13:29] On pa reče: Ne! da ne bi kedaj, trgaje kukolj, izrovali ž njim vred pšenice. 
[13:30] Pustite, naj raste oboje skupaj do žetve; in v čas žetve porečem koscem: Poberite najprej kukolj, in povežite ga v snope, da ga sežgem; pšenico pa spravite v žitnico mojo. 
[13:31] Predloží jim drugo priliko, govoreč: Nebeško kraljestvo je podobno gorušičnemu zrnu, ktero je človek vzel, in posejal na njivi svojej, 
[13:32] Ktero je res najdrobneje od vseh semen: kedar pa zraste, veče je od zelišč, in postane drevo, da prileté tice nebeške in se nastanjujejo po vejah njegovih. 
[13:33] Pové jim drugo priliko: Nebeško kraljestvo je podobno kvasu, kterega je žena vzela in primesila trem mericam moke, dokler se vse ne skvasi. 
[13:34] Vse to je govoril Jezus ljudém v prilikah, in brez prilike jim ni govoril; 
[13:35] Da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po preroku, kteri pravi: "V prilikah bom odprl usta svoja; pripovedal bom skrivnosti od začetka sveta." 
[13:36] Tedaj razpustí Jezus ljudstvo, in pride domú. Pa pristopijo k njemu učenci njegovi, govoreč: Razloži nam priliko o kukolji na njivi. 
[13:37] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Sejalec dobrega semena je sin človečji. 
[13:38] Njiva je pa svet; a dobro seme, ti so sinovi kraljestva; kukolj so pa sinovi hudobije. 
[13:39] Sovražnik, kteri ga je posejal, je hudič; žetev je pa konec svetá; a kosci so angelji. 
[13:40] Kakor se torej kukolj pobira, in v ognji sežiga, tako bo na koncu tega sveta. 
[13:41] Sin človečji bo poslal angelje svoje, in pobrali bodo vsa puhujšanja iz kraljestva njegovega in tiste, kteri delajo krivico, 
[13:42] In vrgli jih bodo v ognjeno peč: tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[13:43] Tedaj se bodo zasvetili pravični kakor solnce v svojega očeta kraljestvu. Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[13:44] Zopet je nebeško kraljestvo podobno skritemu zakladu na polji, kterega je človek našel in skril; in od veselja svojega je šel in je prodal vse, kar je imel, in kupil je tisto polje. 
[13:45] Zopet je nebeško kraljestvo podobno človeku kupcu, kteri je iskal lepih biserjev. 
[13:46] In ko je našel en dragocen biser, šel je, prodal vse, kar je imel, in ga je kupil. 
[13:47] Zopet je nebeško kraljestvo podobno saku, kteri se je vrgel v morje, in je zajel od vsakega rodú. 
[13:48] In ko se je napolnil, izvlekli so ga na kraj in so sedli, in kar je bilo dobro, pobrali so v posode, a kar je bilo slabo, vrgli so proč. 
[13:49] Tako bo na koncu sveta. Angelji pojdejo, in odločili bodo hudobne izsred pravičnih. 
[13:50] In vrgli jih bodo v ognjeno peč; tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[13:51] Jezus jim reče: Ste li vse to umeli? Rekó mu: Dà, Gospod! 
[13:52] On jim pa reče: Za to je vsak pismar, kteri se je naučil kraljestva nebeškega, podoben človeku gospodarju, kteri prinaša iz zaklada svojega novo in staro. 
[13:53] In zgodí se, ko Jezus te prilike končá, odide odtod. 
[13:54] In prišedši v domovino svojo, učil je v njih shajališči, da so se zavzemali in so govorili: Odkod temu ta modrost in močí? 
[13:55] Ali ni ta tesarjev sin? ali se ne imenuje mati njegova Marija, in bratje njegovi Jakob in Judej in Simon in Juda? 
[13:56] In niso li vse sestre njegove pri nas? Odkod torej temu vse to? 
[13:57] In pohujševali so se nad njim. Jezus jim pa reče: Prerok ni brez častí, razen v domovini svojej, in na domu svojem. 
[13:58] In ni storil ondej mnogo čudežev, za voljo njih nevere. 
[14:1] V tem času zasliši četrtnik Herod glas o Jezusu, 
[14:2] Ter reče hlapcem svojim: Ta je Janez Krstnik; on je vstal od mrtvih, in za to dela čudeže. 
[14:3] Kajti Herod je bil Janeza vjel in ga vklenil in posadil v ječo, za voljo Herodijade, svojega brata Filipa žene. 
[14:4] Kajti Janez mu je djal: Ni ti dovoljeno nje imeti. 
[14:5] In hotel ga je umoriti; ali zbal se je ljudstva, ker so ga imeli za preroka. 
[14:6] Ko je bil pa Herodovega rojstva dan, plesala je po sredi Herodijadina hči, in ugodila je Herodu. 
[14:7] Za to jej s prisego obreče dati, karkoli bi prosila. 
[14:8] Ona pa, naučena od matere svoje: Daj mi, reče, tu v skledi glavo Janeza Krstnika. 
[14:9] In kralju se užali. Pa za voljo prisege in gostov jej ukaže dati. 
[14:10] In pošlje, in odseka Janezu v ječi glavo. 
[14:11] Ter prinesó glavo njegovo v skledi, in dadó jo dekletu; in nese jo materi svojej. 
[14:12] In prišedši učenci njegovi, vzemó truplo in ga pokopljejo; ter pridejo in sporočé Jezusu. 
[14:13] In slišavši to Jezus, odrine odtod na ladji posebej na samoten kraj. In ko ljudstvo to sliši, odidejo peš za njim iz mest. 
[14:14] In Jezus izide in ugleda mnogo ljudstva; in zasmilijo mu se, ter uzdravi njih bolnike. 
[14:15] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, pristopijo k njemu učenci njegovi, govoreč: Kraj je samoten, in ura uže pozna; razpusti ljudstvo, da odidejo v vasí in si kupijo živeža. 
[14:16] Jezus jim pa reče: Ni jim treba oditi; dajte jim vi jesti. 
[14:17] Oni mu pa rekó: Nimamo več tu nego pet hlebov in dve ribi, 
[14:18] On pa reče: Prinesite jih sem! 
[14:19] Ter ukaže ljudstvu, naj sedejo po travi, in vzeme petere hlebe in tisti dve ribi, in pogledavši na nebo, blagoslovi; ter prelomi in dá hlebe učencem, učenci pa ljudstvu. 
[14:20] In jedli so vsi, in nasitili so se; in pobrali so ostanke koscev, dvanajst košev polnih. 
[14:21] Bilo jih je pa, kteri so jedli, kakih pet tisoči móž, brez žen in otrók. 
[14:22] In precej prisili Jezus učence svoje, naj stopijo v ladjo, in gredó naprej na drugo stran, dokler ne razpustí ljudstva. 
[14:23] In razpustivši ljudstvo, odide sam posebej na goro molit. Ko se je pa zvečerilo, bil je sam tu. 
[14:24] Ladja je bila pa uže sredi morja, in valovi so jo metali; kajti bil je veter nasproti. 
[14:25] O četrtej straži po noči pa odide Jezus k njim, hodé po morji. 
[14:26] In ko ga učenci ugledajo, da hodi po morji, ustrašijo se in rekó: Prikazen je! in od strahu zakričé. 
[14:27] Jezus jih pa precej ogovorí, in reče: Bodite srčni! Jaz sem; ne bojte se. 
[14:28] Peter mu pa odgovorí in reče: Gospod! če si ti, ukaži mi, naj pridem k tebi pò vodi. 
[14:29] On pa reče: Pridi! In stopivši Peter iz ladje, hodil je po vodi, da pride k Jezusu. 
[14:30] Ko pa vidi, da je veter močán, uplaši se; in ko se začne potapljati, zavpije, govoreč; Gospod, otmi me! 
[14:31] Jezus pa precej stegne roko in ga prime, ter mu reče: Maloverni! po kaj si dvomil? 
[14:32] In ko stopita v ladjo, veter utihne. 
[14:33] Tisti pa, ki so bili v ladji, pristopijo, ter mu se poklonijo, govoreč: Resnično si sin Božji! 
[14:34] In prepeljavši se, pridejo v zemljo Genezaretsko. 
[14:35] In ko ga tega kraja možjé spoznajo, pošljejo po vsej tistej okolici; in prinesó mu vse bolnike. 
[14:36] In prosili so ga, da bi se le robú obleke njegove dotaknili. In kterikoli so se dotaknili, ozdraveli so. 
[15:1] Tedaj pristopijo k Jezusu pismarji in Farizeji iz Jeruzalema, govoreč: 
[15:2] Za kaj prestopajo učenci tvoji izročilo starijih? Ker ne umivajo rok svojih, kedar jedó kruh. 
[15:3] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Za kaj prestopate tudi vi zapoved Božjo za voljo izročila svojega? 
[15:4] Bog namreč je zapovedal, in rekel: "Spoštuj očeta svojega, in mater;" in: "Kdor pa prekolne očeta ali mater, pogine naj s smrtjo." 
[15:5] Vi pa pravite: Če reče kdo očetu ali materi: Dar je, s čimer ti jaz pomorem, in če prav ne spoštuje očeta svojega ali matere svoje. 
[15:6] In zavrgli ste zapoved Božjo za voljo izročila svojega. 
[15:7] Hinavci! lepo je za vas prerokoval Izaija, govoreč: 
[15:8] "To ljudstvo mi se približuje z ustmi svojimi, in spoštuje me z ustnicami svojimi: srce njih je pa daleč od mene. 
[15:9] Ali zastonj me časté, učeč nauke, zapovedi človeške." 
[15:10] In poklicavši ljudsto, reče jim: Poslušajte in umejte! 
[15:11] Ne skruni človeka to, kar prihaja v usta; nego kar izhaja iz ust, to skruni človeka. 
[15:12] Tedaj pristopijo učenci njegovi in mu rekó: Véš li, da so se Farizeji, slišavši besedo, pohujšali? 
[15:13] On pa odgovorí in reče: Vsaka rastlina, ktere ni vsadil oče moj nebeški, izrovala se bo. 
[15:14] Pustite jih; oni so slepcem slepi vodniki. Če pa slepec slepca vodi, padla bosta oba v jamo. 
[15:15] Peter pa odgovorí in mu reče: Razloži nam to priliko! 
[15:16] Jezus pa reče: Ali ste še tudi vi nerazumni? 
[15:17] Ne umete li, da gre vse, kar prihaja v usta, v trebuh in se meče ven? 
[15:18] Kar pa izhaja iz ust, izhaja iz srca, in to skruni človeka. 
[15:19] Kajti iz srca izhajajo hudobne misli, poboji, prešestva, kurbarije, tatvine, krive priče, kletvine. 
[15:20] To je, kar človeka skruni; z neumitimi rokami pa jesti ne skruni človeka. 
[15:21] In Jezus izide odtod, in odide v Tirske in Sidonske predele. 
[15:22] In glej, žena Kananičanka izide iz teh krajev, ter zavpije in mu reče: Usmili se me, Gospod, sin Davidov! mojo hčer hudič zeló muči. 
[15:23] On jej pa ne odgovorí besede. In pristopivši učenci njegovi, prosili so ga, govoreč: Odpodi jo! ko kriči z nami. 
[15:24] On pa odgovorí in reče: Nisem poslan, razen k izgubljenim ovcam Izraelove hiše. 
[15:25] Ona pa pristopi, ter mu se pokloni, govoreč: Gospod, pomagaj mi! 
[15:26] On pa odgovorí in reče: Ni lepo, da se vzeme kruh otrokom in se vrže psom. 
[15:27] Ona pa reče: Dà, Gospod! ali tudi psi jedó od drobtin, ktere padajo z mize njih gospodarjev. 
[15:28] Tedaj odgovorí Jezus in jej reče: O žena, velika je vera tvoja! Zgodí naj ti se, kakor hočeš. In hčer njena je ozdravela od tega časa. 
[15:29] In Jezus odide odtod, in pride k morju Galilejskemu; in stopivši na goro, usede se. 
[15:30] In k njemu pride mnogo ljudî, kteri so imeli s seboj hrome, slepce, mutce, polomljene in mnogo drugih, ter jih položé k nogam Jezusovim; in uzdravi jih. 
[15:31] Da se ljudstvo začudi, ko je videlo, da mutci govoré, in so polomljeni zdravi, in hromi hodijo, in slepci vidijo. In hvalili so Boga Izraelskega. 
[15:32] Poklicavši pa Jezus učence svoje, reče: Ljudstvo mi se smili; ker uže tri dnî so pri meni, in nimajo kaj jesti. A lačnih jih ne čem odpraviti, da na poti ne omagajo. 
[15:33] Pa mu rekó učenci njegovi: Odkod bi mi vzeli v puščavi toliko kruha, da bi toliko ljudstva nasitili? 
[15:34] In reče jim Jezus: Koliko hlebov imate? Oni pa rekó: Sedem, in malo ribic. 
[15:35] Pa ukaže ljudstvu, naj sedejo po tléh. 
[15:36] In vzeme sedmere hlebe in ribe, in blagoslovi, ter prelomi in dá učencem svojim, učenci pa ljudstvu. 
[15:37] In jedli so vsi, in nasitili so se; in pobrali so ostanke koscev, sedem košev polnih. 
[15:38] Bilo jih je pa, kteri so jedli, štiri tisoči, brez žen in otrok. 
[15:39] Razpustivši pa ljudstvo, stopi v ladjo, in pride v Magdalske predele. 
[16:1] Pa pristopijo k njemu Farizeji in Saduceji, in izkušajoč ga, zaprosijo ga, naj jim pokaže znamenje z neba. 
[16:2] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Ko se zvečeri, pravite: Vedro bo! kajti žarí se nebo. 
[16:3] In zjutraj: Danes bo veter! kajti nebo se žarí in oblačí. Hinavci! nebeško lice znate razločevati, znamenj časov pa ne morete? 
[16:4] Hudobni in prešestni rod išče znamenja; ali ne bo mu se dalo znamenje, razen znamenje preroka Jonata. Ter jih pustí, in odide. 
[16:5] In ko se prepeljejo učenci njegovi na drugo stran, pozabili so vzeti kruha. 
[16:6] Jezus jim pa reče: Glejte, in varujte se kvasu Farizejskega in Saducejskega! 
[16:7] Oni so pa sami pri sebi mislili in djali: Kruha nismo vzeli. 
[16:8] Ko pa Jezus to spazi, reče jim: Kaj mislite v sebi, maloverni! da niste vzeli kruha? 
[16:9] Ali še ne umete in se ne spominjate petih hlebov petim tisočim, in koliko košev ste nabrali? 
[16:10] Tudi ne sedmih hlebov štirim tisočim, in koliko košev ste nabrali? 
[16:11] Kako ne umete, da nisem rekel za kruh, da se varujte Farizejskega in Saducejskega kvasú? 
[16:12] Tedaj spoznajo, da ni rekel, naj se varujejo kruhovega kvasú, nego Farizejskega in Saducejskega uka. 
[16:13] Ko je pa prišel Jezus v predele Cezareje Filipove, vpraševal je učence svoje, govoreč: Kdo pravijo ljudjé, da sem jaz, sin človečji? 
[16:14] Oni pa rekó: Nekteri, da si Janez Krstnik; drugi pa, da si Elija; a drugi, da si Jeremija, ali eden od prerokov. 
[16:15] Reče jim: Kdo pa pravite vi, da sem jaz? 
[16:16] Simon Peter pa odgovorí in reče: Ti si Kristus, sin živega Boga. 
[16:17] In Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Blagor ti, Simon, Jonov sin! ker meso in kri ti nista tega razodela, nego oče moj, ki je na nebesih. 
[16:18] Pravim pa tudi jaz tebi, da si ti Peter; in na tej skali bom sezidal cerkev svojo, in vrata peklenska je ne bodo premagala. 
[16:19] In dal ti bom ključe nebeškega kraljestva: in karkoli zvežeš na zemlji, zvezano bo na nebesih; in karkoli razvežeš na zemlji, razvezano bo na nebesih. 
[16:20] Tedaj zapretí učencem svojim, naj nikomur ne povedó, da je on Jezus Kristus. 
[16:21] Odtlej je jel Jezus učencem svojim praviti, da mora v Jeruzalem iti, in mnogo pretrpeti od starešin in vélikih duhovnov in pismarjev, in umorjen biti, in tretji dan od smrti vstati. 
[16:22] In Peter ga vzeme k sebi in ga začne odvračati, govoreč: Smili se sam sebi, Gospod! To ti se nima zgoditi. 
[16:23] On se pa obrne, in reče Petru: Poberi se od mene, satan! Za pohujšanje si mi; ker ne misliš, kar je Božje, nego kar je človeško. 
[16:24] Tedaj reče Jezus učencem svojim: Če kdo hoče za menoj iti, zatají naj samega sebe, in vzeme križ svoj, in gre za menoj. 
[16:25] Kajti kdor hoče življenje svoje ohraniti, izgubil ga bo; kdor pa izgubi življenje svoje za voljo mene, našel ga bo. 
[16:26] Kaj namreč pomaga človeku, če ves svet pridobi, duši svojej pa škoduje? Ali kaj bo dal človek v zameno za dušo svojo? 
[16:27] Kajti sin človečji ima priti v slavi očeta svojega z angelji svojimi; in tedaj bo povrnil vsakemu po delih njegovih. 
[16:28] Resnično vam pravim: Nekteri so med temi, ki stojé tu, kteri ne bodo okusili smrti, dokler ne vidijo sina človečjega, da gre v kraljestvu svojem. 
[17:1] In črez šest dnî vzeme Jezus Petra in Jakoba in Janeza brata njegovega, ter jih odpelje same posebej na visoko goro, 
[17:2] In se pred njimi premení. In obraz njegov se zasveti kakor solnce, a oblačila njegova postanejo bela kakor luč. 
[17:3] In glej, prikažeta jim se Mojzes in Elija, ter sta ž njim govorila. 
[17:4] Peter pa odgovorí in reče Jezusu: Gospod! dobro nam je tu biti. Če hočeš, naredili bomo tu tri šatore, tebi enega, in Mojzesu enega, in Eliju enega. 
[17:5] Ko je še govoril, glej, zakrije jih svetel oblak; in glej, glas iz oblaka, govoreč: Ta je sin moj ljubljeni, kteri je po mojej volji; njega poslušajte. 
[17:6] In slišavši to učenci, padejo na obraz svoj in se zeló uplašijo. 
[17:7] In pristopivši Jezus, dotakne se jih, in reče: Vstanite, in ne bojte se! 
[17:8] Ko so pa oči svoje povzdignili, niso nikogar videli, razen Jezusa samega. 
[17:9] In ko so stopali z gore, zapové jim Jezus, govoreč: Ne povejte nikomur, kar ste videli, dokler sin človečji ne vstane od mrtvih. 
[17:10] In učenci njegovi ga vprašajo, govoreč: Kaj pravijo torej pismarji, da mora Elija poprej priti? 
[17:11] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Elija bo prišel res poprej in bo vse uravnal; 
[17:12] Ali pravim vam, da je uže Elija prišel in ga niso poznali, nego storili so ž njim, kar so hoteli: tako bo tudi sin človečji od njih trpel. 
[17:13] Tedaj spoznajo učenci, da jim je rekel to za Janeza Krstnika. 
[17:14] In ko pridejo k ljudstvu, pristopi k njemu človek in pred njim poklekne, 
[17:15] In reče: Gospod, usmili se sina mojega! ker je mesečen in grozno trpí. Velikokrat namreč pade v ogenj, in velikokrat v vodo. 
[17:16] In pripeljal sem ga učencem tvojim; in niso ga mogli uzdraviti. 
[17:17] Jezus pa odgovorí in reče: O neverni in popačeni rod! doklej bom z vami? doklej vas bom trpel? Pripeljite mi ga sém! 
[17:18] In Jezus mu zapretí; in hudič izide iž njega, in mladenič je ozdravel od tega časa. 
[17:19] Tedaj pristopijo učenci k Jezusu in mu rekó na samem: Za kaj ga nismo mogli mi izgnati? 
[17:20] Jezus jim pa reče: Za voljo nevere vaše. Kajti resnično vam pravim: Če imate za gorušično zrno vere, porečete tej gori: Premakni se odtod tje! in premaknila se bo; in nič vam ne bo nemogoče. 
[17:21] Ta rod pa ne izide, razen z molitvijo in postom. 
[17:22] Ko so pa hodili po Galileji, reče jim Jezus: Sin človečji bo izdan ljudém v roke; 
[17:23] In umorili ga bodo, in tretji dan bo vstal od smrti. In bili so zeló žalostni. 
[17:24] Ko pa pridejo v Kapernaum, pristopijo k Petru tisti, ki so pobirali davek, in rekó: Ali vaš učenik ne plačuje davka? 
[17:25] Reče: Dà. In ko vnide v hišo, prehití ga Jezus, govoreč: Kaj ti se zdí, Simon? Od kterih pobirajo zemeljski kralji colnino ali davek? od sinov svojih, ali od tujcev? 
[17:26] Peter mu pravi: Od tujcev. Jezus mu reče: Torej so sinovi svobodni. 
[17:27] Da jih pa ne pohujšamo, pojdi k morju in nastavi trnik; in prvo ribo, ki se vjame, vzemi in jej odpri usta, ni našel boš groš: vzemi ga, in daj jim za me in za se. 
[18:1] V tem času pristopijo učenci k Jezusu, govoreč: Kdo je torej v nebeškem kraljestvu največi? 
[18:2] In Jezus pokliče otroka in ga postavi sred njih, 
[18:3] In reče: Resnično vam pravim, če se ne spreobrnete in ne postanete kakor otroci, ne boste prišli v nebeško kraljestvo. 
[18:4] Kdor se torej poniža kakor ta otrok, ta bo v nebeškem kraljestvu največi. 
[18:5] In kdorkoli sprejme enega takošnega otroka v ime moje, sprejema mene. 
[18:6] Kdor pa pohujša enega teh malih, ki verujejo v mé, bilo bi mu bolje, da bi mu se obesil mlinsk kamen na vrat, in bi se utopil v morskej globočini. 
[18:7] Gorjé svetu za voljo pohujšanja! Pohujšanje sicer mora priti; ali gorjé tistemu človeku, po kterem pohujšanje pride. 
[18:8] Če te pa roka tvoja ali noga tvoja pohujšuje, odseci ji, in vrzi od sebe; bolje ti je hromemu ali brez roke priti v življenje, nego dve roki in dve nogi imeti, in vrženemu biti v večni ogenj. 
[18:9] In če te pohujšuje oko tvoje, izderi ga, in vrzi od sebe; bolje ti je z enim očesom priti v življenje, nego dve očesi imeti, in vrženemu biti v peklenski ogenj. 
[18:10] Glejte, da ne boste prezirali enega teh malih; kajti resnično vam pravim, da gledajo njih angelji na nebesih vsakedaj obličje očeta mojega, ki je na nebesih. 
[18:11] Kajti sin človečji je prišel, da zveliča, kar se je izgubilo. 
[18:12] Kaj se vam zdí? Če ima en človek sto ovâc, in ena od njih zajde: ne popustí li devet in devetdeseterih, pa gre na gore, in išče tiste, ki je zašla? 
[18:13] In če se zgodi, da jo najde, resnično vam pravim, da se nad njo bolj veselí, nego nad devet in devetdeseterimi, ktere niso zašle. 
[18:14] Tako ni volja očeta vašega, ki je na nebesih, da bi poginil eden od teh malih. 
[18:15] Če se pa pregreší brat tvoj zoper tebe, pojdi, in ograjaj ga med seboj in njim samim; če te posluša, pridobil si brata svojega. 
[18:16] Če pa ne posluša, vzemi seboj še enega ali dva, da ostane vsaka beseda v ustih dveh ali treh prič. 
[18:17] Če jih pa ne posluša, povej cerkvi; če pa tudi cerkve ne posluša, naj ti bo ko pogan in mitar. 
[18:18] Resnično vam pravim: Karkoli zvežete na zemlji, zvezano bo na nebesih; in karkoli razvežete na zemlji, razvezano bo na nebesih. 
[18:19] Zopet vam pravim, da če se dva od vas zedinita na zemlji o čemerkoli, kar prosita, zgodilo jima se bo od očeta mojega, ki je na nebesih. 
[18:20] Kajti, kjer sta dva ali trije zbrani v ime moje, tam sem jaz sredi njih. 
[18:21] Tedaj pristopi k njemu Peter in reče: Gospod! kolikokrat se bo pregrešil brat moj zoper mene in mu bom odpustil? do sedemkrat? 
[18:22] Jezus mu reče: Ne pravim ti, do sedemkrat, nego do sedemdesetkrat sedemkrat. 
[18:23] Za to je nebeško kraljestvo podobno človeku kralju, kteri je hotel s hlapci svojimi račun napraviti. 
[18:24] In ko je jel računiti, pripeljejo mu enega, kteri je bil dolžen tisoč talentov. 
[18:25] Ker pa ni imel, da bi plačal, ukaže gospodar njegov prodati njega, in ženo njegovo in otroke, in vse, kar je imel, in naj mu se plača. 
[18:26] Hlapec pa pade, ter mu se je poklanjal, govoreč: Gospod! potrpi me, in vse ti bom plačal. 
[18:27] Gospodarju se pa ta hlapec zasmili: in prizanese mu, in dolg mu odpustí. 
[18:28] Ko pa ta hlapec izide, najde enega svojih tovarišev, kteri mu je bil sto grošev dolžen; in zgrabivši ga, davil ga je, govoreč: Plačaj mi, kar si dolžen! 
[18:29] Tovariš njegov pa pade k nogam njegovim, ter ga je prosil, govoreč: Potrpi me, in vse ti bom plačal. 
[18:30] On pa ni hotel; nego odide in ga vrže v ječo, dokler ne plača dolga. 
[18:31] Videvši pa tovariši njegovi, kar se je zgodilo, užali jim se zeló; ter pridejo in povedó gospodarju svojemu vse, kar se je zgodilo. 
[18:32] Tedaj ga gospodar njegov pokliče in mu reče: Hudobni hlapec! odpustil sem ti ves tisti dolg, ker si me prosil. 
[18:33] Ali se nisi imel tudi ti tovariša svojega usmiliti, kakor sem se tudi jaz tebe usmilil? 
[18:34] In gospodar njegov se ujezí in ga izročí trinogom, dokler ne poplača vsega, kar mu je bil dolžen. 
[18:35] Tako bo storil tudi oče moj nebeški vam, če ne odpustite vsak bratu svojemu iz srca svojega njih pregreh. 
[19:1] In zgodí se, ko končá Jezus te besede, odide iz Galileje, in pride v predele Judejske onkraj Jordana. 
[19:2] In za njim je šlo mnogo ljudstva, in uzdravi jih tu. 
[19:3] Pa pristopijo k njemu Farizeji, izkušaje ga, in mu rekó: Je li dovoljeno človeku popustiti ženo svojo za voljo vsakega vzroka? 
[19:4] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Niste li brali, da ju je tiste, ki je v začetku ustvaril človeka, ustvaril moža in ženo? 
[19:5] In rekel: "Za to bo zapustil človek očeta in mater; in pridružil se bo ženi svojej, in dva bosta eno telo?" 
[19:6] Tako nista več dva nego eno telo. Kar je torej Bog združil, naj človek ne razdružuje. 
[19:7] Rekó mu: Za kaj je torej zapovedal Mojzes dati ločilno pismo, in pustiti jo? 
[19:8] Reče jim: Ker vam je Mojzes za voljo trdosrčnosti vaše dovolil popuščati žene svoje; v začetku pa ni bilo tako. 
[19:9] Pravim vam pa, da kdorkoli ženo svojo popustí razen za voljo kurbanja, in se oženi z drugo, prešestvuje; in kdor popuščeno vzeme, prešestvuje. 
[19:10] Rekó mu učenci njegovi: Če je tako človekova reč z ženo, ni se dobro ženiti. 
[19:11] On jim pa reče: Te besede ne zapopadajo vsi, nego kterim je dano. 
[19:12] Ker so skopljenci, kteri so se iz materinega telesa tako rodili; in so skopljenci, ktere so ljudjé skopili; in so skopljenci, kteri so se sami skopili, za voljo nebeškega kraljestva. Kdor more zapopasti, naj zapopade! 
[19:13] Tedaj prinesó k njemu otroke, naj položi na njih roke, in moli; učenci jim pa zabranijo. 
[19:14] Jezus pa reče: Pustite otročiče, in ne branite jim priti k meni; kajti takih je nebeško kraljestvo. 
[19:15] In položivši na njih roke, odide odtod. 
[19:16] In glej, eden pristopi in mu reče: Dobri učenik! kaj dobrega naj storim, da bom imel večno življenje? 
[19:17] On mu pa odgovorí: Kaj me imenuješ dobrega? Nikdor ni dober, razen eden, Bog. Če pa hočeš vniti v življenje, izpolni zapovedi. 
[19:18] Reče mu: Ktere? Jezus pa reče: Ne ubijaj, ne prešestvuj; ne kradi; ne pričaj po krivem; 
[19:19] Spoštuj očeta svojega in mater: in ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe. 
[19:20] Mladenič mu reče: Vse to sem izpolnil od mladosti svoje; česa mi je še treba? 
[19:21] Jezus mu reče: Če hočeš biti popoln, pojdi, prodaj premoženje svoje, in daj ubogim: in imel boš zaklad na nebu. Ter pridi, in pojdi za menoj! 
[19:22] Slišavši pa mladenič besedo, odide žalosten; kajti imel je mnogo premoženja. 
[19:23] Jezus pa reče učencem svojim: Resnično vam pravim, da težko bogatin vnide v nebeško kraljestvo. 
[19:24] Zopet vam pravim: Laže je priti kameli skozi igleno uho, nego bogatinu priti v kraljestvo Božje. 
[19:25] Slišavši pa to učenci njegovi, zavzemó se zeló, in rekó: Kdo se torej more zveličati? 
[19:26] Jezus pa pogleda va-nje in jim reče: Pri ljudéh je to nemogoče, ali pri Bogu je vse mogoče. 
[19:27] Tedaj odgovorí Peter in mu reče: Glej, mi smo zapustili vse in smo šli za teboj; kaj bo torej nam? 
[19:28] Jezus jim pa reče: Resnično vam pravim, da vi, ki ste šli za menoj, o drugem rojstvu, ko se bo usedel sin človečji na prestol svoje slave, sedli boste tudi vi na dvanajst prestolov, in sodili boste dvanajstere rodove Izraelove. 
[19:29] In vsak, kdor je zapustil hiše, ali brate, ali sestre, ali očeta, ali mater, ali ženo, ali otroke, ali njive, za voljo imena mojega, prejel bo stokrat več, in zadobil bo večno življenje. 
[19:30] A mnogi prvi bodo zadnji, in zadnji prvi. 
[20:1] Kajti nebeško kraljestvo je podobno človeku gospodarju, kteri je zjutraj zgodaj izšel, da najeme delalcev v vinograd svoj. 
[20:2] In pogodivši se z delalci po groši na dan, pošlje jih v vinograd svoj. 
[20:3] In ko izide okoli tretje ure, ugleda druge, da stojé na trgu brez dela. 
[20:4] In reče jim: Pojdite tudi vi v moj vinograd, in karkoli bo prav, dal vam bom. 
[20:5] Oni pa odidejo. Ko izide zopet o šestej in devetej uri, storí ravno tako. 
[20:6] Ko pa izide okoli enajste ure, najde druge, da stojé brez dela. In reče jim: Kaj stojite tu ves dan brez dela? 
[20:7] Rekó mu: Ker nas ni nihče najel. In velí jim: Pojdite tudi vi v moj vinograd, in karkoli bo prav, boste prejeli. 
[20:8] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, veli gospodar vinograda pristavniku svojemu: Pokliči delalce, in daj jim plačilo, počenši od zadnjih do prvih. 
[20:9] In prišedši tisti, kteri so bili najeti okoli enajste ure, prejmó po groši. 
[20:10] Ko pa pridejo prvi, mislijo, da bodo prejeli več; in tudi oni prejmó po groši. 
[20:11] Prejemši pa, godrnjali so nad gospodarjem, 
[20:12] Govoreč: Ti poslednji so delali eno uro, in naredil si jih enake nam, ki smo prenesli breme vsega dné in vročino. 
[20:13] On pa odgovorí in reče enemu od njih: Prijatelj! ne delam ti krivice. Ali se nisi pogodil z menoj po groši? 
[20:14] Vzemi svoje in pojdi! Hočem pa dati temu poslednjemu, kakor tudi tebi. 
[20:15] Ali mar ne smem jaz s svojim storiti, kar hočem? Je li oko tvoje hudobno, ker sem jaz dober? 
[20:16] Tako bodo zadnji prvi, in prvi zadnji; kajti mnogo je poklicanih, a malo izvoljenih. 
[20:17] In ko je šel Jezus v Jeruzalem, vzeme po poti dvanajstere učence na stran in jim reče: 
[20:18] Glej, v Jeruzalem gremo, in sin človečji bo izdan vélikim duhovnom in pismarjem; in obsodili ga bodo na smrt. 
[20:19] In izročili ga bodo poganom, naj ga zasmehujejo, in bičajo, in križajo; in tretji dan bo vstal od smrti. 
[20:20] Tedaj pristopi k njemu mati Zebedejevih sinov s svojima sinoma, ter mu se je poklanjala in ga nekaj prosila. 
[20:21] On ji pa reče: Kaj hočeš? Reče mu: Reci, naj sedeta ta dva moja sina, eden tebi na desno, in eden tebi na levo v kraljestvu tvojem. 
[20:22] Jezus pa odgovorí in reče: Ne vésta, kaj prosita. Moreta li piti kelih, ki ga bom jaz pil, in krstiti se s krstom, s kterim se jaz krstim? Rečeta mu: Moreva. 
[20:23] In reče jima: Kelih moj bosta torej pila, in s krstom, s kterim se jaz krstim, bosta se krstila; ali da bi sedla meni na desno in meni na levo, ne morem jaz dati, nego to se bo dalo tistim, kterim je pripravljeno od očeta mojega. 
[20:24] In slišavši to deseteri, ujezé se nad tema dvema bratoma. 
[20:25] Jezus jih pa pokliče in reče: Véste, da knezi narodov nad temi gospodujejo, in poglavarji jim vladajo. 
[20:26] Ne bo pa tako med vami: nego kdor hoče velik postati med vami, bodi vam služabnik; 
[20:27] In kdor hoče prvi biti med vami, bodi vam hlapec. 
[20:28] Kakor sin človečji ni prišel, da bi mu služili, nego da služi, in dá življenje svoje v odkup za mnoge. 
[20:29] In ko so šli iz Jerihe, šlo je za njim mnogo ljudstva. 
[20:30] In glej, dva slepca sta sedela kraj poti, in slišavši, da gre Jezus mimo, zakričita, govoreč: Usmili se naju, Gospod, sin Davidov! 
[20:31] Ljudstvo jima pa zapretí, naj umolkneta. Ona dva pa še bolj zavpijeta, govoreč: usmili se naju, gospod, sin Davidov! 
[20:32] In Jezus se ustavi in ju pokliče, ter reče: Kaj hočeta, da vama storím? 
[20:33] Rečeta mu: Gospod! da se nama očí odpró. 
[20:34] Jezusu se pa zasmilita, in dotakne se njunih očî. In precej so spregledale njune očí, in šla sta za njim. 
[21:1] In ko se približajo Jeruzalemu, in pridejo v Betfago k Oljskej gori, tedaj pošlje Jezus dva učenca, 
[21:2] In reče jima: Pojdita v vas, ki vama je nasproti; in precej bosta našla oslico privezano, in žrebe ž njo: odvežita ji, in pripeljita k meni. 
[21:3] In če vama kdo kaj reče, porečeta: Gospod ji potrebuje; in precej ji bo poslal. 
[21:4] Vse to se je pa zgodilo, da se izpolni, kar je rečeno po preroku, kteri pravi; 
[21:5] "Recite Sionskej hčeri: Glej, kralj tvoj gre k tebi, krotek, in sedí na oslici in žrebetu sinu oslice pod jarmom." 
[21:6] Učenca pa odideta in storita, kakor jima je Jezus ukazal. 
[21:7] In pripeljeta oslico in žrebe, ter položé na nji oblačila svoja in ga posadé na nji. 
[21:8] Mnogo ljudstva pa pogrne oblačila svoja po poti; a drugi so sekali veje z dreves, ter jih stlali po poti. 
[21:9] A ljudstvo, ktero je šlo pred njim in za njim, vpilo je, govoreč: Hosana sinu Davidovemu! Blagoslovljen, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem! Hosana na višavah! 
[21:10] In ko vnide v Jeruzalem, zgane se vse mesto, govoreč: Kdo je ta? 
[21:11] Ljudstvo je pa pravilo: Ta je prerok Jezus, iz Nazareta Galilejskega. 
[21:12] In Jezus vnide v tempelj Božji, in izžene vse, kteri so v tempeljnu prodajali in kupovali, in prevrne mize menjalcem, in klopí tistim, kteri so prodajali golobe. 
[21:13] In reče jim: Pisano je: "Dom moj se imenuje dom molitve;" a vi ste naredili iž njega "jamo razbojniško." 
[21:14] Pa pristopijo k njemu v tempeljnu slepci in hromi; in uzdravi jih. 
[21:15] Ko pa vidijo véliki duhovni in pismarji čudeže, ktere storí, in otroke, da vpijejo v tempeljnu, in govoré: Hosana sinu Davidovemu! razjezé se. 
[21:16] In rekó mu: Slišiš li, kaj ti pravijo? Jezus jim pa reče: Dà! Niste li nikoli brali: "Iz ust nedoraslih in dojencev napravil si hvalo?" 
[21:17] Ter jih pustí in odide iz mesta v Betanijo, in tu prenoči. 
[21:18] Zjutraj pa, vračajoč se v mesto, postane lačen. 
[21:19] In ugledavši kraj poti eno smokvo, pride k njej, in ničesar ne najde na njej, razen samo listje; in reče jej: Nikoli več naj ne bo na tebi sadú na vekomaj! In usahnila je smokva precej. 
[21:20] In videvši to učenci, začudijo se, govoreč: Kako precej je usahnila smokva! 
[21:21] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Resnično vam pravim: Če imate vero in ne dvomite, ne boste storili tega samo smokvi, nego če tudi rečete tej gori: Vzdigni se, in vrzi se v morje! zgodilo se bo. 
[21:22] In vse, karkoli v molitvi prosite, če verujete, boste prejeli. 
[21:23] In ko je prišel v tempelj in je učil, pristopijo k njemu véliki duhovni in ljudski pismarji, govoreč: S kakošno oblastjo delaš to? in kdo ti je dal to oblast? 
[21:24] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Vprašal vas bom tudi jaz eno besedo; in če mi jo poveste, povedal bom tudi jaz vam, s kakošno oblastjo to delam. 
[21:25] Odkod je bil krst Janezov? z neba, ali od ljudî? 
[21:26] Oni so pa sami s seboj premišljevali, govoreč: Če rečemo: Z neba, poreče nam: Za kaj mu torej niste verovali? Če pa rečemo: Od ljudî, bojimo se ljudstva; kajti vsi imajo Janeza za preroka. 
[21:27] Ter odgovoré Jezusu in rekó: Ne vémo. Tudi on jim reče: Tudi jaz vam ne povem, s kakošno oblastjo to delam. 
[21:28] Kaj se vam pa zdí? Imel je človek dva sina. In pristopivši k prvemu, reče: Sin, pojdi, delaj danes v vinogradu mojem. 
[21:29] On pa odgovorí in reče: Ne čem. Potem se pa razkesá, in odide. 
[21:30] In pristopivši k drugemu, reče ravno tako. On pa odgovorí in reče: Pojdem, gospod! In ni šel. 
[21:31] Kteri teh dveh je očetu voljo izpolnil? Rekó mu: Prvi. Jezus jim reče: Resnično vam pravim, da pojdejo mitarji in kurbe pred vami v kraljestvo Božje. 
[21:32] Kajti prišel je k vam Janez po poti pravice, in niste mu verjeli; mitarji in kurbe so mu pa verjeli, in ko ste vi to videli, niste se potem razkesali, da bi mu bili verjeli. 
[21:33] Čujte drugo priliko! Bil je neki človek gospodar, kteri je zasadil vinograd, in ga ogradil s plotom, in izkopal v njem klet, in sezidal stolp, ter ga izročil vinogradnikom, in odpotoval. 
[21:34] Ko se pa približa čas sadú, pošlje hlapce svoje k vinogradnikom, da prejmó sad njegov. 
[21:35] In vinogradniki zgrabijo hlapce, in enega pretepó, enega pa ubijejo, a enega kamenjajo. 
[21:36] Zopet pošlje druge hlapce, kterih je bilo več od prvih, in ž njimi storé ravno tako. 
[21:37] Potem pa pošlje k njim sina svojega, govoreč: Sina se bodo bali. 
[21:38] Ko pa ugledajo vinogradniki sina, rekó med seboj: Ta je dedič. Pridite, ubijmo ga, in prilastimo si dedovino njegovo! 
[21:39] Ter ga zgrabijo in vržejo ven iz vinograda, in ubijejo. 
[21:40] Kedar pride torej gospodar vinograda, kaj bo storil tem vinogradnikom? 
[21:41] Rekó mu: Hudobneže, njih bo hudo pogubil, in vinograd svoj bo izročil drugim vinogradnikom, kteri mu bodo dajali sad o svojem času. 
[21:42] Jezus jim reče: Niste li nikoli v pismu brali: "Kamen, kterega so zidarji zavrgli, on je postal glava oglu; od Gospoda se je zgodilo to, in čudno je v očéh naših." 
[21:43] Za to vam pravim, da se bo vam kraljestvo Božje odvzelo, in dalo se bo narodu, kteri donaša njegove sadove. 
[21:44] In kdor na ta kamen pade, razbil se bo; a na kogar on pade, razdrobil ga bo. 
[21:45] In slišavši véliki duhovni in Farizeji prilike njegove, spoznajo, da o njih govorí. 
[21:46] In gledali so, da bi ga vjeli; ali zbojé se ljudstva, ker so ga imeli za preroka. 
[22:1] In Jezus jim odgovorí in reče zopet v prilikah, govoreč: 
[22:2] Nebeško kraljestvo je podobno človeku kralju, kteri je napravil sinu svojemu svatovščino. 
[22:3] In poslal je služabnike svoje, naj pokličejo tiste, kteri so bili na svatovščino povabljeni; in niso hoteli priti. 
[22:4] Zopet je poslal druge služabnike, govoreč: Recite povabljencem: Glej, pojedinjo sem pripravil, junci moji in pitanci so poklani, in vse jo pripravljeno; pridite na svatovščino. 
[22:5] Oni pa niso marali, in odšli so, nekteri na polje svoje, nekteri pa po kupčiji svojej. 
[22:6] Drugi so pa služabnike njegove zgrabili, in zasramotili, in pobili. 
[22:7] Slišavši pa to kralj, razjezí se; ter pošlje vojske svoje, in tiste ubijalce pogubí, in njih mesto razdene. 
[22:8] Tedaj velí služabnikom svojim: Svatovščina je pripravljena, ali povabljeni niso bili vredni. 
[22:9] Pojdite torej na razpotja, in kogarkoli najdete, pokličite ga na svatovščino. 
[22:10] In ti služabniki odidejo na razpotja, in zberó vse, kterekoli najdejo, hudobne in dobre; in svatovščina se napolni z gosti. 
[22:11] Ko pa kralj izide, da pogleda goste, ugleda tu človeka, kteri ni bil oblečen v svatovsko obleko. 
[22:12] In reče mu: Prijatelj! kako si prišel sem, ko nimaš svatovske obleke? On pa mu umolkne. 
[22:13] Tedaj reče kralj služabnikom svojim: Zvežite mu noge in roke, ter ga vzemite in vrzite v najkrajnjo temo: tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[22:14] Kajti mnogo je poklicanih, ali malo izvoljenih. 
[22:15] Tedaj odidejo Farizeji in se posvetujejo, kako bi ga v besedi vjeli. 
[22:16] In pošljejo k njemu učence svoje s Herodovci, govoreč: Učenik! vémo, da si pravičen in pot Božjo v resnici učiš, in ti ni mar nobenega, ker ne gledaš ljudém na lice. 
[22:17] Povej nam torej, kaj ti se zdí? Ali se sme dati cesarju davek, ali ne? 
[22:18] Jezus pa spozná njih zvijačo, in reče: Kaj me izkušate, hinavci? 
[22:19] Pokažite mi davkovski denar. In oni mu prinesó denar. 
[22:20] In reče jim: Čegava je ta podoba in napis? 
[22:21] Rekó mu: Cesarjeva. Tedaj jim reče: Dajte torej, kar je cesarjevega, cesarju; in kar je Božjega, Bogu. 
[22:22] In slišavši to, začudijo se; ter ga pusté, in odidejo. 
[22:23] Tisti dan pristopijo k njemu Saduceji, kteri pravijo, da ni vstajanja, in vprašajo ga, 
[22:24] Govoreč: Učenik! Mojzes je rekel: Če kdo umre, in nima otrok, naj vzeme brat njegov ženo njegovo, in zbudí seme bratu svojemu. 
[22:25] Bilo je pa pri nas sedem bratov. In prvi se je oženil, in umrl; in ne imevši semena, zapustil je ženo svojo bratu svojemu. 
[22:26] Ravno tako tudi drugi, in tretji, noter do sedmega. 
[22:27] Na zadnje za vsemi je pa umrla tudi žena. 
[22:28] O vstajanji torej, čegava od sedmerih bo žena? kajti vsi so jo imeli. 
[22:29] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Motite se, ker ne znate ne pisma, ne močí Božje. 
[22:30] O vstajanji namreč se ne ženijo, in ne možé, nego so kakor angelji Božji na nebu. 
[22:31] Za vstajanje pa mrtvih, niste li brali, kar vam je rekel Bog, govoreč: 
[22:32] "Jaz sem Bog Abrahamov, in Bog Izakov, in Bog Jakobov?" Ni Bog Bog mrtvih, nego živih. 
[22:33] In slišavši to ljudstvo, strmeli so nad naukom njegovim. 
[22:34] Ko pa Farizeji slišijo, da je Saduceje osramotil, zberó se vkupej. 
[22:35] Pa vpraša en učenik postave izmed njih, izkušaje ga, in reče: 
[22:36] Učenik! ktera zapoved je v postavi naj veča? 
[22:37] Jezus mu pa reče: "Ljubi Gospoda Boga svojega iz vsega srca svojega, in iz vse duše svoje, in iz vse pameti svoje." 
[22:38] Ta je prva in največa zapoved. 
[22:39] Druga je pa tej podobna: "Ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe." 
[22:40] O teh dveh zapovedih visi vsa postava in preroki. 
[22:41] Ko se pa Farizeji snidejo, vpraša jih Jezus, 
[22:42] Govoreč: Kaj se vam zdí za Kristusa? Čegav sin je? Rekó mu: Davidov. 
[22:43] Reče jim: Kako ga torej David v duhu imenuje gospoda, ko pravi: 
[22:44] "Rekel je Gospod gospodu mojemu: Sedí meni na desno, dokler ne položim sovražnikov trojih nogam tvojim za podnožje?" 
[22:45] Če ga torej David imenuje gospoda, kako je sin njegov? 
[22:46] In nihče mu ni mogel besede odgovoriti; in od tega dné se ga ni upal nihče več vprašati. 
[23:1] Tedaj reče Jezus ljudstvu in učencem svojim, 
[23:2] Govoreč: Na Mojzesov stol so se usedli pismarji in Farizeji. 
[23:3] Vse torej, karkoli vam rekó izpolnjevati, izpolnjujte in delajte. Po njih delih pa ne delajte; ker govoré, pa ne delajo. 
[23:4] Vežejo namreč težke in neprenosljive butare; in nakladajo jih ljudém na pleča: a s svojim prstom jih ne té ganiti. 
[23:5] Vsa svoja dela pa delajo, da jih vidijo ljudjé. Razširjajo si namreč napise, in delajo velike robove oblačilom svojim. 
[23:6] In ljubijo prve prostore na gostijah, in prve stole po shajališčih, 
[23:7] In pozdrave po ulicah, in da jih ljudjé imenujejo: Rabi! Rabi! 
[23:8] Vi se pa ne imenujte rabi; kajti eden je vaš mojster, Kristus: vsi vi ste pa bratje. 
[23:9] In ne imenujte na zemlji nikogar očeta svojega; kajti eden je vaš oče, kteri je na nebesih. 
[23:10] Ne imenujte se tudi ne učenike; kajti eden je vaš učenik, Kristus. 
[23:11] A kdor je največi med vami, bodi vam služabnik. 
[23:12] Kdor se pa povišuje, ponižal se bo; in kdor se ponižuje, povišal se bo. 
[23:13] Gorjé pa vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da zapirate nebeško kraljestvo pred ljudmí; vi namreč ne greste va-nj, in tudi tistim, kteri hočejo, ne puščate vniti. 
[23:14] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da požirate vdovam hiše, in na videz dolgo molite: za to boste prejeli ostrejo sodbo. 
[23:15] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da prehodite morje in zemljo, da pridobite enega, kteri se pojudi; in ko se je pojudil, naredite iž njega peklenskega sinú, dvakrat hujega od sebe. 
[23:16] Gorjé vam, slepi vodniki! kteri pravite: Če priseže kdo pri tempeljnu, to ni nič; če pa priseže kdo pri tempeljnovem zlatu, kriv je. 
[23:17] Bebci in slepci! Kaj pa je več, zlato, ali tempelj, kteri posvečuje zlato? 
[23:18] In; Če priseže kdo pri oltarji, to ni nič; če pa priseže kdo pri daru, ki je na njem, kriv je. 
[23:19] Bebci in slepci! Kaj pa je več, dar, ali oltar, kteri posvečuje dar? 
[23:20] Kdor torej priseže pri oltarji, prisega pri njem in pri vsem, kar je na njem. 
[23:21] In kdor priseže pri nebu, prisega pri njem in pri tistem, kteri sedí na njem. 
[23:22] In kdor priseže pri tempeljnu, prisega pri njem in pri tistem, kteri prebiva v njem. 
[23:23] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da dajete desetino od mete, in kopra, in kumine, opustili ste pa, kar je najvažneje v postavi: sodbo in milost in vero. To je bilo treba storiti, in onega ne opustiti. 
[23:24] Slepi vodniki! kteri ocejate komarja, kamelo pa požirate. 
[23:25] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da čistite sklenico in skledo zunej, znotrej ste pa polni ropa in nepravičnosti. 
[23:26] Slepi Farizej! očisti poprej sklenico in skledo znotrej, da boste tudi zunej čisti 
[23:27] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da ste podobni pobeljenim grobom, kteri se zdé zunej lepi, znotrej so pa polni mrtvaških kosti in vse nesnage. 
[23:28] Tako se kažete tudi vi ljudém zunej pravične, znotrej ste pa polni hinavstva in hudobije. 
[23:29] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da zidate prerokom grobe, in lepšate pravičnim spomenike, 
[23:30] In pravite: Da smo bili v dnéh očetov svojih, ne bi bili njih deležniki bili pri krvi prerokov. 
[23:31] Tako pričate sami zoper sebe, da ste sinovih teh, kteri so pomorili preroke. 
[23:32] In vi ste napolnili mero očetov svojih. 
[23:33] Kače! gadja zalega! kako boste ubežali sodbi peklenskega ognja? 
[23:34] Za to, glej, pošiljam jaz k vam preroke in modre in pismarje; in nektere od njih boste pomorili in razpeli na križ, in nektere od njih boste po shajališčih svojih bičali, in preganjali od mesta do mesta. 
[23:35] Da pride na vas vsa pravična kri, ktera se je prelila na zemlji, od krvi pravičnega Abeljna noter do krvi Zaharija Baruhijevega sina, kterega ste umorili med tempeljnom in oltarjem. 
[23:36] Resnično vam pravim: Vse to bo prišlo na ta rod. 
[23:37] Jeruzalem, Jeruzalem, kteri ubijaš preroke in kamenjuješ tiste, kteri so k tebi poslani! Kolikrat sem hotel zbrati otroke tvoje, kakor zbira kokoš piščeta svoja pod peruti, in niste hoteli. 
[23:38] Glej, zapušča vam se hiša vaša pusta. 
[23:39] Kajti resnično vam pravim: Ne boste me videli odslej, dokler ne rečete: Blagoslovljen, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem! 
[24:1] In izšedši Jezus, šel je od tempeljna. Pa pristopijo učenci njegovi, da mu pokažejo zidine tempeljna. 
[24:2] Jezus jim pa reče: Ne vidite li vsega tega? Resnično vam pravim: Tu ne bo ostal kamen na kamenu, kteri se ne bi podrl. 
[24:3] Ko je pa sedel na Oljskej gori, pristopijo posebéj k njemu učenci, govoreč: Povej nam, kedaj bo to? In kaj bo znamenje prihodu tvojemu in koncu sveta? 
[24:4] In Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Varujte se, da vas kdo ne premoti! 
[24:5] Kajti mnogo jih bo prišlo v ime moje, govoreč: Jaz sem Kristus. In mnogo jih bodo premotili. 
[24:6] Slišali boste boje in glasove o bojih. Glejte, ne ustrašite se! kajti to mora vse biti. Ali tedaj še ni konec. 
[24:7] Kajti vstal bo narod na narod, in kraljestvo na kraljestvo; in lakote bodo in kuge in potresi po krajih. 
[24:8] Vse to je pa začetek nadlogam. 
[24:9] Tedaj vas bodo izročili stiski, in morili vas bodo; in sovražili vas bodo vsi narodi za voljo imena mojega. 
[24:10] In tedaj se bodo pohujšali mnogi; in drug drugega bodo izdajali, in drug drugega sovražili. 
[24:11] In mnogo lažnjivih prerokov bo vstalo; in premotili jih bodo veliko. 
[24:12] In da se hudobnost razmnoží, omrznila bo mnogim ljubezen. 
[24:13] Kdor pa pretrpí do konca, ta se bo zveličal. 
[24:14] In ta evangelj se bo oznanil po vsem svetu, vsem narodom za pričo; in tedaj bo prišel konec. 
[24:15] Kedar torej ugledate "gnjusobo razdevanja," za ktero je povedal prerok Danijel, da stojí na svetem prostoru: (kdor bere, naj ume!) 
[24:16] Tedaj naj tisti, kteri so v Judeji, zbežé na gore. 
[24:17] In kdor je na strehi, ne stopa naj dol, da vzeme kaj iz hiše svoje. 
[24:18] In kdor je na polji, ne vrača naj se nazaj, da vzeme plašč svoj. 
[24:19] Gorjé pa nosečim in doječim v tistih dnéh! 
[24:20] Molite pa, da ne bo vaš beg po zimi, in ne v soboto. 
[24:21] Kajti tedaj bo velika stiska, kakoršne ni bilo od začetka sveta noter doslej, in je tudi ne bo. 
[24:22] In ko se ne bi tisti dnevi prikrajšali, ne bi se nihče zveličal; ali za voljo izvoljencev se bodo prikrajšali tisti dnevi. 
[24:23] Če vam tedaj kdo reče: Glej, tu je Kristus, ali tam: ne verujte. 
[24:24] Kajti vstali bodo lažnjivi kristusi in lažnjivi preroki, in kazali bodo velika znamenja in čudeže, da bi premotili, ko bi bilo mogoče, tudi izvoljence. 
[24:25] Glej, povedal sem vam naprej. 
[24:26] Če vam torej rekó: Glej, v puščavi je! ne hodite ven: Glej, v izbah je! ne verujte. 
[24:27] Kajti kakor izhaja blisk od vzhoda in se sveti do zahoda, tako bo tudi prihod sinú človečjega. 
[24:28] Kjerkoli namreč je mrhovina, tam se bodo zbirali orli. 
[24:29] Precej po stiski tistih dnî bo pa solnce otemnelo, in mesec ne bo dajal svetlobe svoje, in zvezde bodo padale z neba, in sile nebeške se bodo pregibale. 
[24:30] In tedaj se bo pokazalo na nebu znamenje sina človečjega; in tedaj bodo zajokali vsi rodovi zemlje, in videli bodo sina človečjega, da gre na nebeških oblakih z veliko močjó in slavo. 
[24:31] In poslal bo angelje svoje z močnim glasom trobente, in zbrali bodo izvoljence njegove od čveterih vetrov od konca nebes do njih kraja. 
[24:32] Od smokve se pa naučite priliko: Kedar se veje njene omladé, in poženó listje, véste, da je blizu pomlad. 
[24:33] Tako tudi vi, ko vse to ugledate, védite, da je blizu pri vratih. 
[24:34] Resnično vam pravim: Ne bo prešel ta rod, dokler se vse to ne zgodí. 
[24:35] Nebo in zemlja bosta prešla, a besede moje ne bodo prešle. 
[24:36] Za tisti dan in uro pa nikdor ne vé, tudi ne angelji nebeški, nego oče moj sam. 
[24:37] Kakor pa v dnéh Noeta, tako bo tudi o prihodu sina človečjega. 
[24:38] Kakor so namreč v dnéh pred potopom žrli in pili, ženili se in možili, do tistega dné, ko je stopil Noe v barko, 
[24:39] In niso zvedeli, dokler ni prišla voda in vseh pobrala: tako bo tudi o prihodu sina človečjega. 
[24:40] Tedaj bosta dva na njivi; eden se bo vzel, in eden pustil. 
[24:41] Dve boste mleli na mlinu; ena se bo vzela, in ena pustila. 
[24:42] Čujte torej! ker ne véste, obklej bo prišel gospod vaš. 
[24:43] Védite pa to, da ko bi hišni gospodar vedel, o kterej straži bo prišel tat, čul bi, in ne bi dal hiše svoje podkopati. 
[24:44] Za to bodite tudi vi pripravljeni; kajti sin človečji bo prišel ob uri, ko se vam ne zdí. 
[24:45] Kdo je torej zvesti in modri hlapec, kterega je postavil gospodar njegov nad svojimi posli, da jim daje hrano o svojem času? 
[24:46] Blagor tistemu hlapcu, kterega bo našel gospodar njegov, kedar pride, da tako dela. 
[24:47] Resnično vam pravim, da ga bo postavil nad vsem svojim premoženjem. 
[24:48] Če pa reče ta hudobni hlapec v srcu svojem: Gospodar moj se mudi in še ne bo prišel. 
[24:49] In začne sohlapce pretepati, in jesti in piti s pijanci: 
[24:50] Prišel bo gospodar tega hlapca, kedar ne pričakuje, in ob uri, ktere ne vé. 
[24:51] In presekal ga bo, in položil bo del njegov s hinavci: tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[25:1] Tedaj bo nebeško kraljestvo podobno desetim devicam, ktere so vzele svetilnice svoje in so šle ženinu naproti. 
[25:2] Pet od njih je bilo modrih, in pet trapastih. 
[25:3] Tiste, ktere so bile trapaste, vzele so svetilnice svoje, in olja niso vzele s seboj. 
[25:4] Modre so pa vzele olje v posodah svojih s svetilnicami svojimi vred. 
[25:5] Ko se je pa ženin mudil, podremale so vse in pospale. 
[25:6] 0 polnoči pa nastane hrup: Glej, ženin gre; izidite mu naproti. 
[25:7] Tedaj vstanejo vse te device, in olepšajo svetilnice svoje. 
[25:8] Trapaste pa rekó modrim: Dajte nam od olja svojega, ker naše svetilnice gasnejo. 
[25:9] Modre jim pa odgovoré in rekó: Da zmanjka nam in vam: Pa pojdite rajše k prodajavcem in si kupite. 
[25:10] Ko so pa odšle kupovat, pride ženin; in tiste, ktere so bile pripravljene, vnidejo ž njim na svatovščino: in vrata se zapró. 
[25:11] Poslej pa pridejo tudi druge device, govoreč: Gospod, gospod, odpri nam: 
[25:12] On pa odgovorí in reče: Resnično vam pravim, ne poznam vas. 
[25:13] Čujte torej, ker ne véste ne dneva ne ure, obklej pride sin človečji. 
[25:14] Kakor je namreč človek, odpravljajoč se na pot, poklical hlapce svoje, in jim je izročil premoženje svoje, 
[25:15] In dal enemu pet talentov, enemu pa dva, a enemu enega, vsakemu po njegovej moči, in precej odpotoval. 
[25:16] Tisti pa, ki je prejel pet talentov, šel je in je ž njimi gospodaril, in napravil je pet drugih talentov. 
[25:17] Tako je tudi tisti, ki je prejel dva, tudi on dva druga pridobil. 
[25:18] Tisti pa, ki je prejel enega, šel je in ga je zakopal v zemljo, in skril srebro gospodarja svojega. 
[25:19] Črez mnogo časa pa pride gospodar teh hlapcev, in začne ž njimi računiti. 
[25:20] Pa pristopi tisti, ki je prejel pet talentov, in prinese pet drugih talentov, govoreč: Gospod! pet talentov si mi dal; glej, pridobil sem ž njimi pet drugih talentov. 
[25:21] Gospod njegov mu pa reče; Dobro, vrli in zvesti hlapec! v majhnem si bil zvest, postavil te bom nad veliko; vnidi v veselje gospodarja svojega. 
[25:22] Pristopi pa tudi tisti, ki je prejel dva talenta, in reče: Gospod! dva talenta si mi dal; glej, pridobil sem ž njima dva druga talenta. 
[25:23] Gospodar njegov mu reče: Dobro, vrli in zvesti hlapec! v majhnem si bil zvest, postavil te bom nad veliko; vnidi v veselje gospodarja svojega. 
[25:24] Pristopi pa tudi tisti, ki je prejel eden talent, in reče: Gospod! vedel sem te, da si trd človek, in žanješ, kjer nisi posejal, in pobiraš, kjer nisi raztresel. 
[25:25] Pa sem se zbal, in šel sem, in skril sem talent tvoj v zemljo; glej, tu imaš svoje. 
[25:26] Gospodar njegov mu pa odgovorí in reče: Hudobni in leni hlapec! vedel si, da žanjem, kjer nisem posejal, in pobiram, kjer nisem raztresel; 
[25:27] Torej bi bil moral ti dati srebro moje menjalcem: in kedar bi bil jaz prišel, vzel bi bil svoje z dobičkom. 
[25:28] Vzemite mu torej talent, in dajte tistemu, kteri ima deset talentov. 
[25:29] Kajti vsakemu, kdor ima, dalo se bo, in preveč mu bo; kdor pa nima, odvzelo mu se bo tudi to, kar ima. 
[25:30] In nepridnega hlapca vrzite v najkrajnjo temo: tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí. 
[25:31] Kedar pa pride sin človečji v slavi svojej, in vsi sveti angelji ž njim, tedaj se bo usedel na prestol svoje slave. 
[25:32] In pred njim se bodo zbrali vsi narodi; in ločil jih bo enega od drugega, kakor odločuje pastir ovce od kozlov. 
[25:33] In postavil bo ovce sebi na desno, a kozle na levo. 
[25:34] Tedaj poreče kralj tistim na desnici svojej: Pridite, blagoslovljeni očeta mojega! prejmite kraljestvo, ktero vam je pripravljeno od začetka sveta. 
[25:35] Kajti lačen sem bil, in dali ste mi jesti; žejen, in napojili ste me; gost sem bil, in sprejeli ste me; 
[25:36] Nag, in oblekli ste me; bolen, in obiskali ste me; v ječi sem bil, in prišli ste k meni. 
[25:37] Tedaj mu bodo odgovorili pravični, govoreč: Gospod! kedaj smo te videli lačnega, in smo te nasitili? ali žejnega, in smo te napojili? 
[25:38] Kedaj smo te pa videli gosta, in smo te sprejeli? ali nagega, in smo te oblekli? 
[25:39] Kedaj smo te pa videli bolnega, ali v ječi, in smo prišli k tebi? 
[25:40] In kralj bo odgovoril in jim poreče: Resnično vam pravim, karkoli ste storili enemu teh najmanjih mojih bratov, storili ste meni. 
[25:41] Tedaj poreče tudi tistim na levici: Pojdite od mene, prekleti! v večni ogenj, kteri je pripravljen hudiču in angeljem njegovim. 
[25:42] Kajti lačen sem bil, in niste mi dali jesti; žejen, in niste me napojili; gost sem bil, in niste me sprejeli; 
[25:43] Nag, in niste me oblekli; bolen, in v ječi, in niste me obiskali. 
[25:44] Tedaj mu bodo odgovorili tudi oni, govoreč: Gospod! kedaj smo te videli lačnega, ali žejnega, ali gosta, ali nagega, ali bolnega, ali v ječi, in ti nismo postregli? 
[25:45] Tedaj jim bo odgovoril, govoreč: Resnično vam pravim, karkoli niste storili enemu teh najmanjih, niste meni storili. 
[25:46] In ti pojdejo v večno trpljenje; pravični pa v večno življenje. 
[26:1] In zgodí se, ko je Jezus vse te besede končal, reče učencem svojim: 
[26:2] Véste, da bo črez dva dní velika noč, in sin človečji bo izdan, da ga križajo. 
[26:3] Tedaj se zberó véliki duhovni in pismarji in starešine naroda na dvoru vélikega duhovna, kteremu je bilo ime Kajfa. 
[26:4] In posvetujejo se, da bi Jezusa z zvijačo vjeli in umorili. 
[26:5] Govorili so pa: Ne na praznik, da se narod ne spunta. 
[26:6] Ko je bil pa Jezus v Betaniji v hiši Simona gobavca, 
[26:7] Pristopi k njemu žena, ktera je imela sklenico dragocene mire, in jo izlije na glavo njegovo, ko je sedel za mizo. 
[26:8] Ko pa učenci njegovi to vidijo, razhudé se, govoreč: Čemu ta potrata? 
[26:9] Ta mira namreč bi se bila mogla za mnogo prodati, in dati se ubogim. 
[26:10] Ko pa Jezus to spazi, reče jim: Kaj delate ženi skrbí? kajti dobro delo je storila na meni. 
[26:11] Uboge namreč imate vselej s seboj; mene pa nimate vselej. 
[26:12] Kajti da je izlila to miro na telo moje, storila je to za pokop moj. 
[26:13] Resnično vam pravim: Kjerkoli po vsem svetu se bo oznanjal ta evangelj, povedalo se bo tudi to, kar je ona storila, njej v spomin. 
[26:14] Tedaj odide eden od dvanajsterih, kteremu je bilo ime Juda Iškarijan, k vélikim duhovnom, 
[26:15] In reče: Kaj mi hočete dati, in jaz vam ga bom izdal? Oni mu pa obrekó trideset srebrnikov. 
[26:16] In odtlej je iskal priložnosti, da ga izdá. 
[26:17] Prvi dan presnih kruhov pa pristopijo učenci k Jezusu in mu rekó: Kje hočeš, da ti pripravimo, da boš jedel velikonočno jagnje? 
[26:18] On pa reče: Pojdite v mesto k temu in temu, in recite mu: Učenik pravi: Čas moj je blizu; pri tebi bom jedel velikonočno jagnje z učenci svojimi. 
[26:19] In učenci storé, kakor jim je Jezus ukazal, in pripravijo velikonočno jagnje. 
[26:20] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, sede za mizo z učenci svojimi. 
[26:21] In ko so jedli, reče: Resnično vam pravim, da me bo eden izmed vas izdal. 
[26:22] In zeló jim se užali, in začnó mu praviti vsak od njih: Ali sem jaz, Gospod? 
[26:23] On pa odgovorí in reče: Ta, ki je omočil z menoj rokó v skledo, ta me bo izdal. 
[26:24] Sin človečji sicer gre, kakor je pisano za-nj; ali gorjé tistemu človeku, kteri sina človečjega izdaja, Bolje bi mu bilo, da se ne bi bil tisti človek rodil. 
[26:25] Juda izdajalec njegov pa odgovorí in reče: Ali sem jaz, rabi? Reče mu: Ti si rekel. 
[26:26] Ko so pa jedli, vzeme Jezus kruh, in blagoslovivši, prelomi, in dajal je učencem svojim, govoreč: Vzemite, jejte; to je telo moje. 
[26:27] In vzemši kelih, zahvali, in dá jim, govoreč: Pijte iž njega vsi; 
[26:28] Kajti to je kri moja novega zakona, ktera se prelija za mnoge v odpuščanje grehov. 
[26:29] Pravim vam pa, da odslej ne bom pil od tega trtnega rodú, do tistega dné, ko ga bom pil z vami novega v kraljestvu očeta svojega. 
[26:30] In ko so odpeli, odidejo na oljsko goro. 
[26:31] Tedaj jim reče Jezus: Vsi vi se boste pohujšali to noč od mene. Kajti pisano je: "Pastirja bom udaril, in razkropile se bodo ovce črede." 
[26:32] Po vstajanji svojem pa pojdem pred vami v Galilejo. 
[26:33] Peter pa odgovorí in mu reče: Če se tudi vsi od tebe pohujšajo, jaz se ne bom nikoli pohujšal. 
[26:34] Jezus mu reče: Resnično ti pravim, da to noč, predno bo petelin zapel, zatajil me boš trikrat. 
[26:35] Peter mu pravi: In ko bi moral s teboj umreti, ne bom te zatajil. Tako tudi vsi učenci rekó. 
[26:36] Tedaj pride ž njimi Jezus v vas imenovano Getsemane, in reče učencem: Usedite se tu dotlej, da grem in tam molim. 
[26:37] In vzemši Petra in Zebedejeva dva sina, začne žalovati in obupovati. 
[26:38] Tedaj jim reče: Žalostna je duša moja do smrti; ostanite tu, in čujte z menoj. 
[26:39] In odšedši malo dalje, pade na obraz svoj, in molil je, govoreč: Oče moj! če je mogoče, odide naj ta kelih od mene; ali ne kakor hočem jaz, nego kakor ti. 
[26:40] In prišedši k učencem, najde jih, da spé; ter reče Petru: Tako niste mogli ene ure z menoj prečuti? 
[26:41] Čujte in molite, da ne zajdete v izkušnjavo; duh je sicer krepek, ali telo je slabo. 
[26:42] Zopet odide drugoč; in molil je, govoreč: Oče moj! ako ne more ta kelih oditi od mene, če ga ne pijem, zgódi se volja tvoja. 
[26:43] In prišedši, najde jih zopet, da spé; bile so jim namreč oči otežale. 
[26:44] In pustivši jih, odide zopet; in molil je v tretje, govoreč iste besede. 
[26:45] Tedaj pride k učencem svojim, in reče jim: Spite dalje in počivajte! Glej, ura se je približala, in sin človečji se izdaja grešnikom v roke. 
[26:46] Vstanite, pojdimo! Glej, izdajalec moj se je približal. 
[26:47] In ko je še govoril, glej, pride Juda, eden od dvanajsterih, in ž njim mnogo ljudstva z meči in koli, od vélikih duhovnov in starešin naroda. 
[26:48] Izdajalec njegov jim je pa dal znamenje, govoreč: Kogar bom poljubil, ta je; primite ga. 
[26:49] In precej pristopi k Jezusu, in reče: Zdrav bodi, rabi! in ga poljubi. 
[26:50] Jezus mu pa reče: Prijatelj! po kaj si prišel? Tedaj pristopijo in položé roke svoje na Jezusa in ga vjemó. 
[26:51] In glej, eden tistih, kteri so bili z Jezusom, stegne roko svojo in izdere meč svoj, in udari hlapca vélikega duhovna in mu odseka uho. 
[26:52] Tedaj mu velí Jezus: Vtakni meč svoj na mesto njegovo; kajti vsi, kteri primejo za meč, poginili bodo z mečem. 
[26:53] Ali misliš li, da ne morem sedaj očeta svojega prositi, in poslal bi mi več nego dvanajst legijonov angeljev? 
[26:54] Kako bi se pa izpolnila pisma, da mora tako biti? 
[26:55] V ta čas reče Jezus ljudstvu: Kakor na razbojnika ste izšli na me z meči in koli? Vsak dan sem sedel pri vas, učeč v tempeljnu, in niste me zgrabili. 
[26:56] Ali vse to se je zgodilo, da se izpolnijo pisma prerokov. Tedaj ga vsi učenci pusté, in pobegnejo. 
[26:57] A tisti, kteri so Jezusa vjeli, odpeljejo ga k vélikemu duhovnu Kajfu, kjer so se pismarji in starešine zbrali. 
[26:58] A Peter je šel oddaleč za njim, noter do dvora vélikega duhovna; in stopivši noter, sede k hlapcem, da vidi konec. 
[26:59] Véliki duhovni in pismarji in ves zbor so pa iskali lažnjive priče zoper Jezusa, da bi ga umorili. 
[26:60] In ne najdejo je. In da si ravno pristopi mnogo lažnjivih prič, ne najdejo. Naposled pa pristopite dve priči, 
[26:61] In rečete: Ta je rekel: Jaz morem tempelj Božji podreti, in v treh dnéh sezidati ga. 
[26:62] In véliki duhoven vstane in mu reče: Ne odgovarjaš li ničesar? Kaj pričajo ti zoper tebe? 
[26:63] Jezus je pa molčal. In véliki duhoven odgovorí in mu reče: Zaklinjam te pri živem Bogu, da nam povej, če si ti Kristus sin Božji? 
[26:64] Jezus mu reče: Ti si rekel. Ali pravim vam: Odslej boste videli sina človečjega, da sedí na desnici moči, in gre na nebeških oblakih. 
[26:65] Tedaj raztrga véliki duhoven oblačila svoja, govoreč: Boga je preklel; kaj nam je še treba prič? Glej, ravnokar ste slišali kletvino njegovo. 
[26:66] Kaj se vam zdí? Oni pa odgovoré in rekó: Smrti je vreden. 
[26:67] Tedaj mu pljunejo v obraz, in bijejo ga za uho; a drugi ga bijejo s pestmi, 
[26:68] Govoreč: Prerokuj nam, Kristus! kdo je, ki te je udaril? 
[26:69] Peter je pa sedel zunej na dvoru. Pa pristopi k njemu ena dekla, in reče: Tudi ti i bil z Jezusom Galilejcem. 
[26:70] On na tají pred vsemi, govoreč: Ne vém, kaj praviš. 
[26:71] Ko pa izide k vratom, ugleda ga druga, in reče tistim, kteri so bili tam: Tudi ta je bil z Jezusom Nazarečanom. 
[26:72] In zopet tají s prisego: Ne poznam tega človeka. 
[26:73] Malo potem pa pristopijo tisti, kteri so stali, in rekó Petru: Resnično, tudi ti si izmed njih; saj te tudi govorica tvoja izdaja. 
[26:74] Tedaj se začne rotiti in kleti: Ne poznam tega človeka. In precej zapoje petelin. 
[26:75] In Peter se spomene Jezusove besede, ktero mu je rekel: Predno bo petelin zapel, zatajil me boš trikrat. Ter izide in se britko razjoka. 
[27:1] Ko pa napoči jutro, posvetujejo se vsi véliki duhovni in ljudski pismarji zoper Jezusa, da ga umoré. 
[27:2] Ter ga zvežejo in odpeljejo, in izročé ga poglavarju Ponciju Pilatu. 
[27:3] Tedaj se Juda izdajalec njegov, videvši, da so ga obsodili, razkesá, in vrne trideset srebrnikov vélikim duhovnom in starešinam, 
[27:4] Govoreč: Grešil sem, da sem izdal nedolžno kri. Oni pa rekó: Kaj nam za to? Ti glej! 
[27:5] In vrgši srebrnike v tempelj, izide; ter odide in se obesi. 
[27:6] Veliki duhovni pa, vzemši srebrnike, rekó: Ne smemo jih deti v crkveni zaklad, ker so krvav denar. 
[27:7] Posvetovavši se pa, kupijo za nje lončarjevo polje za pokopališče tujcem. 
[27:8] Za to se imenuje tisto polje Krvavo polje, do današnjega dné. 
[27:9] Tedaj se je izpolnilo, kar je rečeno po preroku Jeremiji, kteri pravi: "In vzeli so trideset srebrnikov, ceno cenjenega, kterega so cenili od sinov Izraelovih; 
[27:10] In dali so jih za lončarjevo polje, kakor mi je naročil Gospod." 
[27:11] A Jezus je stal pred poglavarjem. In vpraša ga poglavar, govoreč: Ti si kralj Judovski? Jezus mu pa reče: Ti praviš. 
[27:12] In ko so ga véliki duhovni in starešine tožili, ni odgovarjal ničesar. 
[27:13] Tedaj mu reče Pilat: Ne slišiš li, kaj zoper te pričajo? 
[27:14] In ni mu odgovoril ne na eno besedo, da se je poglavar zeló čudil. 
[27:15] Na praznik je pa imel poglavar navado, da je izpuščal ljudstvu po enega jetnika, kterega so hoteli. 
[27:16] Imeli so pa tedaj glasovitega jetnika, kteremu je bilo ime Baraba. 
[27:17] Ko se torej zberó, reče jim Pilat: Kterega hočete, da vam izpustim? Baraba, ali Jezusa, ki se imenuje Kristus? 
[27:18] Kajti vedel je, da so ga iz nevošljivosti izdali. 
[27:19] Ko je pa sedel na sodišči, pošlje k njemu žena njegova, govoreč: Ne imej ničesar s tem pravičnim opraviti; kajti veliko sem pretrpela danes v spanji za voljo njega. 
[27:20] A véliki duhovni in starešine podpihajo ljudstvo, naj zahtevajo Baraba, Jezusa pa pogubé. 
[27:21] Poglavar pa odgovorí in jim reče: Kterega od teh dveh hočete, da vam izpustim? Oni pa rekó: Baraba! 
[27:22] Reče jim Pilat: Kaj bom pa storil z Jezusom, ki se imenuje Kristus? Vsi mu rekó: Razpne naj se! 
[27:23] Poglavar pa reče: Kaj hudega je pa storil? Oni so pa še bolj vpili: Razpne naj se! 
[27:24] Ko pa Pilat vidi, da nič ne pomaga, nego še veči šum nastaja, vzeme vodo in umije roke pred ljudstvom, govoreč: Nedolžen sem pri krvi tega pravičnega. Vi glejte! 
[27:25] In vse ljudstvo odgovorí in reče: Kri njegova na nas in na otroke naše! 
[27:26] Tedaj jim izpustí Baraba: Jezusa pa biča in ga izročí, naj ga križajo. 
[27:27] Tedaj vzemó poglavarjevi vojščaki Jezusa v sodnišnico, in zberó na-nj ves trop. 
[27:28] Ter ga slečejo, in oblečejo mu škrlaten plašč. 
[27:29] In spletó krono iz trnja in mu jo denejo na glavo, in trst v desnico njegovo. In pokleknivši pred njim, zasramovali so ga, govoreč: Zdrav bodi, kralj Judovski! 
[27:30] In pljunejo va-nj in vzemó trst, in bíli so ga po glavi. 
[27:31] In ko mu se nasmejajo, slečejo mu plašč, in oblečejo mu njegovo obleko: ter ga odpeljejo, da ga križajo. 
[27:32] Gredoč pa ven najdejo človeka Cirenejca po imenu Simona; tega prisilijo, naj mu ponese križ. 
[27:33] In ko pridejo na mesto, ktero se imenuje Golgata, kar se pravi: Mesto mrtvaške glave, 
[27:34] Dadó mu piti octa, zmešanega z žolčem; in ko je okusil, ni hotel piti. 
[27:35] Križavši ga pa, razdelé obleko njegovo, metaje kocko; da se izpolni, kar je rekel prerok: "Obleko mojo so si razdelili, in za oblačilo moje so vrgli kocko. 
[27:36] Ter so tam sedeli in ga stražili. 
[27:37] In denejo mu nad glavo krivico njegovo napisano: Ta je Jezus kralj Judovski. 
[27:38] Tedaj križajo ž njim dva razbojnika, enega na desno in enega na levo. 
[27:39] A mimo hodeči so ga preklinjali, majaje z glavami svojimi, 
[27:40] In govoreč: Ti; ki podiraš tempelj in ga v treh dnéh postavljaš, pomagaj sam sebi! Če si sin Božji, snidi s križa! 
[27:41] Enako so ga pa tudi véliki hudovni s pismarji in starešinami zasramovali, in govorili so: 
[27:42] Drugim je pomagal, sam sebi ne more pomagati. Če je kralj Izraelski, snide naj sedaj s križa, in verovali mu bomo. 
[27:43] Zaupal je v Boga; naj ga reši sedaj, če ga hoče. Rekel je bil namreč: Sin Božji sem. 
[27:44] Ravno tako sta ga pa zasramovala tudi razbojnika, ktera sta bila ž njim križana. 
[27:45] Od šeste ure pa nastane tema po vsej zemlji noter do devete ure. 
[27:46] A okoli devete ure zavpije Jezus z močnim glasom, govoreč: Eli! Eli! lama sabahtani? to je: "Bog moj! Bog moj! za kaj si me zapustil?" 
[27:47] Slišavši pa to nekteri tistih, ki so tam stali, rekó: Elija kliče ta. 
[27:48] In precej steče eden izmed njih in vzeme gobo, in napolni jo z octom in natakne na trst, ter ga je napajal. 
[27:49] Drugi so pa govorili: Pojenjaj, da vidimo, če pride Elija in ga reši. 
[27:50] Jezus pa zopet z močnim glasom zavpije, in izpustí dušo. 
[27:51] In glej, pregrinjalo tempeljna se pretrga na dvoje od vrha do tâl; in zemlja se potrese, in skale se razpokajo; 
[27:52] In grobi se odpró, in trupla mnogih, kteri so umrli, vstanejo; 
[27:53] In izšedši iz grobov, po vstajanji njegovem, pridejo v sveto mesto in se prikažejo mnogim. 
[27:54] Videvši pa stotnik in kteri so ž njim stražili Jezusa, potres in kar se je zgodilo, preplašijo se zeló, in rekó: Resnično je bil ta sin Božji. 
[27:55] Bile so pa tam in so od daleč gledale mnoge žene, ktere so bile prišle za Jezusom iz Galileje in so mu bile stregle. 
[27:56] Med njimi je bila Marija Magdalena, in Marija Jakobova in Jozejeva mati, in mati Zebedejevih sinov. 
[27:57] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, pride bogat človek iz Arimateje, po imenu Jožef, kteri je bil tudi sam Jezusov učenec. 
[27:58] Ta pristopi k Pilatu, in prosi za Jezusovo truplo. Tedaj zapové Pilat, naj mu dadó truplo. 
[27:59] In Jožef vzeme Jezusovo truplo in ga zavije v čisto platno, 
[27:60] In položí ga v novi svoj grob, ki ga je iztesal iz skale; in privalivši velik kamen grobu na vrata, odide. 
[27:61] Bila je pa tam Marija Magdalena, in druga Marija, in sedeli ste grobu nasproti. 
[27:62] Drugi dan pa, kteri je prvi po petku, zberó se véliki duhovni in Farizeji pri Pilatu, 
[27:63] Govoreč: Gospod! spomenili smo se, da je ta slepar, ko je še živel, djal: Čez tri dní bom vstal od smrti. 
[27:64] Zapovej torej, naj se grob zavaruje do tretjega dné, da ne pridejo kako učenci njegovi po noči in ga ukradejo, ter rekó ljudstvu: Vstal je od mrtvih. In zadnja sleparija bo huja od prve. 
[27:65] Pilat jim pa reče: Stražo imate; pojdite, zavarujte, kakor véste. 
[27:66] Oni pa odidejo in zavarujejo grob s stražo, in zapečatijo kamen. 
[28:1] Po sobotnem večeru pa, ko je svital prvi dan tedna, pride Marija Magdalena, in druga Marija, da pogledate grob. 
[28:2] In glej, potres velik vstane; kajti angelj Gospodov je prišel z neba, in pristopivši, odvalil je kamen od vrat, in sedel je na njem. 
[28:3] Bilo je pa obličje njegovo kakor blisk, in obleka njegova bela kakor sneg. 
[28:4] Od strahú pa njegovega strepetajo stražarji, in postanejo kakor mrtvi. 
[28:5] Angelj pa odgovorí in reče ženama: Ne bojte se! ker vém, da Jezusa križanega iščete. 
[28:6] Ní ga tu; kajti vstal je, kakor je rekel. Pridite, in poglejte mesto, kjer je Gospod ležal, 
[28:7] In pojdite hitro, in povejte učencem njegovim, da je vstal od mrtvih; in glej, pred vami gre v Galilejo. Tam ga boste videli. 
[28:8] In izšedši naglo iz groba, s strahom in velikim veseljem, potečete, da sporočite učencem njegovim. 
[28:9] Ko ste pa šli, da sporočite učencem njegovim, glej, sreča ji Jezus, govoreč: Bodite zdravi! Oni pa pristopite in se oklenete nog njegovih, ter mu se poklonite. 
[28:10] Tedaj jima reče Jezus:! Ne bojte se! Pojdite, sporočite učencem mojim, naj odidejo v Galilejo, in tam me bodo videli. 
[28:11] Ko ste pa šli, glej, pridejo nekteri od straže v mesto, da naznanijo vélikim duhovnom vse, kar se je zgodilo. 
[28:12] In snidejo se s starešinami in se posvetujejo, in dadó vojakom mnogo denarja, 
[28:13] Govoreč: Recite, da so prišli po noči učenci njegovi in so ga ukradli, ko smo mi spali. 
[28:14] In če zvé to poglavar, pomirili ga bomo mi, da boste vi brez skrbî. 
[28:15] Oni pa vzemó denar in storé, kakor so bili naučeni. In razglasila se je ta beseda pri Judih noter do današnjega dné. 
[28:16] Enajsteri učenci pa odidejo v Galilejo, na goro, kamor jim je bil Jezus ukazal. 
[28:17] In ko ga ugledajo, poklonijo mu se; in nekteri dvomijo. 
[28:18] In pristopivši Jezus, reče jim, govoreč; Dala mi se je vsa oblast, na nebu in na zemlji. 
[28:19] Pojdite torej, in naučite vse narode, krsteč jih v ime očeta in sina in Duha svetega; 
[28:20] Učeč jih, naj izpolnjujejo vse, kar sem vam ukazal; in glej, jaz sem z vami vse dní do konca sveta. Amen. 

### Mark

[1:1] Začetek evangelja Jezusa Kristusa, sina Božjega; 
[1:2] Kakor je pisano v prerokih; "Glej, jaz pošiljam angelja svojega pred obličjem tvojim, kteri bo pripravil pot tvojo pred teboj.. 
[1:3] "Glas vpijočega v puščavi: Pripravite pot Gospodov; poravnajte steze njegove." 
[1:4] Krščeval je Janez v puščavi in oznanjeval krst pokore za odpuščanje grehov. 
[1:5] In izhajala je k njemu vsa Judejska dežela in Jeruzalemci; in krščeval jih je vse v Jordanu reki, in izpovedovali so grehe svoje. 
[1:6] Bil je pa Janez oblečen v kameljo dlako, in pas usnjat okoli ledja svojega; in jedel je kobilice in med divji. 
[1:7] In oznanjeval je, govoreč: Močneji od mene gre za menoj, kteremu nisem vreden, pripognivši se odvezati jermena na obutalu njegovem. 
[1:8] Jaz sem vas krstil z vodo; ali on vas bo krstil z Duhom svetim. 
[1:9] In zgodí se tiste dni, da pride Jezus iz Nazareta Galilejskega, in krsti ga Janez v Jordanu. 
[1:10] In precej, stopajoč iz vode, ugleda, da se odpirajo nebesa, in Duh ko golob shaja na-nj. 
[1:11] In glas se oglasi z nebes: Ti si sin moj ljubljeni, kteri je po mojej volji. 
[1:12] In precej ga izžene Duh v puščavo. 
[1:13] In bil je tam v puščavi štirideset dní, in izkušal ga je satan, in bil je z zverino; in angelji so mu stregli. 
[1:14] Ko so pa Janeza izročili Herodu, pride Jezus v Galilejo, oznanjujoč evangelj kraljestva Božjega, 
[1:15] In govoreč: Izpolnil se je čas, in približalo se je kraljestvo Božje: spokorite se, in verujte v evangelj. 
[1:16] Hodé pa ob morji Galilejskem, ugleda Simona in Andreja brata njegovega, da mečeta mreže v morje; bila sta namreč ribiča. 
[1:17] In reče jima Jezus: Pojdita za menoj, in naredil bom, da bosta lovca ljudî. 
[1:18] In popustívši precej mreže svoje, odideta za njim. 
[1:19] In prišedši odtod malo dalje, ugleda Jakoba sina Zebedejevega, in Janeza brata njegovega, a ona krpata v ladji mreže. 
[1:20] In precej ju pokliče. In popustivši očeta svojega Zebedeja v ladji z najemniki, odideta za njim. 
[1:21] Ter vnidejo v Kapernaum; in precej v soboto vnide v shajališče, ter je učil. 
[1:22] In strmeli so nad naukom njegovim; kajti učil jih je, kakor kdor ima oblast, a ne kakor pismarji. 
[1:23] In bil je v njih shajališči človek, kteri je imel duha nečistega, in zavpije, 
[1:24] Govoreč: Pojenjaj, kaj imaš z nami, Jezus Nazarečan? Prišel si, da nas pogubiš? Poznam te, kdo si – svetnik Božji. 
[1:25] In zapretí mu Jezus, govoreč: Umolkni, in izidi iz njega, 
[1:26] In duh nečisti ga strese, in zakričí z močnim glasom,; in izide iž njega. 
[1:27] In vsi se prestrašijo, tako, da so vpraševali eden drugega, govoreč: Kaj je to? kakošen je ta novi nauk, da z oblastjo tudi duhovom nečistim ukazuje, in pokorni so mu? 
[1:28] In precej izide glas o njem po vsej pokrajini Galilejskej. 
[1:29] In izšedši precej iz shajališča, pridejo v hišo Simona in Andreja, z Jakobom in Janezom. 
[1:30] Tašča pa Simonova ležala je mrzlična; in precej mu povedó za njo. 
[1:31] In pristopivši, vzdigne jo, prijemši jo za roko; in precej jo je pustila mrzlica, ter jim je stregla 
[1:32] Zvečer pa, ko je solnce zatonilo, prinašali so k njemu vse bolnike in obsedence. 
[1:33] In vse mesto se je bilo zbralo k vratom. 
[1:34] In uzdravil je mnogo bolnikov od različnih bolezni; in hudičev je mnogo izgnal, in ni dal govoriti hudičem, ker so ga poznali. 
[1:35] In zjutraj zeló zgodaj vstane in izide, ter odide na samoten kraj, in tam je molil. 
[1:36] In za njim potekó Simon in kteri so bili ž njim. 
[1:37] In ko ga najdejo, rekó mu; Vsi te iščejo. 
[1:38] Pa jim reče: Pojdimo v bližnje trge, da bom tudi tam učil; kajti za to sem prišel. 
[1:39] In učil je po njih shajališčih, po vsej Galileji, in hudiče je izganjal. 
[1:40] Pa pride k njemu gobavec, proseč ga in klečeč pred njim, in govoreč mu: Če hočeš, moreš me očistiti. 
[1:41] In Jezusu se zasmili, in stegnivši roko, dotakne se ga in mu reče: Hočem, očisti se! 
[1:42] In ko je to rekel, precej je odšla od njega goba, in bil je očiščen. 
[1:43] In zapretivši mu, izžene ga precej, 
[1:44] In velí mu: Glej, da nikomur nič ne povéš; nego pojdi, pokaži se duhovnu, in prinesi za očiščenje svoje, kar je ukazal Mojzes, njim za pričo. 
[1:45] On pa, ko je izšel, jel je mnogo oznanjevati in reč razglaševati, tako, da ni mogel Jezus nič več očitno v mesto vniti; nego zunej po samotnih krajih je bil, in prihajali so k njemu od vseh stranî. 
[2:1] In zopet vnide v Kapernaum črez nekoliko dnî; in zasliši se, da je v hiši. 
[2:2] In precej se jih zbere mnogo, toliko, da niso imeli prostora tudi pred vratmi ne; in govoril jim je besedo. 
[2:3] Pa pridejo k njemu in prinesó mrtvoudnega, kterega so štirje nosili. 
[2:4] In ko mu se niso mogli približati za voljo ljudstva, odkrijejo streho, kjer je bil, in ko so jo predrli, spusté oder, na kterem je mrtvoudni ležal. 
[2:5] Videvši pa Jezus njih vero, reče mrtvoudnemu: Sin, odpuščajo ti se grehi tvoji. 
[2:6] Bili so pa tam nekteri od pismarjev, kteri so sedeli in premišljevali v srcih svojih: 
[2:7] Kaj ta tako Boga preklinja? Kdo more odpuščati grehe, razen eden, Bog? 
[2:8] In spoznavši Jezus precej z duhom svojim, da tako premišljujejo sami s seboj, reče jim: Kaj to premišljujete v srcih svojih? 
[2:9] Kaj je laže, reči mrtvoudnemu: Odpuščajo ti se grehi? ali reči: Vstani in vzemi oder svoj, in hodi? 
[2:10] Da boste pa vedeli, da ima oblast sin človečji odpuščati na zemlji grehe, (velí mrtvoudnemu:) 
[2:11] Tebi pravim: Vstani in vzemi oder svoj, in pojdi na dom svoj. 
[2:12] In precej vstane in vzeme oder, in izide pred vsemi, da so se vsi čudili in Boga hvalili, govoreč: Nikoli nismo kaj takega videli. 
[2:13] In zopet izide k morju. In vse ljudstvo je prihajalo k njemu, in učil jih je. 
[2:14] In mimo gredé ugleda Levija sina Alfejevega, da sedí na mitnici, in reče mu: Pojdi za menoj. Pa vstane in odide za njim. 
[2:15] In zgodí se, ko je sedel za mizo v hiši njegovej, da je tudi mnogo mitarjev in grešnikov sedelo z Jezusom in učenci njegovimi; kajti bilo jih je veliko, kteri so šli za njim. 
[2:16] Pismarji pa in Farizeji, videvši ga, da jé z mitarji in grešniki, govorili so učencem njegovim; Kaj je to, da z mitarji in grešniki jé in pije? 
[2:17] In slišavši to Jezus, reče jim: Ne potrebujejo zdravi zdravnika, nego bolni. Nisem prišel klicat pravičnih, nego grešnike na pokoro. 
[2:18] A učenci Janezovi in Farizejski so se postili; ter pridejo in mu rekó: Za kaj se učenci Janezovi in Farizejski postijo, tvoji se pa učenci ne postijo? 
[2:19] Pa jim Jezus reče: Morejo li se svatje, kedar je ženin ž njimi, postiti? Dokler imajo s seboj ženina, ne morejo se postiti. 
[2:20] Prišli bodo pa dnevi, ko jim se bo ženin odvzel, in tedaj se bodo postili tiste dní. 
[2:21] In nikdor zaplate iz novega sukna ne prišiva na staro obleko, sicer odtrga nova njena zaplata od starega še nekaj, in luknja bo veča. 
[2:22] In nikdor ne deva novega vina v stare mehove; sicer predere vino novo mehove, in vino se izlije, in mehovi se pokazé; nego novo vino je treba v nove mehove vlijati. 
[2:23] In zgodí se, da je šel v soboto skozi setve, in jeli so učenci njegovi po poti gredé trgati klasje. 
[2:24] Pa mu rekó Farizeji: Glej, kaj delajo v soboto, kar se ne smé? 
[2:25] In on jim reče: Niste li nikoli brali, kaj je storil David, ko je bil v sili in se je ulakotil, on in kteri so bili ž njim? 
[2:26] Kako je šel v hišo Božjo, ko je bil Abijatar véliki duhoven, ter je snedel postavljene kruhe, kterih ni smel nikdor jesti, razen duhovni, in dal je tudi tistim, kteri so bili ž njim? 
[2:27] In reče jim: Sobota je ustvarjena za voljo človeka, a ne človek za voljo sobote. 
[2:28] Za to je sin človečji gospodar tudi sobote. 
[3:1] In zopet vnide v shajališče, in bil je tam človek, kteri je imel suho roko. 
[3:2] In pazili so na-nj, če ga bo uzdravil v soboto, da bi ga zatožili. 
[3:3] Pa reče človeku, kteri je imel suho roko: Stopi na sredo! 
[3:4] In reče jim: Ali se sme v soboto dobro storiti, ali hudo storiti? življenje oteti, ali pogubiti? Oni so pa molčali. 
[3:5] In pogledavši po njih okoli z jezo, milovaje trdovratnost njih srca, velí človeku: Stegni roko svojo! Pa stegne, in roka njegova je bila zdrava kakor druga. 
[3:6] In Farizeji izidejo, ter se precej s Herodovci za-nj posvetujejo, kako bi ga pogubili. 
[3:7] Ali Jezus odide z učenci svojimi k morju; in velika množica iz Galileje je šla za njim, in iz Judeje, 
[3:8] In iz Jeruzalema, in iz Idumeje, in z one strani Jordana: in kteri so prebivali okoli Tira in Sidona: množica velika, ko so slišali, kakošne rečí dela, prišli so k njemu. 
[3:9] Pa reče učencem svojim, naj mu bo ladjica pripravljena, za voljo ljudstva, da ga ne bi stiskali. 
[3:10] Kajti veliko jih je uzdravil, tako, da so padali na-nj, da bi se ga dotikali, kterikoli so imeli bolezni; 
[3:11] In nečisti duhovi, ko so ga videli, padali so pred njim, in kričali so, govoreč: Ti si sin Božji. 
[3:12] In zeló jim je pretil, naj ga ne razglasé. 
[3:13] In izide na goro, in pokliče k sebi, ktere je on hotel; ter pridejo k njemu. 
[3:14] In postavi jih dvanajst, da bi bili ž njim, in da bi jih poslal oznanjevat; 
[3:15] In bi imeli oblast uzdravljati bolezni, in izganjati hudiče. 
[3:16] Simona, in dá mu ime Peter; 
[3:17] In Jakoba sina Zebedejevega, in Janeza brata Jakobovega; in dá jima ime Boanerges, to je: Sinova gromova. 
[3:18] In Andreja, in Filipa, in Jerneja, in Matevža, in Tomaža, in Jakoba sina Alfejevega, in Tadeja, in Simona Kananičana. 
[3:19] In Juda Iškarijana, kteri ga je tudi izdal. 
[3:20] In pridejo v hišo; in snide se zopet ljudstvo, tako, da še kruha niso mogli pojesti. 
[3:21] In slišavši to rojaki njegovi, šli so, da bi ga vjeli; kajti govorili so: Iz sebe je. 
[3:22] In pismarji, kteri so bili prišli iz Jeruzalema, pravili so: Belzebula ima, in: S poglavarjem hudičev izganja hudiče. 
[3:23] In poklicavši jih k sebi, govoril jim je v prilikah: Kako more satan satana izganjati? 
[3:24] In če se kraljestvo samo zoper sebe razdvojí, ne more ostati to kraljestvo; 
[3:25] In če se dom sam zoper sebe razdvojí, ne more ostati ta dom; 
[3:26] In če je vstal satan sam zoper sebe, in se je razdvojil, ne more ostati, nego po njem je. 
[3:27] Nikdor ne more močnemu vniti v hišo in mu posode pobrati, če poprej močnega ne zveže, in tedaj bo okradel hišo njegovo. 
[3:28] Resnično vam pravim, da se bodo vsi grehi odpustili sinovom človečjim, tudi kletvine, s kterimikoli bi prekleli Boga; 
[3:29] Kdor se pa zarotí proti svetemu Duhu, nima odpuščanja na vekomaj, nego kriv je večne sodbe. 
[3:30] Kajti govorili so: Nečistega duha ima. 
[3:31] Ter pridejo bratje njegovi in mati njegova, in stoječ zunej, pošljejo k njemu, da ga pokličejo. 
[3:32] In sedelo je ljudstvo okoli njega; in rekó mu: Glej, mati tvoja in bratje tvoji te zunej iščejo. 
[3:33] In odgovorí jim, govoreč: Kdo je mati moja, ali bratje moji? 
[3:34] In ozré se okrog po tistih, ki so sedeli okoli njega, in reče: Glej mati moja in bratje moji! 
[3:35] Kajti kdorkoli storí voljo Božjo, on je brat moj in sestra moja in mati. 
[4:1] In zopet začne učiti ob morji. In zbere se pri njem mnogo ljudstva, toliko, da stopi v ladjo, ter je sedel na morji; in vse ljudstvo je bilo ob morji na tléh. 
[4:2] In učil jih je v prilikah mnogo, in pravil jim je v nauku svojem: 
[4:3] Poslušajte! Glej, izšel je sejavec sejat. 
[4:4] In zgodí se, ko je sejal, padlo je nekaj zrnja poleg ceste; in priletele so tice nebeške in ga pozobale. 
[4:5] A drugo je padlo na skalnata tlá, kjer ni imelo mnogo zemlje, in precej je pognalo, ker ni imelo globoke zemlje. 
[4:6] Ko je pa solnce vzšlo, ovenelo je; in ker ni imelo korenine, usahnilo je. 
[4:7] In drugo je padlo v trnje. In trnje je zrastlo in ga udušilo; in ni dalo sadú. 
[4:8] In drugo je padlo na dobro zemljo, in dajalo je sad, kteri je rastel in se množil, in rodilo je po trideset, in po šestdeset, in po sto. 
[4:9] In reče jim: Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[4:10] Ko je pa ostal sam, vprašajo ga tisti, kteri so bili pri njem z dvanajsterimi, za to priliko. 
[4:11] Pa jim reče: Vam je dano, da spoznate skrivnost kraljestva Božjega; onim pa, ki so zunej, godí se vse v prilikah; 
[4:12] Da vidijo in gledajo, pa ne ugledajo; in slišijo ter poslušajo, pa ne umejo; da se ne bi kedaj spreobrnili, in bi se jim odpustili grehi. 
[4:13] In reče jim: Ne umete li te prilike? a kako boste vse prilike umeli? 
[4:14] Sejavec seje besedo. 
[4:15] Ti so pa, ki so poleg ceste: kjer se seje beseda, in so jo slišali, precej pride satan in vzeme besedo, ktera je posejana v njih srca, 
[4:16] In enako so ti, ki so na skalnata tlá posejani: kteri besedo, ki so jo slišali, precej z veseljem sprejmó; 
[4:17] Pa nimajo korenine v sebi, nego so nestanovitni; potem ko nastane stiska ali preganjanje za voljo besede, pohujšujejo se precej. 
[4:18] In ti so, ki so v trnje posejani: ti so, kteri besedo slišijo; 
[4:19] Pa skrbí tega sveta, in ničemurnost bogastva, in druge slasti se prikradejo, in udušé besedo, in brez sadú je. 
[4:20] In ti so, ki so na dobro zemljo posejani: kteri besedo poslušajo in sprejemajo, ter prinašajo sad, po trideset, in po šestdeset, in po sto. 
[4:21] In reče jim; Prižiga li se sveča, da se pod mernik postavi ali pod posteljo? a ne, da se na svečnik postavi? 
[4:22] Kajti nič ni skrivnega, kar se ne bi razodelo; in nič ni tako skritega, da ne bi prišlo na svetlo. 
[4:23] Če ima kdo ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[4:24] In reče jim: Pomislite, kaj slišite! S kakoršno mero boste merili, merilo se bo vam, in pridalo se bo vam, ki poslušate. 
[4:25] Kajti kdor ima, dalo mu se bo; a kdor nima, odvzelo mu se bo tudi to, ka ima. 
[4:26] In reče: Tako je kraljestvo Božje, kakor človek, če vrže seme v zemljo, 
[4:27] In spí in vstaja po noči in po dnevu, in seme poganja, in raste, da ne vé on. 
[4:28] Kajti zemlja sama od sebe rodí, najprej travo, potem klas, potem polno pšenico v klasu. 
[4:29] Ko pa sad dozorí, precej pošlje srp; kajti nastala je žetev. 
[4:30] In reče: Komu bomo primerili kraljestvo Božje? ali v kakošnej priliki ga bomo upodobili? 
[4:31] Ono je, kakor zrno gorušično, ktero je, ko se vseje v zemljo, manjše od vseh semen, ktera so na zemlji; 
[4:32] In ko je vsejano, raste, in postane veče od vseh zelišč, in dela velike veje, da se morejo pod senco njegovo tice nebeške nastanjevati. 
[4:33] In v mnogih takošnih prilikah jim je govoril besedo, ko so jo mogli poslušati. 
[4:34] Brez prilike jim pa ni govoril; a posebej je učencem svojim razlagal vse. 
[4:35] In reče jim tisti dan, ko se je zvečerilo: Prepeljimo se na oni kraj. 
[4:36] In zapustivši ljudstvo, vzemó ga, kakor je bil v ladji; bile so pa tudi druge ladjice ž njim. 
[4:37] Kar nastane vélik vihar od vetra; in valovi so se vlivali v ladjo, da se je uže napolnjevala. 
[4:38] In on je bil na krmi, spé na vzglavji; in zbudé ga, in rekó mu: Učenik, ali ti ni nič mar, da pogibamo? 
[4:39] In vstavši, zapretí vetru, in reče morju; Umolkni, umiri se! In nehal je veter, in nastala je velika tihota. 
[4:40] In reče jim: Kaj ste tako plašni? Kako, da nimate vere? 
[4:41] In uplašili so se z velikim strahom, in govorili so med seboj: Kdo vendar je ta, da sta mu tudi veter in morje pokorna? 
[5:1] Ter pridejo na drugo stran morja, v okolico Gadarensko. 
[5:2] In precej, ko stopi iz ladje, sreča ga človek iz grobov, kteri je imel nečistega duha, 
[5:3] In je prebivališče imel v grobih; in tudi z verigami ga ni mogel nihče zvezati: 
[5:4] Kajti bil je velikokrat z oklepami in verigami zvezan, pa je verige potrgal in oklepe polomil, in nihče ga ni mogel ukrotiti. 
[5:5] In vedno, po noči in po dnevu, bil je po gorah in po grobih, ter je kričal in se bíl s kamenjem. 
[5:6] Ugledavši pa Jezusa oddaleč, steče, ter mu se pokloni. 
[5:7] In zakričavši z močnim glasom, reče: Kaj imam s teboj, Jezus, sin Boga najvišega? Zaklinjam te pri Bogu, ne muči me! 
[5:8] (Govoril mu je namreč: Izidi, nečisti duh, iz tega človeka.) 
[5:9] In vpraša ga: Kako ti je ime? Pa odgovorí in reče: Legeon mi je ime, ker nas je mnogo. 
[5:10] In prosil ga je zeló, naj jih ne izžene iz tega kraja. 
[5:11] Bila je pa tam pri gorah velika čreda svinj, ktere so se pasle; 
[5:12] In zaprosijo ga vsi hudiči, govoreč: Dovoli nam, da vnidemo va-nje. 
[5:13] In Jezus jim precej dovoli. In duhovi nečisti izidejo in vnidejo v svinje; in zakadí se čreda z brega v morje – bilo jih je pa kaki dve tisoči – ter potonejo v morji. 
[5:14] Tisti pa, ki so svinje pasli, pobegnejo, in oznanijo po mestu in po vaséh. Pa izidejo, da pogledajo, kaj bi to bilo, kar se je zgodilo. 
[5:15] In pridejo k Jezusu, in ugledajo obsedenca, da sedí in je oblečen in pameten, tistega, ki je imel legeon, in preplašijo se. 
[5:16] In povedó jim tisti, kteri so bili videli, kako se je zgodilo obsedencu, in o svinjah. 
[5:17] In začnó ga prositi, naj odide iž njih krajev. 
[5:18] In ko stopi na ladjo, prosil ga je obsedenec, da bi bil ž njim. 
[5:19] Jezus mu pa ne dopustí, nego mu reče: Pojdi na dom svoj k svojim, in naznani jim, kaj ti je Gospod storil, in kako se te je usmilil. 
[5:20] Ter odide in začne oznanjevati po Deseterih mestih, kaj mu je storil Jezus; in vsi so se čudili. 
[5:21] In ko se prepelje Jezus v ladji zopet na drugo stran, zbere se pri njem mnogo ljudstva; in bil je pri morji. 
[5:22] In glej, eden od starešin shajališča, po imenu Jair, pride in ko ga ugleda, pade mu pred noge; 
[5:23] In prosil ga je zeló, govoreč: Hči mi umira; pridi, polóži na njo roké, da ozdravi in bo živa. 
[5:24] Pa odide ž njim; in šlo je za njim mnogo ljudstva, in stiskali so ga. 
[5:25] In neka žena, ktera je imela krvotok dvanajst let, 
[5:26] In je mnogo pretrpela od mnogih zdravnikov, in potrošila vse svoje; pa jej ni nič pomagalo, nego je še huje bilo; 
[5:27] Prišla je, slišavši za Jezusa, med ljudstvom od zadi in se je dotaknila obleke njegove. 
[5:28] Kajti djala je: Če se le obleke njegove dotaknem, ozdravela bom. 
[5:29] In precej je usahnil vir krvi njene, in spoznala je po životu, da je ozdravela od bolezni. 
[5:30] In začutivši Jezus precej po sebi, da je moč iž njega izšla, reče, obrnivši se med ljudstvom: Kdo se je dotaknil moje obleke? 
[5:31] Pa mu rekó učenci njegovi: Saj vidiš ljudstvo, da te stiska, pa praviš: Kdo se me je dotaknil? 
[5:32] In oziral se je okoli, da bi ugledal tisto, ktera je to storila. 
[5:33] Žena pa, vedoč, kaj jej se je zgodilo, uplašena in trepetaje pristopi, in pred njim pade in mu pové vso resnico. 
[5:34] On jej pa reče: Hči, vera tvoja ti je pomogla; pojdi v miru, in bodi zdrava od nadloge svoje. 
[5:35] In ko je še govoril, pridejo od starešine shajališčnega, govoreč: Hči tvoja je umrla; čemu nadleguješ še učeniku? 
[5:36] Jezus pa precej, ko je slišal besedo, ktero so povedali, reče starešini: Ne boj se, le veruj! 
[5:37] In ni pustil nikomur, da bi šel za njim, razen Petru in Jakobu in Janezu bratu Jakobovemu. 
[5:38] In pride v starešinovo hišo, in ugleda hrup in tiste, kteri so mnogo jokali in hrumeli. 
[5:39] In ko vnide, reče jim: Kaj hrumite in jokate? Deklica ni umrla, nego spí. 
[5:40] In posmehovali so mu se. On pa izžene vse, in vzeme očeta in mater deklice, in te, kteri so bili ž njim, in vnide, kjer je deklica ležala. 
[5:41] In prijemši deklico za roko, velí jej: Talita, kumi! to se tolmači: Deklica, (pravim ti,) vstani! 
[5:42] In precej je vstala deklica in hodila; imela je pa dvanajst let; in začudijo se z velikim čudom. 
[5:43] In zapové jim zeló, naj nikdor ne zvé tega; in reče, naj jej dadó jesti. 
[6:1] In izide odtod, in pride v domovino svojo; in za njim so šli učenci njegovi. 
[6:2] In ko je bila sobota, jel je v shajališči učiti; in mnogi poslušalci so strmeli, govoreč: Odkod temu to? in kakošna je ta modrost, ki mu je dana, da se tudi takošni čudeži z rokami njegovimi delajo? 
[6:3] Ali ni ta tesar, sin Marijin, brat pa Jakobov in Jozejev in Judov in Simonov? in niso li sestre njegove tu med nami? In pohujševali so se nad njim. 
[6:4] Jezus jim pa reče: Nikjer ni prerok brez časti, razen v domovini svojej, in pri rodbini in na domu svojem. 
[6:5] In ni mogel ondej nobenega čudeža storiti, razen da je malo bolnikov, položivši na nje roke, uzdravil. 
[6:6] In čudil se je njih neveri: in hodil je okoli po vaséh in učil. 
[6:7] Pa pokliče k sebi dvanajstere, in začne jih razpošiljati po dva in dva, in dajal jim je oblast nad duhovi nečistimi. 
[6:8] In zapové jim, naj ničesar ne jemljó na pot razen same palice; ne torbe, ne kruha, ne v pasu denarja; 
[6:9] Nego da naj si obujejo opanke, in naj ne oblačijo dveh sukenj. 
[6:10] In govoril jim je: Kjerkoli vnidete v hišo, tam ostanite, dokler ne izidete odondod. 
[6:11] In kterikoli vas ne bi sprejeli in vas ne poslušali, gredé odondod otresite prah izpod nog svojih, njim za pričo. Resnično vam pravim: Laže bo Sodomi ali Gomori v dan sodbe, nego tistemu mestu. 
[6:12] In ko so odšli, oznanjevali so ljudém, naj se spokoré. 
[6:13] In izganjali so mnogo hudičev, in mazali z oljem mnogo bolnikov, in uzdravljali. 
[6:14] In slišal je to kralj Herod (kajti ime njegovo se je bilo razglasilo), in pravil je: Janez Krstnik je od mrtvih vstal, in za to se godé čudeži po njem. 
[6:15] Drugi so govorili: Elija je; a drugi so pravili: Prerok je, ali kakor kteri od prerokov. 
[6:16] Slišavši pa to Herod, reče: Ta je tisti Janez, kteremu sem jaz glavo odsekal, on je vstal od mrtvih. 
[6:17] Kajti ta Herod je bil poslal in vjel Janeza, ter ga vklenil v ječi, zavoljo Herodijade, svojega brata Filipa žene, da se je ž njo oženil; 
[6:18] Kajti Janez je djal Herodu: Ne smeš imeti svojega brata žene. 
[6:19] Herodijada ga je pa zalezovala, in hotela ga je umoriti; pa ni mogla. 
[6:20] Kajti Herod se je bal Janeza, vedoč, da je on pravičen in svet mož, ter ga je varoval; in mnogo je delal, kakor mu je on rekel, in rad ga je poslušal. 
[6:21] In ko je napočil priložen dan, da je Herod v spomin svojega rojstva večerjo napravil svojim knezom in stotnikom in Galilejskim prvakom, 
[6:22] Ter je prišla noter Herodijadina hči in plesala in se prikupila Herodu in gostom, reče kralj dekletu: Prosi me, karkoli hočeš, in dal ti bom. 
[6:23] In priseže jej: Karkoli me boš prosila, dal ti bom, noter do polovice kraljestva mojega. 
[6:24] Ona pa izide in reče materi svojej: Ktero reč ga bom prosila? Ona pa reče: Glavo Janeza Krstnika. 
[6:25] Ter vnide precej jadrno h kralju in ga zaprosi, govoreč: Hočem, da mi daj pri tej priči v skledi glavo Janeza Krstnika. 
[6:26] In kralj postane žalosten; pa za voljo prisege in gostov jej ni hotel odreči. 
[6:27] In precej pošlje kralj rabeljna, in zapové prinesti glavo njegovo. 
[6:28] Ta pa odide in mu odseka v ječi glavo, in prinese glavo njegovo v skledi, in dá jo dekletu; a dekle jo dá materi svojej. 
[6:29] In slišavši to učenci njegovi, pridejo in vzemó truplo njegovo, ter ga denejo v grob. 
[6:30] In snidejo se aposteljni pri Jezusu in mu vse sporočé, in to, kar so storili in ljudi naučili. 
[6:31] Pa jim reče: Pojdite vi sami na samoten kraj, in malo počijte. Kajti bilo jih je veliko, kteri so prihajali in odhajali, in še jesti niso utegnili. 
[6:32] Ter odidejo na ladji v samoten kraj sami. 
[6:33] In videlo jih je ljudstvo, ko so odhajali, in spoznajo ga mnogi; in peš iz vseh mest potekó tje, in prehité jih, in snidejo se k njemu. 
[6:34] In izstopivši, zagleda Jezus mnogo ljudstva, in zasmilijo mu se; kajti bili so kakor ovce, ktere nimajo pastirja. In začne jih učiti mnogo reči. 
[6:35] In ko je bila ura uže pozna, pristopijo k njemu učenci njegovi, govoreč: Samoten je kraj in ura uže pozna; 
[6:36] Razpústi jih, da odidejo v okolne vasí in trge, ter si kupijo kruha, ker nimajo kaj jesti. 
[6:37] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Dajte jim vi jesti. Pa mu rekó: Če odidemo in kupimo za dve sto grošev kruha, ter jim damo jesti? 
[6:38] On jim pa reče: Koliko hlebov imate? Pojdite in poglejte! In zvedevši, rekó: Pet, in dve ribi. 
[6:39] In zapové jim, naj posadé zaporedoma, omizje za omizjem, po zelenej travi. 
[6:40] In posedejo se v vrste, po sto in po petdeset. 
[6:41] In vzemši petere hlebe in tisti dve ribi, ozrè se proti nebu in blagoslovi; ter razlomi hlebe, in dajal je učencem svojim, naj položé pred nje. In dve ribi razdelí vsem. 
[6:42] In jedli so vsi, in nasitili so se. 
[6:43] In pobrali so koscev, dvanajst košev polnih, in ostankov od rib. 
[6:44] In bilo jih je, kteri so jedli hlebe, kakih pet tisoč móž. 
[6:45] In precej prisili učence svoje, naj vstopijo v ladjo in gredó naprej črez morje k Betsajdi, dokler ne razpustí ljudstva. 
[6:46] In ko jih je odpravil, odide na goro molit. 
[6:47] In ko se je zvečerilo, bila je ladja sredi morja, in on sam na zemlji. 
[6:48] In zagleda jih, da se mučijo z veslanjem; bil jim je namreč veter nasproti. In okoli četrte straže po noči pride k njim, hodé po morji; in hotel je iti mimo njih. 
[6:49] Oni pa, videvši ga, da hodi po morji, menili so, da je prikazen, in zakričé: 
[6:50] Kajti vsi so ga zagledali in preplašili se. In precej jih ogovorí in jim reče: Zaupajte; jaz sem, ne bojte se! 
[6:51] In stopi k njim v ladjo, in veter utihne. In zeló so se zavzemali in čudili, 
[6:52] Ker niso umeli tega od hlebov; kajti srce njih je bilo okamenelo. 
[6:53] In ko se prepeljejo, pridejo na zemljo Genezaretsko in potisnejo ladjo h kraju. 
[6:54] In ko stopijo iz ladje, spoznajo ga precej; 
[6:55] Ter obletajo vso tisto okolico, in začnó na posteljah bolnike prinašati, kjer so slišali, da je on. 
[6:56] In kamorkoli je hodil, v trge ali v mesta ali v vasí, pokladali so po ulicah bolnike, in prosili so ga, da bi se le robú obleke njegove dotaknili; in kterikoli so se ga dotikali, ozdravljeni so bili. 
[7:1] In snidejo se pri njem Farizeji in nekteri od pismarjev, kteri so bili prišli iz Jeruzalema; 
[7:2] In videvši nektere učence njegove, da s priprostimi rokami, to je z neumitimi, jedó kruh, zavrnejo jih. 
[7:3] (Kajti Farizeji in vsi Judje ne jedó, dokler s pestjó ne umijejo rok, izpolnjevaje izročilo starijih. 
[7:4] In prišedši s trga, ne jedó, dokler se ne umijejo; in mnogo drugih je rečî, ktere so sprejeli, in jih izpolnjujejo: umivanje kupic in vrčev in kotlov in klopî.) 
[7:5] Na to ga vprašajo Farizeji in pismarji: Za kaj se učenci tvoji ne ravnajo po izročilu starijih, nego z neumitimi rokami jedó kruh? 
[7:6] On jim pa odgovorí in reče: Lepo je prerokoval Izaija za vas hinavce, kakor je pisano: "To ljudstvo me z ustnicami spoštuje, srce njih je pa daleč od mene. 
[7:7] Ali zastonj me časté, učeč nauke, zapovedi človeške." 
[7:8] Kajti opustivši zapoved Božjo, izpolnjujete postave človeške, umivanje vrčev in kupic, in mnogo drugih tém podobnih rečî počinjate. 
[7:9] In reče jim: Lepo zametujete zapoved Božjo, da izročilo svoje ohranite. 
[7:10] Mojzes namreč je rekel: "Spoštuj očeta svojega in mater svojo." In: "Kdor preklinja očeta ali mater, naj s smrtjo pogine." 
[7:11] Vi pa pravite: Če reče človek očetu ali materi: Korban! (to je: Dar je,) s čimer ti pomorem. 
[7:12] In ne puščate mu nič več storiti očetu svojemu ali materi svojej, 
[7:13] Zametovaje besedo Božjo za voljo postave svoje, ktero ste postavili; in mnogo tém podobnih rečî počinjate. 
[7:14] In poklicavši vse ljudstvo, reče jim: Poslušajte me vsi, in umejte! 
[7:15] Nič ne more človeka oskruniti, kar od zunej v njega prihaja; nego to, kar izhaja iž njega, to je, kar skruni človeka. 
[7:16] Če ima kdo ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[7:17] In ko vnide od ljudstva proč v hišo, vpraševali so ga učenci njegovi za to priliko. 
[7:18] Pa jim reče: Ali ste tudi vi tako nerazumni? Ne umete li, da vse to, kar od zunej v človeka prihaja, ne more ga oskruniti? 
[7:19] Ker ne gre v srce njegovo, nego v trebuh; in izhaja ven, čisteč vse jedí. 
[7:20] Reče pa: Kar iz človeka izhaja, to ga skruni. 
[7:21] Kajti od znotrej, iz srca človeškega izhajajo hudobne misli, prešestva, kurbarije, poboji; 
[7:22] Kraje, lakomnost, hudobnost, zvijača, nečistost, hudobno oko, preklinjanje Boga, napuh, nespametnost. 
[7:23] Vse te hudobne rečí od znotrej izhajajo, in skrunijo človeka. 
[7:24] In vstavši odtod, odide v Tirske in Sidonske kraje. In vstopivši v hišo, ni hotel, da bi kdo zvedel za-nj; ali ni se mogel prikriti. 
[7:25] Kajti slišavši za-nj žena, ktere hči je imela duha nečistega, pride in mu pade pred noge. 
[7:26] Bila je pa žena Grkinja, Sirofeničanka po rodu; in prosila ga je, naj bi izgnal hudiča iz hčeri njéne. 
[7:27] Jezus jej pa reče: Pojenjaj, naj se poprej nasitijo otroci; ker ni lepo, da se vzeme kruh otrokom, in se vrže psom. 
[7:28] Ona pa odgovorí in mu reče: Dà, gospod! ali tudi psi pod mizo jedó od drobtin otrók. 
[7:29] Pa jej reče: Za voljo té besede, pojdi; izšel je hudič iz hčeri tvoje. 
[7:30] In odšedši na dom svoj, našla je, da je izšel hudič iž nje, in hčer je ležala na postelji. 
[7:31] In Jezus izide zopet iz Tirskih in Sidonskih predelov, in pride h Galilejskemu morju, po sredi predelov Deseterih mest. 
[7:32] In pripeljejo mu gluhega in mutastega, ter ga zaprosijo, naj bi položil na-nj roko. 
[7:33] In vzemši ga od ljudstva proč na stran, položí prste svoje v ušesa njegova, in pljune in se dotakne jezika njegovega 
[7:34] In pogledavši na nebo, vzdihne in mu reče: Efata, to je: Odpri se! 
[7:35] In precej se odpró ušesa njegova; in razveže se vez jezika njegovega, in govoril je prav. 
[7:36] In zapové jim, naj nikomur ne povedó; ali bolj ko jim je prepovedoval, bolj so oznanjevali. 
[7:37] In presilno so se čudili, govoreč: Vse je dobro naredil; gluhim nareja, da slišijo, in mutastim, da govoré. 
[8:1] Tiste dní, ko je bilo vse polno ljudstva pri njem, in niso imeli kaj jesti, pokliče Jezus učence svoje, in reče jim: 
[8:2] Ljudstvo mi se smili; kajti uže tri dni so pri meni, in nimajo kaj jesti; 
[8:3] In če jih pustim lačne na njih dom, oslabeli bodo na poti; kajti nekteri od njih so daleč prišli. 
[8:4] Pa mu odgovoré učenci njegovi: Odkod bi jih mogel kdo tu v puščavi nasititi s kruhom? 
[8:5] In vpraša jih: Koliko imate hlebov? Oni pa rekó: Sedem. 
[8:6] Pa zapové ljudstvu, naj se posedejo po tleh. In vzemši sedmere hlebe, zahvali, in prelomi, in dajal je učencem svojim, naj položé pred nje in položili so pred ljudstvo. 
[8:7] In imeli so malo rib; in blagoslovivši jih, reče, naj položé tudi té pred nje. 
[8:8] Ter so jedli in nasitili se; in pobrali so ostanke koscev, sedem košev. 
[8:9] Bilo jih je pa, kteri so jedli, kake štiri tisoči; in razpustí jih. 
[8:10] In precej vstopi v ladjo z učenci svojimi, in pride v Dalmanutske kraje. 
[8:11] Pa izidejo Farizeji, in začnó se ž njim prepirati, in zahtevali so od njega znamenje z neba, izkušajoč ga. 
[8:12] In vzdihnivši z duhom svojim, reče: Kaj zahteva ta rod znamenja? Resnično vam pravim: Ne bo se dalo znamenje temu zarodu. 
[8:13] In pustivši jih, stopi precej v ladjo, in odide na drugo stran. 
[8:14] Pozabili so pa vzeti kruha, in niso imeli več kakor en hleb s seboj v ladji. 
[8:15] In naročal jim je, govoreč: Glejte, varujte se kvasú Farizejskega in kvasú Herodovega. 
[8:16] In premišljevali so sami s seboj, govoreč: Kruha nimamo. 
[8:17] In ko Jezus to spazi, reče jim: Kaj premišljujete, da nimate kruha? Ali še ne spoznate, in ne umete? ali imate še okamenjeno srce svoje? 
[8:18] Očí imate, in ne vidite? ušesa imate, in ne slišite? in ne pomnite li? 
[8:19] Ko sem pet hlebov razlomil med pet tisoči, koliko polnih košev ste nabrali drobtin? Rekó mu: Dvanajst. 
[8:20] Ko sem jih pa sedem med štiri tisoči, koliko polnih košev ste nabrali drobtin? Oni pa rekó: Sedem. 
[8:21] In reče jim: Kako ne umete? 
[8:22] In pride v Betsajdo. In pripeljejo mu slepca, in zaprosijo ga, naj se ga dotakne. 
[8:23] In prijemši slepca za roko, izpelje ga ven iz vasí; ter pljune v očí njegove, in položivši roke na-nj, vpraša ga, če kaj vidi? 
[8:24] Pa spregleda, in reče: Vidim ljudí, da kakor drevesa okoli hodijo. 
[8:25] Potem položí zopet roke na očí njegove, in reče mu, naj pogleda. In ozdravel je, in videl je bistro vse. 
[8:26] In odpravi ga na dom njegov, govoreč: Ne hodi ne v vas, in tudi nikomur v vasi ne povéj. 
[8:27] Ter izide Jezus, in učenci njegovi v vasí Cezareje Filipove; in po poti je vpraševal učence svoje, govoreč jim: Kdo pravijo ljudjé, da sem jaz? 
[8:28] Oni mu pa odgovoré: Janez Krstnik; in drugi: Elija; drugi pa: Eden od prerokov. 
[8:29] In on jim reče: Kdo pa pravite vi, da sem jaz? Peter pa odgovorí in mu reče: Ti si Kristus. 
[8:30] In zapretí jim, naj nikomur ne pripovedujejo za-nj. 
[8:31] In začne jih učiti, da mora sin človečji mnogo pretrpeti, in zavržen biti od starešin in vélikih duhovnov in pismarjev, in umorjen biti, in v treh dnéh od smrti vstati. 
[8:32] In to besedo je govoril srčno. In Peter ga prime, in začne ga odvračati. 
[8:33] On se pa obrne, in pogledavši učence svoje, zapretí Petru, govoreč: Poberi se od mene, satan! ker ne misliš, kar je Božje, nego kar je človeško. 
[8:34] In poklicavši ljudstvo z učenci svojimi, reče jim: Kdor hoče za menoj iti, zatají naj samega sebe, in vzeme križ svoj, in gre za menoj. 
[8:35] Kajti kdor hoče življenje svoje ohraniti, izgubil ga bo; kdor pa izgubi življenje svoje za voljo mene in evangelja, ta ga bo ohranil. 
[8:36] Kaj namreč pomaga človeku, če ves svet pridobí, duši svojej pa škoduje? 
[8:37] Ali kaj bo dal človek v zameno za dušo svojo? 
[8:38] Kajti kdor se sramuje mene in besed mojih v tem prešestnem in grešnem rodu, sramoval se bo tudi sin človečji njega, kedar bo prišel v slavi očeta svojega z angelji svetimi. 
[9:1] In reče jim: Resnično vam pravim, da so nekteri med temi, ki stojé tu, kteri ne bodo okusili smrti, dokler ne vidijo kraljestva Božjega, da je prišlo z močjó. 
[9:2] In črez šest dni vzeme Jezus Petra in Jakoba in Janeza, in odpelje jih na visoko goro same posebej; in premení se pred njimi. 
[9:3] In oblačila njegova postanejo svetla, zeló bela kakor sneg, kakor jih belivec na zemlji ne more ubeliti. 
[9:4] In prikaže jim se Elija z Mojzesom, in pogovarjala sta se z Jezusom. 
[9:5] In Peter odgovorí in reče Jezusu: Rabi, dobro nam je tu biti; bomo pa naredili tri šatore: tebi enega, in Mojzesu enega, in Eliju enega. 
[9:6] Ni namreč vedel, kaj govori; kajti bili so zeló uplašeni. 
[9:7] Pa nastane oblak in jih zakrije; in glas pride iz oblaka, govoreč: Ta je sin moj ljubljeni; njega poslušajte. 
[9:8] In nagloma se ozró, in nikogar več niso videli, razen Jezusa samega s seboj. 
[9:9] Ko so pa stopali z gore, zapové jim, naj nikomur ne povedó, kar so videli, dokler sin človečji ne vstane od mrtvih. 
[9:10] In to besedo so ohranili v sebi, in vpraševali so, kaj bi to bilo: od mrtvih vstati? 
[9:11] In vpraševali so ga, govoreč: Saj pravijo pismarji, da mora Elija poprej priti? 
[9:12] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Elija bo prišel res poprej in bo vse uravnal; kakor je tudi pisano za sina človečjega, da mora mnogo pretrpeli in zaničevan biti: 
[9:13] Ali jaz vam pravim, da je tudi Elija prišel, in storili so mu, kar so hoteli, kakor je pisano za-nj. 
[9:14] In prišedši k učencem, ugleda mnogo ljudstva okoli njih, in pismarje, da se ž njimi prepirajo. 
[9:15] In precej vse ljudstvo, ko ga ugleda, ostrmí, in pritekši k njemu, pozdravljali so ga. 
[9:16] Pa vpraša pismarje: Kaj se prepirate ž njimi? 
[9:17] In odgovarjajoč eden izmed ljudstva, reče: Učenik, pripeljal sem k tebi sina svojega, kteri ima duha mutastega. 
[9:18] In kedar ga zgrabi, lomi ga; in on se peni, in škriplje z zobmí svojimi, in suší se. Pa sem djal učencem tvojim, naj bi ga izgnali, in niso mogli. 
[9:19] On mu pa odgovorí in reče: O neverni rod, doklej bom z vami? doklej vas bom trpel? Peljite ga k meni! 
[9:20] In pripeljejo ga k njemu. In ko ga duh ugleda, precej ga strese; in padši na zemljo, valjal se je in penil. 
[9:21] Pa vpraša očeta njegovega: Koliko je časa, kar mu se je to zgodilo? On pa reče: Od mladih nóg. 
[9:22] In velikokrat ga tudi v ogenj vrže ali v vodo, da bi ga pogubil; ali če moreš kaj, pomagaj nam, usmili se nas. 
[9:23] Jezus mu pa reče: Če moreš to verovati, vse je mogoče tistemu, kteri veruje. 
[9:24] In precej zavpije oče mladeničev, in s solzami reče: Verujem, Gospod; pomagaj neveri mojej! 
[9:25] Videvši pa Jezus, da se steka ljudstvo, zapretí duhu nečistemu, govoreč mu: Duh mutasti in gluhi, jaz ti ukazujem, izidi iž njega, in ne vnidi več va-nj. 
[9:26] Pa zakričí in ga močno strese, in izide iž njega. In postal je kakor mrtev, tako, da so mnogi govorili, da je umrl. 
[9:27] Jezus ga pa prime za roko in ga vzdigne; in vstal je. 
[9:28] In ko vnide v hišo, vpraševali so ga učenci njegovi na samem: Za kaj ga mi nismo mogli izgnati? 
[9:29] Pa jim reče: Ta zarod ne more iziti z ničimer, razen z molitvijo in postom. 
[9:30] In izšedši odtod, šli so skupaj skozi Galilejo; in ni hotel, da bi kdo zvedel. 
[9:31] Kajti učil je učence svoje, in pravil jim je: Sin človečji bo izdan v človeške roke, in umorili ga bodo; in ko bo umorjen, vstal bo tretji dan od smrti. 
[9:32] Oni pa niso umeli govora, in bali so se vprašati ga. 
[9:33] In pride v Kapernaum; in ko je bil v hiši, vpraša jih: Kaj ste se po poti med seboj pričkali? 
[9:34] Oni so pa molčali; prepirali so se bili namreč po poti med seboj, kdo je največi. 
[9:35] In ko se je usedel, pokliče dvanajstere, in reče jim: Če kdo hoče biti prvi, naj bo najzadnji od vseh, in vsem služabnik. 
[9:36] In vzemši otročiča, postavi ga sredi njih; in objemši ga, reče jim: 
[9:37] Kdor enega takih otročičev sprejme v ime moje, mene sprejema: in kdor mene sprejme, ne sprejema mene, nego tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[9:38] Pa mu odgovorí Janez in reče: Učenik, videli smo nekoga, da je z imenom tvojim izganjal hudiče, kteri ne hodi za nami; in zabranili smo mu, ker ne hodi za nami. 
[9:39] Jezus mu pa reče: Ne branite mu; kajti nikogar ni, kteri bi storil čudež z imenom mojim, in bi mogel brž slabo govoriti o meni. 
[9:40] Kajti kdor ni zoper nas, z nami je. 
[9:41] Kdorkoli namreč vas napojí s kupico vode v ime moje, ker ste Kristusovi, resnično vam pravim, ne bo izgubil plačila svojega. 
[9:42] In kdor pohujša enega teh malih, kteri verujejo v mé, bilo bi mu bolje, da bi mu se obesil kamen mlinski na vrat, in bi bil vržen v morje. 
[9:43] In če te pohujšuje roka tvoja, odseci jo; bolje ti je brez roke vniti v življenje, nego obe roki imeti, in oditi v pekel, v ogenj neugasljivi, 
[9:44] Kjer njih črv ne umira, in ogenj ne gasne. 
[9:45] In če te noga tvoja pohujšuje, odseci jo; bolje ti je hromemu vniti v življenje, nego obe nogi imeti, in vrženemu bili v pekel, v neugasljivi ogenj, 
[9:46] Kjer njih črv ne umira, in ogenj ne gasne. 
[9:47] In če te oko tvoje pohujšuje, izderi ga; bolje ti je z enim očesom vniti v kraljestvo Božje, nego obe očesi imeti, in vrženemu biti v pekel ognjeni, 
[9:48] Kjer njih črv ne umira, in ogenj ne gasne. 
[9:49] Kajti vsak se bo z ognjem osolil, in vsaka žrtva se bo s soljo osolila. 
[9:50] Dobra je sol; če pa sol neslana postane, s čim jo boste osolili? Imejte v sebi sol, in mir imejte med seboj. 
[10:1] In vstavši odtod, pride v kraje Judejske, skozi pokrajino za Jordanom; in snide se zopet ljudstvo k njemu; in kakor je imel navado, zopet jih je učil. 
[10:2] Pa pristopijo Farizeji in vprašajo ga, če je dovoljeno možu ženo popustíti, izkušajoč ga. 
[10:3] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Kaj vam je zapovedal Mojzes? 
[10:4] Oni pa rekó: Mojzes je dopustil ločilno pismo napisati, in pustiti jo. 
[10:5] Pa odgovorí Jezus in jim reče: Za voljo trdosrčnosti vaše vam je napisal to postavo; 
[10:6] V začetku stvarjenja pa, moža in ženo ustvaril ju je Bog. 
[10:7] "Za to bo zapustil človek očeta svojega in mater; in pridružil se bo ženi svojej. 
[10:8] In dva bosta eno telo." Tako nista več dva, nego eno telo. 
[10:9] Kar je torej Bog združil, naj človek ne razdružuje. 
[10:10] In v hiši ga zopet učenci njegovi za to vprašajo. 
[10:11] Pa jim reče: Kdor popustí ženo svojo in se oženi z drugo, prešestvuje proti njej; 
[10:12] In če žena popustí moža svojega in se omoží z drugim, prešestvuje. 
[10:13] In prinašali so k njemu otročiče, naj bi se jih dotaknil; učenci so pa branili tém, kteri so jih prinašali. 
[10:14] Videvši pa to Jezus, razhudi se, in reče jim: Pustite otročiče, naj pridejo k meni, in ne branite jim; kajti takih je kraljestvo Božje. 
[10:15] Resnično vam pravim: Kdor ne sprejme kraljestva Božjega kakor otrok, ne bo prišel va-nj. 
[10:16] In objemši jih, položí na nje roke in jih blagoslovi. 
[10:17] In ko izide na cesto, pribeží nekdo k njemu, in pokleknivši pred njim, vpraša ga: Dobri učenik, kaj naj storim, da zadobom večno življenje? 
[10:18] Jezus mu pa reče: Kaj me imenuješ dobrega? Nihče ni dober, razen eden, Bog. 
[10:19] Zapovedi znaš: Ne prešestvuj; ne ubijaj; ne kradi; ne pričaj po krivem; ne goljufaj; spoštúj očeta svojega in mater. 
[10:20] On pa odgovorí in mu reče: Učenik, vse to sem izpolnil od mladosti svoje. 
[10:21] Jezus pa pogledavši nanj, poljubi ga in mu reče: Enega ti je še treba: pojdi, prodaj, karkoli imaš, in daj ubogim, in imel boš zaklad na nebu: ter pridi, vzemi križ, in pojdi za menoj. 
[10:22] On pa postane žalosten za voljo te besede, in odide otožen; kajti imel je mnogo premoženja. 
[10:23] In Jezus pogleda okoli, in reče učencem svojim: Kako težko bodo prišli tisti, kteri imajo bogastvo, v kraljestvo Božje? 
[10:24] Učenci so se pa zavzemali nad besedami njegovimi. Jezus pa zopet odgovorí in jim reče: Otroci, kako težko je tistim, kteri zaupajo bogastvu, v kraljestvo Božje vniti! 
[10:25] Laže je priti kameli skozi igelno ušesce, nego bogatemu vniti v kraljestvo Božje. 
[10:26] Oni so se pa na vso moč čudili, govoreč med seboj: In kdo se more zveličati? 
[10:27] Jezus pa pogleda na nje, in reče: Pri ljudéh je nemogoče, ali ne pri Bogu; kajti vse je mogoče pri Bogu. 
[10:28] In začne mu Peter praviti: Glej, mi smo zapustili vse in smo šli za teboj. 
[10:29] Jezus pa odgovorí in reče: Resnično vam pravim, nikogar ni, kteri je zapustil hišo, ali brate, ali sestre, ali očeta, ali mater, ali ženo, ali otroke, ali njive, za voljo mene in evangelja, 
[10:30] Da ne bi prejel sedaj na tem svetu stokrat toliko, hiš in bratov in sester in mater in otrók in njiv, s preganjanjem, na drugem pa večnega življenja. 
[10:31] Mnogi pa, kteri so prvi, bodo zadnji, in kteri so zadnji, prvi. 
[10:32] Bili so pa na poti, gredoč v Jeruzalem; in Jezus je šel pred njimi, in oni so se čudili, in gredoč za njim, bali so se. In vzemši zopet dvanajstere, začne jim praviti, kaj mu se ima zgoditi: 
[10:33] Glej, v Jeruzalem gremo, in sin človečji bo izdan vélikim duhovnom in pismarjem, in obsodili ga bodo na smrt, in izročili nevernikom, 
[10:34] In zasramovali ga bodo, in bičali ga, in pljuvali na-nj, in umorili ga bodo; a tretji dan bo vstal od smrti. 
[10:35] Pa pristopita k njemu Jakob in Janez, sina Zebedejeva, govoreč: Učenik! hočeva, da nama stóri, kar bova prosila. 
[10:36] On jima pa reče: Kaj hočeta, da naj vama storím? 
[10:37] Ona mu pa rečeta: Daj nama, da sedeva eden tebi na desno, in eden tebi na levo v slavi tvojej. 
[10:38] Jezus jima pa reče: Ne vésta, kaj prosita. Moreta li piti kelih, kterega jaz pijem, in krstiti se s krstom, s kterim se jaz krstim? 
[10:39] Ona mu pa rečeta: Moreva. In Jezus jima reče: Kelih, kterega jaz pijem, bosta pila; in s krstom, s kterim se jaz krstim, bosta se krstila. 
[10:40] Da bi pa sedla meni na desno in meni na levo, ne morem jaz dati, nego to se bo dalo tém, kterim je pripravljeno. 
[10:41] In slišavši to deseteri, začnó se jeziti nad Jakobom in Janezom. 
[10:42] Jezus jih pa pokliče, in reče jim: Véste, da tisti, kteri menijo vladati nad narodi, nad njimi gospodujejo; a poglavarji njih imajo oblast nad njimi. 
[10:43] Ne bo pa tako med vami: nego kdorkoli hoče velik postati med vami, naj vam bo služabnik; 
[10:44] In kdorkoli od vas hoče postati prvi, bodi vsem hlapec. 
[10:45] Kajti tudi sin človečji ni prišel, da bi mu služili, nego da služi, in dá življenje svoje za odkup mnogim. 
[10:46] In pridejo v Jeriho. In ko so šli iz Jerihe, on in učenci njegovi, in obilno ljudstva, sedel je sin Timejev slepi Bartimej kraj poti in je prosil. 
[10:47] In ko sliši, da je Jezus Nazarečan, začne vpiti in govoriti: Sin Davidov, Jezus, usmili se me! 
[10:48] In mnogi so mu pretili, naj umolkne; on je pa še veliko bolj kričal: Sin Davidov, usmili se me! 
[10:49] In Jezus se ustavi, in reče, naj ga pokličejo. Pa pokličejo slepca, govoreč mu: Ne boj se! Vstani; kliče te. 
[10:50] On pa, zagnavši s sebe plašč svoj, vstane, in pride k Jezusu. 
[10:51] In Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Kaj hočeš, naj ti storím? Slepec mu pa reče: Rabi, da spregledam! 
[10:52] Jezus mu pa reče: Pojdi; vera tvoja ti je pomogla. In precej je spregledal, in šel je za Jezusom po poti. 
[11:1] In ko so se približevali Jeruzalemu, Betfagi in Betaniji pri Oljskej gori, pošlje dva izmed učencev svojih, 
[11:2] In reče jima: Pojdita v vas, ki vama je nasproti; in precej, ko prideta va-njo, našla bosta žrebe privezano, na kterem ni noben človek sedel: odvežita ga, in pripeljita. 
[11:3] In če vama kdo reče: Kaj delata to? recita: Gospod ga potrebuje; in precej ga bo poslal sém. 
[11:4] Ter odideta, in najdeta žrebe privezano pri vratih zunej na razpotji, in odvežeta ga. 
[11:5] In nekteri tistih, ki so ondej stali, rekó jima: Kaj odvezujeta žrebe? 
[11:6] Ona jim pa rečeta, kakor je bil Jezus naročil: in pusté ju. 
[11:7] Ter pripeljeta žrebe k Jezusu, in denejo na-nj oblačila svoja: in usede se na-nj. 
[11:8] Mnogi pa pogrnejo oblačila svoja po cesti; a drugi so sekali veje z dreves, ter jih stlali po poti. 
[11:9] In kteri so šli pred njim, in kteri so šli za njim, vpili so, govoreč: Hosana; Blagoslovljen, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem! 
[11:10] Blagoslovljeno kraljestvo očeta našega Davida, ktero gre v imenu Gospodovem! Hosana na višavah! 
[11:11] In Jezus vnide v Jeruzalem, in v tempelj; in ko je vse pregledal, odide, ker je bil uže večer, z dvanajsterimi v Betanijo. 
[11:12] In ko so drugi dan šli iz Betanije, postane lačen. 
[11:13] In ugledavši od daleč smokvo, ktera je imela listje, pride, ako bi kaj našel na njej. Ali prišedši k njej, ne najde ničesar razen listje: ker ni bil čas za smokve. 
[11:14] In Jezus odgovorí in jej reče: Naj na vekomaj nikoli nihče s tebe sadú ne jé! In slišali so ga učenci njegovi. 
[11:15] In pridejo v Jeruzalem. In ko stopi Jezus v tempelj, začne izganjati tiste, kteri so v tempeljnu prodajali in kupovali; in mize menjalcev in stole tistih, kteri so prodajali golobe, prevrne. 
[11:16] In ni pustil, da bi kdo nesel posodo skozi tempelj. 
[11:17] In učil je, govoreč jim: Mar ni pisano: "Dom moj naj se imenuje dom molitve vsem narodom?" A vi ste naredili iz njega "jamo razbojniško". 
[11:18] In slišali so pismarji in véliki duhovni, in iskali so, kako bi ga pogubili; kajti bali so se ga, ker se je vse ljudstvo čudilo nauku njegovemu. 
[11:19] In ko se je zvečerilo, šel je ven iz mesta. 
[11:20] In gredoč zjutraj mimo, ugledajo smokvo, da se je posušila s korenino. 
[11:21] In spomene se Peter, in reče mu: Rabi, glej, smokva, ktero si preklel, posušila se je. 
[11:22] Pa odgovorí Jezus in jim reče: Imejte vero Božjo! 
[11:23] Kajti resnično vam pravim: Če kdo reče tej gori: Vzdigni se, in vrzi se v morje! in ne dvomi v srcu svojem, nego veruje, da se bo zgodilo, kar pravi, zgodilo mu se bo, karkoli poreče. 
[11:24] Za to vam pravim: Vse, karkoli v molitvi svojej prosite, verujte, da boste prejeli, in zgodilo vam se bo. 
[11:25] In kedar se vstopite k molitvi, odpustite, če zoper koga kaj imate; da tudi oče vaš, ki je na nebesih, odpustí vam vaše grehe. 
[11:26] Če pa vi ne odpuščate, tudi vam ne bo odpustil oče vaš, ki je na nebesih, vaših grehov. 
[11:27] In pridejo zopet v Jeruzalem. In ko se je po tempeljnu sprehajal, pridejo k njemu véliki duhovni in pismarji in starešine, 
[11:28] In rekó mu: S kakošno oblastjo delaš to? in kdo ti je dal to oblast, da to delaš? 
[11:29] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Vprašal bom tudi jaz vas eno besedo; in odgovorite mi, pa vam bom povedal, s kakošno oblastjo to delam. 
[11:30] Krst Janezov, je li bil z nebes, ali od ljudî? Odgovorite mi! 
[11:31] In premišljevali so sami s seboj, govoreč: Če rečemo: Z nebes, poreče: Za kaj mu torej niste verovali? 
[11:32] Bi li rekli: Od ljudî? Bali so se ljudstva; kajti vsi so mislili za Janeza, da je bil res prerok. 
[11:33] Pa odgovoré in rekó Jezusu: Ne vemo. In Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Tudi jaz vam ne povem, s kakošno oblastjo to delam. 
[12:1] In začne jim v prilikah govoriti: Zasadil je človek vinograd, in ogradil ga je s plotom, in izkopal je klet in sezidal stolp, in izročil ga je vinogradnikom, ter je odpotoval. 
[12:2] In ko je bil čas, pošlje do vinogradnikov hlapca, da bi od vinogradnikov prejel od sadú vinogradovega. 
[12:3] Oni ga pa zgrabijo, in pretepó in pošljejo praznega. 
[12:4] In zopet pošlje k njim drugega hlapca; in tega kamenjajo in mu razbijejo glavo, in pošljejo usramotenega. 
[12:5] In zopet pošlje drugega; in tega ubijejo. In mnogo drugih, od kterih so nektere pretepli, a nektere pobili. 
[12:6] Imajoč torej še edinega sina svojega ljubljenega pošlje naposled tudi tega k njim, govoreč: Sina mojega se bodo bali. 
[12:7] Oni pa, vinogradniki, rekó med seboj: Ta je dedič. Pridite, ubijmo ga, in naš bo vinograd. 
[12:8] Ter ga zgrabijo in ubijejo, in vržejo ven iz vinograda. 
[12:9] Kaj bo torej storil gospodar vinograda? Prišel bo in bo vinogradnike pogubil, in vinograd bo izročil drugim. 
[12:10] Niste li tega pisma brali? "Kamen, kterega so zidarji zavrgli, on je postal glava oglu; 
[12:11] Od Gospoda se je zgodilo to, in čudno je v očéh naših." 
[12:12] In gledali so, da bi ga vjeli; ali zbojé se ljudstva. Spoznali so namreč, da je zoper njih priliko povedal. In pustivši ga, odidejo. 
[12:13] In pošljejo k njemu nekteri od Farizejev in Herodovcev, da bi ga vjeli v besedi. 
[12:14] Oni pa pristopijo in mu rekó: Učenik! vémo, da si pravičen in ti ni nikogar mar, ker ne gledaš ljudém na lice, nego v resnici učiš pot Božjo. Ali se sme dati cesarju davek ali ne? bi li dali, ali ne bi dali? 
[12:15] On je pa poznal njih hinavstvo, in reče jim: Kaj me izkušate? Prinesite mi denar, da pogledam. 
[12:16] Oni pa prinesó. In reče jim: Čegava je ta podoba in napis? Oni mu pa rekó: Cesarjeva. 
[12:17] Pa odgovorí Jezus in jim reče: Dajte, kar je cesarjevega, cesarju, in kar je Božjega, Bogu. In začudijo mu se. 
[12:18] Pa pridejo k njmemu Saduceji, kteri pravijo, da ni vstajanja. In vprašajo ga, govoreč: 
[12:19] Učenik! Mojzes nam je napisal: Če komu brat umre, in zapustí ženo, otrók pa ne zapustí, naj vzeme brat njegov ženo njegovo, in zbudí seme bratu svojemu. 
[12:20] Bilo je pa sedem bratov; in prvi je vzel ženo, in umrl je, in ni zapustil semena. 
[12:21] In vzel jo je drugi in umrl je, in tudi ta ni zapustil semena. Tudi tretji tako. 
[12:22] In vzeli so jo sedmeri, in niso zapustili semena. Naposled za vsemi je umrla tudi žena. 
[12:23] O vstajanji torej, kedar vstanejo, čegava od njih bo žena? Kajti imeli so jo sedmeri za ženo. 
[12:24] Pa odgovorí Jezus in jim reče: Ne motite li se za to, ker ne znate pisem, ne močí Božje? 
[12:25] Kedar namreč od mrtvih vstanejo, ne ženijo se in ne možé, nego so kakor angelji na nebesih. 
[12:26] Za mrtve pa, da vstajajo, niste li brali v Mojzesovih bukvah, pri grmu, kako mu je Bog rekel, govoreč: "Jaz sem Bog Abrahamov, in Bog Izakov, in Bog Jakobov?" 
[12:27] Ni Bog Bog mrtvih, nego Bog živih; vi se torej zeló motite. 
[12:28] In pristopivši eden od pismarjev, kteri je slišal, kako so se prepirali, in je videl, da jim je dobro odgovoril, vpraša ga: Ktera je prva zapoved od vseh? 
[12:29] Jezus mu pa odgovorí: Prva vseh zapovedi je: "Sliši, Izrael! Gospod naš Bog je edini Gospod. 
[12:30] In ljubi Gospoda Boga svojega iz vsega srca svojega, in iz vse duše svoje, in iz vse pameti svoje, in iz vse moči svoje." Ta je prva zapoved. 
[12:31] In druga podobna ta: "Ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe." Veče od teh ni druge zapovedi. 
[12:32] Pa mu reče pismar: Dobro, učenik! Prav si povedal, da je Bog eden, in da ni drugega razen njega. 
[12:33] In ljubiti ga iz vsega srca, in iz vse pameti, in iz vse duše, in iz vse moči, in bližnjega ljubiti kakor samega sebe: to je več od vseh žrtev in darov. 
[12:34] In Jezus videvši, da je on pametno odgovoril, reče mu: Nisi daleč od kraljestva Božjega. In nihče ga ni smel več vprašati. 
[12:35] In odgovarjajoč Jezus reče, učeč v tempeljnu: Kako pravijo pismarji, da je Kristus sin Davidov? 
[12:36] Kajti sam David je rekel v Duhu svetem: "Rekel je Gospod gospodu mojemu: Sédi meni na desno, dokler ne položim sovražnikov tvojih nogam tvojim za podnožje." 
[12:37] Sam David ga torej imenuje gospoda, in odkod je sin njegov? In obilno ljudstvo ga je rado poslušalo. 
[12:38] In govoril jim je v nauku svojem: Varujte se pismarjev, kteri hočejo v dolgih suknjah hoditi, in ljubijo pozdrave po ulicah, 
[12:39] In prve stole po shajališčih, in prve prostore na gostijah; 
[12:40] Kteri požirajo vdovam hiše, in na videz dolgo molijo: ti bodo prejeli ostrejo sodbo. 
[12:41] In usede se Jezus cerkvenemu zakladu nasproti, in gledal je, kako meče ljudstvo denar v zakladnico; in veliko bogatih je metalo veliko. 
[12:42] In pride ena vdova uboga, in vrže dva denarca, kar je en vinar. 
[12:43] In poklicavši učence svoje, reče jim: Resnično vam pravim, da je ta vdova uboga vrgla več od vseh, kteri mečejo v zakladnico; 
[12:44] Kajti vsi so vrgli od obilnosti svoje; ta je pa od uboštva svojega vrgla vse, kar je imela, ves živež svoj. 
[13:1] In ko je šel iz tempeljna, reče mu eden učencev njegovih: Učenik, glej, kakošno kamenje in kakošne zidine! 
[13:2] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče mu: Vidiš té-le zidine velike? Ne bo ostal kamen na kamenu, kteri se ne bi podrl. 
[13:3] In ko je sedel na Oljskej gori tempeljnu nasproti, vpraševali so ga posebej Peter in Jakob in Janez in Andrej: 
[13:4] Povéj nam, kedaj bo to? in kaj bo znamenje, kedar se ima vse to izpolniti? 
[13:5] Jezus jim pa odgovorí in začne praviti: varujte se, da vas kdo ne premoti! 
[13:6] Kajti veliko jih bo prišlo v ime moje, govoreč: Jaz sem Kristus; in veliko jih bodo premotili. 
[13:7] Kedar pa zaslišite boje in glasove o bojih, ne ustrašite se! Kajti to mora biti. Ali to še ni konec. 
[13:8] Kajti vstal bo narod na narod, in kraljestvo na kraljestvo; in potresi bodo po krajih, in lakote bodo in prekucije. 
[13:9] Začetek nadlogam je to. A vi se varujte! Kajti izročevali vas bodo sodnijam in shajališčem; bičali vas bodo, in pred vladarje in kralje vas popeljejo za voljo mene, njim za pričo. 
[13:10] In pri vseh narodih se mora poprej oznaniti evangelj. 
[13:11] Kedar vas pa popeljejo, da vas izročé, ne skrbite naprej, kaj bi govorili, in ne premišljujte! nego kar vam se bo dalo tisto uro, to govorite: ker ne boste govorili vi, nego Duh sveti. 
[13:12] Izdajal bo pa brat brata na smrt, in oče sina; in otroci bodo vstali zoper roditelje, in morili jih bodo. 
[13:13] In sovražili vas bodo vsi za voljo imena mojega; kdor pa pretrpí do konca, ta se bo zveličal. 
[13:14] A kedar ugledate "gnjusobo razdevanja," za ktero je povedal prerok Danijel, da stojí, kjer ne bi imela, (kdor bere, naj ume!) tedaj naj tisti, kteri so v Judeji, zbežé na gore. 
[13:15] A kdor je na strehi, ne stopaj dol v hišo, in ne hódi noter, da bi kaj vzel iz hiše svoje. 
[13:16] In kdor je na polji, naj se ne vrača, da vzeme plašč svoj. 
[13:17] Gorjé pa nosečim in doječim v tistih dnéh! 
[13:18] Molite pa, naj ne bo beg vaš po zimi. 
[13:19] Kajti tisti dnevi bodo stiska, kakoršne ni bilo od začetka stvarjenja, ktero je stvaril Bog, doslej, in je tudi ne bo. 
[13:20] In ko ne bi bil Gospod prikrajšal dnî, to se ne bi noben človek zveličal; ali za voljo izvoljencev, ktere je izvolil, prikrajšal je dní. 
[13:21] In če vam tedaj kdo reče: Glej, tu je Kristus; ali: Glej, ondej je, ne verjemite. 
[13:22] Kajti vstali bodo lažnjivi kristusi in lažnjivi preroki, in delali bodo znamenja in čudeže, da bi premotili, ko bi bilo mogoče, tudi izvoljence. 
[13:23] A vi se varujte; glej, povedal sem vam vse poprej. 
[13:24] Tiste dní pa, po tej stiski, otemnelo bo solnce in mesec ne bo dajal svetlobe svoje, 
[13:25] In zvezde nebeške bodo padale, in sile, ktere so na nebesih, pregibale se bodo. 
[13:26] In tedaj bodo ugledali sina človečjega, da gre na oblakih z veliko močjó in slavo. 
[13:27] In tedaj bo poslal angelje svoje, in zbral bo izvoljence svoje od čveterih vetrov, od konca zemlje do kraja neba. 
[13:28] A od smokve se naučite priliko: Kedar se veja njena pomladí, in požene liste, véste, da je blizu pomlad; 
[13:29] Tako tudi vi, kedar ugledate, da se te reči godé, védite, da je blizu pri vratih. 
[13:30] Resnično vam pravim, da ne bo prešel ta rod, dokler se vse te reči ne zgodé. 
[13:31] Nebo in zemlja bosta prešla; a besede moje ne bodo nikoli prešle. 
[13:32] Za tisti dan in uro pa nihče ne vé, tudi angelji na nebu ne, tudi sin ne, razen oče. 
[13:33] Pazite, čujte in molite, ker ne véste, kedaj je čas. 
[13:34] Kakor je človek, kteri je odpotoval, zapustil dom svoj, in dal hlapcem svojim oblast, in vsakemu svoje delo, in zapovedal vratarju, da naj čuje. 
[13:35] Čujte torej, (ker ne véste, kedaj bo prišel hišni gospodar zvečer, ali o polnoči, ali o petelinjem petji, ali zjutraj;) 
[13:36] Da ne pride nenadoma, in vas ne najde spéčih. 
[13:37] Kar pa vam pravim, pravim vsem: Čujte! 
[14:1] Bila je pa velika noč in praznik presnih kruhov črez dva dni. In iskali so véliki duhovni in pismarji, kako bi ga z zvijačo vjeli, in umorili. 
[14:2] Govorili so pa: Ne na praznik, da se narod ne spunta. 
[14:3] In ko je bil v Betaniji, v hiši Simona gobavca, in je sedel za mizo, pride žena, ktera je imela sklenico čiste dragocene nardove mire; in razbije sklenico in mu izlije na glavo. 
[14:4] Bili so pa nekteri, kteri so se sami pri sebi hudovali, govoreč: Čemu se je ta potrata mire zgodila? 
[14:5] Kajti to bi se bilo moglo za več kakor sto grošev prodati, in dati se ubogim. In godrnjali so nad njo. 
[14:6] Jezus pa reče; Pustite jo; kaj jej delate skrbí? Dobro delo je storila na meni. 
[14:7] Kajti uboge imate vselej s seboj, in kedar hočete, morete jim dobro storiti; mene pa nimate vselej. 
[14:8] Kar je ona mogla, to je storila; prva je pomazilila telo moje za pokop. 
[14:9] Resnično vam pravim: Kjerkoli po vsem svetu se bo oznanil ta evangelj, povedalo se bo tudi to, kar je ta storila, njej v spomin. 
[14:10] In Juda Iškarijan, eden od dvanajsterih, odide k vélikim duhovnom, da jim ga izda. 
[14:11] Oni pa, ko to slišijo, razveselé se, in obrekó mu dati denarja: in iskal je, kako bi ga priložno izdal. 
[14:12] In prvi dan presnih kruhov, ko so velikonočno jagnje klali, rekó mu učenci njegovi: Kam hočeš, da gremo in pripravimo, da boš jedel velikonočno jagnje? 
[14:13] Pa pošlje dva izmed učencev svojih, in reče jima: Pojdita v mesto; in srečal vaju bo človek, kteri ponese vrč vode. Pojdita za njim, 
[14:14] In kjer vnide, recita gospodarju hiše: Učenik pravi: Kje je gostilnica, kjer bom z učenci svojimi jedel velikonočno jagnje? 
[14:15] In on vama bo pokazal veliko izbo, pogrnjeno in pripravljeno; tam nam priredita. 
[14:16] In učenca njegova izideta, in prideta v mesto, in najdeta, kakor jima je rekel, ter pripravita velikonočno jagnje. 
[14:17] In ko se zvečerí, pride z dvanajsterimi. 
[14:18] In ko so za mizo sedeli in jedli, reče Jezus: Resnično vam pravim, da me bo eden izmed vas, kteri z menoj jé, izdal. 
[14:19] Oni se pa začnó žalostiti, in praviti mu eden za drugim: Ali jaz? in drugi: Ali jaz? 
[14:20] On pa odgovorí in jim reče: Eden od dvanajsterih, kteri omaka z menoj v skledo. 
[14:21] Sin človečji sicer gre, kakor je pisano za-nj; ali gorjé tistemu človeku, kteri sina človečjega izdaja. Bolje bi mu bilo, da se ne bi bil rodil tisti človek. 
[14:22] In ko so jedli, vzeme Jezus kruh, in blagoslovivši, prelomi, in dá jim, in reče: Vzemite, jejte; to je telo moje. 
[14:23] In vzemši kelih, zahvali, in dá jim; in pili so iž njega vsi. 
[14:24] In reče jim: To je kri moja novega zakona, ktera se prelija za mnoge. 
[14:25] Resnično vam pravim, da ne bom več pil od trtnega rodú, do tistega dné, ko ga bom pil novega v kraljestvu Božjem. 
[14:26] In ko so odpeli, odidejo na Oljsko goro. 
[14:27] In reče jim Jezus: Vsi se boste pohujšali to noč od mene. Kajti pisano je: "Pastirja bom udaril, in razkropile se bodo ovce." 
[14:28] Ali po vstajanji svojem pojdem pred vami v Galilejo. 
[14:29] Peter mu pa reče: In če se vsi pohujšajo, jaz ne. 
[14:30] Pa mu reče Jezus: Resnično ti pravim, da nocoj to noč, predno bo petelin dvakrat zapel, zatajil me boš trikrat. 
[14:31] On je pa še bolj pravil: Ko bi moral s teboj vred umreti, nikoli te ne bom zatajil. Tako so tudi vsi govorili. 
[14:32] In pridejo na mesto, kteremu je ime Getsemane; ter reče učencem svojim: Usedite se tu dotlej, da izmolim. 
[14:33] In vzeme Petra in Jakoba in Janeza s seboj. In začne žalovati in obupovati. 
[14:34] In reče jim: Žalostna je duša moja do smrti; ostanite tu, in čujte. 
[14:35] Ter odide malo dalje in pade na zemljo, in molil je, naj bi, če je mogoče, prešla ta ura od njega. 
[14:36] In govoril je: Aba, oče! vse je mogoče tebi. Prenesi ta kelih od mene; ali ne, kar jaz hočem, nego kar ti. 
[14:37] In pride, in najde jih, da spé, ter reče Petru: Simon, spíš? Ali nisi mogel ene ure prečuti? 
[14:38] Čujte in molite, da ne zajdete v izkušnjavo; duh je sicer krepek, ali telo je slabo. 
[14:39] In zopet odide, in molil je, govoreč iste besede. 
[14:40] In ko se vrne, najde jih zopet, da spé (kajti bile so jim oči otežale); in niso vedeli, kaj bi mu odgovorili. 
[14:41] In pride v tretje, in reče jim: Spíte dalje in počivajte! Dosti je; prišla je ura. Glej, sin človečji se izdaja grešnikom v roke. 
[14:42] Vstanite, pojdimo! Glej, izdajalec moj se je približal. 
[14:43] In precej, ko je še govoril, pride Juda, kteri je bil eden od dvanajsterih, in ž njim mnogo ljudstva z meči in koli, od vélikih duhovnov in pismarjev in starešin. 
[14:44] Dal jim je pa izdajalec njegov znamenje, govoreč: Kogar bom poljubil, ta je; zgrabite ga, in odpeljite varno. 
[14:45] In prišedši, pristopi precej k njemu, in reče: Rabi! Rabi! in ga poljubi. 
[14:46] Oni pa položé na-nj roke svoje in ga zgrabijo. 
[14:47] Eden tistih pa, kteri so zraven stali, izdere meč, in mahne hlapca vélikega duhovna in mu odseka uho. 
[14:48] In Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Kakor na razbojnika ste izšli z meči in kôli, lovit me? 
[14:49] Vsak dan sem bil pri vas, učeč v tempeljnu, in niste me zgrabili; ali da se izpolni pismo. 
[14:50] In zapustivši ga, vsi pobegnejo. 
[14:51] In šel je za njim neki mladenič, ograjen s platnom po nagem; in popadejo ga mladeniči. 
[14:52] On pa pustí platno, in odbeží nag od njih. 
[14:53] In Jezusa odpeljejo k vélikemu duhovnu. In snidejo se pri njem vsi véliki duhovni in starešine in pismarji. 
[14:54] In Peter je šel oddaleč za njim, noter na dvor vélikega duhovna; in sedel je s hlapci, ogrevaje se pri ognji. 
[14:55] A véliki duhovni in ves zbor so iskali zoper Jezusa priče, da bi ga umorili; ali ne najdejo je. 
[14:56] Kajti mnogi so pričali po krivem zoper njega, ali enaka niso bila pričevanja. 
[14:57] In vstavši nekteri, pričali so po krivem zoper njega, govoreč: 
[14:58] Mi smo ga slišali, da je djal: Jaz bom podrl ta tempelj, ki je narejen z rokami, in v treh dnéh bom sezidal drugega, kteri ne bo narejen z rokami. 
[14:59] Ali tudi to njih pričevanje ni bilo enako. 
[14:60] In véliki duhoven stopi na sredo, in vpraša Jezusa, govoreč: Ne odgovarjaš li ničesar? Kaj pričajo ti zoper tebe? 
[14:61] On je pa molčal, in ničesar ni odgovoril. Zopet ga vpraša véliki duhoven, in reče mu: Ti si Kristus, sin blagoslovljenega? 
[14:62] Jezus pa reče: Jaz sem. In videli boste sina človečjega, da gre, sedeč na desnici moči, na nebeških oblakih. 
[14:63] Véliki duhoven pa raztrga oblačilo svoje, in reče: Kaj nam je še treba prič? 
[14:64] Slišali ste kletvino zoper Boga; kaj se vam zdí? Oni pa vsi razsodijo, da je vreden smrti. 
[14:65] In nekteri začnó pljuvati na-nj, in zakrivati mu obraz, in bíti ga za uho, in praviti mu: Prerokuj! In hlapci so ga bíli s pestmi. 
[14:66] In ko je bil Peter doli na dvorišči, pride ena od dekel vélikega duhovna, 
[14:67] In videvši Petra, da se ogreva, pogleda na-nj, in reče: Tudi ti si z Nazarečanom Jezusom bil. 
[14:68] On pa tají, govoreč: Ne vém, in ne umem, kaj ti praviš. In izide ven na dvor; in petelin zapoje. 
[14:69] In dekla, videvši ga, začne zopet praviti tém, kteri so zraven stali: Ta je od njih. 
[14:70] On je pa zopet tajil. In malo potem so zopet tisti, ki so zraven stali, pravili Petru: Gotovo si od njih; kajti Galilejec si, in tudi govorica tvoja je podobna. 
[14:71] On se pa začne rotiti in kleti: Ne poznam tega človeka, za kogar pravite. 
[14:72] In drugoč petelin zapoje. In spomene se Peter besede, ktero mu je rekel Jezus: Predno bo petelin dvakrat zapel, zatajil me boš trikrat. In zavije se v oblačilo, in jokal je. 
[15:1] In precej zjutraj se posvetujejo véliki duhovni s starešinami in pismarji, in ves zbor, zvezavši Jezusa, odpeljejo in izročé Pilatu. 
[15:2] In vpraša ga Pilat: Ti si kralj Judovski? On pa odgovorí in mu reče: Ti praviš. 
[15:3] In tožili so ga véliki duhovni veliko. 
[15:4] Pilat ga pa zopet vpraša, govoreč: Ne odgovarjaš li ničesar? Glej, kaj zoper té pričajo. 
[15:5] Ali Jesus mu ni nič več odgovoril, tako, da se je Pilat čudil. 
[15:6] O prazniku jim je pa izpuščal po enega jetnika, kterega so zahtevali. 
[15:7] Bil je pa, kteremu je bilo ime Baraba, s tovariši v ječi, kteri so bili o puntu ubojstvo storili. 
[15:8] In zakričavši ljudsto, začne zahtevati, naj storí, kakor jim je vselej storil. 
[15:9] Pilat jim pa odgovorí in reče: Hočete li, da vam izpustim kralja Judovskega? 
[15:10] Vedel je namreč, da so ga bili iz nevošljivosti izročili véliki duhovni. 
[15:11] Véliki duhovni pa podpihajo ljudstvo, naj jim rajši Baraba izpustí. 
[15:12] Pilat pa zopet odgovorí in jim reče: Kaj torej hočete, da naj storim s tem, ki ga imenujete kralja Judovskega? 
[15:13] Oni pa zopet zakričé: Križaj ga! 
[15:14] Pilat jim pa reče: Kaj pa je hudega storil? Oni pa še bolj zavpijejo: Križaj ga! 
[15:15] Pilat pa, hoteč ljudstvu ustreči, izpustí jim Baraba; in Jezusa biča in izročí, naj ga križajo. 
[15:16] A vojaki ga odpeljejo noter na dvor, to je: v sodnišnico, in skličejo ves trop. 
[15:17] In oblečejo mu škrlaten plašč, in spletó krono iz trnja in jo denejo na-nj. 
[15:18] In začnó ga pozdravljati: Zdrav, kralj Judovski! 
[15:19] In bili so ga po glavi s trstom, in pljuvali so na-nj, in pripogibali so kolena in priklanjali mu se. 
[15:20] In ko mu se nasmejajo, slečejo mu škrlatni plašč, in oblečejo mu lastno njegovo oblačilo; ter ga odpeljejo, da ga križajo. 
[15:21] In prisilijo nekega mimo gredočega Simona Cirenejca, kteri je šel s polja, očeta Aleksandrovega in Rufovega, naj mu ponese križ. 
[15:22] In pripeljejo ga na mesto Golgata, kar se tolmači: Mesto mrtvaške glave. 
[15:23] In dajali so mu piti vina z miro; ali on ni vzel. 
[15:24] In ko so ga na križ razpeli, delili so obleko njegovo, metaje kocko za njo, kdo bo kaj vzel. 
[15:25] Bila je pa ura tri, in razpnó ga na križ. 
[15:26] In bil je napis krivice njegove napisan: Kralj Judovski. 
[15:27] In ž njim križajo dva razbojnika, enega njemu na desno in enega na levo. 
[15:28] In izpolnilo se je pismo, ktero pravi: "In hudodelnikom je prištet." 
[15:29] In mimo gredoči so ga preklinjali, in majali so z glavami svojimi in govorili: Ahá, ki podiraš tempelj, in ga v treh dnéh postavljaš! 
[15:30] Pomagaj si, in snidi s križa! 
[15:31] Ravno tako so mu se pa tudi véliki duhovni posmehovali, in govorili so med seboj s pismarji: Drugim je pomagal, sam sebi ne more pomagati. 
[15:32] Kristus kralj Izraelski naj snide sedaj s križa, da bomo videli in verovali. Tudi ktera sta bila križana ž njim, zasramovala sta ga. 
[15:33] Ko je bila pa ura šest, nastane tema po vsej zemlji noter do devete ure. 
[15:34] In ob devetej uri zavpije Jezus z močnim glasom, govoreč: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabahtani? kar se tolmači: Bog moj! Bog moj! za kaj si me zapustil? 
[15:35] In nekteri tistih, ki so zraven stali, slišali to, govorili so: Glej! Elija kliče. 
[15:36] Eden pa odbeží, in napolni gobo z octom, in nataknivši na trst, napajal ga je, govoreč: Pojenjajte! bomo videli, če pride Elija, da ga sneme. 
[15:37] Jezus pa zavpije z močnim glasom, in izdahne. 
[15:38] In zagrinjalo tempeljna se pretrga na dvoje, od vrha do tâl. 
[15:39] Videvši pa stotnik, kteri je stal njemu nasproti, da je tako zakričavši izdahnil, reče: Resnično je ta človek sin Božji. 
[15:40] Bile so pa tudi žene, ktere so oddaleč gledale, med kterimi je bila tudi Marija Magdalena, in Marija Jakoba manjšega in Jozejeva mati, in Salome, 
[15:41] Ktere so tudi, ko je bil v Galileji, za njim hodile in mu služile; in mnoge druge, ktere so bile ž njim prišle v Jeruzalem. 
[15:42] In ko se je uže zvečerilo, (ker je bil petek, to je: pred soboto,) 
[15:43] Pride Jožef Arimatejec, pošten svetovalec, kteri je tudi pričakoval kraljestva Božjega; in vnide srčno k Pilatu, in zaprosi Jezusovo truplo. 
[15:44] Pilat se pa začudi, da je uže umrl; in poklicavši stotnika, vpraša ga, če je davno umrl. 
[15:45] In zvedevši od stotnika, podarí truplo Jožefu. 
[15:46] In kupivši platna sneme ga, in zavije ga v platno, in položí ga v grob, kteri je bil iztesan iz kamena; in privali kamen grobu na vrata. 
[15:47] Marija Magdalena in Marija Jozejeva ste pa gledali, kje so ga pokladali. 
[16:1] In ko mine sobota, Marija Magdalena in Marija Jakobova in Salome nakupijo dišav, da bi prišle in bi ga pomazilile. 
[16:2] In zjutraj zgodaj prvi dan po soboti pridejo k grobu, ko je solnce izšlo. 
[16:3] In pogovarjale so se med seboj: Kdo nam bo odvalil kamen od vrat grobnih? 
[16:4] In pogledavši, ugledajo, da je kamen odvaljen; bil je namreč zeló velik. 
[16:5] In prišedši v grob, ugledajo mladeniča, da sedí na desnej strani in je ograjen z belim oblačilom; in uplašijo se. 
[16:6] On jim pa reče: Ne bojte se: Jezusa iščete Nazarečana, kterega so križali; vstal je, ni ga tu. Glej mesto, kamor so ga bili položili. 
[16:7] Ali pojdite, povejte učencem njegovim, in Petru, da je šel pred vami v Galilejo; tam ga boste videli, kakor vam je rekel. 
[16:8] In izšedši naglo, zbežé od groba; kajti spreletal jih je strah in groza; in nikomur niso nič povedale, ker so se bale. 
[16:9] Vstavši pa zgodaj prvi dan po soboti, prikaže se najprej Mariji Magdaleni, iz ktere je bil izgnal sedem hudičev. 
[16:10] Ona odide in sporočí tem, kteri so bili ž njim, in so žalovali in jokali. 
[16:11] In ko slišijo, da živi in ga je ona videla, niso verovali. 
[16:12] Potem se pa prikaže dvema od njih na poti v drugej podobi, ko sta šla na polje. 
[16:13] In ona odideta in naznanita dugim; ali tudi njima niso verovali. 
[16:14] Naposled se prikaže enajsterim, ko so sedeli za mizo, in ograja njih nevero in trdosrčnost, da niso verjeli tem, kteri so ga videli, da je vstal. 
[16:15] In reče jim: Pojdite po vsem svetu, in oznanite evangelj vsemu stvarjenju. 
[16:16] Kdor bo veroval in se bo krstil, zveličal se bo; a kdor ne bo veroval, pogubil se bo. 
[16:17] Znamenja pa tistim, kteri verujejo, bodo ta: Z imenom mojim bodo izganjali hudiče; govorili bodo nove jezike; 
[16:18] Kače bodo prijemali; in če kaj strupenega izpijó, ne bo jim škodovalo; na bolnike bodo roke pokladali, in zdravi bodo. 
[16:19] In Gospod, ko jim je izgovoril, vzet je bil na nebo, in usedel se je Bogu na desno. 
[16:20] Oni so pa šli, in oznanjevali so povsodi, in Gospod jim je pomagal, in potrjeval je besedo s čudeži, kteri so se potem godili. Amen. 

### Luke

[1:1] Ko so mnogi jeli opisovati rečí, ktere so popolnoma gotove med nami, 
[1:2] Kakor so nam izročili, kteri so od začetka sami videli in so služabniki besede bili: 
[1:3] Namenil sem tudi jaz, ki sem vse od začetka na tanko pozvedel, po vrsti pisati tebi, častiti Teofil! 
[1:4] Da spoznaš gotovost rečî, kterih si se naučil. 
[1:5] Bil je v dnéh Heroda kralja Judejskega neki duhoven po imenu Zaharija, od reda Abijevega; in žena njegova od hčeri Aronovih, in ime jej je bilo Elizabeta. 
[1:6] Bila sta pa oba pravična pred Bogom, in živela sta po vseh zapovedih in ustavah Gospodovih brez madeža. 
[1:7] In nista imela otrók, ker je bila Elizabeta nerodovitna, in oba sta se bila uže postarala. 
[1:8] Zgodí se pa, ko je po vrsti reda svojega služil pred Bogom, 
[1:9] Po navadi duhovstva zadene ga opravilo, naj vnide v tempelj Gospodov, da pokadí. 
[1:10] In vsa množiča ljudstva je bila zunej, in molila je v čas kajenja. 
[1:11] Prikaže pa mu se angelj Gospodov, stoječ na desnej strani kadilnega oltarja. 
[1:12] In Zaharija se ustraši, ko ga ugleda, in groza ga obide. 
[1:13] Angelj mu pa reče: Ne boj se, Zaharija! kajti uslišana je molitev tvoja, in žena tvoja Elizabeta ti bo rodila sina, in imenuj ime njegovo Janez. 
[1:14] In bo ti na radost in na veselje, in veliko se jih bo rojstvu njegovemu radovalo. 
[1:15] Kajti velik bo pred Gospodom; in vina in močne pijače ne bo pil, in napolnil se bo Duha svetega še v telesu matere svoje. 
[1:16] In veliko sinov Izraelskih bo obrnil h Gospodu Bogu njih. 
[1:17] In on pojde pred njim z duhom in močjó Elijevo, da obrne srca očetov k otrokom, in nevernike k razumnosti pravičnih: da pripravi Gospodu ljudstvo gotovo. 
[1:18] Pa reče Zaharija angelju: Po čem bom poznal to? kajti jaz sem star, in žena moja se je postarala. 
[1:19] In odgovarjajoč angelj, reče mu: Jaz sem Gabrijel, ki stojim pred Bogom, in poslan sem, naj s teboj govorim, in ti to veselje oznanim. 
[1:20] In glej, mutast boš in ne boš mogel govoriti do dné, ko se bo to zgodilo; ker nisi veroval besedam mojim, ktere se bodo izpolnile o svojem času. 
[1:21] In čakalo je ljudstvo Zaharija; in čudili so se, da se tako dolgo mudí v tempeljnu. 
[1:22] Ko pa izide, ni jim mogel govoriti? in spoznajo, da je videl prikazen v tempeljnu: in on jim je pomigaval, in ostal je mutast. 
[1:23] In zgodí se, ko se izpolnijo dnevi službe njegove, odide na dom svoj. 
[1:24] A po teh dnéh je Elizabeta žena njegova spočela, in skrivala se je pet mesecev, govoreč: 
[1:25] Tako mi je storil Gospod v dnéh, ko se je ozrl na me, da odvzeme oponos moj med ljudmí. 
[1:26] A šesti mesec pošlje Bog angelja Gabrijela v mesto Galilejsko, kteremu je ime Nazaret, 
[1:27] K devici zaročenej možu, kteremu je bilo ime Jožef, iz hiše Davidove; in devici je bilo ime Marija. 
[1:28] In angelj vnide k njej, in reče: Zdrava, z milostjo obdarovana! Gospod je s teboj; blagoslovljena si ti med ženami. 
[1:29] Ona pa, ko ga ugleda, prestraši se od besede njegove, in premišljevala je, kakošen bi bil ta pozdrav. 
[1:30] Pa jej angelj reče; Ne boj se, Marija! našla si namreč milost pri Bogu. 
[1:31] In glej, spočela boš v telesu, in rodila boš sina, in imenuj ime njegovo Jezus. 
[1:32] Ta bo velik, in imenoval se bo sin najvišega; in dal mu bo Gospod Bog prestol Davida očeta njegovega, 
[1:33] In kraljeval bo v hiši Jakobovej vekomaj, in kraljestvu njegovemu ne bo konca. 
[1:34] Marija pa reče angelju: Kako bo to, ko moža ne poznam? 
[1:35] In odgovarjajoč angelj, reče jej; Sveti Duh bo prišel na te, in moč najvišega te bo obsenčila; za to se bo sveto, ktero se bo rodilo iz tebe, imenovalo sin Božji. 
[1:36] In glej, Elizabeta teta tvoja, tudi ona je spočela sina v starosti svojej; in ta mesec jej je šesti, njej, ki jo imenujejo nerodovitno: 
[1:37] Ker ne bo nobene besede pri Bogu, ktera se ne bi mogla izpolniti. 
[1:38] Marija pa reče: Glej, dekla sem Gospodova; zgôdi mi se po besedi tvojej. In angelj odide od nje. 
[1:39] Vstavši pa Marija v té dni, odide jadrno na gorenjo stran v mesto Judovo. 
[1:40] In vnide v hišo Zaharijevo, in pozdravi Elizabeto. 
[1:41] In zgodí se, ko sliši Elizabeta pozdrav Marijin, zaigra dete v telesu njenem; in Elizabeta se napolni Duha svetega, 
[1:42] In zavpije z močnim glasom, in reče: Blagoslovljena si ti med ženami, in blagoslovljen je sad telesa tvojega. 
[1:43] In odkod meni to, da je prišla mati Gospoda mojega k meni? 
[1:44] Kajti glej, ko je prišel glas pozdrava tvojega v ušesa moja, zaigralo je dete radostno v telesu mojem. 
[1:45] In blagor jej, ktera je verovala; kajti zgodilo se bo, kar jej je rekel Gospod. 
[1:46] Pa reče Marija: Duša moja poveličuje Gospoda, 
[1:47] In duh moj se je oveselil v Bogu, zveličarji mojem: 
[1:48] Da se je ozrl na ponižanje dekle svoje. Kajti glej, odslej me bodo blagrovali vsi rodovi: 
[1:49] Ker mi je storil velike rečí on, ki je mogočen, in ime njegovo sveto; 
[1:50] In usmiljenje njegovo od roda do roda tistim, kteri se ga bojé. 
[1:51] Pokazal je moč z roko svojo: razkropil je ošabne v mislih srca njih; 
[1:52] Vrgel je mogočne s prestola, in povišal je ponižne. 
[1:53] Lačne je napolnil z blagom, in bogate je odpravil prazne. 
[1:54] Sprejel je Izraela hlapca svojega, da se spomene usmiljenja svojega. 
[1:55] (Kakor je govoril očetom našim,) Abrahamu in semenu njegovemu na vekomaj. 
[1:56] Prebila je pa Marija ž njo kake tri mesece; in vrne se na dom svoj. 
[1:57] A Elizabeti se izpolni čas, da porodí, in rodí sina. 
[1:58] In sosedje in sorodniki njeni zaslišijo, da je pokazal Gospod veliko usmiljenje svoje na njej; in radovali so se ž njo. 
[1:59] In zgodí se osmi dan, da pridejo deteta obrezovat; in klicali so ga po imenu očeta njegovega, Zaharija. 
[1:60] Ali odgovarjajoč mati njegova, reče: Ne, nego imenoval se bo Janez. 
[1:61] In rekó jej: Nikogar ni v rodovini tvojej, da bi mu bilo tako ime. 
[1:62] In pomigavali so očetu njegovemu, kako hoče, da bi ga imenovali. 
[1:63] In izprosivši tablico, napiše, govoreč: Janez mu je ime. In vsi se začudijo. 
[1:64] In odprla so se usta njegova pri tej priči in jezik njegov, in govoril je, hvaleč Boga. 
[1:65] In strah obide vse njih sosede; in po vsej gorenjej Judeji se razglasé vse te reči. 
[1:66] In vsi, kteri jih slišijo, položé jih v srce svoje, govoreč: Kaj neki bo iz tega otroka? In roka Gospodova je bila ž njim. 
[1:67] In Zaharija oče njegov se napolni Duha svetega, in prerokuje, govoreč: 
[1:68] Blagoslovljen Gospod Bog Izraelov, da je obiskal in odrešil ljudstvo svoje; 
[1:69] In nam povzdignil rog zveličanja v hiši Davida hlapca svojega, 
[1:70] (Kakor je govoril z ustmi svetih prerokov svojih, ki so bili od nekedaj:) 
[1:71] Da nas bo rešil sovražnikov naših in iz rok vseh, kteri nas mrzé: 
[1:72] Da storí usmiljenje očetom našim, in se spomene svete zaveze svoje, 
[1:73] Prisege, ktero je prisegel Abrahamu očetu našemu, da nam bo dal, 
[1:74] Da mu, rešeni iz rok sovražnikov svojih, brez straha služimo, 
[1:75] V svetosti in pravičnosti pred njim vse svoje žive dní. 
[1:76] In ti, otrok, imenoval se boš prerok najvišega; kajti šel boš pred obličjem Gospodovim, da mu pripraviš pot; 
[1:77] In daš razum zveličanja ljudstvu njegovemu za odpuščanje njih grehov, 
[1:78] Po prisrčnem usmiljenji Boga našega, po kterem nas je obiskal vzhod z vižave: 
[1:79] Da obsije tiste, kteri sedé v temi in smrtnej senci; da naravná noge naše na pot mirú. 
[1:80] A dete je rastlo in se krepčalo v duhu; in bilo je v puščavah do dné, ko se pokaže Izraelu. 
[2:1] Zgodí se pa tiste dni, da izide povelje od cesarja Avgusta, naj se popiše ves svet. 
[2:2] (To popisovanje prvo bilo je, ko je vladal v Siriji Cirenij.) 
[2:3] In šli so vsi, da se zapišejo, vsak v svoje mesto. 
[2:4] Napoti se pa tudi Jožef iz Galileje, iz mesta Nazareta, v Judejo, v mesto Davidovo, ktero se imenuje Betlehem, (ker je bil iz hiše in rodovine Davidove,) 
[2:5] Da se zapiše z Marijo zaročeno mu ženo, ktera je bila noseča. 
[2:6] Zgodí se pa, ko sta bila tam, da se izpolnijo dnevi, da porodí. 
[2:7] In rodí sina svojega prvenca, in povije ga v plenice, in položi ga v jasli: ker jima ni bilo prostora v gostilnici. 
[2:8] Bili so pa pastirji v tistem kraji, kteri so čuli in na ponočnih stražah bili pri čredi svojej. 
[2:9] In glej, angelj Gospodov pristopi k njim, in slava Gospodova jih obsije; in uplašijo se z velikim strahom. 
[2:10] Pa jim angelj reče: Ne bojte se! kajti glej, oznanjam vam veliko radost, ktera bo vsemu ljudstvu: 
[2:11] Da vam se je rodil danes zveličar, kteri je Kristus Gospod, v mestu Davidovem. 
[2:12] In to vam bo znamenje: Našli boste dete povito, da leži v jaslih. 
[2:13] In na hip se pokaže z angeljem množica nebeške vojske, kteri so Boga hvalili, govoreč: 
[2:14] Slava na višavah Bogu, in na zemlji mir; med ljudmi dobra volja. 
[2:15] In zgodí se, ko odidejo angelji od njih na nebo, pa rekó pastirji med seboj: Pojdimo do Betlehema, in poglejmo to reč, ki se je zgodila, ki nam jo je povedal Gospod. 
[2:16] In pridejo jadrno, in najdejo Marijo in Jožefa, in dete, da leží v jaslih. 
[2:17] Videvši pa, povedó, kar jim je bilo rečeno za to dete. 
[2:18] In vsi, kteri so slišali, začudijo se temu, kar so jim bili povedali pastirji. 
[2:19] A Marija je vse te besede varovala, in zlágala jih je v srcu svojem. 
[2:20] In vrnejo se pastirji, slaveč in hvaleč Boga za vse, kar so slišali in videli, kakor jim je bilo povedano. 
[2:21] In ko se izpolni osem dnî, da dete obrežejo, pa mu dadó ime Jezus, ktero je bil imenoval angelj, predno se je še začel v telesu. 
[2:22] In ko se izpolnijo dnevi očiščevanja njenega, po postavi Mojzesovej, prineseta ga v Jeruzalem, da ga postavita pred Gospoda, 
[2:23] (Kakor je pisano v postavi Gospodovej: "Vsak samec, kteri odprè maternico, posvetí naj se Gospodu,") 
[2:24] In da dasta dar po tem, kar je rečeno v postavi Gospodovej: "Dve grlici ali dva golobiča." 
[2:25] In glej, bil je človek v Jeruzalemu, kteremu je bilo ime Simeon, in ta človek je bil pravičen in pobožen, in čakal je tolažbe Izraelove, in Duh sveti je bil v njem. 
[2:26] In razodel mu je bil sveti Duh, da ne bo videl smrti, dokler ne vidi Kristusa Gospoda. 
[2:27] In pride v Duhu v tempelj. In ko prineseta roditelja otroka Jezusa, da storita za-nj po šegi postave, 
[2:28] Pa ga on vzeme na naročje svoje, in zahvali Boga, in reče: 
[2:29] Sedaj odpuščaš hlapca svojega, Gospod, po besedi svojej v miru: 
[2:30] Ker so videle očí moje zveličanje tvoje, 
[2:31] Ktero si pripravil pred obličjem vseh narodov; 
[2:32] Luč za razsvetljenje poganov, in slavo naroda tvojega Izraelskega. 
[2:33] A Jožef in mati njegova sta se čudila temu, kar se je govorilo o njem. 
[2:34] In blagoslovi ju Simeon, in reče Mariji materi njegovej: Glej, ta je postavljen na pad in vstajenje mnogim v Izraelu, in za znamenje, kteremu se bo nasprotovalo: 
[2:35] (A tebi samej bo pa prebodel meč dušo!) da se odkrijejo iz mnogih src misli. 
[2:36] In bila je prerokinja Ana, hči Fanuelova, od rodú Azerjevega: ta je bila zeló stara, in sedem let je bila živela z možem po devištvu svojem; 
[2:37] In vdova okoli štiri in osemdesetih let, ktera ni odhajala od tempeljna, in je s postom in molitvami služila Bogu, noč in dan. 
[2:38] In ta ravno tisti čas pristopi, in hvalila je Gospoda, in govorila je o njem vsem, kteri so čakali odrešenja v Jeruzalemu. 
[2:39] In ko vse po postavi Gospodovej dopolnijo, vrnejo se v Galilejo, v mesto svoje Nazaret. 
[2:40] A dete je rastlo, in krepčalo se je v duhu, in napolnjevalo se je modrosti; in milost Božja je bila ž njim. 
[2:41] In hodila sta roditelja njegova vsako leto v Jeruzalem o velikonočnem prazniku. 
[2:42] In ko mu je bilo dvanajst let, in sta bila šla v Jeruzalem po navadi praznika, 
[2:43] In sta dní dokončala, ko sta se onadva vračala, ostal je deček Jezus v Jeruzalemu. In tega ni vedel Jožef in mati njegova. 
[2:44] Misleč pa, da je pri druščini, prešla sta dan hodá, in iskala sta ga pri sorodnikih in pri znancih. 
[2:45] In ko ga nista našla, vrneta se v Jeruzalem, iskajoč ga, 
[2:46] In zgodí se po treh dnéh, da ga najdeta v tempeljnu, da sedí sredi učenikov, ter jih posluša, in jih vprašuje. 
[2:47] Čudili pa so se vsi, kteri so ga poslušali, razumu njegovemu in odgovorom njegovim. 
[2:48] In ko ga ugledata, zavzemeta se; in reče mu mati njegova: Sin, kaj si nama storil tako? Glej, oče tvoj in jaz sva te z žalostjo iskala. 
[2:49] Pa jima reče: Kaj, da sta me iskala? Nista li vedela, da moram biti v tem, kar je očeta mojega? 
[2:50] In ona nista razumela besede, ktero jima je rekel. 
[2:51] Ter snide ž njima, in pride v Nazaret; in bil jima je pokoren. In mati njegova je varovala vse te besede v srcu svojem. 
[2:52] In Jezus je napredoval v modrosti in rasti, in v milosti pri Bogu in ljudeh. 
[3:1] Petnajstega pa leta vlade cesarja Tiberija, ko je bil Pontijski Pilat poglavar v Judeji, in Herod četrtnik v Galileji, a Filip brat njegov četrtnik v Itureji in Trahonitskej pokrajini, in Lizanija četrtnik v Abileni, 
[3:2] Za vélikih duhovnov Ana in Kajfa: reče Bog Janezu Zaharijevemu sinu v puščavi, 
[3:3] Ter pride v vso okolico Jordansko, oznanjujoč krst pokore za odpuščanje grehov; 
[3:4] Kakor je pisano v bukvah govorov Izaija preroka, kteri pravi: "Glas vpijočega v puščavi: Pripravite pot Gospodov; poravnajte steze njegove. 
[3:5] Vsaka dolina naj se izpolni, in vsaka gora in grič naj se zniža; in kar je krivo, bodi raven pot, in ostra pota naj bodo gladka. 
[3:6] In vse človeštvo bo videlo zveličanje Božje." 
[3:7] Govoril je torej množicam, ktere so izhajale, da bi jih krstil: Gadja zalega! kdo vam je pokazal, kako boste ubežali prihodnjej jezi? 
[3:8] Rodite torej vreden sad pokore; in ne začenjajte govoriti v sebi: Za očeta imamo Abrahama: kajti pravim vam, da more Bog iz tega kamenja obuditi Abrahamu sinove. 
[3:9] Uže pa tudi sekira drevju pri korenini stojí: vsako torej drevo, ktero ne rodi dobrega sadú, posekalo se bo in vrglo na ogenj. 
[3:10] In vpraševale so ga množice, govoreč: Kaj naj torej storimo? 
[3:11] Odgovarjajoč pa, velí jim: Kdor ima dve suknji, podá naj tistemu, kteri nima; in kdor ima hrane, storí naj enako. 
[3:12] Pridejo pa tudi mitarji, da bi jih krstil, in rekó mu: Učenik, kaj naj storimo? 
[3:13] On jim pa reče: Nič več ne tirjajte, nego kar vam je ukazano. 
[3:14] Vpraševali so ga pa tudi vojaki, govoreč: In mi, kaj naj storimo? In reče jim: Nikogar ne bíjte, in ne ovajajte; in bodite zadovoljni s plačo svojo. 
[3:15] Ko je pa ljudstvo čakalo, in so vsi premišljevali v srcih svojih za Janeza, če ni nemara on Kristus, 
[3:16] Odgovorí Janez vsem, govoreč: Jaz vas z vodo krščujem; gre pa močneji od mene, kteremu nisem vreden odvezati jermena na obutalu njegovem: On vas bo krstil z Duhom svetim in ognjem, 
[3:17] Komur je lopata v roki njegovej, in bo očedil gumno svoje; in pospravil bo pšenico v žitnico svojo, a plevo bo spalil z neugasljivim ognjem. 
[3:18] In tako je še veliko drugega napominjal in oznanjeval ljudstvu. 
[3:19] Herod pa četrtnik, ker ga je svaril za voljo Herodijade žene Filipa brata njegovega, in za vse, kar je hudega storil Herod, 
[3:20] Storí vrh vsega tudi to, in zaprè Janeza v ječo. 
[3:21] Zgodilo se pa je, ko se je krščevalo vse ljudstvo, in se je Jezus krstil in je molil: da se je odprlo nebo, 
[3:22] In je sešel sveti Duh v telesnej podobi ko golob na-nj, in se je glas z neba oglasil, govoreč: Ti si sin moj ljubljeni, ti si po mojej volji. 
[3:23] In ta Jezus je pričenjal kako trideseto leto, sin, kakor se je mislilo, Jožefa, sina Helijevega, 
[3:24] Sina Matatovega, sina Levijevega, sina Melhijevega, sina Janovega, sina Jožefovega, 
[3:25] Sina Matatijevega, sina Amosovega, sina Naumovega, sina Eslijevega, sina Nangejevega, 
[3:26] Sina Maatovega, sina Matatijevega, sina Semejevega, sina Jožefovega, sina Judovega, 
[3:27] Sina Joanovega, sina Resovega, sina Zorobabeljnovega, sina Salatijelovega, sina Nerijevega, 
[3:28] Sina Melhijevega, sina Adijevega, sina Kozamovega, sina Elmodamovega, sina Erovega, 
[3:29] Sina Jozejevega, sina Elijezerjevega, sina Jorimovega, sina Matatovega, sina Levijevega, 
[3:30] Sina Simeonovega, sina Judovega, sina Jožefovega, sina Jonanovega, sina Elijahimovega, 
[3:31] Sina Melejevega, sina Majnanovega, sina Matatajevega, sina Natanovega, sina Davidovega, 
[3:32] Sina Jesejevega, sina Obedovega, sina Boozovega, sina Salmonovega, sina Naasonovega, 
[3:33] Sina Aminadabovega, sina Aramovega, sina Ezronovega, sina Faresovega, sina Judovega, 
[3:34] Sina Jakobovega, sina Izakovega, sina Abrahamovega, sina Tarovega, sina Nahorovega, 
[3:35] Sina Saruhovega, sina Ragavovega, sina Falekovega, sina Eberjevega, sina Salovega, 
[3:36] Sina Kajnanovega, sina Arfaksadovega, sina Semovega, sina Noetovega, sina Lamehovega, 
[3:37] Sina Matuzalovega sina Enohovega, sina Jaredovega, sina Maleleelovega, sina Kajnanovega, 
[3:38] Sina Enosovega, sina Setovega, sina Adamovega, in ta je bil Božji. 
[4:1] Jezus pa, svetega Duha poln, vrne se od Jordana; in odpelje ga Duh v puščavo. 
[4:2] In štirideset dnî ga je izkušal hudič. In ničesar ni jedel v teh dnéh; in ko minejo, potem postane lačen. 
[4:3] In reče mu hudič: Če si sin Božji, reci temu kamenu, naj postane kruh. 
[4:4] In odgovorí mu Jezus, govoreč: Pisano je: "Ne bo živel človek o samem kruhu, nego o vsakej besedi Božjej." 
[4:5] In popeljavši ga hudič na visoko goro, pokaže mu vsa kraljestva sveta v pičici časa. 
[4:6] In reče mu hudič: Tebi bom dal vso to oblast in njih slavo; kajti meni je izročena, in dám jo, komurkoli jo hočem. 
[4:7] Ti torej če se pokloniš pred menoj, tvoje bo vse. 
[4:8] In odgovarjajoč, reče mu Jezus: Poberi se od mene, satan! Kajti pisano je: "Poklanjaj se Gospodu Bogu svojemu, in njemu edinemu služi." 
[4:9] In pelje ga v Jeruzalem, in postavi ga na vrh tempeljna, in reče mu: Če si sin Božji, vrzi se odtod dol: 
[4:10] Kajti pisano je: "Angeljem svojim bo zapovedal za te, naj te varujejo: 
[4:11] In vzeli te bodo na roko, da se kje z nogo svoje ne udariš o kamen." 
[4:12] In odgovarjajoč, reče mu Jezus: Povedano je: "Ne izkušaj Gospoda Boga svojega." 
[4:13] In končavši hudič vso izkušnjavo, odide od njega do časa. 
[4:14] In vrne se Jezus z močjó duhovno v Galilejo; in glas o njem izide po vsem okolnem kraji. 
[4:15] In on je učil po njih shajališčih, in vsi so ga slavili. 
[4:16] In pride v Nazaret, kjer je odrastel; in vnide po navadi svojej, v sobotni dan, v shajališče, in vstane, da bere. 
[4:17] In dadó mu bukve Izaija preroka; in ko razgane bukve, najde mesto, kjer je bilo pisano: 
[4:18] "Duh Gospodov je na meni: za to, ker me je pomazilil; da oznanim evangelj ubogim, poslal me je, da uzdravim potrte v srcu, da oznanim jetnikom, da se bodo izpustili, in slepcem, da bodo spregledali, da izpustim sužnje v svobodo, 
[4:19] Da oznanim prijetno leto Gospodovo." 
[4:20] In zgane bukve, in dá strežaju, in sede; in vsi v shajališči so gledali na-nj. 
[4:21] In začne jim govoriti: Danes se je izpolnilo to pismo v ušesih vaših. 
[4:22] In vsi so mu pričali, in čudili so se besedam milosti, ktere so izhajale iz ust njegovih, in govorili so: Ali ni ta Jožefov? 
[4:23] In reče jim: Gotovo mi boste povedali to priliko: Zdravnik, uzdravi se sam! Karkoli smo slišali, da se je zgodilo v Kapernaumu, stóri tudi tu v domovini svojej. 
[4:24] Reče pa: Resnično vam pravim, da ni noben prerok prijeten v domovini svojej. 
[4:25] Ali v resnici vam pravim, da je bilo veliko vdov v dnéh Elija v Izraelu, ko se je nebo zaprlo tri leta in šest mesecev, tako, da je nastala velika lakota po vsej zemlji; 
[4:26] In k nobenej od njih ni bil poslan Elija, razen v Sarepto Sidonsko k ženi vdovi. 
[4:27] In veliko gobavcev je bilo za Eliseja preroka v Izraelu; in nobeden od njih se ni očistil, razen Naaman Sirijan. 
[4:28] In vsi v shajališči se napolnijo jeze, ko to slišijo. 
[4:29] In vstavši, izženó ga ven iz mesta, in odpeljejo ga na vrh gore, na kterej je bilo njih mesto sezidano, da bi ga dol pahnili. 
[4:30] Ali on prejde posredi njih, in odide. 
[4:31] In snide v Kapernaum mesto Galilejsko; in učil jih je ob sobotah. 
[4:32] In čudili so se nauku njegovemu, ker je bila beseda njegova silna. 
[4:33] In v shajališči je bil človek, kteri je imel nečistega duha hudičevega, in zakričí z močnim glasom, 
[4:34] Govoreč: Pojenjaj, kaj imaš z nami, Jezus Nazarečan? Prišel si, da bi nas pogubil? Poznam te, kdo si – svetnik Božji. 
[4:35] In zapretí mu Jezus, govoreč: Umolkni, in izidi iž njega! In trešči ga hudič na sredo, in izide iž njega, in nič ga ni oškodoval. 
[4:36] In obide jih groza vse, in pomenkovali so se med seboj, govoreč: Kakošna je ta beseda, da z oblastjo in močjó ukazuje nečistim duhovom, ter izhajajo? 
[4:37] In razglasí se glas o njem po vsem okolnem kraji. 
[4:38] Vstavši pa iz shajališča, vnide v hišo Simonovo. Tašča pa Simonova imela je hudo mrzlico; in zaprosijo ga za njo. 
[4:39] In stoječ nad njo, zapretí mrzlici, in pustí jo; in precej je vstala, ter jim je stregla. 
[4:40] Ko je pa solnce zahajalo, vsi, kteri so imeli bolnike z različnimi boleznimi, dovažali so jih k njemu; a on je na vsakega od njih pokladal roke, ter jih je uzdravljal. 
[4:41] Izhajali pa so tudi hudiči iz mnogih, kričeč in govoreč: Ti si Kristus sin Božji. In grozeč se, ni jim dal govoriti, ker so vedeli, da je on Kristus. 
[4:42] Ko se pa zdaní, izide, in odide na samoten kraj; in ljudstvo ga je iskalo, in pridejo k njemu, in pridržavali so ga, da ne bi šel od njih. 
[4:43] On jim pa reče: Tudi drugim mestom moram oznanjevati evangelj o kraljestvu Božjem! kajti za to sem poslan. 
[4:44] In oznanjeval je po shajališčih Galilejskih. 
[5:1] Zgodí se pa, ko ga ljudstvo obsuje, da bi poslušali besedo Božjo, pa je on stal pri jezeru Genezaretskem. 
[5:2] In ugleda dve ladji, da stojite ob jezeru; a ribiči so bili izšli iž njih in so izpirali mreže. 
[5:3] In stopivši v eno od ladij, ktera je bila Simonova, zaprosi ga, naj malo odrine od kraja; ter sede, in učil je iz ladje ljudstvo. 
[5:4] A ko neha govoriti, reče Simonu: Odrini na globoko, in vrzite mreže svoje na lov. 
[5:5] In odgovarjajoč Simon, reče mu: Učenik, vso noč smo se trudili, in nič nismo vjeli; ali po besedi tvojej vrgel bom mrežo. 
[5:6] In storivši to, zajemó veliko število rib; trgala pa jim se je mreža. 
[5:7] Ter pomignejo tovarišem, kteri so bili v drugej ladji, naj jim pridejo pomagat. Ter pridejo, in napolnijo obe ladji, da ste se topili. 
[5:8] Vidveši pa to Simon Peter, pade h kolenom Jezusovim, govoreč: Izidi od mene, ker sem človek grešnik, Gospod! 
[5:9] Kajti groza je bila obšla njega in vse, kteri so bili ž njim, od vlaka rib, ki so ga bili zajeli. 
[5:10] Ravno tako pa tudi Jakoba in Janeza, sinova Zebedejeva, ktera sta bila tovariša Simonova. Pa reče Jezus Simonu: Ne boj se! odslej boš ljudí lovil. 
[5:11] In potegnivši ladjo h kraju, popusté vse, in odidejo za njim. 
[5:12] In zgodí se, ko je bil v enem mestu, in glej, mož ves v gobi; in ugledavši Jezusa, pade na obraz, in prosil ga je, govoreč: Gospod, če hočeš, moreš me očistiti. 
[5:13] In stegnivši roko, dotakne se ga, in reče: Hočem, očisti se! In precej je odšla goba od njega. 
[5:14] In on mu naroči, naj nikomur ne pové; nego pojdi, reče mu, pokaži se duhovnu, in prinesi za očiščenje svoje, kakor je ukazal Mojzes, njim za pričo. 
[5:15] Ali razglaševala se je le še s tem bolj govorica o njem; in stekalo se je veliko ljudstva, da bi ga poslušali, in da bi jih uzdravljal od njih bolezni. 
[5:16] A on je odhajal v puščave in je molil. 
[5:17] In zgodí se en dan, in on je učil; in sedeli so tam Farizeji in učeniki postave, kteri so bili prišli iz vseh vasi Galilejskih in Judejskih in Jeruzalema; in moč Gospodova je bila, da jih je uzdravljala. 
[5:18] In glej, možjé prinesó na odru človeka, kteri je bil mrtvouden, in iskali so, kako bi ga vnesli in položili pred-nj. 
[5:19] In ko ne najdejo, kod bi ga vnesli, za voljo ljudstva, zlezejo na streho, in skozi skodle spusté ga z odrom na sredo pred Jezusa. 
[5:20] In videvši njih vero, reče mu: Človek, odpuščajo ti se grehi tvoji. 
[5:21] Pa začnó premišljati pismarji in Farizeji, govoreč: Kdo je ta, da preklinja Boga? Kdo more odpuščati grehe, razen edini Bog! 
[5:22] Spoznavši pa Jezus njih misli, odgovorí in jim reče: Kaj premišljate v srcih svojih? 
[5:23] Kaj je laže, reči: Odpuščajo ti se grehi tvoji? ali reči: Vstani in hodi? 
[5:24] Da boste pa vedeli, da ima oblast sin človečji na zemlji odpuščati grehe, (reče mrtvoudnemu:) Tebi pravim, vstani in vzemi oder svoj, in pojdi na dom svoj. 
[5:25] In precej vstane pred njimi, in vzeme, na čemer je ležal, in odide na dom svoj, hvaleč Boga. 
[5:26] In groza obide vse, in hvalili so Boga, in napolnijo se strahú, govoreč: Čudne rečí smo videli danes. 
[5:27] In po tem izide, in ugleda mitarja, po imenu Levija, da sedí na mitnici, in reče mu: Pojdi za menoj! 
[5:28] In pustivši vse, vstane in odide za njim. 
[5:29] In napravi mu Levij veliko pojedinjo v hiši svojej; in bila je velika množica mitarjev, in drugih, kteri so ž njimi sedeli za mizo. 
[5:30] In godrnjali so pismarji in Farizeji, govoreč učencem njegovim: Za kaj z mitarji in grešniki jeste in pijete? 
[5:31] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče jim: Ne potrebujejo zdravi zdravnika, nego bolni. 
[5:32] Nisem prišel klicat pravičnih, nego grešnike na pokoro. 
[5:33] A oni mu rekó: Po kaj se učenci Janezovi pogostoma postijo, in molijo, tako tudi Farizejski; tvoji pa jedó in pijejo? 
[5:34] On jim pa reče: Morete li storiti, da bi se svatje, dokler je ženin ž njimi, postili? 
[5:35] Prišli bodo pa dnevi, in ko jim se bo ženin odvzel, tedaj se bodo postili v tistih dnéh. 
[5:36] Pravil jim je pa tudi priliko: Nikdor zaplate od nove obleke ne prišiva na staro obleko; sicer bo tudi novo razdrl, in starej se ne prilega zaplata od nove. 
[5:37] In nikdor ne deva novega vina v stare mehove; sicer predere vino nove mehove, in ono se izlije, in mehovi se pokazé; 
[5:38] Nego novo vino se mora v nove mehove vlijati, in oboje se ohrani. 
[5:39] In kdor je pil staro, nikdar ne če precej novega; ker pravi: Staro je bolje. 
[6:1] Zgodí se pa prvo soboto drugega dné, da je šel skozi setve; in trgali so učenci njegovi klasje, in meli so ga z rokami, ter jedli. 
[6:2] Nekteri pa od Farizejev rekó jim: Za kaj delate, kar se ne sme delati ob sobotah? 
[6:3] In odgovarjajoč, reče jim Jezus: Ali niste brali tega, kar je storil David, ko se je bil ulakotil on in kteri so bili ž njim? 
[6:4] Kako je šel v hišo Božjo, in je postavljene kruhe vzel in snedel, in dal tudi tistim, kteri so bili ž njim: kterih ne sme nikdor jesti, razen edini duhovni? 
[6:5] In reče jim: Sin človečji je gospodar tudi sobote. 
[6:6] Zgodí se pa tudi v drugo soboto, da vnide v shajališče, ter je učil. In bil je tam človek, in desna roka mu je bila suha. 
[6:7] Pismarji in Farizeji so pa pazili na-nj, če ga bo v soboto uzdravil; da bi našli tožbo zoper njega. 
[6:8] A on je vedel njih misli, in reče človeku, kteri je imel suho roko: Vstani, in stopi na sredo! In on vstane in se vstopi. 
[6:9] Tedaj jim Jezus reče: Vprašal vas bom, kaj veljá ob sobotah, dobro delati ali hudo delati? dušo oteti ali pogubiti? 
[6:10] In pogledavši na vse njih, reče človeku: Stegni roko svojo! In on storí tako. In zdrava je bila roka njegova kakor druga. 
[6:11] A oni postanejo togote vsi neumni, in pomenkovali so se med seboj, kaj bi storili Jezusu. 
[6:12] Zgodí se pa v té dní, da izide na goro molit; in vso noč je premolil v molitvi Božjej. 
[6:13] In ko se zdaní, pokliče učence svoje; in izvoli jih izmed njih dvanajst, kterim tudi ime aposteljni dá: 
[6:14] Simona, kteremu tudi dá ime Peter, in Andreja brata njegovega, Jakoba in Janeza, Filipa in Jerneja, 
[6:15] Matevža in Tomaža, Jakoba Alfejevega in Simona, ki se imenuje Zelot, 
[6:16] Juda Jakobovega, in Juda Iškarijana, kteri je tudi postal izdajalec. 
[6:17] Ter snide ž njimi, in ustavi se na ravnem polji, in truma učencev njegovih, in velika množica ljudstva iz vse Judeje in iz Jeruzalema, in primorja Tirskega in Sidonskega, kteri so bili prišli, da bi ga slišali, in da bi jih uzdravil od njih bolezni, 
[6:18] In ktere so mučili nečisti duhovi; in ozdravljali so se. 
[6:19] In vse ljudstvo je iskalo, da bi se ga dotikali; kajti moč je iž njega izhajala, in uzdravljala je vse. 
[6:20] In on povzdignivši očí svoje na učence svoje, pravil je: Blagor vam ubogim, ker vaše je kraljestvo Božje. 
[6:21] Blagor vam, kteri ste sedaj lačni, ker se boste nasitili. Blagor vam, kteri sedaj jokate, ker se boste smejali. 
[6:22] Blagor vam, kedar vas bodo ljudjé mršili, in kedar vas bodo izobčevali, in sramotili, in razglaševali ime vaše za hudobno, za voljo sinú človečjega. 
[6:23] Radujte se tisti dan in poskakujte; kajti veliko je plačilo vaše na nebu. Ravno tako namreč so delali prerokom očetje njih. 
[6:24] Ali gorjé vam bogatini! kajti prejeli ste tolažbo svojo. 
[6:25] Gorjé vam, kteri ste nasiteni! kajti lačni boste. Gorjé vam, kteri se sedaj smejate! kajti žalovali boste in jokali. 
[6:26] Gorjé vam, kedar bodo dobro o vas govorili vsi ljudjé! kajti ravno tako so delali lažnjivim prerokom očetje njih. 
[6:27] Ali vam, kteri poslušate, pravim: Ljubite sovražnike svoje; delajte dobro tém, kteri vas mrzé; 
[6:28] Blagoslovite té, kteri vas preklinjajo; in molite za té, kteri vas obrekujejo. 
[6:29] Kdor te udari po enem licu, nastavi mu tudi drugo; in kdor ti vzeme plašč, ne brani mu tudi suknje ne. 
[6:30] Vsakemu, kdor te prosi, daj: in od tega, kdor tvoje vzeme, ne tirjaj nazaj. 
[6:31] In kakor hočete, da bi ljudjé vam storili, ravno tako storite tudi vi njim. 
[6:32] In če boste ljubili tiste, kteri ljubijo vas, kakošno boste imeli milost? Saj tudi grešniki ljubijo tiste, kteri ljubijo njih. 
[6:33] In če boste dobro delali tistim, kteri dobro delajo vam, kakošno boste imeli milost? Saj tudi grešniki delajo ravno tako. 
[6:34] In če boste posojevali tistim, od kterih upate, da boste prejeli, kakošno boste imeli milost? Saj tudi grešniki grešnikom posojujejo, da prejmó enako. 
[6:35] Nego ljubite sovražnike svoje, in delajte dobro in posojujte, ne pričakovaje ničesar; in veliko vam bo plačilo, in sinovi boste najvišega: kajti on je dobrotljiv tudi nehvaležnežem in hudobnežem. 
[6:36] Bodite torej usmiljeni, kakor je tudi oče vaš usmiljen. 
[6:37] In ne sodite, in ne bo vam se sodilo. Ne obsojajte, ter ne boste obsojeni. Odpuščajte, in odpustilo vam se bo. 
[6:38] Dajajte, in dalo vam se bo: mero dobro, natlačeno in potreseno in zvrhano dali vam bodo na naročje vaše. S kakoršno namreč mero merite, s takošno vam se bo odmerjalo. 
[6:39] In pové jim priliko: More li slepec slepca voditi? Ne bosta li oba v jamo padla? 
[6:40] Ni ga učenca nad učenika svojega; nego kdorkoli se izučí, bode kakor učenik njegov. 
[6:41] Kaj pa vidiš troho, ki je v očesu brata tvojega, bruna pa, ki je v očesu tvojem, ne čutiš? 
[6:42] Ali kako moreš reči bratu svojemu: Brat, čaj, da izderem troho, ki je v očesu tvojem, ko sam bruna, ki je v očesu tvojem, ne vidiš? Hinavec! ízmi najprej bruno iz očesa svojega, in tedaj boš pregledal, da izmeš troho, ki je v očesu brata tvojega. 
[6:43] Ni ga namreč drevesa dobrega, da bi rodilo slab sad; tudi slabega drevesa ne, da bi rodilo dober sad. 
[6:44] Kajti vsako drevo se po sadú svojem pozná. S trnja namreč ne beró smokev, in z robidja ne trgajo grozdja. 
[6:45] Dober človek prinaša iz dobrega zaklada srca svojega dobro; in hudoben človek prinaša iz hudobnega zaklada srca svojega hudobno: kajti usta njegova govoré od preobilnosti srca. 
[6:46] Kaj pa me imenujete: Gospod, Gospod! pa ne delate, kar pravim? 
[6:47] Vsak, kdor gre k meni in sliši moje besede in jih izpolnjuje, pokazal vam bom, komu je podoben. 
[6:48] Podoben je človeku, kteri je zidal hišo, in jo izkopal in izdolbel, in postavil temelj na skalo; in ko je nastala povodenj, udarila je roka v tisto hišo, in ni je mogla premakniti: kajti bila je postavljena na skalo. 
[6:49] A kdor sliši in ne storí, podoben je človeku, kteri je sezidal hišo na zemlji brez temelja; na ktero je udarila reka: in precej je padla, in bila je podrtija té hiše velika. 
[7:1] A ko je končal vse té besede pred ljudstvom, vnide v Kapernaum. 
[7:2] Nekemu stotniku pa je bil hlapec bolan, kterega je rad imel, in je umiral. 
[7:3] In slišavši za Jezusa, pošlje k njemu starešine Judovske, proseč ga, naj bi prišel, da bi mu uzdravil hlapca. 
[7:4] Oni pa, ko so prišli k Jezusu, prosili so ga silno, govoreč: Gotovo je vreden, da mu to storiš; 
[7:5] Ker ljubi narod naš, in shajališče nam je sezidal on. 
[7:6] A Jezus je šel ž njimi. In ko uže ni bil daleč od hiše, pošlije k njemu stotnik prijatelje, govoreč mu: Gospod, ne trudi se! nisem namreč vreden, da vnideš pod streho mojo. 
[7:7] Za to tudi samega sebe nisem vrednega štel, da bi prišel k tebi: nego reci z besedo, in ozdravel bo hlapec moj. 
[7:8] Kajti tudi jaz sem človek pod oblast postavljen, in imam pod seboj vojake; pa velim temu: Pojdi! in gre; in drugemu: Pridi! in pride; in hlapcu svojemu: Stóri to! in storí. 
[7:9] Slišavši pa to Jezus, začudi mu se; in obrnivši se, reče ljudstvu, ktero je šlo za njim: Pravim vam, da tudi v Izraelu nisem našel tolike vere. 
[7:10] In vrnivši se domú, kteri so bili poslani, najdejo hlapca, kteri je bil bolan, da je zdrav. 
[7:11] In zgodí se po tem, da je šel v mesto, ktero se imenuje Nain; in šlo je ž njim veliko učencev njegovih, in veliko ljudstva. 
[7:12] Ko se pa približa vratom mestnim, in glej, nesli so ven mrliča, sina edinca matere njegove; in ona vdova; in ljudî iz mesta je bilo veliko ž njo. 
[7:13] In ko jo Gospod ugleda, zasmili mu se, in reče jej: Ne jokaj! 
[7:14] In pristopivši, dotakne se odra; (a tisti, kteri so nosili, ustavijo se;) ter reče: Mladenič, tebi pravim, vstani! 
[7:15] In usede se mrlič, in začne govoriti: in dá ga materi njegovej. 
[7:16] Obide pa jih groza vse, in hvalili so Boga, govoreč: Prerok velik je vstal med nami; in: Obiskal je Bog ljudstvo svoje. 
[7:17] In razglasí se ta beseda o njem po vsej Judeji, in po vsem okolnem kraji. 
[7:18] In sporočili so Janezu učenči njegovi za vse to. 
[7:19] In poklicavši Janez dva od učencev svojih, pošlje k Jezusu, govoreč: Ti li si tisti, kteri ima priti, ali naj drugega čakamo? 
[7:20] Ko torej moža prideta k Jezusu, rečeta: Janez Krstnik naju je poslal k tebi, govoreč: Ti li si tisti, kteri ima priti, ali naj drugega čakamo? 
[7:21] Ravno ta čas pa uzdravil jih je veliko od bolezni in muk in duhov hudobnih, in mnogim slepcem je dal vid. 
[7:22] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče jima: Pojdita in sporočita Janezu, kar sta videla in slišala: da slepci spregledujejo, hromi hodijo, gobavci da se očiščajo, gluhi da slišijo, mrtvi da vstajajo, ubogim da se oznanjuje evangelj: 
[7:23] In blagor mu, kdor se ne pohujša od mene. 
[7:24] In ko sta poslanca Janezova odšla, začne govoriti ljudstvu o Janezu: Koga ste izšli v puščavo gledat? trst, kterega veter maje? 
[7:25] Ali koga ste izšli gledat? človeka v mehko obleko oblečenega? Glej, kteri se v gosposko obleko oblačijo in v slasti živé, ti so po dvorih kraljévih. 
[7:26] Ali koga ste izšli gledat? preroka? Dà, pravim vam, in še več ko preroka. 
[7:27] Ta je, za kogar je pisano: "Glej, jaz pošiljam angelja svojega pred obličjem tvojim, kteri bo pripravil pot tvojo pred teboj." 
[7:28] Kajti pravim vam, da nobeden izmed rojenih od žen ni veči prerok od Janeza Krstnika; a kdor je najmanji v kraljestvu Božjem, veči je od njega. 
[7:29] In vsi ljudjé, kteri so to slišali, in mitarji, opravičili so Boga, krstivši se s krstom Janezovim. 
[7:30] A Farizeji in učeniki postave zavrgli so svét Božji sami zoper sebe, in niso se dali krstiti od njega. 
[7:31] Ter reče Gospod: Komu torej bom primeril ljudí tega rodú? in komu so podobni? 
[7:32] Podobni so otrokom, kteri po ulici posedajo, in vpijejo: Piskali smo vam, in niste plesali; tarnali smo vam, in niste jokali. 
[7:33] Kajti prišel je Janez Krstnik, in ne jé kruha in ne pije vina, pa pravite: Hudiča ima! 
[7:34] Prišel je sin človečji, in jé in pije, pa pravite: Glej ga človeka požeruha in pijanca, prijatelja mitarjev in grešnikov! 
[7:35] In opravičili so modrost vsi nje otroci. 
[7:36] Prosil ga pa je eden od Farizejev, naj bi jedel ž njim; ter vnide v hišo Farizejevo, in sede za mizo. 
[7:37] In glej, žena v mestu, ktera je bila grešnica, ko je bila zvedela, da sedí za mizo v hiši Farizejevej, prinese sklenico mire, 
[7:38] In stoječ zadej pri nogah njegovih, začne opirati noge njegove s solzami, in z lasmí z glave svoje jih je otirala, in poljubovala je noge njegove, in mazilila jih je z miro. 
[7:39] Ko pa ugleda to Farizej, kteri ga je bil povabil, reče sam s seboj, govoreč: Ta ko bi bil prerok, vedel bi, kdo in kakošna je žena, ktera se ga dotika; kajti grešnica je. 
[7:40] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče mu: Simon! imam ti nekaj povedati. On pa reče: Učenik, povéj! 
[7:41] Dva dolžnika je imel neki upnik; eden je bil dolžen pet sto srebrnikov, a drugi petdeset. 
[7:42] Ker pa nista imela s čim plačati, odpusti dolg obema. Povéj torej, kteri od nju ga bo bolj ljubil? 
[7:43] Odgovarjajoč pa Simon, reče: Menim, da tisti, kteremu je več odpustil. On mu pa reče: Prav si odgovoril. 
[7:44] In obrnivši se k ženi, reče Simonu: Vidiš to ženo? Prišel sem v hišo, vode mi nisi podal na noge; a ta mi je s solzami oprala noge, in z lasmí z glave svoje jih je otrla. 
[7:45] Poljubca mi nisi dal; ta pa, odkar sem prišel noter, ni nehala poljubovati nog mojih. 
[7:46] Z oljem glave moje nisi pomazal; a ta mi je z miro pomazala noge. 
[7:47] Za to ti pravim: Odpuščajo jej se mnogi grehi njeni; kajti imela je veliko ljubezen: a komur se malo odpušča, malo ljubi. 
[7:48] In reče jej: Odpuščajo ti se grehi. 
[7:49] Pa začnó, kteri so ž njim sedeli za mizo, govoriti v sebi: Kdo je ta, ki tudi grehe odpušča? 
[7:50] Ter reče ženi: Vera tvoja ti je pomogla; pojdi v miru. 
[8:1] In zgodí se po tem, in on je hodil po mestih in vaséh, učeč in oznanjujoč evangelj o kraljestvu Božjem; in dvanajsteri ž njim, 
[8:2] In nektere žene, ktere so uzdravljene bile od duhov hudobnih in od bolezni, Marija, ki se imenuje Magdalena, iz ktere je bilo sedem hudičev izšlo, 
[8:3] Joana žena Huza pristavnika Herodovega, in Suzana, in drugih veliko, ktere so mu služile z imenjem svojim. 
[8:4] Ko se je pa veliko ljudstva sešlo, in tistih, kteri so iz mest prihajali k njemu, pové jim v priliki: 
[8:5] Izšel je sejalec sejat seme svoje; in ko je sejal, eno je padlo poleg ceste, in pogazilo se je, in tice nebeške so ga pozobale. 
[8:6] In drugo je padlo na skalo, in ko je pognalo, usahnilo je, ker ni imelo vlage. 
[8:7] In drugo je padlo sredi trnja, in trnje je zrastlo, in udušilo ga je. 
[8:8] In drugo je padlo na dobro zemljo, in ko je pognalo, doneslo je stoteri sad. Ko je to pravil, klical je: Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[8:9] Vpraševali pa so ga učenci njegovi, govoreč: Kakošna bi bila ta prilika? 
[8:10] On pa reče: Vam je dano, da spoznate skrivnosti kraljestva Božjega; drugim pa v prilikah, da gledajo in ne vidijo, ter slišijo in ne umejo. 
[8:11] Ta prilika pa je: Seme je beseda Božja: 
[8:12] A kteri so poleg ceste posejani, ti so, kteri slišijo: ali potem pride hudič in vzeme besedo iz srca njih, da ne bi verovali in zveličali se. 
[8:13] A kteri so na skalo posejani, ti, kteri besedo, ko so jo sklišali, z veseljem sprejemajo; in ti korenine nimajo, kteri nekaj časa verujejo, a v čas izkušnjave odpadejo. 
[8:14] Kar je pa v trnje padlo, to so ti, kteri slišijo: ali ker za skrbmí in bogastvom in slastmi življenja hodijo, udušé se, in ne donašajo sadú. 
[8:15] Kar je pa na dobro zemljo padlo, to so ti, kteri v dobrem in blagem srcu varujejo besedo, ktero so slišali, in donašajo sad v trpljenji. 
[8:16] Nikdor pa sveče, ko jo prižgè, ne skrije pod mernik, ali dene pod posteljo; nego postavi jo na svečnik, da ti, kteri vhajajo, vidijo luč. 
[8:17] Kajti nič ni prikritega, kar se ne bo razodelo; tudi skrivnega ne, kar se ne bo zvedelo in na svetlo prišlo. 
[8:18] Glejte torej, kako boste poslušali: kajti kdor imá, dalo mu se bo; a kdor nima, odvzelo mu se bo tudi to, kar misli, da ima. 
[8:19] Pridejo pa k njemu mati njegova in bratje njegovi; ali za voljo ljudstva niso mogli priti do njega. 
[8:20] In sporočé mu, govoreč: Mati tvoja in bratje tvoji stojé zunej, in radi bi te videli. 
[8:21] On pa odgovarjajoč, reče jim: Mati moja in bratje moji so ti, kteri besedo Božjo poslušajo in delajo po njej. 
[8:22] In zgodí se en dan, in on stopi v ladjo in učenci njegovi; in reče jim: Prepeljimo se na oni kraj jezera! In odpeljejo se. 
[8:23] A ko so se peljali, zaspí. Kar snide vihar na jezero, in potapljali so se, in bili so v nevarnosti. 
[8:24] In pristopivši, zbudé ga, govoreč: Učenik! učenik! pogibamo! A on vstavši, zapretí vetru in valovju; in umirita se, in nastala je tihota. 
[8:25] In reče jim: Kje je vera vaša? A oni so se uplašili, in začudijo se, govoreč eden drugemu: Kdo neki je ta, da tudi vetrovom zapoveduje in vodi, in poslušajo ga? 
[8:26] In preplavijo se v zemljo Gadarensko, ktera je Galileji nasproti. 
[8:27] Ko pa izide na zemljo, sreča ga en človek iz mesta, kteri je imel hudiča uže dolgo časa, in v obleko se ni oblačil, in v hiši ni prebival, nego v grobih. 
[8:28] A ko ugleda Jezusa, zakričí in pade pred-nj, in z močnim glasom reče: Kaj imaš z menoj, Jezus, sin Boga najvišega: Prosim te, nikar mene muči! 
[8:29] Ukazal je bil namreč duhu nečistemu, naj izide iz človeka: kajti uže dolgo časa ga je bil metal, in vezali so ga z verigami in vezmí, ter so ga varovali; ali potrgal je vezí, in gonil ga je hudič po puščavah. 
[8:30] Vpraša pa ga Jezus, govoreč: Kako ti je ime? On pa reče: Množica; kajti obsedlo ga je bilo mnogo hudičev. 
[8:31] In prosili so ga, naj jim ne zapové iti v brezno. 
[8:32] Bila je pa tam velika čreda svinj, ktere so se pasle na gori; in prosili so ga, naj jim dovoli, da vnidejo va-nje. In dovoli jim. 
[8:33] In hudiči izidejo iz človeka in vnidejo v svinje; in zakadí se čreda z brega v jezero, in potonejo. 
[8:34] Videvši pa pastirji, kar se je zgodilo, pobegnejo, ter odidejo in sporočé po mestu in po vaséh. 
[8:35] Ter izidejo gledat, kaj se je zgodilo; in pridejo k Jezusu, in najdejo človeka, iz kterega so bili hudiči izšli, da je oblečen in pameten, in sedí pri nogah Jezusovih; in uplašijo se. 
[8:36] Sporočé pa jim tudi ti, kteri so bili videli, kako je obsedenec ozdravel. 
[8:37] In zaprosi ga vsa množica iz okolice Gadarenske, naj odide od njih; kajti strah velik jih je preletal. A on stopi v ladjo in se vrne. 
[8:38] Prosil pa ga je mož, iz kterega so bili izšli hudiči, da bi bil ž njim; ali Jezus ga odpravi, govoreč: 
[8:39] Vrni se na dom svoj, in pripoveduj, kaj ti je storil Bog. Pa odide, po vsem mestu oznanjujoč, kaj mu je storil Jezus. 
[8:40] Zgodí se pa, ko se vrne Jezus, sprejme ga ljudstvo; kajti vsi so ga pričakovali. 
[8:41] In glej, pa pride mož, kteremu je bilo ime Jair, (in ta je bil starešina v shajališči,) in pade Jezusu pred noge, in prosil ga je, naj vnide v hišo njegovo; 
[8:42] Kajti imel je hčer edinico pri dvanajstih letih, in ta je umirala. A ko je šel, stiskalo ga je ljudstvo. 
[8:43] In žena, ktera je imela krvotok uže dvanajst let, in je bila vse imenje svoje potrošila na zdravnike, ktere ni mogel nobeden uzdraviti. 
[8:44] Pristopi od zadi in se dotakne robú obleke njegove; in precej se je ustavil vir krví njene. 
[8:45] Pa reče Jezus: Kdo se me je dotaknil? Ko so se pa vsi odgovarjali, reče Peter in kteri so bili ž njim; Učenik, ljudstvo te gnjete in stiska, pa praviš: Kdo se me je dotaknil? 
[8:46] Jezus pa reče: Nekdo se me je dotaknil; kajti jaz sem očutil, da je odšla moč od mene. 
[8:47] Videč pa žena, da se ni prikrila, pristopi drhtajoč, in pade pred-nj, in pové mu pred vsem ljudstvom, za kaj se ga je dotaknila, in kako je ozdravela precej. 
[8:48] On jej pa reče: Zaupaj, hčer! vera tvoja ti je pomogla; pojdi v miru. 
[8:49] Ko je še govoril, pride nekdo od starešine shajališčnega, govoreč mu: Umrla je hčer tvoja; ne trudi učenika. 
[8:50] Slišavši pa to Jezus, odgovorí mu, govoreč: Ne boj se! le veruj, in ozdravela bo. 
[8:51] Ko je pa prišel v hišo, ni dal nikomur vniti, razen Petru in Jakobu in Janezu, in očetu in materi deklice. 
[8:52] Vsi pa so jokali, in tarnali po njej. On pa reče: Ne jokajte! ni umrla, nego spí. 
[8:53] In posmehovali so mu se, vedoč, da je umrla. 
[8:54] On pa izgnavši vse, in prijemši jo za roko, zakliče, govoreč: Deklica, vstani! 
[8:55] In vrne se duh nje, in vstala je precej; in ukaže jim, naj jej dadó jesti. 
[8:56] In zavzemeta se roditelja njena; a on jima naročí, naj nikomur ne povesta, kar se je zgodilo. 
[9:1] Sklicavši pa dvanajstere učence svoje, dá jim moč in oblast nad vsemi hudiči, in da naj uzdravljajo bolezni; 
[9:2] In odpošlje jih oznanjevat kraljestva Božjega, in uzdravljat bolnike. 
[9:3] In reče jim: Ničesar ne jemljite na pot; ne palice, ne torbe, ne kruha, ne denarja; tudi po dva plašča ne imejte. 
[9:4] In v kterokoli hišo vnidete, tu prebivajte, in odtod izhajajte. 
[9:5] In kterikoli vas ne sprejmó, izidite iz tistega mesta, in otresite prag z nog svojih, za pričo zoper njih. 
[9:6] Ter izidejo in hodili so po vaséh, oznanjujoč evangelj in uzdravljajoč povsodi. 
[9:7] Slišal je pa Herod četrtnik vse, kaj on dela; in ni se mogel načuditi, ker so nekteri pravili: Janez je vstal od mrtvih; 
[9:8] A drugi: Elija je prišel; drugi pa: Starih prerokov eden jo vstal. 
[9:9] Pa reče Herod: Janeza sem jaz posekal; kdo pa je ta, za kogar jaz slišim takošne reči? In želel ga je videti. 
[9:10] In vrnivši se aposteljni, povedó mu, kar so storili; in vzeme jih, in odide posebej na samoten kraj mesta, ktero se imenuje Betsajda. 
[9:11] Zvedevši pa to ljudstvo, odidejo za njim; in sprejme jih, in govoril jim je o kraljestvu Božjem, in kteri so potrebovali zdravja, uzdravljal jih je. 
[9:12] A dan se je jel nagibati; in pristopivši dvanajsteri, rekó mu: Odpusti ljudstvo, da odidejo v okolne vasi in pristave, in tam prenočé, in najdejo živeža: kajti tu smo v samotnem kraji. 
[9:13] Pa jim reče: Dajte jim vi jesti. Oni pa rekó: Nimamo več, nego pet hlebov in dve ribi, razen če odidemo mi, da kupimo za vse to ljudstvo jedî. 
[9:14] Bilo jih je namreč kakih pet tisoči mož. Pa reče učencem svojim: Posadite jih po petdeset v vrsto. 
[9:15] In storé tako, in posadé vse. 
[9:16] Vzemši pa petere hlebe in tisti dve ribi, ozrè se na nebo in jih blagoslovi, ter prelomi, in dajal je učencem, naj položé pred ljudstvo. 
[9:17] In jedli so, in nasitili so se vsi; in pobrali so, kar jim je ostalo od košcev, dvanajst košev. 
[9:18] In zgodí se, ko je na samem molil, bili so ž njim učenci; in vpraševal jih je, govoreč: Kdo pravijo ljudjé, da sem jaz? 
[9:19] Oni pa odgovarjajoč, rekó: Janez Krstnik; drugi pa Elija; a drugi, da je eden starih prerokov vstal. 
[9:20] Pa jim reče: Vi pa, kdo pravite, da sem jaz? Odgovarjajoč pa Peter, reče: Kristus Božji. 
[9:21] A on jim zapretí in naročí, naj nikomur ne povedó tega, 
[9:22] Govoreč: Sinu človečjemu je treba veliko pretrpeti, in zavrženemu biti od starešin in vélikih duhovnov in pismarjev, in umorjenemu biti, in tretji dan vstati. 
[9:23] In pravil je vsem: Če kdo hoče za menoj iti, zatají naj samega sebe, in vzeme križ svoj vsak dan, in gre za menoj. 
[9:24] Kajti kdor hoče dušo svojo ohraniti, izgubil jo bo; kdor pa izgubí dušo svojo za voljo mene, ta jo bo ohranil. 
[9:25] Kaj namreč pomaga človeku, če pridobí ves svet, samega sebe pa pogubí ali si škodo napravi? 
[9:26] Kdor se bo namreč sramoval mene in mojih besed, tega se bo tudi sin človečji sramoval, kedar pride v svojej in očetovej in svetih angeljev slavi. 
[9:27] Pravim vam pa resnično, da so nekteri med témi, ki stojé tu, kteri ne bodo okusili smrti, dokler ne vidijo kraljestva Božjega. 
[9:28] Zgodí se pa kakih osem dní po teh besedah, pa vzeme Petra in Jakoba in Janeza, in izide na goro molit. 
[9:29] In ko je molil, postane podoba obličja njegovega drugačna, in oblačilo njegovo belo in svetlo. 
[9:30] In glej, moža dva sta govorila ž njim, ktera sta bila Mojzes in Elija; 
[9:31] Ktera sta se prikazala v slavi in sta govorila o koncu njegovem, ki ga je imel dokončati v Jeruzalemu. 
[9:32] A Peter in ktera sta bila ž njim, bili so zaspali; a ko se prebudé, ugledajo slavo njegovo, in oba moža, ktera sta ž njim stala. 
[9:33] In zgodí se, ko sta odhajala od njega, reče Peter Jezusu: Učenik, dobro nam je tu biti; bomo pa naredili tri šatore, enega tebi, in Mojzesu enega, in enega Eliju: ne vedoč, kaj govori. 
[9:34] Ko je pa to govoril, nastane oblak in ju zakrije; in zbojé se, ko vnideta v oblak. 
[9:35] In glas se oglasí iz oblaka, govoreč: Ta je sin moj ljubljeni; njega poslušajte. 
[9:36] In ko se je bil glas oglasil, najdejo Jezusa samega. In oni zamolčé, in nikomur niso tiste dní nič povedali od tega, kar so bili videli. 
[9:37] Zgodí se pa drugi dan, ko pridejo z gore, sreča ga veliko ljudstva. 
[9:38] In glej, mož iz ljudstva zavpije, govoreč: Učenik, prosim te, ozri se na sina mojega; kajti edinec mi je. 
[9:39] In glej, hudič ga napada, in precej kričí, in lomi ga s peno, in komaj potem odide od njega, ko ga je zvil. 
[9:40] In prosil sem učence tvoje, naj bi ga izgnali, in niso mogli. 
[9:41] Odgovarjajoč pa Jezus, reče: O rod neverni in popačeni! doklej bom pri vas in vas bom trpel? pripelji sèm sina svojega! 
[9:42] In ko je še k njemu šel, zgrabi ga hudič in strese; a Jezus zapretí duhu nečistemu, in uzdravi dečka, in dá ga očetu njegovemu. 
[9:43] In vsi so se čudili veličastvu Božjemu. Ko so se pa vsi čudili vsemu, kar je storil Jezus, reče učencem svojim: 
[9:44] Ohranite vi v ušesih svojih te besede; kajti sin človečji bo izdan v roke človeške. 
[9:45] Oni pa niso umeli te besede, in bila jim je prikrita, da je niso razumeli; in bali so se, da bi ga vprašali za to besedo. 
[9:46] Všla je bila pa misel vanje, kdo bi bil največi med njimi. 
[9:47] Jezus pa, vedoč misel srca njih, vzeme otroka, in postavi ga pred se, 
[9:48] In reče jim: Kdorkoli sprejme tega otroka v ime moje, mene sprejema; a kdorkoli mene sprejme, sprejema tega, kdor me je poslal. Kdor je namreč najmanji med vami, ta bo velik. 
[9:49] Odgovarjajoč pa Janez, reče: Učenik, videli smo nekoga, kteri je z imenom tvojim izganjal hudiče; in zabranili smo mu, ker ne hodi z nami za teboj. 
[9:50] In reče mu Jezus: Ne branite! Kdor namreč ni zoper nas, on je z nami. 
[9:51] Zgodí se pa, ko so se dopolnjevali dnevi vzhoda njegovega, pa se on na ravnost v Jeruzalem nameri. 
[9:52] In pošlje poslance pred obličjem svojim; in ti odidejo in vnidejo v vas Samarijansko, da mu pripravijo prenočišča. 
[9:53] Ali niso ga hoteli sprejeti, ker so videli, da gre v Jeruzalem. 
[9:54] Videvši pa to učenca njegova Jakob in Janez, rečeta: Gospod, hočeš li, da rečeva, naj ogenj snide z neba, in jih potrebi, kakor je tudi Elija storil? 
[9:55] Obrnivši se pa, zapretí jim, in reče: Ne véste, kakošnega duha ste vi; 
[9:56] Sin človečji namreč ni prišel duš človeških gubit, nego da jih zveliča, In šli so v drugo vas. 
[9:57] Zgodí se pa, ko so šli, reče mu nekdo po poti: Šel bom za teboj, karmorkoli odideš, Gospod! 
[9:58] In reče mu Jezus: Lisice imajo brloge, in tice nebeške gnezda; a sin človečji nima kje glave nasloniti, 
[9:59] A drugemu reče: Pojdi za menoj! On pa reče: Gospod, dovoli mi, da prej odidem in pokopljem očeta svojega. 
[9:60] Ali Jezus mu reče: Pusti, naj mrliči pokopljejo mrliče svoje; ti pa pojdi in oznanjuj kraljestvo Božje. 
[9:61] Zopet drugi pa reče: Šel bom za teboj, Gospod! ali dovoli mi, da se poprej poslovim z domačimi svojimi. 
[9:62] In reče mu Jezus: Nobeden ni pripraven za kraljestvo Božje, kdor položí roko svojo na plug, pa se ozira na to, kar je zadej. 
[10:1] Po tem pa izvoli Gospod še drugih sedemdeset, in pošlje jih po dva in dva pred obličjem svojim v vsako mesto in kraj, kamor je imel sam priti. 
[10:2] In pravil jim je: Žetve je sicer mnogo, ali delalcev malo; prosite torej gospodarja žetve, naj pošlje delalcev na žetev svojo. 
[10:3] Pojdite; glej, jaz vas pošiljam kakor jagnjeta sredi volkov. 
[10:4] Ne nosite mošnje, ne torbe, ne obutala; in nikogar na poti ne pozdravljajte. 
[10:5] V kterokoli pa hišo vnidete, naprej recite: Mir tej hiši! 
[10:6] In če bo tu sin mirú, ostal bo mir vaš na njem; če pa ne vrnil se bo k vam. 
[10:7] A v tej hiši prebivajte, in jejte in pijte, kar imajo; kajti vreden je delalec plačila svojega. Ne prehajajte iz hiše v hišo. 
[10:8] In v kterokoli mesto pridete, in vas sprejmó, jejte, kar vam postavijo, 
[10:9] In uzdravljajte bolnike, kteri so v njej, in pravite jim: Približalo se je k vam kraljestvo Božje. 
[10:10] A v kterokoli mesto pridete, in vas ne sprejmó, izidite na ulice njegove in recite: 
[10:11] Tudi prah, ki se nas je v mestu vašem prijel, otresamo vam; ali vedite to, da se je približalo k vam kraljestvo Božje. 
[10:12] Pravim vam pa, da bo Sodomljanom tisti dan laže, nego temu mestu. 
[10:13] Gorjé ti, Korazin! gorjé ti, Betsajda! kajti ko bi se bili v Tiru in Sidonu zgodili čudeži, kteri so se zgodili v vama, bila bi se davno, v žaklji in pepelu sedeč, spokorila. 
[10:14] Ali Tiru in Sidonu bo laže na sodbi, nego vama. 
[10:15] In ti, Kapernaum, ki si se do neba povzdignil, zagnan boš do pekla. 
[10:16] Kdor posluša vas, posluša mene; in kdor se odreka vas, odreka se mene: a kdor se mene odreka, odreka se tega, kdor me je poslal. 
[10:17] Vrnejo pa se sedemdeseteri z radostjo, govoreč: Gospod, tudi hudiči so nam pokorni v imenu tvojem. 
[10:18] Pa jim reče: Videl sem satana, da je padel z neba kakor blisk. 
[10:19] Glej, dajem vam oblast stopati na kače in škorpijone, in vso silo vražjo: in nič vam ne bo škodovalo. 
[10:20] Ali temu se ne radujte, da so vam hudiči pokorni; radujte se pa marveč, da so imena vaša zapisana na nebesih. 
[10:21] V ta čas se oveselí Jezus v duhu, in reče: Zahvaljujem ti, oče, Gospodar neba in zemlje! da si to prikril modrim in razumnim, in si je razodel nedoraslim; dà, oče: ker tako je bila volja tvoja. 
[10:22] Vse mi je izročil oče moj; in nikdor ne vé, kdo je sin, razen oče, in kdo je oče, razen sin, in komurkoli če sin razodeti. 
[10:23] In obrnivši se k učencem posebej, reče: Blagor očém, ktere vidijo, kar vi vidite, 
[10:24] Kajti pravim vam, da je veliko prerokov in kraljev želelo videti, kar vi vidite, in niso videli; in slišati, kar vi slišite, in niso slišali. 
[10:25] In glej, učenik postave vstane, in izkušajoč ga, reče: Učenik, kaj naj storim, da zadobóm večno življenje? 
[10:26] On mu pa reče: V zakonu kaj je pisano? kako bereš? 
[10:27] On pa odgovarjajoč, reče: "Ljubi Gospoda Boga svojega iz vsega srca svojega, in iz vse duše svoje, in iz vse močí svoje, in iz vse pameti svoje;" in: "a bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe." 
[10:28] Pa mu reče: Prav si odgovoril; to delaj, in živel boš. 
[10:29] On pa, hoteč samega sebe opravičiti, reče Jezusu: Kdo pa je bližnji moj? 
[10:30] Odgovarjajoč pa Jezus, reče: En človek je šel iz Jeruzalema v Jeriho in je med razbojnike padel, kteri so, ko so ga bili slekli in ranili, odšli, pustivši ga na pol mrtvega. 
[10:31] Po naključbi pa je šel neki duhoven po tej poti, in videvši ga prejde mimo. 
[10:32] Enako pa tudi Levit, ko je bil na tem mestu, pride, in videvši ga, prejde mimo. 
[10:33] Neki Samarijan pa, kteri je šel po poti, pride do njega; in ko ga ugleda, zasmili mu se. 
[10:34] In pristopivši, obveže mu rane, in vlije olja in vina; in posadivši ga na svoje kljuse, pripelje ga v gostilnico, in poskrbi za-nj. 
[10:35] Drugi dan pa, ko je odhajal, vzeme dva srebrnika iz mošnje, in dá krčmarju, in reče mu: Skrbi za-nj; in karkoli več boš potrošil, povrnil ti bom jaz, kedar se vrnem. 
[10:36] Kdo torej od teh tréh ti se zdí, da je bil bližnji temu, ki je padel med razbojnike? 
[10:37] On pa reče: Ta, kteri se ga je usmilil. Reče mu torej: Pojdi, tudi ti delaj enako. 
[10:38] Zgodí se pa, ko so šli, pa vnide on v eno vas; a neka žena po imenu Marta sprejme ga v hišo svojo. 
[10:39] In ta je imela sestro, ktera se je imenovala Marija, ktera je tudi sedeč pri nogah Jezusovih poslušala besedo njegovo. 
[10:40] A Marta si je dajala veliko opraviti s postrežbo; ter pristopi, in reče: Gospod, kaj ti ni mar, da me je sestra moja samo pustila, naj strežem? Reci jej torej, naj mi pomore. 
[10:41] Odgovarjajoč pa, reče jej Jezus: Marta! Marta! skrbiš in trudiš se za mnogo; 
[10:42] Ali le eno je potrebno. A Marija je dobri del izvolila, kteri jej se ne bo odvzel. 
[11:1] In zgodí se, ko je na nekem kraji molil, potem ko je nehal, reče mu eden učencev njegovih: Gospod, nauči nas moliti, kakor je tudi Janez naučil učence svoje. 
[11:2] Pa jim reče: Kedar boste molili, govorite: Oče naš, ki si na nebesih, posveti se ime tvoje: pridi kraljestvo tvoje; bodi volja tvoja, kakor na nebu, tudi na zemlji. 
[11:3] Kruh naš vsakdanji dáj nam vsak dan. 
[11:4] In odpusti nam grehe naše, ker tudi mi odpuščamo vsakemu dolžniku svojemu. In ne vpelji nas v izkušnjavo, nego reši nas zlega. 
[11:5] In reče jim: Kdo od vas ima prijatelja, in pojde k njemu o polnoči in mu poreče: Prijatelj, posodi mi tri hlebe, 
[11:6] Ker je prijatelj moj k meni prišel s pota, pa mu nimam kaj postaviti; 
[11:7] On pa, da odgovarjajoč znotraj poreče: Ne nadleguj mi; duri so uže zaprte, in otroci moji so z menoj v postelji; ne morem vstati, da bi ti dal. 
[11:8] Pravim vam, če tudi ne bo vstal, da bi mu dal za to, ker mu je prijatelj, vstal bo vsaj za voljo nesramnosti njegove, da mu dá, kar mu jo treba. 
[11:9] In jaz vam pravim: Prosite, in dalo vam se bo; iščite, in našli boste; trkajte, in odprlo vam se bo. 
[11:10] Kajti vsak, kdor prosi, prejema? in kdor išče, nahaja; in kdor trka, odpiralo mu se bo. 
[11:11] Kdo od vas je pa oče, da če ga prosi sin kruha, da mu bo dal kamen? ali če prosi ribe, da mu bo mesto ribe, dal kačo? 
[11:12] Ali če prosi jajca, ba mu bo dal škorpijona? 
[11:13] Če torej vi, ki ste hudobni, znate dobre darove dajati otrokom svojim, koliko več bo dal oče nebeški Duha svetega tém, kteri ga prosijo? 
[11:14] In izganjal je hudiča, in ta je bil mutast; zgodí se pa, ko je hudič izšel, mutec pregovorí: in ljudstvo se začudi. 
[11:15] A nekteri od njih rekó: Z Belzebulom poglavarjem hudičev izganja hudiče. 
[11:16] Drugi pa, izkušajoč ga, iskali so od njega znamenja z neba. 
[11:17] On pa, spoznavši njih misli, reče jim: Vsako kraljestvo, ktero se je samo zoper sebe razdvojilo, opustelo bo; in dom, kteri se je sam zoper sebe razdvojil, razpadel bo. 
[11:18] Če se je pa tudi satan sam zoper sebe razdvojil, kako bo obstalo kraljestvo njegovo? ko pravite, da z Belzebulom izganjam hudiče. 
[11:19] A če jaz z Belzebulom izganjam hudiče, s čegavo pomočjo izganjajo sinovi vaši? Za to vam bodo oni sodniki. 
[11:20] Če pa s prstom Božjim izganjam hudiče, prišlo je torej k vam kraljestvo Božje. 
[11:21] Kedar se močni oboroži, in varuje dvor svoj, na miru bo imenje njegovo; 
[11:22] Če pa pride močneji od njega in ga premaga, vzel bo vse orožje njegovo, kteremu je zaupal, in razdelil bo plen njegov. 
[11:23] Kdor ni z menoj, on je zoper mé; in kdor ne zbira z menoj, razsiplje. 
[11:24] Kedar nečisti duh izide iz človeka, hodi po suhih krajih in išče pokoja; in ko ga ne najde, pravi: Vrnil se bom v dom svoj, odkoder sem izšel. 
[11:25] In ko pride, najde pometenega in olepšanega. 
[11:26] Tedaj odide in vzeme sedem drugih duhov, hujih od sebe, in ko vnidejo, prebivajo tu. In poslednje bo temu človeku huje od prvega. 
[11:27] Zgodí se pa, ko je govoril to, povzdigne neka žena glas izmed ljudstva, in reče mu: Blagor telesu, ktero te je nosilo; in prsom, ktera si sisal. 
[11:28] On pa reče: Veliko bolj blagor tém, kteri besedo Božjo poslušajo in jo varujejo! 
[11:29] Ko se je pa ljudstvo zbiralo, začne jim govoriti: Ta rod je hudoben: znamenja išče, ali ne bo mu se dalo znamenje, razen znamenje Jona preroka. 
[11:30] Kakor je bil namreč Jona znamenje Ninevljanom, tako bo tudi sin človečji temu rodu. 
[11:31] Kraljica južna bo vstala na sodbo z možmí tega roda, in obsodila jih bo; kajti prišla je od kraja sveta, poslušat modrost Solomonovo: in glej, tu je veči od Solomona. 
[11:32] Možjé Ninevljani bodo vstali na sodbo s tem rodom, in obsodili ga bodo; kajti spokorili so se po pridigi Jona; in glej, tu je veči od Jona. 
[11:33] Nikdor pa sveče, ko jo užge, dene na skrivno, tudi ne pod mernik; nego na svečnik, da tí, kteri vhajajo, vidijo luč. 
[11:34] Sveča telesu je oko: kedar bo torej oko tvoje prosto, svetlo bo tudi vse telo tvoje; če bo pa hudobno, temno bo tudi telo tvoje. 
[11:35] Za to glej, da ne bo luč, ktera je v tebi, tema. 
[11:36] Če bo torej vse telo tvoje svetlo, da ne bo imelo nobenega uda temnega, svetlo bo vse, kakor kedar te sveča s svetlobo obsija. 
[11:37] Ko je pa izgovoril, prosil ga je neki Farizej, naj bi obedoval pri njem; ter vnide in sede za mizo. 
[11:38] A Farizej se začudi, videvši, da se ni prej umil pred obedom. 
[11:39] Gospod mu pa reče: Sedaj vi Farizeji čistite sklenico in skledo od zunej; a notranje vaše je polno ropa in hudobije. 
[11:40] Neumneži; mar ni ta, kdor je naredil to, kar je zunej, tudi tega, kar je znotrej, naredil? 
[11:41] Ali dajte miloščino od tega, kar je notri: in glej, vse vam bo čisto. 
[11:42] Ali gorjé vam Farizejem! da dajete desetino od mete in od rute in vsakega zelišča, izogibate pa se sodbe in ljubezni Božje: to je bilo treba storiti, in onega ne opustiti. 
[11:43] Gorjé vam Farizejem! da ljubite prve stole po shajališčih, in pozdrave po ulicah. 
[11:44] Gorjé vam, pismarji in Farizeji, hinavci! da ste kakor pokriti grobi, po kterih ljudjé hodijo, in ne vedó zanje. 
[11:45] Odgovarjajoč pa eden od učenikov postave, reče mu: Učenik, govoreč to, sramotiš tudi nas. 
[11:46] On pa reče: Gorjé tudi vam učenikom postave! da nakladate ljudém neprenesljive butare, a sami se ne z enim prstom svojim ne dotaknete butar. 
[11:47] Gorjé vam! da zidate grobe prerokom, a očetje vaši so jih pobili. 
[11:48] Za to pričate in potrjujete dela očetov svojih: kajti oni so jih pobili, a vi jim zidate grobe. 
[11:49] Za to je tudi modrost Božja rekla: Poslal jim bom preroke in aposteljne, in nektere od njih bodo pobili, a druge bodo pregnali: 
[11:50] Da se bo tirjala kri vseh prerokov, ktera se je prelila od začetka sveta, do tega rodú, 
[11:51] Od krvi Abeljnove do krvi Zaharijeve, kteri je poginil med oltarjem in tempeljnom. Dà, pravim vam, tirjala se bo od tega rodú. 
[11:52] Gorjé vam učenikom postave! da ste vzeli ključ od znanja; sami niste šli noter, a kteri so hoteli vniti, tém ste zabranili. 
[11:53] Ko jim je pa to govoril, začnó pismarji in Farizeji zeló pritiskati nanj, in vpraševati ga za veliko rečî, 
[11:54] Prežeč na-nj, in iskajoč, da bi kaj vjeli iz ust njegovih, da bi ga zatožili. 
[12:1] Med tem ko se je bilo zbralo na tisoče ljudstva, tako, da so eden po drugem gazili, začne govoriti učencem svojim: Najprej se varujte kvasú Farizejskega, kteri je hinavstvo. 
[12:2] Nič pa ni skritega, kar se ne bo odkrilo; in skrivnega, kar se ne bo zvedelo. 
[12:3] Za to se bo to, kar ste pravili v temi, slišalo na svetlem; in kar ste na uho šepetali v kletih, oznanjevalo se bo na strehah. 
[12:4] Pravim pa vam prijateljem svojim: Ne bojte se jih, kteri ubijajo telo, a po tem ne morejo nič več storiti. 
[12:5] Pokazal pa vam bom, koga se bojte: bojte se tistega, kteri ima oblast, po tem ko je ubil, zagnati v pekel. Dà, pravim vam, tega se bojte. 
[12:6] Ne prodaja li se pet vrabcev za dva solda! in ne eden od njih ni pozabljen pred Bogom. 
[12:7] A vam so tudi lasje na glavi vsi razšteti. Ne bojte se torej; vi ste bolji od mnogo vrabcev. 
[12:8] Pravim vam pa: Vsak kdor bo spoznal mene pred ljudmí, spoznal bo tudi sin človečji njega pred angelji Božjimi; 
[12:9] Kdor bo pa zatajil mene pred ljudmí, zatajil se bo pred angelji Božjimi. 
[12:10] In vsak, kdor reče besedo zoper sina človečjega, odpustila mu se bo; a kdor se zarotí zoper Duha svetega, ne bo mu se odpustilo. 
[12:11] Kedar vas pa popeljejo v shajališča in h gosposki in pred oblasti, ne skrbite, kako ali kaj bi odgovorili, ali kaj bi povedali: 
[12:12] Kajti naučil vas bo Duh sveti tisti čas, kaj je treba reči. 
[12:13] Reče pa mu nekdo izmed ljudstva: Učenik, reci bratu mojemu, naj razdeli z menoj dedovino. 
[12:14] On mu pa reče: Človek, kdo me je postavil za sodnika ali delilca med vama? 
[12:15] In reče jim: Glejte in varujte se lakomnosti; kajti nikdor ne živí ob obilnosti imenja svojega. 
[12:16] Pové jim pa priliko, govoreč: Nekemu človeku bogatemu obrodila je njiva; 
[12:17] In premišljeval je v sebi, govoreč: Kaj bom storil, ko nimam kam spraviti letine svoje? 
[12:18] Pa reče: To bom storil: podrl bom žitnice svoje, in naredil bom veče, in spravil bom tu vse pridelke svoje in blago svoje. 
[12:19] Ter porečem duši svojej: Duša! veliko blaga imaš na veliko let; počivaj, jej, pij, veseli se. 
[12:20] Reče pa mu Bog: Neumnež! to noč bom tirjal dušo tvojo od tebe; a kar si pripravil, čegavo bo? 
[12:21] Tako, kdor sebi zaklade nabira, pa se ne bogati v Bogu. 
[12:22] Reče pa učencem svojim: Za to vam pravim, da ne skrbite za življenje svoje, kaj boste jedli; tudi za telo svoje ne, kaj boste oblekli. 
[12:23] Življenje je več kakor hrana, in telo več kakor obleka. 
[12:24] Poglejte krokarje, da ne sejejo, in ne žanjejo; kteri nimajo kleti ne žitnice, in Bog jih živí: koliko bolji ste vi od tic? 
[12:25] Kdo od vas pa skrbeč more postavi svojej primakniti en komolec? 
[12:26] Če torej tudi najmanjega ne morete, čemu skrbite za drugo? 
[12:27] Poglejte lilije, kako rastejo; ne trudijo se in ne predejo; pravim vam pa: Tudi Solomon v vsej slavi svojej se ni oblekel, kakor teh ena. 
[12:28] Če pa travo na polji, ktera danes stojí, a jutri se meče v peč, Bog tako oblači, koliko bolj vas, maloverni? 
[12:29] Tudi vi ne iščite, kaj boste jedli, ali kaj boste pili; in ne skrbite. 
[12:30] Kajti vsega tega iščejo pogani: a oče vaš vé, da tega potrebujete. 
[12:31] Nego iščite kraljestva Božjega, in vse to vam se bo pridalo. 
[12:32] Ne boj se, mala čreda! kajti volja je očeta vašega dati vam kraljestvo. 
[12:33] Prodajte imenje svoje, in dajte miloščino. Napravite si mošnje, ktere ne ostaré, zaklad na nebesih, kteri ne izgine, kjer se tat ne približuje, in tudi molj ne razjeda. 
[12:34] Kajti kjer je zaklad vaš, tam bo tudi srce vaše. 
[12:35] Bodi vam ledje opasano, in sveče prižgane; 
[12:36] In vi podobni ljudém, kteri pričakujejo gospodarja svojega, kedaj se bo vrnil z ženitnine, da mu, kedar pride in potrka, precej odpró. 
[12:37] Blagor tistim hlapcem, ktere bo našel gospodar, kedar pride, da čujejo. Resnično vam pravim, da se bo opasal in jih bo posadil, ter bo pristopil in jim bo stregel. 
[12:38] In če pride o drugej straži, ali če o tretjej straži pride in bo našel tako, blagor tistim hlapcem. 
[12:39] Vedite pa to, da ko bi vedel gospodar, o kterej straži bo prišel tat, čul bi, in ne bi dal podkopati hiše svoje. 
[12:40] Za to bodite tudi vi pripravljeni; kajti sin človečji bo prišel ob uri, ko se vam ne bo dozdevalo. 
[12:41] Reče pa mu Peter: Gospod, praviš li to priliko nam, ali vsem? 
[12:42] Gospod pa reče: Kdo je torej zvesti in modri pristavnik, kterega je postavil gospodar nad družino svojo, naj jim daje hrano o svojem času? 
[12:43] Blagor tistemu hlapcu, kterega bo našel gospodar, kedar pride, da tako dela. 
[12:44] Resnično vam pravim, da ga bo postavil nad vsem imenjem svojim. 
[12:45] Če pa reče ta hlapec v srcu svojem: Gospodarja mojega še ne bo! in začne pretepati hlapce in dekle, ter jesti in piti in pijančevati: 
[12:46] Prišel bo gospodar tega hlapca o dnevu, ko ne pričakuje, in ob uri, ktere ne vé: in presekal ga bo, in del njegov bo položil z neverniki. 
[12:47] Tisti pa hlapec, kteri je voljo gospodarja svojega vedel, pa se ni pripravil in tudi ni storil po volji njegovej, tepen bo zeló; 
[12:48] A tisti, kteri ni vedel, pa je storil, kar je kazni vredno, tepen bo malo. Vsakemu pa, komur se je mnogo dalo, tirjalo se bo od njega mnogo; in komor so izročili mnogo, tirjali bodo od njega več. 
[12:49] Prišel sem, da vržem ogenj na zemljo, in kaj hočem, če se je uže užgal? 
[12:50] Ali s krstom se imam krstiti, in kako britko mi je, dokler se ne dopolni! 
[12:51] Menite li, da sem prišel, da dam na zemljo mir? Ne! pravim vam, nego razpor. 
[12:52] Kajti odslej jih bo pet v enej hiši razprtih, trije z dvema, in dva s tremi. 
[12:53] Oče se bo razprl s sinom, in sin z očetom; mati s hčerjo, in hčer z materjo; tašča s sneho svojo, in sneha s taščo svojo. 
[12:54] Pravil je pa tudi ljudstvu: Kedar vidite oblak, da vzhaja od zahoda, precej pravite: Dež bo! in zgodí se tako. 
[12:55] In kedar jug, da vleče, pravite: Vroče bo! in zgodí se. 
[12:56] Hinavci! lice zemlje in neba véste razločevati: tega časa pa kako ne razločujete? 
[12:57] Za kaj pa tudi sami od sebe ne sodite, kar je prav? 
[12:58] Kedar greš pa z zopernikom svojim k poglavarju, potrudi se po poti, da se ga rešiš: da te ne privleče k sodniku, in sodnik da te ne izročí beriču, in berič da te ne vrže v ječo. 
[12:59] Pravim ti: Ne boš izšel odtod, dokler ne plačaš tudi zadnjega solda. 
[13:1] Bili so pa ravno ta čas tu nekteri, kteri so mu poročali za Galilejce, kterih kri je zmešal Pilat ž njih daritvami. 
[13:2] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče jim: Menite li, da so bili ti Galilejci najgrešniji od vseh Galilejcev, ker so to pretrpeli? 
[13:3] Ne! pravim vam; nego če se ne spokorite, poginili boste vsi tako. 
[13:4] Ali tistih osemnajst, na ktere je padel stolp Siloamski, in jih pobil: menite li, da so bili li največ krivi izmed vseh ljudî, kteri so prebivali v Jeruzalemu? 
[13:5] Ne! pravim vam: nego če se ne spokorite, poginili boste vsi tako. 
[13:6] Pravil jim je pa to priliko: Imel je nekdo smokvo vsajeno v vinogradu svojem; in prišel je iskat sadú na njej, in ni našel. 
[13:7] Ter reče vinogradniku: Glej, tri leta hodim iskat sadú na tej smokvi, in ne nahajam. Posekaj jo torej! čemu še zemljo kazí? 
[13:8] On pa odgovarjajoč, reče mu: Gospod, pustí jo še to leto, da jo okopljem, in z gnojem ospém, 
[13:9] Da li bo rodila sad; če pa ne, posekal jo boš potem. 
[13:10] A v enem shajališči je v soboto učil; 
[13:11] In glej, bila je tu žena, ktera je duha slabosti imela osemnajst let, in je bila sključena, ter se nikakor ni mogla po konci skloniti. 
[13:12] Ugledavši jo pa Jezus, pokliče, in reče jej: Žena, rešena si slabosti svoje! 
[13:13] In položí na njo roke: in pri tej priči je vstala, ter je hvalila Boga. 
[13:14] Odgovarjajoč pa starešina shajališča, jezeč se, da je Jezus v soboto uzdravil, reče ljudstvu: Šest dnî je, v kterih veljá delati; té torej hodite in se zdravite, ne pa sobotni dan. 
[13:15] Gospod mu pa odgovorí in reče: Hinavec! vsak od vas, ali ne bo odvezal v soboto svojega vola ali osla od jasli, in ga bo gnal napajat? 
[13:16] Te pa, hčeri Abrahamove, ktero je bil zvezal hudič, glej, osemnajst let, ali je ni bilo treba rešiti iz te vezí v sobotni dan? 
[13:17] In ko je to govoril, sramovali so se vsi, kteri so mu nasprotovali; in vse ljudstvo se je radovalo slavnim delom njegovim, ktera so se godila. 
[13:18] Pravil je pa: Komu je podobno kraljestvo Božje? in komu ga bom primeril? 
[13:19] Podobno je gorušičnemu zrnu, ktero je človek vzel in vrgel na vrt svoj; in zrastlo je, in postalo je veliko drevo, in tice nebeške so se nastanile po vejah njegovih. 
[13:20] In zopet reče: Komu bom primeril Kraljestvo Božje? 
[13:21] Podobno je kvasu, kterega je žena vzela in skrila v tri merice moke, dokler se vse ne skvasi. 
[13:22] In hodil je po mestih in vaséh, učeč, in potujoč v Jeruzalem. 
[13:23] Reče pa mu nekdo: Gospod! če je pač malo teh, kteri se bodo zveličali? On jim pa reče: 
[13:24] Podvizajte se, da vnidete skozi tesna vrata; kajti veliko, pravim vam, iskalo jih bo, da bi prišli noter, pa ne bodo mogli. 
[13:25] Kedar bo gospodar vstal, in bo zaprl vrata, in boste jeli zunej postajati, in na vrata trkati, govoreč: Gospod, Gospod, odpri nam! pa vam odgovarjajoč, poreče: Ne poznam vas, odkod ste. 
[13:26] Tedaj boste jeli praviti: Jedli smo pred teboj in pili, in po ulicah naših si učil. 
[13:27] Pa poreče: Pravim vam, ne poznam vas, odkod ste; odstopite od mene vsi, kteri delate krivice. 
[13:28] Tam bo jok in škripanje z zobmí, ko boste videli Abrahama in Izaka in Jakoba in vse preroke v kraljestvu Božjem, sebe pa izgnane ven. 
[13:29] In prišli bodo od vzhoda in zahoda, in od severja in juga, in sedli bodo za mizo v kraljestvu Božjem. 
[13:30] In glej, so pa zadnji, kteri bodo prvi; in prvi, kteri bodo zadnji. 
[13:31] Ravno ta dan pristopijo k njemu nekteri od Farizejev, veleč mu: Izidi in odidi odtod; kajti Herod te hoče ubiti. 
[13:32] Pa jim reče: Pojdite, povejte temu lisjaku: Glej, izganjal bom hudiče, in uzdravljal bom danes in jutri, a tretji dan bom končal. 
[13:33] Ali danes in jutri in pojutranjem moram iti: ker ni mogoče preroku umreti zunej Jeruzalema. 
[13:34] Jeruzalem, Jeruzalem, kteri ubijaš preroke in kamenjuješ té, kteri so k tebi poslani! kolikrat sem hotel zbrati otroke tvoje, kakor koklja piščeta svoja pod peruti, in niste hoteli! 
[13:35] Glej, zapušča vam se dom vaš pust. Ali resnično vam pravim, da me ne boste videli, dokler ne pride, da porečete: Blagoslovljen, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem! 
[14:1] In zgodí se, ko vnide v hišo enega od starešin Farizejskih v soboto kruh jest, pa so oni na-nj pazili. 
[14:2] In glej, neki človek vodeničen je bil pred njim. 
[14:3] In odgovarjajoč Jezus, reče učenikom postave in Farizejem, govoreč: Ali se sme v soboto zdraviti? 
[14:4] Oni pa umolknejo. In prijemši ga, uzdravi ga in odpustí. 
[14:5] In odgovarjajoč jim, reče: Komu od vas bo padel osel ali vol v vodnjak in ga ne bo izvlekel na sobotni dan? 
[14:6] In niso mu mogli odgovoriti na to. 
[14:7] Pravil je pa povabljenim priliko, opazivši, kako izbirajo prve prostore, govoreč jim: 
[14:8] Kedar te kdo povabi na svatovščino, ne sédaj na prve prostore, da ne bi bil med tistimi, kteri so povabljeni od njega, kdo pošteniji od tebe, 
[14:9] In ne pride ta, kteri je tebe in njega povabil, in ti ne reče: Daj temu prostor! in ne boš tedaj s sramoto sédel na zadnji prostor. 
[14:10] Nego kedar si povabljen in prideš, sédi na zadnji prostor, da ti ta, kteri te je povabil, kedar pride, poreče: Prijatelj, pomakni se više! tedaj ti bo čast pred tistimi, kteri sedé s teboj. 
[14:11] Kajti vsak, kdor se povišuje, ponižal se bo; a kdor se ponižuje, povišal se bo. 
[14:12] Pravil je pa tudi temu, kteri ga je bil povabil: Kedar napraviš obed ali pojedinjo, ne vabi prijateljev svojih, ne bratov svojih, ne sorodnikov svojih, ne sosedov bogatih: da te ne bi tudi oni povabili, in ti se ne bi vrnilo. 
[14:13] Nego, kedar napraviš gostijo, povabi siromake, polomljene, hrome, slepce: 
[14:14] In blagor ti, da ti nimajo s čim povrniti! povrnilo ti se bo namreč o vstajanji pravičnih. 
[14:15] Slišavši pa to nekdo od téh, kteri so ž njim sedeli za mizo, reče mu: Blagor mu, kdor bo v kraljestvu Božjem jedel kruh! 
[14:16] On mu pa reče: Neki človek je napravil pojedinjo; in povabil jih je veliko. 
[14:17] In poslal je hlapca svojega v čas pojedinje, naj reče povabljencem: Pridite, ker je uže vse pripravljeno! 
[14:18] In začnó se vsi h krati izgovarjati. Prvi mu reče: Njivo sem kupil, in silno mi je treba, da izidem in jo ogledam, prosim te, izgovori me. 
[14:19] A drugi reč: Pet jarmov volov sem kupil, in grem jih izkušat; prosim te, izgovóri me. 
[14:20] Zopet drugi pa: Oženil sem se, in zato ne morem priti. 
[14:21] In ko ta hlapec pride, sporočí to gospodarju svojemu. Tedaj se gospodar razjezí, in reče hlapcu svojemu: Izidi naglo na razpotja in ulice mestne, in pripelji sêm siromake in polomljene in hrome in slepce. 
[14:22] In hlapec reče: Gospod, zgodilo se je, kakor si ukazal, in še je prostora. 
[14:23] Pa reče gospodar hlapcu: Pojdi na pota in med ograje, in prinudi, naj vnidejo, da se napolni hiša moja; 
[14:24] Kajti pravim vam, da ne bo nobeden onih móž, kteri so bili povabljeni, okusil pojedinje moje. 
[14:25] Shajalo se je pa veliko ljudstva; in obrnivši se, reče jim; 
[14:26] Če pride kdo k meni, pa ne sovraži očeta svojega in matere, in žene in otrók, in bratov in sester, in tudi lastne duše svoje, ne more moj učenec biti. 
[14:27] In kdor ne zadene križa svojega, in gre za menoj, ne more moj učenec biti. 
[14:28] Kdo namreč izmed vas, kedar hoče stolp zidati, ne bo proprej sédel in preračunil stroškov, če ima pač, da ga bo dozidal? 
[14:29] Da mu ne bi, ko bi postavil temelj, pa ne bi mogel dozidati, vsi, kteri bi to videli, jeli posmehovati se, 
[14:30] Govoreč: Ta človek je jel zidati, pa ni mogel dozidati! 
[14:31] Ali kteri kralj, kedar se gre z drugim kraljem vojskovat, ne bo sédel, in se poprej posvetoval, če se bo pač mogel z desetémi tisočmi srečati s tém, kteri gre z dvajsetémi tisočmi nad-nj? 
[14:32] In če ne, poslal bo, dokler je še ta daleč, poslance, ter bo prosil mirú. 
[14:33] Tako torej vsak izmed vas, kdor se ne odreče imenja svojega, ne more moj učenec biti. 
[14:34] Dobra je sol; če pa sol znorí, s čim se bo osolila? 
[14:35] Ne za v zemljo ne za v gnoj ni dobra; mečejo jo proč. Kdor ima ušesa, da sliši, naj sliši! 
[15:1] Približevali so se pa k njemu vsi mitarji in grešniki, da bi ga poslušali. 
[15:2] In godrnjali so Farizeji in pismarji, govoreč: Ta sprejema grešnike, in ž njimi jé. 
[15:3] A on jim pové to-le priliko, govoreč: 
[15:4] Kdo izmed vas, imajoč sto ovác, če eno od njih izgubí, ne pustí devet in devetdeseterih v puščavi, pa gre za izgubljeno, da jo najde? 
[15:5] In ko jo najde, zadene jo vesel na rame svoje, 
[15:6] In ko pride domú, skliče prijatelje in sosede, govoreč jim: Radujte se z menoj! kajti našel sem ovco svojo, ktera se je bila izgubila. 
[15:7] Pravim vam, da bo ravno tako radost na nebu za enega grešnika, kteri se spokori, veča, nego za devet in devetdeset pravičnih, kterim ni treba pokore. 
[15:8] Ali ktera žena, imajoč deset grošev, če izgubí en groš, ne prižge sveče, in ne pomete hiše, in ne išče skrbno, dokler ne najde? 
[15:9] In ko najde, skliče prijateljico in sosedinje, govoreč: Radujte se z menoj! kajti našla sem groš, kterega sem bila izgubila. 
[15:10] Tako, pravim vam, da je tudi radost pred angelji Božjimi za enega grešnika, kteri se spokorí. 
[15:11] In reče: Neki človek je imel dva sina. 
[15:12] Pa reče mlajši od nju očetu: Oče, daj mi del premoženja, kteri mi pripada. In razdelí jima premoženje. 
[15:13] In črez nekoliko dnî zbere mlajši sin vse, in odpotuje v daljno deželo: in tu raztrosi vse premoženje, živeč samopašno. 
[15:14] In ko je bil vse potratil, nastane huda lakota po tej deželi, in on začne stradati. 
[15:15] In odide, in pridruži se enemu od meščanov te dežele; in ta ga pošlje na polje svoje svinje past. 
[15:16] In hrepenel je, da bi napolnil trebuh svoj z rožiči, ktere so jedle svinje; ali nikdor mu jih ni podajal. 
[15:17] A ko pride k sebi, reče: Koliko najemnikov očeta mojega ima obilno kruha, a jaz lakote pogibam! 
[15:18] Vstal bom, šel bom k očetu svojemu, in rekel mu bom: Oče, pregrešil sem se zoper nebo in pred teboj! 
[15:19] In nisem več vreden, da bi se sin tvoj imenoval; naredi me za enega najemnikov svojih. 
[15:20] In vstavši, odide k očetu svojemu. A ko je še daleč bil, ugleda ga oče njegov; in užali mu se, ter poletí, in oklene se vratú njegovega, in poljubi ga. 
[15:21] A sin mu reče: Oče, pregrešil sem se zoper nebo in pred teboj, in nisem več vreden, da bi se sin tvoj imenoval! 
[15:22] Pa reče oče hlapcem svojim: Prinesite najlepšo suknjo, in oblecite ga, in podajte mu prstan na roko, in obutalo na noge; 
[15:23] In pripeljite tele pitano, in zakoljite ga; in jedoč, veselili se bomo: 
[15:24] Kajti ta sin moj je bil mrtev, in oživel je; in izgubljen je bil, in našel se je. In začnó se veseliti. 
[15:25] A stariji sin njegov je bil na polji; in ko se gredoč približa hiši, zasliši petje in vrisk, 
[15:26] In poklicavši enega od hlapcev, vpraša, kaj bi to bilo. 
[15:27] On mu pa reče: Brat tvoj je prišel; in zaklal je oče tvoj tele pitano, da ga je zdravega sprejel. 
[15:28] A on se ujezí, in ni hotel vniti. Tedaj izide oče njegov, ter ga je prosil. 
[15:29] On pa odgovarjajoč, reče očetu: Glej, toliko let ti služim, in nikoli nisem prelomil zapovedi tvoje, in meni nisi dal nikoli kozliča, da bi se s prijatelji svojimi razveselil. 
[15:30] Ko je pa prišel ta sin tvoj, kteri je premoženje tvoje s kurbami zažrl, zaklal si mu tele pitano. 
[15:31] On mu pa reče: Sin, ti si vsegdar z menoj, in vse moje je tvoje. 
[15:32] Treba pa se je bilo veseliti in radovati, ker je bil ta brat mrtev, in oživel je; in izgubljen je bil, in našel se je. 
[16:1] Pravil pa je tudi učencem svojim: Bil je en človek bogat, kteri je imel pristavnika; in tega so bili ovadili pri njem, da mu razsiplje imenje. 
[16:2] In poklicavši ga, reče mu: Kaj to slišim za te? Daj račun od gospodarstva svojega, ker ne moreš dalje gospodariti. 
[16:3] A pristavnik reče sam s seboj: Kaj bom storil, ko mi gospodar moj odjemlje gospodarstvo? Kopati ne morem, prositi me je sram. 
[16:4] Vém, kaj bom storil, da me bodo, kedar bom odstavljen gospodarstva, sprejeli v hiše svoje. 
[16:5] In poklicavši vsakega posameznega od dolžnikov gospodarja svojega, reče prvemu: Koliko si dolžen gospodarju mojemu? 
[16:6] On pa reče: Sto mer olja. In reče mu: Vzemi svojo pismo, pa sedí hitro, in napiši petdeset. 
[16:7] Po tem reče drugemu: A ti koliko si dolžen? On pa reče: Sto korcev pšenice. In velí mu: Vzemi svoje pismo, in napiši osemdeset. 
[16:8] In gospodar pohvali krivičnega hlapca, da je pametno storil. Kajti sinovi tega sveta so pametniji od sinov svetlobe v svojem rodu. 
[16:9] Tudi jaz vam pravim: Naredite si prijateljev s krivičnim bogastvom, da vas, kedar ubožate, sprejmó v večna stanovališča. 
[16:10] Kdor je v najmanjem zvest, zvest je tudi v velikem; in kdor je v najmanjem krivičen, krivičen je tudi v velikem. 
[16:11] Če torej v krivičnem bogastvu niste bili zvesti, kdo vam bo zaupal pravično? 
[16:12] In če v tujem niste bili zvesti, kdo vam bo dal, kar je vaše? 
[16:13] Noben hlapec ne more dvema gospodoma služiti: ali bo enega sovražil, in drugega ljubil; ali se bo enega držal, in drugega bo zaničeval. Ne morete Bogu služiti in mamonu. 
[16:14] Poslušali so pa vse to tudi Farizeji, kteri so srebro ljubili, ter so ga zasmehovali. 
[16:15] Pa jim reče: Vi ste tisti, kteri se delate pravične pred ljudmí; ali Bog pozná srca vaša: kajti kar je pri ljudéh visoko, gnjusoba je pred Bogom. 
[16:16] Zakon in preroki so do Janeza; odtlej se oznanjuje kraljestvo Božje, in vsak s silo va-nj tišči. 
[16:17] Laže je pa nebu in zemlji prejti, nego enej pičici iz zakona izpasti. 
[16:18] Vsak, kdor pustí ženo svojo in se oženi z drugo, prešestvuje; in vsak, kdor popuščeno od moža vzeme, prešestvuje. 
[16:19] Bil je pa neki človek bogat, in oblačil se je v škrlat in tančico, in razveseljeval se je vsak dan sijajno. 
[16:20] Bil je pa neki ubožec po imenu Lazar, kteri jo ležal pred vratmi njegovimi, gnôjen, 
[16:21] In hrepeneč nasititi se z drobtinami, ktere so padale z mize bogatina; ali tudi psi so dohajali, ter so lizali gnoj njegov 
[16:22] Zgodí se pa, da ubožec umrè, in odnesó ga angelji na naročje Abrahamovo; umrè pa tudi bogatin, in pokopljejo ga. 
[16:23] In v peklu, ko je bil v bolečinah, povzdigne očí svoje, in ugleda Abrahama od daleč, in Lazarja na naročji njegovem. 
[16:24] In on zaklicavši, reče: Oče Abraham! usmili se me, in pošlji Lazarja, naj omoči konec prsta svojega v vodi, in mi jezik ohladí, ker se mučim v tem plamenu. 
[16:25] Abraham pa reče: Sin! spomeni se, da si ti prejel dobroto svojo v življenji svojem, in ravno tako Lazar slabo. Sedaj pa; on se tolaži, a ti se mučiš. 
[16:26] In vrh vsega tega, med nami in vami je postavljen prepad velik, da kteri hočejo odtod sniti k vam, ne morejo, in kteri odondod k nam, da ne prehajajo. 
[16:27] Pa reče: Prosim te torej, oče, da ga pošlji na mojega očeta dom, 
[16:28] Ker imam pet bratov: da jim to izpriča, da ne pridejo tudi oni na ta kraj trpljenja. 
[16:29] Velí mu Abraham: Mojzesa imajo in preroke; poslušajo naj jih. 
[16:30] On pa reče: Ne, oče Abraham! nego če kdo od mrtvih pride k njim, potem se bodo spokorili. 
[16:31] Pa mu reče: Če Mojzesa in prerokov ne poslušajo, ne bodo verovali, če tudi kdo od mrtvih vstane. 
[17:1] Reče pa učencem svojim: Ni mogoče, da pohujšanja ne bi prišla; ali gorjé tistemu, po kterem prihajajo. 
[17:2] Bolje bi mu bilo, da bi mu se obesil kamen mlinski na vrat, ter bi bil vržen v morje, nego da enega teh malih pohujša. 
[17:3] Varujte se! Če se pregreší brat tvoj zoper tebe, popreti mu; in če se spokorí, odpusti mu. 
[17:4] In če se pregreší sedemkrat na dan zoper tebe, pa se sedemkrat na dan obrne do tebe, govoreč: Kesam se! odpusti mu. 
[17:5] Pa rekó aposteljni Gospodu: Priloži nam vere! 
[17:6] Gospod pa reče: Ako bi imeli vere, kolikoršno je zrno gorušično, in bi rekli tej murvi: Izderi se, in vsádi se v morje! in poslušala bi vas. 
[17:7] Kdo izmed vas ima pa hlapca, kteri orje in pase, da bi mu, kedar pride s polja, precej rekel: Pojdi, počij? 
[17:8] Ne poreče li mu marveč: Pripravi, kar bom večerjal, in opaši se in strezi mi, dokler se ne najém in napijem; a potem jej in pij ti? 
[17:9] Ali bo mar zahvalil temu hlapcu, da je storil, kar mu se je bilo ukazalo? Ne verujem. 
[17:10] Tako tudi vi, kedar storite, kar vam je ukazano, recite: Nepotrebni hlapci smo; kajti storili smo, kar smo bili dolžni storiti. 
[17:11] In zgodí se, ko je šel v Jeruzalem, da je hodil med Samarijo in Galilejo. 
[17:12] In ko vnide v neko vas, sreča ga deset gobavih móž, kteri so stali od daleč. 
[17:13] In ti povzdignejo glas, govoreč: Jezus, učenik, usmili se nas! 
[17:14] In ugledavši jih, reče jim: Pojdite, pokažite se duhovnom! In zgodí se, ko so šli, očistijo se. 
[17:15] Eden pa izmed njih, videvši, da je ozdravel, vrne se, hvaleč Boga z močnim glasom; 
[17:16] In pade na obraz pred noge njegove, in zahvali mu; in ta je bil Samarijan. 
[17:17] Odgovarjajoč pa Jezus, reče: Ali se jih ni deset očistilo? Onih devet pa, kje so? 
[17:18] Ali se ni našel, kteri bi se vrnil, da bi dal Bogu hvalo, razen ta tujec? 
[17:19] In reče mu: Vstani, pojdi! vera tvoja ti je pomogla. 
[17:20] Vprašan pa od Farizejev, kedaj bo prišlo kraljestvo Božje, odgovorí jim, in reče: Kraljestvo Božje ne bo prišlo s svetlostjo. 
[17:21] Tudi ne porekó: Glej, tu je! ali: Glej, tam je! Kajti glej, kraljestvo Božje je notri v vas. 
[17:22] Reče pa učencem: Prišli bodo dnevi, ko boste želeli enega od dnî sinú človečjega videti, in ne boste videli. 
[17:23] In porekó vam: Glej, tu je! ali: Glej, tam je! Ne izidite, in tudi ne sledite ne! 
[17:24] Kajti kakor blisk, kteri šine in se svetli iz enega kraja pod nebom do drugega kraja pod nebom, tako bo tudi sin človečji v dan svoj. 
[17:25] Ali poprej mu je treba veliko pretrpeti, in zavrženemu biti od tega rodú. 
[17:26] In kakor je bilo v dnéh Noeta, tako bo tudi v dnéh sinu človečjega. 
[17:27] Jedli so, pili so, ženili so se, možile so se, noter do dné, ko je stopil Noe v barko, ter je prišel potop in vse pogubil. 
[17:28] Enako tudi, kakor je bilo v dnéh Lota; jedli so, pili so, kupovali so, prodajali so, sadili so, zidali so; 
[17:29] Ali tisti dan, ko je izšel Lot iz Sodome, udaril je ogenj in žveplo z neba, in pogubil je vse. 
[17:30] Ravno tako bo tisti dan, ko se bo sin človečji razodel. 
[17:31] Tisti dan, kdor bo na strehi, a pohištvo njegovo v hiši, ne stopa naj dol, da ga vzeme; in kdor bo na polji, naj se ravno tako ne ozira na to, kar je zadej. 
[17:32] Spominjajte se žene Lotove! 
[17:33] Kdor bo gledal dušo svojo ohraniti, izgubil jo bo; a kdor jo bo izgubil, oživil jo bo. 
[17:34] Pravim vam: Tisto noč bosta dva na enej postelji: eden se bo vzel, a drugi pustil. 
[17:35] Dve boste mleli vkupej: ena se bo vzela, a druga pustila. 
[17:36] Dva bosta na njivi: eden se bo vzel, a drugi pustil. 
[17:37] In odgovarjajoč, rekó mu: Kje, Gospod? A on jim reče: Kjer je truplo, tam se bodo zbirali orli. 
[18:1] Pravil jim je pa tudi priliko, kako je treba vsegdar moliti, in ne naveličati se, 
[18:2] Govoreč: Bil je v nekem mestu en sodnik, kteri se ni bal Boga, in se ni sramoval ljudî. 
[18:3] Bila je pa v tem mestu neka vdova, in hodila je k njemu, govoreč: Maščuj me nad zopernikom mojim! 
[18:4] In dolgo časa ni hotel; po tem pa reče sam s seboj: Če se tudi Boga ne bojim, in se ne sramujem ljudî: 
[18:5] Vendar za to, ker mi nadlego dela ta vdova, maščeval jo bom, da naposled ne pride in me ogluší. 
[18:6] Pa reče Gospod: Slišite, kaj pravi nepravični sodnik! 
[18:7] Bog pa, ali ne bo maščeval izvoljencev svojih, kteri vpijejo k njemu dan in noč, ako ravno jim odlaša? 
[18:8] Pravim vam, da jih bo kmalu maščeval. Ali sin človečji, kedar pride, našel li bo vero na zemlji? 
[18:9] Pové pa tudi nekterim, kteri so va-se zaupali, da so pravični, a druge so zaničevali, to priliko: 
[18:10] Dva človeka sta šla gor v tempelj molit; eden je bil Farizej, a drugi mitar. 
[18:11] Farizej se vstopi, in molil je sam s seboj to: Bog, zahvaljujem ti, da nisem kakor drugi ljudjé: razbojniki, krivičniki, prešestniki, ali kakor ta-le mitar. 
[18:12] Postim se dvakrat na teden, desetino dajem od vsega, kar imam. 
[18:13] A mitar je od daleč stal, in še očî ni hotel povzdigniti na nebo, nego trkal je na prsi svoje, govoreč: Bog, milostljiv mi bodi grešniku! 
[18:14] Pravim vam: Ta je sešel opravičen na dom svoj, a ne on. Kajti vsak, kdor se povišuje, ponižal se bo; a kdor se ponižuje, povišal se bo. 
[18:15] Donašali so pa k njemu tudi otročiče, da bi se jih dotikal; videč pa to učenci njegovi, zapreté jim. 
[18:16] A Jezus jih pokliče, in reče: Pustite otročiče, naj dohajajo k meni in ne branite jim! kajti teh je kraljestvo Božje. 
[18:17] Resnično vam pravim: Kdorkoli ne sprejme kraljestva Božjega kakor otrok, ne bo prišel va-nj. 
[18:18] In vpraša ga en starešina, govoreč: Učenik dobri, kaj naj storim, da zadobóm večno življenje? 
[18:19] Jezus mu pa reče: Kaj me imenuješ dobrega? Nikdor ni dober, razen eden, Bog. 
[18:20] Zapovedi znaš: Ne prešestvuj; ne ubijaj; ne kradi; ne pričaj po krivem; spoštúj Očeta svojega in mater svojo. 
[18:21] On pa reče: Vse to sem izpolnil od mladosti svoje. 
[18:22] Slišavši pa to Jezus, reče mu: Enega ti je še treba: prodaj vse, kar imaš, in razdaj ubogim, in imel boš zaklad na nebu; ter pridi, pojdi za menoj. 
[18:23] On pa, slišavši to, postane zeló žalosten; kajti bil je silno bogat. 
[18:24] Videvši ga pa Jezus, da je zeló žalosten postal, reče: Kako težko bodo, kteri imajo bogastvo, prišli v kraljestvo Božje! 
[18:25] Laže je namreč priti kameli skozi igleno ušesce, nogo bogatemu vniti v kraljestvo Božje. 
[18:26] Pa rekó, kteri so to slišali: In kdo se more zveličati? 
[18:27] On pa reče: Kar je pri ljudéh nemogoče, mogoče je pri Bogu. 
[18:28] A Peter reče: Glej, mi smo zapustili vse, in šli smo za teboj. 
[18:29] On jim pa reče: Resnično vam pravim, da ni nikogar, kteri je zapustil dom, ali roditelje, ali brata, ali ženo, ali otroke, za voljo kraljestva Božjega: 
[18:30] Da ne bi prejel veliko več v tem času, a na drugem svetu večnega življenja. 
[18:31] Vzemši pa dvanajstere, reče jim: Glej, v Jeruzalem, gremo, in dopolnilo se bo vse kar so preroki napisali za sina človečjega. 
[18:32] Izročili ga bodo namreč poganom, in zasmehovali ga bodo in zasramovali, in pljuvali na-nj; 
[18:33] In bičali ga bodo, in po tem umorili; a tretji dan bo vstal. 
[18:34] In oni niso ničesar od tega umeli, in bila je ta beseda skrita pred njimi, in niso vedeli, kaj jim se je pravilo. 
[18:35] Zgodí se pa, ko se je bližal Jerihi, sedel je en slepec kraj poti. 
[18:36] In slišavši ljudstvo, da gre mimo, vpraševal je, kaj bi to bilo. 
[18:37] In povedó mu: Jezus Nazarečan gre mimo. 
[18:38] Pa zavpije, govoreč: Jezus, sin Davidov, usmili se me? 
[18:39] In kteri so mimo šli, pretili so mu, naj umolkne; on je pa še bolj kričal: Sin Davidov, usmili se me! 
[18:40] Ustavivši se pa Jezus, ukaže, naj ga pripeljejo k njemu; in ko se približa, vpraša ga. 
[18:41] Govoreč: Kaj hočeš, naj ti storím? On pa reče: Gospod, da spregledam. 
[18:42] In Jezus mu reče: Spreglej! vera tvoja ti je pomogla. 
[18:43] In precej je spregledal, in šel je za njim, hvaleč Boga; in vse ljudstvo, ko je to videlo, dalo je Bogu hvalo. 
[19:1] In vnide, in šel je skozi Jeriho. 
[19:2] In glej, mož po imenu Zahej, in ta je bil starešina mitarjem, in bil je bogat, 
[19:3] In rad bi bil videl Jezusa, kdo da je; pa ni mogel za voljo ljudstva, ker je bil majhne postave. 
[19:4] In poletel je naprej, in zlezel je na murvo, da bi ga videl: ker je imel todi mimo iti. 
[19:5] In Jezus, ko pride na to mesto, ozrè se gor, in ugleda ga, in reče mu: Zahej, snidi hitro! kajti danes moram v tvojej hiši ostati. 
[19:6] Pa snide hitro in ga radosten sprejme. 
[19:7] In vsi so, ko so to videli, godrnjali, govoreč: Pri grešnem človeku se je navrnil! 
[19:8] Pristopivši pa Zahej, reče Gospodu: Glej, polovico premoženja svojega, Gospod, dajem ubogim; in če sem koga ogoljufal, povrnil mu bom čvetero. 
[19:9] Jezus mu pa reče: Danes je prišlo zveličanje tej hiši, ker je tudi ta sin Abrahamov. 
[19:10] Kajti prišel je sin človečji iskat in zveličat, kar se je izgubilo. 
[19:11] Ko so pa to poslušali, pristavi in pové priliko, zato, ker je bil blizu Jeruzalema, in so mislili, da se bo kraljestvo Božje precej razodelo. 
[19:12] In reče: Neki človek imenitnega rodú je šel v daljno deželo, da si vzeme kraljestvo, in da se vrne. 
[19:13] In poklicavši deset hlapcev, dá jim deset mošenj, in reče jim: Kupčujte, dokler se ne vrnem. 
[19:14] Meščani njegovi so ga pa sovražili, ter pošljejo poslance za njim, govoreč: Nečemo, da bi nam ta kraljeval. 
[19:15] In zgodí se, ko je bil kraljestvo prejel in se je vrnil, pa reče, naj mu pokličejo te hlapce, kterim je bil dal srebro, da bi zvedel, kaj je kdo prikupčeval. 
[19:16] Pa pride prvi, govoreč: Gospod, mošnja tvoja je pridobila deset mošenj. 
[19:17] In reče mu: Dobro, vrli hlapec! ker si bil v najmanjem zvest, iméj oblast nad desetémi mesti. 
[19:18] In pride drugi, govoreč: Gospod, mošnja tvoja je napravila pet mošenj. 
[19:19] In tudi temu reče: Tudi ti bodi nad petémi mesti. 
[19:20] In drugi pride, govoreč: Gospod, glej, tu je mošnja tvoja, ktero sem imel v prtu spravljeno. 
[19:21] Kajti bal sem se te, ker si trd človek: jemlješ, česar nisi položil; žanješ, česar nisi posejal. 
[19:22] Pa mu reče: Sodil te bom po tvojih besedah, hudobni hlapec! Vedel si, da sem trd človek, in jemljem, česar nisem položil, in žanjem, česar nisem posejal; 
[19:23] In za kaj nisi dal srebra mojega kupcu, da bi ga bil, kedar bi se bil vrnil, prejel z dobičkom? 
[19:24] Ter reče tém, kteri so stali pred njim: Vzemite mu mošnjo, in dajte tistemu, kteri jih ima deset. 
[19:25] (Pa mu rekó: Gospod, deset mošenj ima!) 
[19:26] Pravim vam namreč, da vsakemu, kdor ima, dalo se bo; a kdor nima, odvzelo mu se bo tudi to, kar ima. 
[19:27] A tiste sovražnike moje, kteri niso hoteli, da bi jim kraljeval, pripeljite sêm, in posekajte jih pred menoj. 
[19:28] In ko je bil to povedal, šel je dalje, gredoč gor v Jeruzalem. 
[19:29] In zgodí se, ko se približa Betfagi in Betaniji, pri gori, ktera se imenuje Oljska, pošlje dva izmed učencev svojih, 
[19:30] Govoreč: Pojdita v vas, ki je nasproti, v kterej bosta našla, kedar vnideta, žrebe privezano, na ktero se ni nikoli noben človek usedel: odvežita ga, in pripeljita sèm. 
[19:31] In če vaju kdo vpraša: Po kaj odvezujeta? povejta mu tako: Gospod ga potrebuje. 
[19:32] In poslanca odideta in najdeta, kakor jima je bil rekel. 
[19:33] Ko sta pa žrebe odvezovala, rekó jima gospodarji njegovi: Kaj odvezujeta žrebe? 
[19:34] Ona pa rečeta: Gospod ga potrebuje. 
[19:35] In pripeljeta k Jezusu; in položivši svoja oblačila na žrebe, posadé Jezusa. 
[19:36] Ko je pa šel, pogrinjali so oblačila svoja na pot. 
[19:37] In ko se je uže bližal strmcu Oljske gore, začne vsa množica učencev radostna Boga hvaliti z močnim glasom za vse čudeže, ktere so videli, 
[19:38] Govoreč: Blagoslovljen kralj, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem! Mir na nebu, in slava na višavah! 
[19:39] In nekteri Farizeji izmed ljudstva mu rekó: Učenik, popréti učencem svojim! 
[19:40] In odgovarjajoč, reče jim: Pravim vam, da če ti umolkneje, vpilo bo kamenje. 
[19:41] In ko se približa in ugleda mesto, razjoka se nad njim, 
[19:42] Govoreč: Ko bi pač tudi ti vedelo, vsaj ta dan tvoj, kaj je za mir tvoj: ali sedaj je skrito pred očmí tvojimi. 
[19:43] Prišli bodo namreč nate dnevi, ko te bodo obdali sovražniki tvoji z nasipi, in te bodo oblegali, in stiskali te od vseh stranî; 
[19:44] In razbili bodo tebe in otroke tvoje v tebi, in ne kamena na kamenu ne bodo pustili v tebi: za to, ker nisi poznalo časa, v kterim si bilo obiskano. 
[19:45] In ko vnide v tempelj, začne izganjati tiste, kteri so prodajali v njem in kupovali, 
[19:46] Govoreč jim: Pisano je: "Dom moj je dom molitve;" a vi ste naredili iz njega "jamo razbojniško". 
[19:47] In učil je vsak dan v tempeljnu; a véliki duhovni in pismarji in prvaki ljudski so iskali, da bi ga pogubili; 
[19:48] In niso nahajali, kaj bi mu storili: kajti ljustvo se ga je držalo vse, poslušajoč ga. 
[20:1] In zgodí se enega tistih dnî, ko je učil ljudstvo v tempeljnu in je oznanjeval evangelj, pridejo véliki duhovni in pismarji s starešinami, 
[20:2] In rekó mu, govoreč: Povej nam, s kakošno oblastjo to delaš, ali kdo ti je dal to oblast? 
[20:3] Odgovarjajoč pa, reče jim: Vprašal bom tudi jaz vas eno besedo, in povejte mi: 
[20:4] Krst Janezov je li bil z neba, ali od ljudî? 
[20:5] A oni so pomišljevali v sebi govoreč: Če rečemo: Z neba, poreče: Za kaj mu torej niste verovali? 
[20:6] Če pa rečemo: Od ljudî, vse ljudstvo nas bo kamenjalo: kajti prepričano je, da je bil Janez prerok. 
[20:7] Ter odgovoré, da ne vedó, odkod. 
[20:8] Pa jim Jezus reče: Tudi jaz ne bom povedal vam, s kakošno oblastjo to delam. 
[20:9] A ljudstvu začne praviti tole priliko: Neki človek je zasadil vinograd, in dal ga je vinogradnikom v najem, in odpotoval je na veliko časa. 
[20:10] In o svojem času pošlje k vinogradnikom hlapca, naj mu dadó od sadú vinogradovega; a vinogradniki ga pretepó, in odpošljejo praznega. 
[20:11] In zopet pošlje drugega hlapca; a oni tudi tega pretepó, in zasramoté, in odpošljejo praznega. 
[20:12] In zopet pošlje tretjega: in oni tudi tega ranijo, in izženó. 
[20:13] Tedaj reče gospodar vinograda: Kaj bom storil? Poslal bom sina svojega ljubljenega; ko bodo tega videli, ne mara, da se bodo bali. 
[20:14] Ko ga pa vinogradniki ugledajo, posvetovali so se med seboj, govoreč: Ta je dedič; pridite, ubijmo ga, da bo dedovina naša. 
[20:15] In vržejo ga ven iz vinograda, in ubijejo. Kaj jim bo torej gospodar vinograda storil? 
[20:16] Prišel bo, in pogubil bo vinogradnike té, in dal bo vinograd drugim. Ko so pa to slišali, rekó: Bog ne daj! 
[20:17] On pa pogledavši na-nje, reče: Kaj je torej to, kar je pisano: "Kamen, kterega so zidarji zavrgli, on je postal glava oglu?" 
[20:18] Vsak, kdor pade na ta kamen, razbil se bo; na kogar pa on pade, razdrobil ga bo. 
[20:19] In iskali so véliki duhovni in pismarji, da bi položili na-nj roke v ta čas; ali zbojé se ljudstva: kajti spoznali so, da je za-nje povedal to priliko. 
[20:20] In pazeč na-nj, pošljejo prežuhe, kteri naj bi se hlinili pravične, da bi ga vjeli v besedi in ga po tem izročili gosposki in oblasti poglavarjevej. 
[20:21] In vprašajo ga, govoreč: Učenik, vémo, da prav govoriš in učiš, in ne gledaš na lice, nego v resnici pot Božjo učiš: 
[20:22] Smemo li cesarju davek dajati, ali ne? 
[20:23] Spoznavši pa njih zvijačo, reče jim: Kaj me izkušate? 
[20:24] Pokažite denar. Čegavo podobo ima in napis? Odgovarjajoč pa rekó: Cesarjevo. 
[20:25] A on jim reče: Dajte tedaj, kar je cesarjevega, cesarju, a kar je Božjega, Bogu. 
[20:26] In niso mogli besede njegove zavreči pred ljudstvom; in začudijo se odgovoru njegovemu, in umolknejo. 
[20:27] Pristopivši pa nekteri od Saducejev, kteri pravijo, da ni vstajanja, vprašajo ga, 
[20:28] Govoreč: Učenik! Mojzes nam je napisal, da če komu umrè brat, kteri ima ženo, in on brez otrók umrè, naj vzeme brat njegov ženo, in vzbudí seme bratu svojemu. 
[20:29] Bilo je pa sedem bratov. In prvi je vzel ženo, in umrl je brez otrók; 
[20:30] In vzel je ženo drugi, in tudi ta je umrl brez otrók. 
[20:31] In vzel jo je tretji; in tako tudi vseh sedem: in niso pustili otrók, in pomrli so. 
[20:32] A naposled za vsemi umrla je tudi žena. 
[20:33] O vstajanji torej, čegava od njih bo žena! kajti sedem jo jih je imelo za ženo. 
[20:34] In odgovarjajoč, reče jim Jezus: Sinovi tega sveta se ženijo in možé; 
[20:35] Ali ti, kteri bodo vredni, da zadobé drugi svet, in da vstanejo od mrtvih, ne bodo se ženili ne možile, 
[20:36] Ker tudi umreti ne morejo več: enaki so namreč angeljem, in sinovi so Božji, ko so sinovi vstajanja. 
[20:37] Da pa mrtvi vstajajo, pokazal je tudi Mojzes pri grmu, ko imenuje Gospoda "Boga Abrahamovega in Boga Izakovega in Boga Jakobovega." 
[20:38] Bog pa ni Bog mrtvih, nego živih; kajti njemu so vsi živi. 
[20:39] Odgovarjajoč pa nekterí od pismarjev, rekó: Učenik, dobro si povedal. 
[20:40] In nič več ga niso smeli vpraševati. 
[20:41] Reče jim pa: Kako pravijo, da je Kristus sin Davidov? 
[20:42] In sam David pravi v bukvah psalmov: "Rekel je Gospod gospodu mojemu: Sédi meni na desno, 
[20:43] Dokler ne položim sovražnikov tvojih nogam tvojim za podnožje." 
[20:44] David ga torej imenuje Gospoda, in kako je sin njegov? 
[20:45] A ko ga je vse ljudstvo poslušalo, reče učencem svojim: 
[20:46] Varujte se pismarjev, kteri hočejo v dolgih oblačilih hoditi, in ljubijo pozdrave po ulicah, in prve stole po shajališčih, in prve prostore na gostijah. 
[20:47] Kteri požirajo hiše vdovam, in na videz dolgo molijo: ti bodo prejeli ostrejo sodbo. 
[21:1] Pogledavši pa gor, videl je bogatine, da mečejo darove svoje v zakladnico. 
[21:2] Videl je pa tudi eno vdovo ubogo, da je vrgla dva vinarja. 
[21:3] Ter reče: Resnično vam pravim, da je ta uboga vdova vrgla več od vseh: 
[21:4] Kajti vsi ti so vrgli od obilnosti svoje v dar Bogu, a ta je od uboštva svojega vrgla ves živež svoj, kterega je imela. 
[21:5] In ko so nekteri pravili za tempelj, da je olepšan z lepim kamenjem in dragocenostmi, reče: 
[21:6] Prišli bodo dnevi, ko od tega, kar vidite, ne bo ostal kamen na kamenu, kteri ne bi razpadel. 
[21:7] In vprašajo ga, govoreč: Učenik, kedaj pa bo to? in kaj bo znamenje, kedar se ima to zgoditi? 
[21:8] On pa reče: Varujte se, da vas ne premotijo! kajti veliko jih bo prišlo v ime moje, in porekó: Jaz sem! in: Čas se je približal! Ne hodite torej za njimi. 
[21:9] Kedar boste pa slišali vojske in vstaje, ne uplašite se; kajti to se mora najprej zgoditi: ali konca ne bo precej. 
[21:10] Tedaj jim je pravil: Vstal bo narod na narod, in kraljestvo na kraljestvo; 
[21:11] In veliki potresi bodo po krajih in lakote in kuge, groza in znamenja velika bodo na nebu. 
[21:12] A pred vsem tem bodo položili roke svoje na vas, in preganjali vas bodo in izdajali v shajališča in ječe, in vodili pred kralje in poglavarje, za voljo imena mojega. 
[21:13] A to vam se bo zgodilo na pričevanje. 
[21:14] Položite torej v srce svoje, da ne skrbite naprej, kako se boste zagovarjali; 
[21:15] Kajti jaz vam bom dal usta in modrost, kterej ne bodo mogli nasprotovati, ne upirati se vsi nasprotniki vaši. 
[21:16] Izdajali vas bodo pa tudi roditelji in bratje in sorodniki in prijatelji, in nektere od vas bodo umorili. 
[21:17] In sovražili vas bodo vsi za voljo imena mojega. 
[21:18] Pa las z glave vam ne bo poginil. 
[21:19] H potrpljenjem svojim pridobivajte duše svoje. 
[21:20] Kedar boste pa videli, da Jeruzalem oblega vojska, tedaj vedite, da se je približalo razdejanje njegovo. 
[21:21] Tedaj naj, kteri so v Judeji, odbežé na gore: in kteri so sredi njega, izidejo naj na polje; in kteri so na polji, naj ne hodijo va-nj. 
[21:22] Kajti ti dnevi bodo dnevi maščevanja, da se izpolnijo vsa pisma. 
[21:23] Gorjé pa nosečim in doječim v tistih dnéh; kajti velika nadloga bo na zemlji, in jeza nad tem narodom. 
[21:24] In padali bodo od ostrice meča, in gonili jih bodo v sužnost po vseh narodih, in Jeruzalem bodo gazili pogani, dokler se ne izpolnijo časi poganov. 
[21:25] In znamenja bodo v solncu, in mesecu in zvezdah, in narodom na zemlji žalost od obupa, šuma morskega in valovja; 
[21:26] Ludjé bodo mrli od strahu in pričakovanja tega, kar ima na zemljo priti: kajti sile nebeške se bodo pregibale. 
[21:27] In tedaj bodo ugledali sina človečjega, da gre na oblaku z veliko močjó in slavo. 
[21:28] Ko se bo pa to jelo goditi, ozrite se gor in povzdignite glave svoje, ker se približuje odrešenje vaše. 
[21:29] In pové jim priliko: Poglejte smokvo in vse drevje. 
[21:30] Kedar vidite, da je uže pognalo, sami véste, da je pomlad uže blizu. 
[21:31] Tako tudi vi, ko boste videli, da se to godí, védite, da je blizu kraljestvo Božje. 
[21:32] Resnično vam pravim, da ne bo prešel ta rod, dokler se vse ne zgodí. 
[21:33] Nebo in zemlja bosta prešla, a besede moje ne bodo prešle. 
[21:34] Varujte se pa, da vam ne otežajo srca s požrešnostjo in pijanstvom in skrbmí tega sveta, in vam ne pride ta dan iznenada. 
[21:35] Kajti prišel bo kakor zanka na vse, kteri prebivajo na lici vse zemlje. 
[21:36] Čujte torej vsak čas, in molite, da bi bili vredni ubežati vsemu temu, kar se ima zgoditi, in pred sinom človečjim stati. 
[21:37] In po dnevi je učil v tempeljnu; a po noči je izhajal prenočevat na goro, ktera se imenuje Oljska. 
[21:38] In dohajalo je vse ljudstvo zgodaj k njemu v tempelj poslušat ga. 
[22:1] Bližal se je pa praznik presnih kruhov, kteri se imenuje Velika noč. 
[22:2] In gledali so véliki duhovni in pismarji, kako bi ga umorili; kajti bali so se ljudstva. 
[22:3] Pa vnide satan v Juda s priimkom Iškarijana, kteri je bil iz števila dvanajsterih; 
[22:4] Ter odide, in dogovorí se z vélikimi duhovni in starešinami tempeljna, kako jim ga bo izdal. 
[22:5] In razveselé se, in obrekó mu dati denarja. 
[22:6] In obrekel se je, in iskal je pripravnega časa, da jim ga izdá brez ljudstva. 
[22:7] Pride pa dan presnih kruhov, ko je bilo treba velikonočno jagnje klati. 
[22:8] Ter pošlje Petra in Janeza, govoreč: Pojdita, pripravita nam velikonočno jagnje, da jemo. 
[22:9] Ona mu pa rečeta: Kje hočeš, da pripraviva? 
[22:10] A on jima reče: Glej, ko vnideta v mesto, srečal vaju bo človek, kteri ponese vrč vode; pojdita za njim v hišo, v ktero vnide, 
[22:11] In recita hišnemu gospodarju: Učenik ti pravi: Kje je gostilnica, kjer bom jedel velikonočno jagnje z učenci svojimi? 
[22:12] In on vama bo pokazal veliko izbo pogrnjeno; tam pripravita. 
[22:13] Ter odideta in najdeta, kakor jima je bil rekel; in pripravita velikonočno jagnje. 
[22:14] In ko pride čas, sede za mizo, in dvanajsteri aposteljni ž njim. 
[22:15] In reče jim: Željno sem hrepenel jesti to velikonočno jagnje z vami, predno bom trpel; 
[22:16] Kajti pravim vam, da ga ne bom več jedel, dokler se v kraljestvu Božjem ne dopolni. 
[22:17] In vzemši kelih, zahvali, in reče: Vzemite ga, in razdelite med seboj. 
[22:18] Kajti pravim vam, da ne bom pil od trtnega rodú, dokler ne pride kraljestvo Božje. 
[22:19] In vzemši kruh, zahvali, in prelomivši, dá jim govoreč: To je telo moje, ktero se za vas daje; to delajte za moj spomin. 
[22:20] Ravno tako tudi kelih po večerji, govoreč: Ta kelih je nova zaveza po krvi mojej, ktera se za vas prelija. 
[22:21] In glej, roka izdajalca mojega je z menoj na mizi. 
[22:22] In sin človečji gre, kakor je odločeno; ali gorjé človeku, kteri ga izdaja. 
[22:23] In oni začnó iskati med seboj, kdo od njih bi bil, kteri bo to storil. 
[22:24] Vname se pa tudi prepir med njimi, kdo od njih da meni, da je veči. 
[22:25] On jim pa reče: Kralji narodov tem gospodujejo, a kteri imajo oblast, imenujejo se dobrotniki. 
[22:26] Vi pa ne tako: nego kdor je največi med vami, bodi kakor najmanji; in kdor je vodnik, bodi kakor služabnik. 
[22:27] Kajti kdo je veči: kdor sedí za mizo, ali kdor streže? Ali ne ta, kdor sedí za mizo? In jaz sem med vami, kakor kdor streže. 
[22:28] A vi ste, kteri ste prebili z menoj v izkušnjavah mojih. 
[22:29] In jaz vam bom zapustil kraljestvo, kakor ga je meni oče moj zapustil, 
[22:30] Da boste jedli in pili za mizo mojo v kraljestvu mojem, in boste sedeli na prestolih in sodili dvanajstere rodove Izraelove. 
[22:31] Reče pa Gospod: Simon! Simon! glej, satan vas je poželel, da bi vas presejal, kakor pšenico; 
[22:32] Ali jaz sem za te molil, naj ne izgine vera tvoja: in ti, kedar se spreobrneš, utrdi brate svoje. 
[22:33] On mu pa reče: Gospod, pripravljen sem s teboj iti v ječo in na smrt. 
[22:34] A on mu reče: Pravim ti, Peter! nocoj ne bo zapel petelin, dokler trikrat ne utajiš, da me poznaš. 
[22:35] In reče jim: Ko sem vas poslal brez mošnje in torbe in obutala, ali vam je česa zmanjkalo? Oni pa rekó: Ničesar. 
[22:36] Reče jim torej: Ali sedaj, kdor ima mošnjo, vzeme naj jo, ravno tako tudi torbo; a kdor nima, prodá naj suknjo svojo, in kupi meč. 
[22:37] Kajti pravim vam, da se mora še to pismo izpolniti na meni: "In hudodelnikom je bil prištet." Kajti to, kar je pisano za me, dopolnjuje se. 
[22:38] Oni pa rekó: Gospod, glej tu dva meča! A on jim reče: Dosti je! 
[22:39] Ter izide in odide po navadi na Oljsko goro; šli so pa za njim tudi učenci njegovi. 
[22:40] A ko pride na mesto, reče jim: Molite, da ne zajdete v izkušnjavo. 
[22:41] In on odstopi od njih za lučaj kamena, in pokleknivši na kolena, molil je, 
[22:42] Govoreč: Oče, ko bi hotel prenesti ta kelih mimo mene! ali ne moja volja, nego tvoja bodi. 
[22:43] Prikaže pa mu se angelj z neba, ter ga je krepčal. 
[22:44] In ko je bil v boji, molil jo gorečneje. In bil je pót njegov kakor kaplje krví, ktere so padale na zemljo. 
[22:45] In vstavši od molitve, pride k učencem svojim, in najde jih, da spé od žalosti, 
[22:46] In reče jim: Kaj spite? Vstanite! molite, da ne zajdete v izkušnjavo. 
[22:47] A ko je še govoril, glej, ljudstvo; in eden dvanajsterih, kteri se je imenoval Juda, šel je pred njim, in približa se Jezusu, da ga poljubi, 
[22:48] Jezus mu pa reče: Juda! s poljubom izdajaš sina človečjega? 
[22:49] Videč pa tí, kteri so bili okoli njega, kaj da bo, rekó mu: Gospod, ali naj udarimo z mečem? 
[22:50] In eden od njih udari hlapca vélikega duhovna, in odseka mu desno uho. 
[22:51] Odgovarjajoč pa Jezus, reče: Nehajte, dotlej! In dotaknivši se ušesa njegovega, uzdravi ga. 
[22:52] A vélikim duhovnom in poglavarjem tempeljna in starešinam, kteri so bili prišli nad-nj, reče Jezus: Kakor na razbojnika ste izšli nad me z meči in koli? 
[22:53] Vsak dan sem bil z vami v tempeljnu, in niste iztegnili rok na me. Ali ta je vaša ura, in oblast teme. 
[22:54] In zgrabivši ga, odženó in peljejo ga v hišo vélikega duhovna; a Peter je od daleč šel za njim. 
[22:55] In ko so bili zanetili ogenj sredi dvorišča, in so vkupej sedli, sede Peter med-nje. 
[22:56] Ugledavši ga pa ena dekla, da sedí pri ognji, ozrê se na-nj, in reče: Tudi ta je bil ž njim. 
[22:57] A on ga zatají, govoreč: Žena! nisem ga videl. 
[22:58] In malo po tem ga ugleda drugi, in reče: Tudi ti si izmed njih. A Peter reče: Človek! nisem. 
[22:59] In eno ura ali kaj po tem trdil je nekdo drugi, govoreč: Zares, tudi ta je bil ž njm; saj je tudi Galilejec. 
[22:60] Ali Peter reče: Človek! ne vém, kaj praviš. In precej, ko je še govoril, zapoje petelin. 
[22:61] In obrnivši se Gospod, pogleda na Petra; in spomene se Peter besede Gospodove, kakor mu je bil rekel: Predno bo petelin zapel, zatajil me boš trikrat. 
[22:62] In Peter izide ven, in razjoka se britko. 
[22:63] In možjé, kteri so držali Jezusa, zasmehovali so ga in bíli. 
[22:64] In zakrivši ga, bíli so ga po obrazu, in vpraševali so ga, govoreč: Prerokuj, kdo te je udaril? 
[22:65] In drugega veliko so preklinjajoč govorili zoper njega. 
[22:66] In ko napoči jutro, zberó se starešine ljudstva, in véliki duhovni in pismarji, in odpeljejo ga v sodišče svoje, govoreč: Če si ti Kristus? povéj nam. 
[22:67] Pa jim rečé; Če vam povem, nikakor ne boste verovali; 
[22:68] A če tudi vprašam, ne boste mi odgovorili, in tudi izpustili me ne boste. 
[22:69] Odslej bo sin človečji sedel na desnici moči Božje. 
[22:70] Pa rekó vsi: Ti si torej sin Božji? On jim pa reče: Vi pravite, da jaz sem. 
[22:71] A oni rekó: Kaj nam je še treba prič? saj smo sami slišali iz ust njegovih. 
[23:1] In vstavši vsa množica njih, odpeljejo ga k Pilatu. 
[23:2] In začnó ga tožiti, govoreč: Tega smo našli, da odvrača ljudstvo, in brani cesarju davek dajati, in pravi, da je on Kristus kralj. 
[23:3] A Pilat ga vpraša, govoreč: Ti si kralj Judovski? On pa odgovarjajoč, reče mu: Ti praviš. 
[23:4] In Pilat reče vélikim duhovnom in ljudstvu: Na tem človeku ne nahajam nobene krivice. 
[23:5] Oni so pa še bolj silili, govoreč: Ljudstvo punta, učeč po vsej Judeji, počenši od Galileje do sém. 
[23:6] Pilat pa, slišavši Galilejo, vpraša, če je ta človek Galilejec. 
[23:7] In ko zvé, da je izpod oblasti Herodove, pošlje ga k Herodu, kteri je tudi bil te dní v Jeruzalemu, 
[23:8] Herod pa ugledavši Jezusa, razveseli se zeló; kajti uže davno ga je želel videti, ker je bil veliko o njem slišal: in nadejal se je, da bo videl kakošen čudež od njega. 
[23:9] In vpraševal ga je veliko rečî; ali on mu ni ničesar odgovarjal. 
[23:10] A véliki duhovni in pismarji so stali, in trdo so ga tožili. 
[23:11] A zasramotivši ga Herod z vojaki svojimi, in nasmejavši mu se, obleče mu belo oblačilo, in pošlje ga nazaj k Pilatu. 
[23:12] In ta dan sta se Pilat in Herod sprijaznila med seboj; kajti poprej sta se bila sovražila. 
[23:13] A Pilat sklicavši vélike duhovne in starešine in ljudstvo, 
[23:14] Reče jim: Pripeljali ste mi tega človeka, da odvrača ljudstvo; in glej jaz sem ga pred vami izprašal, in nobene krivice nisem našel na tem človeku v tem, za kar ga tožite. 
[23:15] Pa tudi Herod ne; kajti poslal sem vas bil k njemu, in glej, nič ni storil, kar bi bilo smrti vredno. 
[23:16] Bičal ga bom torej in izpustil. 
[23:17] Moral je pa na vsak praznik velikonočni, izpustiti jim enega jetnika; 
[23:18] Ali vse ljudstvo zavpije, govoreč: Vzemi tega, izpustí pa nam Baraba! 
[23:19] (Kteri je bil za voljo neke vstaje, ktera je bila v mestu, in za voljo umora vržen v ječo.) 
[23:20] Pilat jih torej zopet ogovorí, hoteč izpustiti Jezusa. 
[23:21] Oni so pa vpili: Križaj ga! križaj! 
[23:22] In reče jim v tretje: Kaj pa je ta hudega storil? Nič smrti vrednega nisem našel na njem; bičal ga bom torej in izpustil. 
[23:23] A oni so tiščali va-nj z velikim vpitjem, zahtevajoč, naj se razpnè na križ; in zmagovalo je vpitje njihovo in vélikih duhovnov. 
[23:24] In Pilat razsodi, naj se zgodí, kar tirjajo. 
[23:25] In izpustí jim tega, kteri je bil za voljo vstaje in umora v ječo vržen, za kogar so prosili; a Jezusa izročí njih volji. 
[23:26] In ko so ga odpeljali, zgrabijo nekega Simona Cirenejca, kteri je šel s polja, in zadenejo mu križ, naj ponese za Jezusom. 
[23:27] Šla je pa za njim velika množica ljudstva, in žén, ktere so jokale in tarnale za njim. 
[23:28] Obrnivši se pa Jezus k njim, reče: Hčeri Jeruzalemske, ne jokajte za menoj, nego za seboj jokajte in za otroci svojimi; 
[23:29] Kajti glej, prišli bodo dnevi, ko porekó: Blagor nerodovitnim, in telesom, ktera niso rodila, in prsom, ktera niso dojile! 
[23:30] Tedaj bodo jeli praviti goram: Padite na nas! in gričem: Pokrijte nas! 
[23:31] Kajti če se s sirovim lesom tako dela, kaj bo s suhim? 
[23:32] Peljali so pa ž njim vred tudi dva druga, razbojnika, da ju umoré. 
[23:33] In ko pridejo na mesto, ktero se imenuje Črepinjek, križajo tu njega, in razbojnika, enega na desno, a drugega na levo. 
[23:34] A Jezus je govoril: Oče! odpusti jim; saj ne vedó, kaj delajo. Deleč pa obleko njegovo, vržejo kocko. 
[23:35] In stalo je ljudstvo, in gledalo je. Zasmehovali so ga pa ž njimi tudi starešine, govoreč: Drugim je pomogel; naj pomore sebi, če je ta Kristus, izvoljenec Božji. 
[23:36] Posmehovali so mu se pa tudi vojaki, in pristopali so in podajali mu ocet, 
[23:37] In govorili so: Če si ti kralj Judovski, pomagaj si! 
[23:38] Bil je pa tudi napis nad njim napisan z Grškimi in Latinskimi in Hebrejskimi pismeni: Ta je kralj Judovski. 
[23:39] A eden od razbojnikov, ktera sta visela, preklinjal ga je, govoreč: Če si ti Kristus, pomagaj sebi in nama! 
[23:40] Odgovarjajoč pa drugi, pretil mu je, govoreč: Ali se tudi ti ne bojiš Boga, ko si sam tako obsojen? 
[23:41] In midva sicer sva po pravici objosena; kajti prejela sva po delih svojih, kar sva zaslužila: ta pa ni nič hudega storil. 
[23:42] In govoril je Jezusu: Spomeni se me, Gospod, kedar prideš v kraljestvo svoje. 
[23:43] In reče mu Jezus: Resnično ti pravim, danes boš z menoj v raji. 
[23:44] Bilo je pa okoli šeste ure, in tema nastane po vsem svetu do devete ure. 
[23:45] In solnce otemní, in zagrinjalo tempeljna se pretrga na dvoje. 
[23:46] In zaklicavši Jezus z močnim glasom, reče: Oče! v roke tvoje izročam dušo svojo. In rekši to, izdahne. 
[23:47] Videvši pa stotnik, kar se je zgodilo, hvalil je Boga, govoreč: Zares, ta človek je bil pravičen. 
[23:48] In vse ljudstvo, ktero se je bilo sešlo to gledat, ko so videli, kaj se godí, vrnejo se, trkajoč na prsi svoje. 
[23:49] Stali so pa od daleč vsi znanci njegovi, in žene, ktere so bile ž njim prišle iz Galileje, ter so gledali. 
[23:50] In glej, mož po imenu Jožef, svetovalec, mož dober in pravičen, 
[23:51] (Ta se ni bil vjemal ž njih svetom, in njih dejanjem) iz Arimateje, mesta Judovskega, kteri je tudi sam pričakoval kraljestva Božjega: 
[23:52] Ta pristopi k Pilatu, in zaprosi truplo Jezusovo. 
[23:53] In sneme ga, in zavije ga v platno, in položí ga v grob iztesan, v kterem še nikoli nobeden ni bil položen. 
[23:54] In dan je bil petek, in svitala je sobota. 
[23:55] Šle so pa za njim tudi žene, ktere so bile ž njim prišle iz Galileje, in ogledale so grob, in kako je položeno truplo njegovo. 
[23:56] Vrnivši se pa, pripravijo dišav in mire; in v soboto odpočijejo, po zapovedi. 
[24:1] A prvi dan tedna pridejo zeló zgodaj na grob, in prinesó, kar so bile pripravile dišav, in nektere druge žene ž njimi. 
[24:2] Najdejo pa kamen odvaljen od groba; 
[24:3] In ko vnidejo, ne najdejo trupla Gospoda Jezusa. 
[24:4] In zgodí se, ko se niso mogle načuditi temu, in glej, dva moža se postavita poleg njih v svetlih oblačilih. 
[24:5] Ko so se pa bale, in so pobesile lice k zemlji, rečeta jim: Kaj iščete živega med mrtvimi? 
[24:6] Ni ga tu, nego vstal je; spomenite se, kako vam je povedal, ko je bil še v Galileji, 
[24:7] Govoreč: Treba je sinu človečjemu izdanemu biti v roke ljudî grešnikov, in križanemu biti, in tretji dan vstati. 
[24:8] In spomenejo se besed njegovih. 
[24:9] In vrnivši se od groba, sporočé vse to enajsterim in vsem drugim. 
[24:10] Bile so pa Marija Magdalena in Joana in Marija Jakobova, in druge ž njimi, ktere so to pravile aposteljnom. 
[24:11] In zdele so jim se njih besede kakor laž, in niso jim verjeli. 
[24:12] A Peter vstane, in poleti h grobu, in sklonivši se, ugleda samo prte, da ležé, ter odide, čudeč se sam s seboj, kaj se je zgodilo. 
[24:13] In glej, dva od njih sta šla tisti dan v trg, kteri je bil šestdeset bežajev daleč od Jeruzalema, in mu je bilo ime Emaus. 
[24:14] In onadva sta se pogovarjala med seboj o vsem tem, kar se je zgodilo. 
[24:15] In zgodí se, ko sta se pogovarjala in eden drugega vpraševala: in sam Jezus se približa, in šel je ž njima. 
[24:16] Ali nju očí so se držale, da ga nista spoznala. 
[24:17] In reče jima: Kakošen pogovor je ta, ki ga imata med seboj po poti, in po kaj sta žalostna? 
[24:18] Odgovarjajoč pa eden, kteremu je bilo ime Kleopa, reče mu: Si li ti edini tujec v Jeruzalemu, da ne véš, kaj se je te dní v njem zgodilo? 
[24:19] Pa jima reče: Kaj? Onadva mu pa rečeta: Za Jezusa Nazarečana, kteri je bil mož prerok, silen v dejanji in besedi pred Bogom in vsem ljudstvom: 
[24:20] Kako so ga naši véliki duhovni in starešine izdali in na smrt obsodili, in križali ga. 
[24:21] A mi smo se nadejali, da je on ta, ki ima odrešiti Izraela. Ali vrh vsega tega je danes tretji dan, kar se je to zgodilo. 
[24:22] Pa tudi neke žene izmed nas so nas uplašile, ktere so bile zgodaj na grobu; 
[24:23] In ko niso našle trupla njegovega, prišle so, govoreč, da so jim se prikazali angelji, kteri pravijo, da je živ. 
[24:24] In šli so nekteri od téh, kteri so z nami, na grob, in našli so tako, kakor so bile tudi žene povedale; ali njega niso videli. 
[24:25] In on jima reče: O nespametni in lenega srca za verovanje vsega, kar so povedali preroki! 
[24:26] Ali ni bilo potrebno, da je Kristus to trpel, in šel v slavo Božjo? 
[24:27] In začenši od Mojzesa in vseh prerokov, razlagal jima je vsa pisma, ktera so bila pisana za njega, 
[24:28] In približajo se trgu, v kterega sta šla; in on se je delal, kakor da bi hotel dalje iti. 
[24:29] In prinudita ga, govoreč: Ostani z nama, ker se večerí, in dan se je nagnil. Ter vnide, da ostane ž njima. 
[24:30] In zgodí se, ko je sedel za mizo ž njima, vzeme kruh in blagoslovi, in prelomi ga, ter jima je dajal. 
[24:31] In odpró se očí njune, in spoznata ga; a on izgine od nju. 
[24:32] In govorila sta eden drugemu: Ali ni srce gorelo v nama, ko nama je po poti govoril, in ko nama je razlagal pisma? 
[24:33] In vstala sta še tisto uro, in vrnila sta se v Jeruzalem, in našla sta enajstere zbrane in té, kteri so bili ž njimi. 
[24:34] Kteri so pravili: Res je vstal, in prikazal se je Simonu. 
[24:35] In onadva sta razkladala, kaj je bilo na poti in kako sta ga spoznala, ko je kruh prelomil. 
[24:36] Ko so pa to govorili, postavi se sam Jezus sredi njih, in reče jim: Mir vam! 
[24:37] In oni se uplašijo, in vsi prestrašeni mislili so, da vidijo duha. 
[24:38] Pa jim reče: Kaj se plašite? in po kaj takošne misli vhajajo v srca vaša. 
[24:39] Vidite roke moje in noge moje, da sem jaz; potipljite me in poglejte! Saj duh nima telesa in kostî, kakor vidite, da imam jaz. 
[24:40] In rekši to, pokaže jim roke in noge. 
[24:41] Ko so pa še od veselja dvomili, in so se čudili, reče jim: Imate tu kakošne jedí? 
[24:42] Oni mu pa dadó kos pečene ribe, in meda v satu. 
[24:43] In vzel je, in pojedel je pred njimi. 
[24:44] In reče jim: To so besede, ktere sem vam bil govoril, ko sem bil še z vami, da se mora izpolniti vse, kar je pisano za me v postavi Mojzesovej in prerokih in psalmih. 
[24:45] Tedaj jim odpre um, da so umeli pisma. 
[24:46] In reče jim: Tako je pisano, in tako je moral Kristus trpeti, in vstati tretji dan od mrtvih; 
[24:47] In da naj se oznanjuje v ime njegovo pokora in odpuščanje grehov po vseh narodih, počenši od Jeruzalema. 
[24:48] A vi ste priče temu. 
[24:49] In glej, jaz bom poslal obljubo očeta svojega na vas; a vi sedite v mestu Jeruzalemu, dokler se ne oblečete v moč z višave. 
[24:50] In izpelje jih ven do Betanije; in povzdignivši roke svoje, blagoslovi jih. 
[24:51] In zgodí se, ko jih je blagoslovil, odstopi od njih, in bil je na nebo nesen. 
[24:52] In oni mu se poklonijo, in vrnejo se v Jeruzalem z veliko radostjo. 
[24:53] In bili so vseskozi v templjnu, hvaleč in blagosloveč Boga. Amen. 

### John

[1:1] V začetku je bila beseda, in beseda je bila pri Bogu, in Bog je bila beseda. 
[1:2] Ta je bila v začetku pri Bogu. 
[1:3] Vse je po njej postalo, in brez nje ni nič postalo, kar je postalo. 
[1:4] V njej je bilo življenje, in življenje je bilo luč ljudém, 
[1:5] In luč v temi sveti, in tema je ni zapopadla. 
[1:6] Bil je človek poslan od Boga, kteremu je bilo ime Janez. 
[1:7] Ta pride na pričevanje, da priča za luč, da bi vsi verovali po njem. 
[1:8] On ni bil luč, nego da priča za luč. 
[1:9] Bila je prava luč, ktera razsvetljuje vsakega, kteri pride na svet. 
[1:10] Na svetu je bil, in svet je po njem postal, in svet ga ni poznal. 
[1:11] V svoje je prišel, in svoji ga niso sprejeli. 
[1:12] A kterikoli so ga sprejeli, dal jim je oblast, da postanejo sinovi Božji, kteri verujejo v ime njegovo; 
[1:13] Kteri se niso od krví, ne od volje telesne, ne od volje možá, nego od Boga rodili. 
[1:14] In beseda je telo postala, in nastanila se je med nami, (in videli smo slavo njeno, slavo kakor edinorojenega od očeta,) polna milosti in resnice. 
[1:15] Janez pričuje za-nj, in vpije, govoreč: Ta je bil, za kogar sem rekel: Ta, ki bo prišel za menoj, postal je pred menoj; kajti bil je poprej, nego jaz. 
[1:16] In od polnosti njegove smo mi vsi prejeli, tudi milost za milost. 
[1:17] Kajti postava se je po Mojzesu dala, milost in resnica je postala po Jesusu Kristusu. 
[1:18] Boga ni nikoli nihče videl; edinorojeni sin, ki je na naročji očetovem, on nam je oznanil. 
[1:19] In to je pričevanje Janezovo, ko so poslali Judje iz Jeruzalema duhovne in Levite, naj ga vprašajo: Kdo si ti? 
[1:20] In priznal je, in ni utajil; in prizna: Jaz nisem Kristus. 
[1:21] In vprašajo ga: Kaj si torej? Elija si ti? Pa reče: Nisem. Prerok si ti? Pa odgovorí: Ne. 
[1:22] Rekó mu torej: Kdo si? da odgovor dámo tem, kteri so nas poslali. Kaj praviš sam za-se? 
[1:23] Reče: Jaz sem "glas vpijočega v puščavi: Poravnajte pot Gospodov;" kakor je povedal Izaija prerok. 
[1:24] Ti pa, kteri so bili poslani, bili so izmed Farizejev. 
[1:25] In vprašajo ga, in rekó mu: Za kaj torej krščuješ, če ti nisi Kristus, ne Elija, ne prerok? 
[1:26] Odgovorí jim Janez, govoreč: Jaz krščujem z vodo; stojí pa med vami, kogar vi ne poznate. 
[1:27] On je, kteri ima za menoj priti; komur jaz nisem vreden odvezati jermena na obutalu njegovem. 
[1:28] To se je zgodilo v Betabari onkraj Jordana, kjer je Janez krščeval. 
[1:29] Drugi dan ugleda Janez Jezusa, da gre k njemu, ter teče: Glej, jagnje Božje, ktero jemlje greh sveta. 
[1:30] Ta je, za kogar sem jaz rekel: Za menoj gre mož, kteri je pred menoj bil; kajti bil je poprej, nego jaz. 
[1:31] In jaz ga nisem poznal: ali da se razodene Izraelu, za to sem jaz prišel krščevat z vodo. 
[1:32] In pričeval je Janez, govoreč: Videl sem Duha, da shaja ko golob z neba, in ostal je na njem. 
[1:33] In jaz ga nisem poznal; ali kteri me je poslal krščevat, z vodo, ta mi je rekel: Na kogar boš videl, da shaja Duh in ostane na njem, ta je, kteri bo krščeval z Duhom svetim. 
[1:34] In jaz sem ga videl, in pričeval sem, da je ta sin Božji. 
[1:35] Drugi dan je zopet Janez stal, in dva od učencev njegovih. 
[1:36] In ko ugleda Jezusa, da gre, reče: Glej, jagnje Božje. 
[1:37] In slišala sta ga oba učenca, ko je govoril, ter odideta za Jezusom. 
[1:38] Obrnivši se pa Jezus, in ugledavši ju, da gresta za njim, reče jima: 
[1:39] Koga iščeta? Ona mu pa rečeta: Rabi, (kar se pravi, če raztolmačiš: Učenik,) kje stanuješ? 
[1:40] Velí jima: Pridita in poglejta. Šla sta, in videla sta, kje stanuje; in ostala sta tisti dan pri njem; bilo je pa okoli desete ure. 
[1:41] Eden od teh dveh, ktera sta bila slišala od Janeza, in sta bila šla za njim, bil je Andrej, brat Simona Petra. 
[1:42] Ta najde najprej brata svojega Simona, in reče mu: Našli smo Mesija (kar se tolmači: Kristus). 
[1:43] In odpelje ga k Jezusu. Pogledavši pa na-nj Jezus, reče: Ti si Simon sin Jonov; ti se boš imenoval Kefa (kar se tolmači: Peter). 
[1:44] Drugi dan je hotel Jezus vniti v Galilejo; in najde Filipa, in reče mu: Pojdi za menoj. 
[1:45] Bil je pa Filip iz Betsajde, iz mesta Andrejevega in Petrovega. 
[1:46] Filip najde Natanaela, in reče mu: Našli smo ga, za kogar je pisal Mojzes v zakonu in preroki, Jezusa sina Jožefovega iz Nazareta. 
[1:47] Pa mu Natanael reče: Iz Nazareta da more kaj dobrega biti? Velí mu Filip: Pridi in poglej. 
[1:48] Jezus vidi Natanaela, da gre k njemu, ter reče za-nj: Glej, prav Izraelec, v kterem ni zvijače. 
[1:49] Reče mu Natanael: Odkod me poznaš? Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Videl sem te, predno te je Filip poklical, ko si bil pod smokvo. 
[1:50] Natanael odgovorí in mu reče: Rabi, ti si sin Božji, ti si kralj Izraelov. 
[1:51] Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Ker sem ti rekel: Videl sem te pod smokvo, veruješ. Videl boš več od tega. [vrstica 52:] In reče mu: Resnično resnično vam pravim: Odslej boste videli nebo odprto, in angelje Božje stopati gar in dol na sina človečjega. 
[2:1] In tretji dan je bila ženitnina v Kani Galilejskej, in bila je mati Jezusova tam. 
[2:2] Povabljen je bil pa tudi Jezus in učenci njegovi na ženitnino. 
[2:3] In ko je zmanjkalo vina, reče mati Jezusova njemu: Vina nimajo. 
[2:4] Reče jej Jezus: Kaj imaš z menoj, žena? Ni še prišel čas moj. 
[2:5] Mati njegova velí služabnikom: Karkoli vam poreče, storite. 
[2:6] Bilo je pa tam šest vrčev kamenitnih postavljenih po očiščevanji Judovskem, kteri so držali po dve ali tri mere. 
[2:7] Velí jim Jezus: Napolnite vrče z vodo. In napolnijo jih do vrha. 
[2:8] In velí jim: Zajmite sedaj, in nesite starešini. Ter nesó. 
[2:9] Ko pa okusi starešina vodo, ktera je postala vino, (ni pa vedel, odkod je; a služabniki so vedeli, kteri so bili zajeli vodo,) pokliče starešinu ženina, 
[2:10] In reče mu: Vsak človek najprej dobro vino daje, in ko se opijanijo, tedaj tisto, ktero jo slabše: a ti si prihranil dobro vino noter doslej. 
[2:11] Ta začetek čudežev je storil Jezus v Kani Galilejskej, in pokazal je slavo svojo; in verovali so va-nj učenci njegovi. 
[2:12] Po tem snide v Kapernaum, on in mati njegova in bratje njegovi, in učenci njegovi; in tu ostanejo ne veliko dnî. 
[2:13] In bila je blizu Velika noč Judovska, in Jezus se napoti v Jeruzalem. 
[2:14] In najde v tempeljnu prodajalce volov in ovâc in golobov, in menjalce, da sedé. 
[2:15] In naredivši bič iz vrvi, izžene vse iz tempeljna, tudi ovce in vole. In menjalcem raztrese denar, in mize prevrne. 
[2:16] In tém, kteri so prodajali golobe, reče: Odnesite to odtod; ne delajte iz hiše očeta mojega hiše trgovske. 
[2:17] Spomenejo pa se učenci njegovi, da je pisano: "Gorečnost za hišo tvojo me je snedla." 
[2:18] Pa odgovoré Judje in mu rekô: Kakošno znamenje nam boš pokazal, da to delaš? 
[2:19] Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Poderite ta tempelj, in v treh dnéh ga bom postavil. 
[2:20] Pa mu rekó Judje: Šest in štirideset let se je zidal ta tempelj, in ti ga boš v tréh dnéh postavil? 
[2:21] Ali on je govoril za tempelj telesa svojega. 
[2:22] Ko je bil torej od mrtvih vstal, spomenili so se učenci njegovi, da jim je to pravil; in verovali so pismu, in besedi, ktero jim je Jezus povedal. 
[2:23] Ko je bil pa v Jeruzalemu o Velikej noči, na praznik, verovalo jih je veliko v ime njegovo, ko so videli znamenja njegova, ktera je delal. 
[2:24] Sam se jim pa Jezus ni zaupal, ker jih je vse poznal; 
[2:25] In ker mu ni bilo treba, da bi kdo pričal za človeka: ker je sam vedel, kaj je v človeku. 
[3:1] Bil je pa človek med Farizeji, Nikodem mu je bilo ime, starešina Judovski. 
[3:2] Ta pride k Jezusu po noči, in reče mu: Rabi! vémo, da si od Boga prišel učenik; kajti nikdor ne more delati téh znamenj, ktera ti delaš, če ne bo Bog ž njim. 
[3:3] Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Resnično resnično ti pravim: Če se kdo na novo ne rodí, ne more videti kraljestva Božjega. 
[3:4] Reče mu Nikodem: Kako se more človek roditi, ko je star? Jeli more drugoč vniti v telo matere svoje in se roditi? 
[3:5] Jezus odgovorí: Resnično resnično ti pravim: Če se kdo ne rodí iz vode in Duha, ne more vniti v kraljestvo Božje. 
[3:6] Kar se je rodilo iz telesa, telo je; in kar se je rodilo iz Duha, duh je. 
[3:7] Ne čudi se, da sem ti rekel: Treba vam se je na novo roditi. 
[3:8] Veter veje, kjer hoče, in glas njegov slišiš, pa ne véš, odkod prihaja in kam gre; tako je vsak, kdor se je rodil iz Duha. 
[3:9] Nikodem odgovorí in mu reče: Kako more to biti? 
[3:10] Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Ti si učenik Izraelov, in tega ne véš? 
[3:11] Resnično resnično ti pravim, da kar vémo, govorimo; in kar smo videli, pričamo: ali pričevanja našega ne sprejemate. 
[3:12] Če vam pozemeljske reči pravim, in ne verujete: kako boste verovali, če vam bom pravil nebeške? 
[3:13] In nikdor ni stopil na nebo, razen kdor je z neba sešel, sin človečji, ki je na nebu. 
[3:14] In kakor je Mojzes povzdignil kačo v puščavi, tako se mora tudi sin človečji povišati: 
[3:15] Da kdorkoli veruje va-nj, ne pogine, nego da ima večno življenje. 
[3:16] Kajti tako je Bog ljubil svet, da je sina svojega edinorojenega dal, da kdorkoli veruje va-nj, ne pogine, nego da ima večno življenje. 
[3:17] Bog namreč ni poslal sina svojega na svet, da bi svet sodil, nego da se svet zveliča po njem. 
[3:18] Kdor veruje va-nj, ne bo sojen; kdor pa ne veruje, sojen je uže, ker ne veruje v ime edinorojenega sina Božjega. 
[3:19] Sodba je pa to, da je luč prišla na svet; ali ljudjé so bolj ljubili temo, nego luč: kajti njih dela so bila hudobna. 
[3:20] Vsak namreč, kdor dela hudobno, sovraži luč, in ne hodi k luči, da se ne posvaré dela njegova; 
[3:21] Kdor pa dela resnico, hodi k luči, da se dela njegova razodenejo, ker so v Bogu storjena. 
[3:22] Po tem pride Jezus in učenci njegovi v Judejsko zemljo. In tu je prebival ž njimi in krščeval. 
[3:23] Krščeval je pa tudi Janez v Enonu blizu Salima, ker je bilo tam veliko vode; in dohajali so, in krščeval jih je. 
[3:24] Kajti Janez še ni bil vržen v ječo. 
[3:25] Vstane pa vprašanje med učenci Janezovimi in Judi ob očiščevanji. 
[3:26] Ter pridejo k Janezu in mu rekó: Rabi! ta, ki je bil s teboj onkraj Jordana, za kogar si ti pričal, glej, krščuje, in vsi gredó k njemu. 
[3:27] Janez odgovorí in reče: Človek ne more ničesar vzeti, če mu ne bo dano z neba. 
[3:28] Vi sami mi pričate, da sem rekel: Jaz nisem Kristus, nego poslan sem pred njim. 
[3:29] Kdor ima nevesto, ženin je; prijatelj pa ženinov, kteri stoji in ga posluša, z radostjo se raduje glasu ženinovemu. Ta torej radost moja se je izpolnila. 
[3:30] On mora rasti, a jaz manjšati se. 
[3:31] Kdor od zgoraj prihaja, ta je nad vsemi. Kdor je z zemlje, ta je od zemlje, in govorí od zemlje; kdor je prišel z neba, ta je nad vsemi, 
[3:32] In kar je videl in slišal, to priča: ali pričevanja njegovega nikdor ne sprejema. 
[3:33] Kdor sprejme njegovo pričevanje, potrdil je, da je Bog resničen. 
[3:34] Kajti kogar je poslal Bog, besede Božje govorí: Bog namreč ne daje Duha na mero. 
[3:35] Oče ljubi sina, in vse mu je dal v roko. 
[3:36] Kdor veruje v sina, ima večno življenje; a kdor ne veruje v sina, ne bo videl življenja, nego jeza Božja prebiva na njem. 
[4:1] Ko torej zvé Gospod, da so Farizeji slišali, da Jezus več učencev dobiva in krščuje, nego Janez, 
[4:2] (Da si ravno Jezus sam ni krščeval, nego učenci njegovi,) 
[4:3] Zapustí Judejo, in odide zopet v Galilejo. 
[4:4] Moral je pa iti skozi Samarijo. 
[4:5] Ter pride v mesto Samarijsko, ktero se imenuje Sihar, blizu vasi, ktero je dal Jakob Jožefu sinu svojemu. 
[4:6] Bil je pa tam studenec Jakobov. Jezus torej, truden od pota, sedel je tako na studencu. Bilo je okoli šeste ure. 
[4:7] Kar pride žena iz Samarije zajemat vodo. Velí jej Jezus: Daj mi piti. 
[4:8] (Kajti učenci njegovi so bili odšli v mesto, da kupijo živeža.) 
[4:9] Pa mu žena Samarijanka reče: Kako moreš ti, ko si Jud, mene, ki sem žena Samarijanka, prositi, naj ti dam piti? (Kajti Judje se ne pečajo s Samarijani.) 
[4:10] Jezus odgovorí in jej reče: Ko bi vedela dar Božji, in kdo je ta, ki ti pravi: Daj mi piti! prosila bi ti njega, in dal bi ti žive vode. 
[4:11] Reče mu žena: Gospodi saj še zajeti nimaš s čim, in vodnjak je globok: odkod imaš torej živo vodo? 
[4:12] Jeli si ti veči od našega očeta Jakoba, kteri nam je dal vodnjak, in je sam iž njega pil, in sinovi njegovi, in živina njegova? 
[4:13] Jezus odgovorí in jej reče: Vsak, kdor pije od te vode, ožejal bo zopet. 
[4:14] Kdorkoli bo pa pil od vode, ktero mu bom jaz dal, ne bo ožejal vekomaj; nego voda, ktero mu bom dal, postala bo v njem studenec vode, ktera teče v večno življenje. 
[4:15] Velí mu žena: Gospod! daj mi té vode, da ne bom žejna, in ne bom sèm hodila zajemat. 
[4:16] Velí jej Jezus: Pojdi, pokliči moža svojega, in pridi sèm. 
[4:17] Žena odgovorí in reče: Nimam moža. Reče jej Jezus: Prav si povedala: Nimam moža. 
[4:18] Imela si namreč pet móž; in kogar sedaj imaš, ni mož tvoj: to si po pravici povedala. 
[4:19] Reče mu žena: Gospod! vidim, da si prerok. 
[4:20] Očetje naši so na tej gori molili; vi pa pravite da je v Jeruzalemu kraj, kjer je treba moliti. 
[4:21] Reče jej Jezus: Žena! verjemi mi, da bo prišel čas, in sedaj je, ko ne boste ne na tej gori ne v Jeruzalemu molili očeta. 
[4:22] Vi molite, kar ne véste; mi molimo, kar vémo: kajti zveličanje je od Judov. 
[4:23] Ali prišel bo čas, in sedaj je, ko bodo pravi molilci molili očeta v duhu in resnici: saj oče tudi išče takošnih, da bi ga molili. 
[4:24] Bog je duh; in kteri ga molijo, morajo v duhu in resnici moliti. 
[4:25] Reče mu žena: Vem, da bo Mesija prišel (ki se imenuje Kristus); Kedar on pride, oznanil nam bo vse. 
[4:26] Reče jej Jezus: Jaz sem, ki govorim s teboj. 
[4:27] In na to pridejo učenci njegovi, in začudijo se, da se z ženo pogovarja; vendar pa nobeden ni rekel; Kaj hočeš? ali: Kaj se pogovarjaš ž njo? 
[4:28] A žena pustí vrč, in odide v mesto, in velí ljudém: 
[4:29] Pojdite, poglejte človeka, kteri mi je povedal vse, kar sem storila: jeli ni ta Kristus? 
[4:30] Ter izidejo iz mesta, in pridejo k njemu. 
[4:31] Med tem so ga pa učenci njegovi prosili, govoreč: Rabi, jej! 
[4:32] On jim pa reče: Jaz imam jed, da jém, za ktero vi ne véste. 
[4:33] Učenci so se torej pomenkovali med seboj: Je li mu je kdo prinesel jesti? 
[4:34] Reče jim Jezus: Moja jed je, da izpolnjujem voljo tega, kteri me je poslal, in dodelam njegovo delo. 
[4:35] Ne pravite li vi, da še štiri mesece, pa bo prišla žetev? Glej, pravim vam, povzdignite oči svoje, in poglejte njive, kako užé rumené za žetev. 
[4:36] In kdor žanje, prejema plačilo, in zbira sad za večno življenje: da se radujeta oba ob enem, kdor seje in kdor žanje. 
[4:37] Kajti v tem je beseda resnična, da je drugi, kteri seje, in drugi, kteri žanje. 
[4:38] Jaz sem vas poslal žet, česar vi niste obdelali; drugi so obdelali, in vi ste v njihovo delo prišli. 
[4:39] Iz tega mesta jih je veliko verovalo va-nj od Samarijanov, za voljo besede žene, ktera je pričala: Povedal mi je vse, kar sem storila. 
[4:40] Ko pridejo torej Samarijani k njemu, prosili so ga, naj ostane pri njih; in ostal je tam dva dní. 
[4:41] In veliko več jih je verovalo za voljo njegove besede. 
[4:42] A ženi so pravili: Sedaj ne verujemo več za voljo tvoje besede, ker smo sami slišali, in vémo, da je ta resnično zveličar sveta Kristus. 
[4:43] Po teh dveh dnéh pa izide odtod, in odide v Galilejo. 
[4:44] Kajti Jezus sam je pričal, da prerok v svojej domovini nima časti. 
[4:45] Ko pa pride v Galilejo, sprejmó ga Galilejci, kteri so bili videli vse, kar je storil v Jeruzalemu na praznik; kajti tudi oni so bili prišli na praznik. 
[4:46] In zopet pride Jezus v Kano Galilejsko, kjer je bil premenil vodo v vino. In bil je neki kraljev človek, kogar sin je bolen bil v Kapernaumu. 
[4:47] Ta, slišavši, da je prišel Jezus iz Judeje v Galilejo, odide k njemu, in prosil ga je, naj snide in mu uzdravi sina: imel je namreč umreti. 
[4:48] Reče mu torej Jezus: Če znamenj in čudežev ne vidite, ne verujete. 
[4:49] Velí mu kraljev človek: Gospod! snidi, dokler ni umrl otrok moj. 
[4:50] Reče mu Jezus: Pojdi! sin tvoj je živ. In veroval je človek besedi, ktero mu je Jezus rekel, in šel je. 
[4:51] A ko je še šel, srečajo ga hlapci njegovi, in sporočé, govoreč: Sin tvoj je živ. 
[4:52] In vpraša jih za uro, obklej mu je odleglo. In rekó mu: Včeraj ob sedmih ga je pustila mrzlica. 
[4:53] Tedaj spozná oče, da tisto uro, ko mu je Jezus rekel: Sin tvoj je živ. In veroval je on in vsa hiša njegova. 
[4:54] Ta zopet, drugi čudež, storil je Jezus, ko je prišel iz Judeje v Galilejo. 
[5:1] Po tem je bil praznik Judovski, in Jezus se napoti v Jeruzalem. 
[5:2] Je pa v Jeruzalemu pri Ovčjih vratih kopel, ktera se Hebrejski imenuje Betesda, in ima pet lop. 
[5:3] V teh je ležala velika množica bolnikov, slepih, hromih, polomljenih, kteri so pričakovali, kedaj se bo jela voda gibati. 
[5:4] Shajal je namreč angelj o svojem času v kopel, in kalil je vodo; in kdor je prvi vstopil, potem ko se je voda skalila, ozdravel je, kterokoli bolezen je imel. 
[5:5] Bil je pa en človek tam, kteri je bil osem in trideset let bolan. 
[5:6] Ko Jezus tega vidi, da leži, in zvé, da je uže dolgo časa bolan, reče mu: Hočeš li ozdraveti? 
[5:7] Odgovorí mu bolnik: Gospod, nimam človeka, da bi me, kedar se voda skalí, vrgel v kopel; a predno sam pridem, vstopi drugi pred menoj. 
[5:8] Velí mu Jezus: Vstani, vzemi oder svoj, in hodi. 
[5:9] In precej je človek ozdravel, in vzel oder svoj, in hodil. Bila je pa tisti dan sobota. 
[5:10] Za to so govorili Judje uzdravljenemu: Sobota je; ne smeš odra nositi. 
[5:11] Odgovorí jim: Ta, ki me je uzdravil, rekel mi je: Vzemi oder svoj, in hodi! 
[5:12] Vprašajo ga torej: Kdo je ta človek, ki ti je rekel: Vzemi oder svoj, in hodi? 
[5:13] Uzdravljeni pa ni vedel, kdo je; kajti Jezus se je bil umaknil, ker je bilo veliko ljudstva na tem kraji. 
[5:14] Po tem ga najde Jezus v tempeljnu, in reče mu: Glej, ozdravel si; ne gréši več, da ti se kaj hujega ne prigodí. 
[5:15] Človek odide, in sporočí Judom, da je Jezus tisti, ki ga je uzdravil. 
[5:16] In za to so Judje Jezusa preganjali, in gledali so, da bi ga umorili, ker je to delal v soboto. 
[5:17] Jezus jim je pa odgovarjal: Oče moj doslej dela, tudi jaz delam. 
[5:18] Za to so pa Judje še bolj gledali, da bi ga umorili, ker ni samo sobote prelomil, nego tudi Boga očeta svojega imenoval, delajoč se enakega Bogu. 
[5:19] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim, da ne more sin sam od sebe ničesar delati, razen kar vidi, da dela oče; karkoli namreč on dela, to tudi sin dela ravno tako. 
[5:20] Kajti oče sina ljubi, in vse mu pokazuje, kar sam dela; in pokazal mu bo še veča dela, nego ta, da se boste vi čudili. 
[5:21] Kakor namreč oče obujuje mrtve, in oživlja, tako tudi sin, ktere hoče. 
[5:22] Kajti oče tudi nikogar ne sodi, nego vso sodbo je izročil sinu: 
[5:23] Da bi vsi spoštovali sina, kakor spoštujejo očeta. Kdor sina ne spoštuje, ne spoštuje očeta, kteri ga je poslal. 
[5:24] Resnično resnično vam pravim, da kdor mojo besedo posluša, in veruje temu, kteri me je poslal, ima večno življenje; in ne pride na sodbo, nego prešel je iz smrti v življenje. 
[5:25] Resnično resnično vam pravim, da bo prišel čas, in sedaj je, ko bodo mrtvi slišali glas sina Božjega, in kteri bodo slišali, oživeli bodo. 
[5:26] Kakor ima namreč oče življenje v sebi, tako je dal tudi sinu, da ima življenje v sebi. 
[5:27] In dal mu je oblast tudi sodbo delati, ker je sin človečji. 
[5:28] Ne čudite se temu; kajti prišel bo čas, ko bodo vsi, kteri so v grobih, slišali glas njegov; 
[5:29] In izšli bodo, kteri so dobro delali, na vstajanje življenja, a kteri so hudo delali, na vstajanje sodbe. 
[5:30] Jas sam od sebe ne morem ničesar delati. Kakor slišim, sodim; in sodba moja je pravična: ker ne iščem svoje volje, nego volje tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[5:31] Če jaz sam za sebe pričam, pričanje moje ni resnično. 
[5:32] Drugi je, kteri priča zame, in vém, da je pričevanje, ktero za-me priča, resnično. 
[5:33] Vi ste poslali k Janezu, in pričal je po pravici; 
[5:34] Ali jaz ne sprejemam priče od človeka; nego pravim vam to, da bi se zveličali. 
[5:35] On je bil luč, ktera je gorela in svetila; a vi ste se hoteli nekoliko časa veseliti svetlobe njegove. 
[5:36] Ali jaz imam večo pričo, kakor Janez; dela namreč, ktera mi je oče izročil, naj jih dodelam: ta dela, ktera jaz delam, pričajo za-me, da me je oče poslal. 
[5:37] In oče, kteri me je poslal, pričal je sam za mene. Niste pa ne glasú njegovega slišali, ne obličja njegovega videli. 
[5:38] In besede njegove nimate, da bi prebivala v vas: ker temu, kogar je on poslal, ne verujete. 
[5:39] Preglejte pisma, ker vi mislite, da imate v njih življenje, in ta so, ktera pričajo za-me. 
[5:40] Pa ne čete priti k meni, da bi imeli življenje. 
[5:41] Slave od ljudî ne sprejemam. 
[5:42] Ali poznam vas, da ljubezni Božje nimate v sebi. 
[5:43] Jaz sem prišel v ime očeta svojega, in ne sprejemate me; če drugi pride v svoje ime, njega boste sprejeli. 
[5:44] Kako morete vi verovati, ko sprejemate slavo eden od drugega, slave pa, ktera je od edinega Boga, ne iščete? 
[5:45] Ne mislite, da vas bom jaz tožil očetu; je, kteri vas toži, Mojzes, v kogar vi zaupate. 
[5:46] Ko bi namreč Mojzesu verovali, verovali bi meni: kajti on je pisal za mene. 
[5:47] Če pa njegovim pismom ne verujete, kako boste mojim besedam verovali? 
[6:1] Po tem odide Jezus na oni kraj morja Galilejskega ali Tiberijskega. 
[6:2] In šlo je za njim veliko ljudstva, ko so videli njegove čudeže, ki jih je delal na bolnikih. 
[6:3] Jezus pa izide na goro, in tu je z učenci svojimi sedel. 
[6:4] Bila ja pa blizu Velika noč, praznik Judovski. 
[6:5] Povzdignivši torej Jezus očí, in videvši, da veliko ljudstva k njemu dohaja, reče Filipu: Kje bomo kupili kruha, da bodo tí jedli? 
[6:6] (To je pa govoril, izkušajoč ga; kajti on je vedel, kaj bo storil.) 
[6:7] Odgovorí mu Filip: Za dve sto grošev kruha jim ni dosti, da bi vsakteri od njih kaj malega dobil. 
[6:8] Reče mu eden učencev njegovih Andrej brat Simona Petra: 
[6:9] En deček je tu, kteri ima pet hlebov ječmenovih in dve ribici; ali kaj je to med toliko? 
[6:10] Jezus pa reče: Dajte, posadite ljudí. Bilo je pa veliko trave na tem mestu. In posadé se možjé, kakih pet tisoči na število. 
[6:11] Tedaj Jezus vzeme hlebe, in zahvali, ter razdelí učencem, učenci pa tém, ki so sedeli: in ravno tako tudi od ribic, kolikor so hoteli. 
[6:12] Ko so se pa nasitili, velí učencem svojim: Zberite ostanke koscev, da nič ne pogine. 
[6:13] Ter zberó, in napolnijo dvanajst košev koscev od petih hlebov ječmenovih, ki so preostali od téh, ktere so bili pojedli. 
[6:14] Ljudjé pa, ko so videli čudež, kterega je bil Jezus storil, govorili so: Ta je res prerok, kteri je imel priti na svet. 
[6:15] Jezus torej, vedoč, da bodo prišli in ga zgrabili, da ga naredé za kralja, umakne se zopet na goro on sam. 
[6:16] Ko se je pa zvečerilo, snidejo učenci njegovi na morje. 
[6:17] In stopivši v ladjo, šli so na oni kraj morja v Kapernaum. In uže se jo mračilo, in Jezus ni bil k njim prišel, 
[6:18] In morje se je od velikega vetra vzdigalo. 
[6:19] Odplavivši se pa kakih pet in dvajset ali trideset bežajev, ugledajo Jezusa, da hodi po morji, in se približuje ladji; in uplašijo se. 
[6:20] On jim pa reče: Jaz sem; ne bojte se! 
[6:21] In željno so ga vzeli v ladjo, in precej je bila ladja na zemlji, v ktero so šli. 
[6:22] Drugi dan pa ljudstvo, ktero je stalo onkraj morja, ko je videlo, da ni bilo tam druge ladje, razen tiste ene, v ktero so bili stopili učenci njegovi, in da Jezus ni vstopil z učenci svojimi v ladjo, nego da so bili učenci njegovi sami odšli; 
[6:23] (Prišle so pa druge ladje iz Tiberijade blizu mesta, kjer so bili jedli kruh, ko je Gospod zahvalil;) 
[6:24] Ko je torej ljudstvo videlo, da Jezusa ni tu, in tudi učencev njegovih ne: stopijo tudi oni v ladje, in pridejo v Kapernaum, iskajoč Jezusa. 
[6:25] In ko ga najdejo onkraj morja, rekó mu: Rabi, kedaj si prišel sem? 
[6:26] Odgovorí jim Jezus in reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim, iščete me, ne za to, ker ste videli čudeže, nego ker ste jedli hlebe in ste se nasitili. 
[6:27] Trudite se, ne za jed, ktera mine, nego za jed, ktera ostane za večno življenje, ktero vam bo sin človečji dal: kajti tega je potrdil oče Bog. 
[6:28] Rekó mu torej: Kaj naj storimo, da bomo delali dela Božja? 
[6:29] Odgovorí jim Jezus in reče: To je delo Božje, da verujete v tega, kterega je on poslal. 
[6:30] Pa mu rekó: Kakošno znamenje nam pokazuješ, da bi videli in ti verovali? kaj delaš? 
[6:31] Očetje naši so jedli mano v puščavi, kakor jo pisano: "Kruh z neba jim je dal jesti." 
[6:32] Pa jim Jezus reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim: Ni vam dal Mojzes kruha z neba; nego oče moj vam daje pravi kruh z neba. 
[6:33] Kajti kruh Božji je ta, kteri shaja z neba, in daje življenje svetu. 
[6:34] Rekó mu torej: Gospod, daj nam vsegdar tega kruha. 
[6:35] Jezus jim pa reče: Jaz sem kruh življenja; kdor k meni dohaja, ne bo nikoli lačen, in kdor veruje v mé, ne bo nikoli ožejal. 
[6:36] Ali povedal sem vam, da ste me tudi videli, in ne verujete. 
[6:37] Vse, kar mi oče dá, pride k meni; in kdor pride k meni, ne bom ga izgnal ven: 
[6:38] Kajti prišel sem z neba, ne da bi delal po svojej volji, nego po volji tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[6:39] Volja očeta, kteri me je poslal, je pa ta, da od tega, kar mi je dal, ničesar ne izgubim, nego da to poslednji dan obudim. 
[6:40] In volja tega, kteri me je poslal, je ta, da ima vsak, kdor vidi sina in veruje va-nj, večno življenje, in jaz ga bom obudil poslednji dan. 
[6:41] Tedaj so Judje godrnjali nad njim, da je rekel: Jaz sem kruh, kteri je prišel z neba. 
[6:42] In govorili so: Kaj ni ta sin Jožefov, komur mi očeta in mater poznamo? Kako torej govorí ta: Z neba sem prišel! 
[6:43] Jezus pa odgovorí in jim reče: Ne godrnjajte med seboj! 
[6:44] Nikdor ne more priti k meni, če ga oče, kteri me je poslal, ne privleče, in jaz ga bom obudil poslednji dan. 
[6:45] Pisano je v prerokih: "In vsi bodo učeni od Boga." Kdorkoli je torej slišal od očeta in se je naučil, dohaja k meni; 
[6:46] Ne da bi bil kdo očeta videl, razen tisti, kteri je od Boga: ta je videl Boga. 
[6:47] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Kdor veruje v mé, ima večno življenje. 
[6:48] Jaz sem kruh življenja. 
[6:49] Očetje vaši so jedli mano v puščavi, in pomrli so. 
[6:50] Ta je kruh, kteri shaja z neba: da kdor od njega jé, ne umre. 
[6:51] Jaz sem živi kruh, kteri sem z neba prišel; če kdo jé od tega kruha, živel bo vekomaj. Kruh pa, kterega bom jaz dal, je telo moje, ktero bom jaz dal za življenje sveta. 
[6:52] Judje so se pa prepirali med seboj, govoreč: Kako nam more ta dati telo jesti? 
[6:53] Pa jim Jezus reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim: Če ne boste jedli telesa sina človečjega, in pili njegove krví, ne boste imeli življenja v sebi. 
[6:54] Kdor jé moje telo, in pije mojo kri, ima večno življenje, in jaz ga bom obudil poslednji dan. 
[6:55] Kajti telo moje je prava jed, in kri moja je prava pijača. 
[6:56] Kdor jé moje telo, in pije mojo kri, prebiva v meni, in jaz v njem. 
[6:57] Kakor je mene poslal živi oče, in jaz za voljo očeta živim: tako bo tudi tisti, kteri mene jé, živel, za voljo mene. 
[6:58] Ta je kruh, kteri je z neba prišel; ne kakor so očetje vaši jedli mano, in so pomrli; kdor ta kruh jé, živel bo vekomaj. 
[6:59] To je povedal v shajališči, ko je učil v Kapernaumu. 
[6:60] Veliko torej učencev njegovih, kteri so poslušali, reče: Trda je ta beseda; kdo jo more poslušati? 
[6:61] Vedoč pa Jezus sam v sebi, da učenci njegovi godrnjajo nad tem, reče jim: To vas pohujšuje? 
[6:62] Kaj pa, ko boste videli sina človečjega, da gre gor, kjer je poprej bil? 
[6:63] Duh je to, kar oživlja, telo nič ne pomaga; besede, ktere vam jaz govorim, duh so in življenje so. 
[6:64] So pa nekteri med vami, kteri ne verujejo. Jezus namreč je od začetka vedel, kteri so, da ne verujejo, in kdo je, kteri ga bo izdal. 
[6:65] In pravil je: Za to sem vam rekel, da ne more nihče k meni priti, če mu ne bo dano od očeta mojega. 
[6:66] Posihmal je veliko učencev njegovih zopet odšlo, in nič več niso ž njim hodili. 
[6:67] Tedaj reče Jezus dvanajsterim: Ali hočete tudi vi oditi? 
[6:68] Pa mu odgovorí Simon Peter: Gospod, h komu pojdemo? Besede večnega življenja imaš. 
[6:69] In mi smo verovali, in vémo, da si ti Kristus, sin živega Boga. 
[6:70] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Ali vas nisem jaz dvanajst izvolil, in eden od vas je hudič? 
[6:71] Govoril je pa za Juda Simonovega Iškarijana: kajti ta ga je imel izdati, in bil je eden od dvanajsterih. 
[7:1] In po tem je Jezus hodil po Galileji; kajti po Judeji ni hotel hoditi, ker so Judje gledali, da bi ga umorili. 
[7:2] Bil je pa blizu praznik Judovski, postavljanje šatorov. 
[7:3] Za to mu rekó bratje njegovi: Odidi odtod, in pojdi v Jeruzalem, da bodo videli tudi učenci tvoji deja tvoja, ktera delaš. 
[7:4] Kajti kdor hoče imeniten biti, ne dela nobeden nič na skrivnem. Če takošne reči delaš, pokaži se svetu. 
[7:5] Kajti tudi bratje njegovi niso verovali va-nj. 
[7:6] Pa jim Jezus reče: Moj čas še ni prišel; vaš čas je pa vsegdar gotov. 
[7:7] Vas ne more svet sovražiti: mene pa sovraži, ker jaz pričam za-nj, da so dela njegova hudobna. 
[7:8] Vi pojdite na ta praznik; jaz še ne pojdem na ta praznik, ker se čas moj še ni izpolnil. 
[7:9] In ko jim je to povedal, ostal je v Galileji. 
[7:10] Ko so pa bratje njegovi odšli, tedaj odide tudi on na praznik, ne očitno, nego kakor skrivaj. 
[7:11] Judje so ga torej na praznik iskali, in govorili so: Kje je on? 
[7:12] In bil je za-nj velik prepir med ljudstvom. Kajti nekteri so pravili: Dober je; drugi so pa govorili: Ne! nego ljudstvo slepari. 
[7:13] Vendar pa ni nihče očitno za-nj govoril, za voljo strahú Judovskega. 
[7:14] Ali uže o polovici praznika izide Jezus v tempelj, ter je učil. 
[7:15] In čudili so se Judje, govoreč: Kako ta pismo ume, ko se ni učil? 
[7:16] Odgovorí jim Jezus in reče: Moj nauk ni moj, nego tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[7:17] Če kdo hoče njegovo voljo izpolnjevati, razpoznal bo, je li ta nauk od Boga, ali jaz sam od sebe govorim. 
[7:18] Kdor govorí sam od sebe, išče lastne slave; kdor pa išče slave tega, kdor ga je poslal, ta je resničen, in nepravičnosti ni v njem. 
[7:19] Vam li ni Mojzes dal postave, in nihče od vas ne izpolnjuje postave? Za kaj me gledate umoriti? 
[7:20] Ljudstvo odgovorí in reče: Hudiča imaš; kdo te gleda umoriti? 
[7:21] Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Eno delo sem storil, in vsi se čudite. 
[7:22] In vendar vam je Mojzes dal obrezo, (ne da bi od Mojzesa bilo, nego od očakov), in v soboto obrezujete človeka, 
[7:23] Če sprejme človek obrezo v soboto, da se postava Mojzesova ne prelomi: nad menoj pa se hudujete, da sem vsega človeka uzdravil v soboto? 
[7:24] Ne sodíte po licu, nego pravično sodbo sodite. 
[7:25] Tedaj so nekteri od Jeruzalemcev govorili: Ali ni ta tisti, kterega gledajo umoriti? 
[7:26] In glej, očitno govorí, in nič mu ne rekó. Ali so mar starešine spoznali, da je ta res Kristus? 
[7:27] To da za tega vémo, odkod je; Kristus pa, kedar pride, ne bo nihče vedel, odkod je. 
[7:28] Pa zavpije Jezus, učeč v tempeljnu, in reče: In mene poznate, in véste, odkod sem; in sam od sebe nisem prišel: je pa resničen, kteri me je poslal, kogar vi ne poznate. 
[7:29] A jaz ga poznam, ker sem od njega, in on me je poslal. 
[7:30] In gledali so, da bi ga zgrabili, ali nihče ni položil na-nj roke, ker čas njegov še ni bil prišel. 
[7:31] Veliko izmed ljudstva pa jih je verovalo va-nj, in govorili so: Kristus, kedar pride, bode li več čudežev storil, nego jih je ta storil? 
[7:32] Farizeji zaslišijo, da se ljudstvo to za-nj pogovarja; in poslali so Farizeji in véliki duhovni hlapce, naj ga vjemó. 
[7:33] Reče jim torej Jezus: Še malo časa sem z vami, pa pojdem k temu, kteri me je poslal. 
[7:34] Iskali me boste, in ne boste me našli: in kjer sem jaz, tje vi ne morete priti. 
[7:35] Pa rekó Judje med seboj: Kam pojde ta, da ga mi ne bomo našli? Ali pojde med razkropljene Grke, in bo učil Grke? 
[7:36] Kakošna je ta beseda, ktero je rekel: Iskali me boste, in ne boste me našli; in kjer sem jaz, tje vi ne morete priti? 
[7:37] A zadnji véliki dan praznika, stal Je Jezus, in vpil je, govoreč: Če je kdo žejen, pride naj k meni in pije. 
[7:38] Kdor veruje v mé, kakor pravi pismo, tekle bodo iz telesa njegovega reke žive vode. 
[7:39] (To je pa rekel za Duha, ki so ga imeli prejeti tí, kteri so verovali va-nj; kajti svetega Duha še ni bilo, ker Jezus še ni bil oslavljen.) 
[7:40] In veliko izmed ljudstva, ko so slišali besedo, govorilo jih je: Ta je zares prerok. 
[7:41] Drugi so pravili: Ta je Kristus. Drugi so pa govorili: Ali bo Jezus prišel iz Galileje? 
[7:42] Ali ne pravi pismo, da bo Kristus prišel iz semena Davidovega, in iz Betlehema, trga kjer je David bil? 
[7:43] In med ljudstvom nastane razpor za voljo njega. 
[7:44] A nekteri od njih so ga hoteli zgrabiti; pa nihče ni položil na-nj rók. 
[7:45] In hlapci pridejo k vélikim duhovnom in Farizejem; in ti jim rekó: Za kaj ga niste pripeljali? 
[7:46] Hlapci odgovoré: Nikoli noben človek ni tako govoril, kakor ta človek. 
[7:47] Pa jim Farizeji odgovoré: Ali ste tudi vi zapeljani? 
[7:48] Je li kdo izmed starešin veroval va-nj, ali izmed Farizejev? 
[7:49] Nego to ljudstvo, ktero zakona ne zná: prekleti so! 
[7:50] Reče jim Nikodem, kteri je bil po noči prišel k njemu, in je bil eden od njih: 
[7:51] Ali postava naša sodi človeka, če se poprej ne sliši od njega, in zvé, kaj je storil? 
[7:52] Odgovoré in rekó mu: Nisi li tudi ti iz Galileje? Preglej in védi, da prerok iz Galileje ni vstal. 
[7:53] Ter odidejo vsak na svoj dom. 
[8:1] Jezus je pa odšel na Oljsko goro. 
[8:2] A zjutraj pride zopet v tempelj, in vse ljudstvo je šlo k njemu; ter sede in je učil. 
[8:3] Pripeljejo pa pismarji in Farizeji k njemu ženo, v prešestvu zasačeno, in postavivši jo na sredo, 
[8:4] Rekó mu: Učenik, ta žena je ravnokar v prešestvu zasačena; 
[8:5] Mojzes nam je pa v postavi zapovedal, naj takošne kamenjujemo. Ti pa kaj praviš? 
[8:6] To so pa govorili, izkušajoč ga, da bi ga mogli zatožiti. A Jezus, sklonivši se dol, pisal je s prstom svojim po tléh. 
[8:7] Ko so ga pa le še vpraševali, skloni se kvišku, in reče jim: Kdor je med vami brez greha, naj prvi vrže kamen na njo. 
[8:8] In zopet se skloni dol, in pisal je po tléh. 
[8:9] Oni pa, ko so to slišali, in jih je vest tožila, odhajali so eden za drugim, počenši od starešin noter do zadnjih; in Jezus je ostal sam, in žena, stoječ na sredi. 
[8:10] Jezus pa, ko se po konci skloni, in razen žene nikogar ne vidi, reče jej: Žena, kje so tisti tožniki tvoji? ali te ni nobeden obsodil? 
[8:11] Ona pa reče: Nobeden, Gospod! A Jezus jej reče: Tudi jaz te ne bom obsodil; pojdi in ne gréši več. 
[8:12] In Jezus jim zopet reče, govoreč: Jaz sem luč sveta; kdor gre za menoj, ne bo hodil po temi, nego imel bo luč življenja. 
[8:13] Pa mu rekó Farizeji: Ti sam za-se pričuješ; pričanje tvoje ni resnično. 
[8:14] Jezus odgovorí in jim reče: Če tudi jaz sam za-se pričam, pričanje moje je resnično: ker vém, odkod sem prišel, in kam grem: vi pa ne véste, odkod sem prišel, in kam grem, 
[8:15] Vi po telesu sodite; jaz ne sodim nikogar. 
[8:16] Pa če jaz tudi sodim, sodba moja je resnična; ker nisem sam, nego jaz in oče, kteri me je poslal. 
[8:17] Pisano pa je tudi v zakonu vašem, da je dveh človekov pričanje resnično. 
[8:18] Jaz sem, kteri sam za-se pričam, in oče priča za-me, kteri me je poslal. 
[8:19] Tedaj so mu pravili: Kje je oče tvoj? Jezus odgovorí: Ne mene ne poznate, ne očeta mojega; ko bi mene poznali, poznali bi tudi očeta mojega. 
[8:20] Te besede je povedal Jezus pri zakladnici, učeč v tempeljnu; in nihče ga ni zgrabil, ker čas njegov še ni bil prišel. 
[8:21] In Jezus jim zopet reče: Jaz grem, in iskali me boste, in v grehu svojem boste pomrli. Kamor jaz grem, vi ne morete priti. 
[8:22] Govorili so torej Judje: Ali se bo sam umoril, ko pravi: Kamor jaz grem, vi ne morete priti? 
[8:23] Pa jim reče: Vi ste od zdolej, jaz sem od zgorej; vi ste s tega sveta, jaz nisem s tega sveta. 
[8:24] Rekel sem vam pa, da boste pomrli v grehih svojih: če namreč ne boste verovali, da sem jaz, pomrli boste v grehih svojih. 
[8:25] Rekó mu torej: Kdo si ti? In reče jim Jezus: To, kar vam od začetka pravim. 
[8:26] Veliko imam o vas govoriti, in soditi; ali kteri me je poslal, ta je resničen; in jaz govorim to, kar sem od njega slišal. 
[8:27] Niso pa razpoznali, da jim je govoril za očeta. 
[8:28] Za to jim Jezus reče: Kedar boste sina človečjega povišali, tedaj boste razpoznali, da sem jaz, in da sam od sebe ničesar ne delam, nego kakor me je naučil oče moj, to govorim. 
[8:29] In kteri me je poslal, ta je z menoj; ni me pustil oče samega, ker jaz to, kar je njemu po godi, vsegdar delam. 
[8:30] Ko je to govoril, verovalo jih je veliko va-nj. 
[8:31] In govoril je Jezus tistim Judom, kteri so mu verovali: Če vi ostanete v besedi mojej, boste zares učenci moji; 
[8:32] In razpoznali boste resnico, in resnica vas bo osvobodila. 
[8:33] Odgovoré mu: Seme Abrahamovo smo, in služili nismo nikoli nobenemu; kako govoriš ti: Svobodni boste postali? 
[8:34] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Resnično resnično vam pravim, da vsak, kdor dela greh, suženj je grehu. 
[8:35] Suženj pa ne ostane v hiši vekomaj; sin ostane vekomaj. 
[8:36] Če vas torej sin osvobodí, boste res svobodni. 
[8:37] Vém, da ste seme Abrahamovo; ali gledate me umoriti, ker moja beseda nima mesta v vas. 
[8:38] Jaz govorim, kar sem videl od očeta svojega: in vi delate, kar ste od svojega očeta videli. 
[8:39] Odgovoré in rekó mu: Oče naš je Abraham. Reče jim Jezus: Ko bi bili sinovi Abrahamovi, delali bi dela Abrahamova. 
[8:40] Sedaj pa gledate mene umoriti, človeka, kteri sem vam resnico povedal, ktero sem slišal od Boga; tega Abraham ni storil. 
[8:41] Vi delate dela svojega očeta. Pa mu rekó: Ali nismo iz kurbarije rojeni! enega očeta imamo, Boga. 
[8:42] Jezus jim pa reče: Ko bi bil Bog vaš oče, ljubili bi me; kajti jaz sem od Boga izšel in prišel: ker tudi nisem sam od sebe prišel, nego on me je poslal. 
[8:43] Za kaj mojega govora ne umete? Ker ne morete moje besede poslušati. 
[8:44] Vi ste od očeta hudiča, in slasti očeta svojega hočete delati. On je bil ubijalec ljudî od začetka, in na resnici ne stojí: ker resnice ni v njem. Kedar govorí laž, govorí od svojega, ker je lažnik in oče laží. 
[8:45] Jaz pa, ker resnico govorim, ne verujete mi. 
[8:46] Kdo izmed vas me dolží greha? Če pa resnico govorim, za kaj mi vi ne verujete? 
[8:47] Kdor je od Boga, besedo Božjo posluša; za to vi ne poslušate, ker niste od Boga. 
[8:48] Judje pa odgovoré in mu rekó: Ali ne pravimo mi prav, da si ti Samarijan, in imaš hudiča? 
[8:49] Jezus odgovorí: Jaz nimam hudiča, nego spoštujem očeta svojega; a vi me zasramujete. 
[8:50] Pa jaz ne iščem svoji slave; je, kteri je išče in sode 
[8:51] Resnično resnično vam pravim: če kdo mojo besedo ohrani, ne bo videl smrti vekomaj. 
[8:52] Rekó mu torej Judje: Sedaj smo razpoznali, da hudiča imaš; Abraham je umrl in preroki, a ti praviš: Če kdo mojo besedo ohrani, ne bo okusil smrti vekomaj. 
[8:53] Kaj si ne mara ti veči od našega očeta Abrahama, kteri je umrl? Tudi preroki so pomrli: koga se ti sam delaš? 
[8:54] Jezus odgovorí: Če se jaz sam slavim, slava moja ni nič; oče moj je, kteri me slavi, za kogar vi pravite, da je vaš Bog. 
[8:55] In ne poznate ga, a jaz ga poznam; in ko bi rekel, da ga ne poznam, enak bi bil vam, lažnjivec: ali poznam ga, in besedo njegovo izpolnjujem. 
[8:56] Abraham, oče vaš, oveselil se je, da bo videl moj dan; in videl je, in radoval se je. 
[8:57] Rekó mu torej Judje: Petdeset let še nimaš, in videl si Abrahama? 
[8:58] Reče jim Jezus: Resnično resnično vam pravim: Jaz sem, predno se je Abraham rodil. 
[8:59] Tedaj zgrabijo kamenje, da bi vrgli na-nj; ali Jezus se skrije, in prejde po sredi njih, in izide iz tempeljna: in tako je odšel. 
[9:1] In gredoč mimo, ugleda človeka, kteri je bil slep od rojstva. 
[9:2] In vprašajo ga učenci njegovi, govoreč: Rabi, kdo je grešil, ta ali roditelji njegovi, da se je slep rodil? 
[9:3] Jezus odgovorí: Ne ta ni grešil, ne roditelji njegovi; nego da se razodenejo dela Božja na njem. 
[9:4] Jaz moram delati dela tega, kteri me je poslal, dokler je dan; prišla bo noč, ko ne bo nihče mogel delati. 
[9:5] Dokler sem na svetu, luč sem svetu. 
[9:6] Rekši to, pljune na zemljo, in napravi blato od sline, in pomaže z blatom slepcu očí. 
[9:7] In reče mu: Pojdi, umij se v kopeli Siloamskej (kar se tolmači: Poslan). Ter odide in se umije, in vrne se videč. 
[9:8] A sosedje, in kteri so ga bili poprej videli, da je slep, govorili so: Ali ni ta tisti, ki je sedel in prosil? 
[9:9] Nekteri so pravili: On je; drugi pa: Podoben mu je. On je pravil: Jaz sem. 
[9:10] Rekó mu torej: Kako so ti se odprle očí? 
[9:11] On odgovorí in reče: Človek, ki se imenuje Jezus, napravil je blato, in pomazal mi je očí, in rekel mi je: Pojdi v kopel Siloamsko, in umij se. In ko sem odšel, in sem se umil, spregledal sem. 
[9:12] Pa mu rekó: Kje je on? Reče: Ne vém. 
[9:13] Peljejo ga k Farizejem, tega, ki je nekedaj slep bil. 
[9:14] Bila je pa sobota, ko je Jezus blato napravil in mu odprl oči. 
[9:15] In vpraševali so ga zopet tudi Farizeji, kako je spregledal. On jim pa reče: Blato mi je del na oči, in umil sem se, ter vidim. 
[9:16] Tedaj so nekteri od Farizejev govorili: Ta človek ni od Boga, ko sobote ne sveti. Drugi so govorili: Kako more grešen človek takošne čudeže delati? In bil je razpor med njimi. 
[9:17] Zopet rekó slepcu: Kaj ti praviš za-nj, da ti je odprl očí? On pa reče: Da je prerok. 
[9:18] Judje pa niso verovali za-nj, da je slep bil in je spregledal, dokler niso roditeljev tega, ki je spregledal, poklicali, 
[9:19] In jih vprašali, govoreč: Je li ta sin vaš, za kogar pravite, da se je slep rodil? Kako pa sedaj vidi? 
[9:20] Odgovoré jim roditelji njegovi in rekó: Vémo, da je ta sin naš, in da se je slep rodil; 
[9:21] Kako pa sedaj vidi, ne vemo; ali kdo mu je oči odprl, mi ne vemo. On ima leta; njega vprašajte, on bo sam govoril za-se. 
[9:22] To so rekli roditelji njegovi za to, ker so se bali Judov; kajti Judje so se bili uže dogovorili, da bodo vsakega, kdor ga bo pripoznal za Kristusa, izpahnili iz shajališča. 
[9:23] Za to so roditelji njegovi rekli: Saj ima leta; njega vprašajte. 
[9:24] Tedaj drugoč pokličejo človeka, kteri je slep bil, in rekó mu: Daj Bogu hvalo; in vémo, da je ta človek grešnik. 
[9:25] On pa odgovorí in reče: Če je grešnik, ne vém; samo vém, da sem slep bil, in sedaj vidim. 
[9:26] Rekó mu torej zopet: Kaj ti je storil? Kako ti je odprl očí? 
[9:27] Odgovorí jim: Povedal sem vam uže, in niste slišali; kaj hočete zopet slišati? Ali hočete tudi vi njegovi učenci postati? 
[9:28] Oni pa ga opsujejo, in rekó: Ti si njegov učenec; mi smo Mojzesovi učenci. 
[9:29] Mi vémo, da je z Mojzesom govoril Bog; za tega pa ne vémo, odkod je. 
[9:30] Človek odgovorí in jim reče: To je pač res čudno, da vi ne véste, odkod je, in odprl mi je očí. 
[9:31] Vémo pa, da grešnikov Bog ne posluša; nego če kdo spoštuje Boga, in voljo njegovo izpolnjuje, tega posluša. 
[9:32] Od vekomaj se ni slišalo, da bi bil kdo od rojstva slepemu očí odprl. 
[9:33] Ko ta ne bi bil od Boga, ne bi mogel ničesar storiti. 
[9:34] Odgovoré in rekó mu: Ves v grehih si se rodil, pa boš ti nas učil? In izženó ga ven. 
[9:35] Jezus zasliši, da so ga izgnali ven; in ko ga najde, reče mu: Veruješ li v sina Božjega? 
[9:36] On odgovorí in reče: Kdo je, gospod, da bom veroval va-nj? 
[9:37] Jezus mu pa reče: In videl si ga, in kteri s teboj govori, ta je. 
[9:38] On pa reče: Verujem, gospod! In pokloni mu se. 
[9:39] In Jezus reče: Jaz sem prišel na sodbo na ta svet, da kteri ne vidijo, spregledajo, in kteri vidijo, oslepé. 
[9:40] In slišali so to nekteri izmed Farizejev, kteri so bili ž njim, in rekó mu: Ali smo tudi mi slepi? 
[9:41] Reče jim Jezus: Ko bi bili slepi, ne bi imeli greha; sedaj pa pravite: Vidimo; za to greh vaš ostane. 
[10:1] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Kdor ne vhaja skozi vrata v ovčji hlev, nego prelazi drugod, ta je tat in razbojnik. 
[10:2] Kdor pa vhaja skozi vrata, ta je pastir ovâc. 
[10:3] Temu vratar odpira, in ovce glas njegov poslušajo, in svoje ovce kliče po imenu, in izganja jih. 
[10:4] In ko ovce svoje izžene, gre pred njimi; in ovce gredó za njim, ker poznajo glas njegov; 
[10:5] A za tujcem ne gredó, nego odbežé od njega: ker ne poznajo tujega glasu. 
[10:6] To priliko jim je Jezus povedal; ali oni niso razumeli, kaj bi to bilo, kar jim je pravil. 
[10:7] Tedaj jim Jezus zopet reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim, da sem jaz vrata ovcam. 
[10:8] Vsi, kolikorkoli jih je prišlo pred menoj, tatjé so in razbojniki: ali ovce jih niso poslušale. 
[10:9] Jaz sem vrata; skozi mene če kdo vnide, zveličal se bo, in pojde noter in izšel bo, in našel bo pašo. 
[10:10] Tat ne vnide, razen da ukrade in ubije in pogubí: jaz sem prišel, da bi življenje imeli, in obilno imeli. 
[10:11] Jaz sem dober pastir; dober pastir poklada dušo svojo za ovce. 
[10:12] Najemnik pa, in kdor ni pastir, komur niso ovce lastne, vidi volka, da gre, pa popustí ovce, in odbeží: in volk jih razgrabi, in razpodí ovce. 
[10:13] Najemnik pa odbeží, ker je najemnik, in ne mara za ovce. 
[10:14] Jaz sem dober pastir; in poznam svoje, in moje poznajo mene: 
[10:15] Kakor oče mene pozná, in jaz očeta poznam. In dušo svojo pokladam za ovce. 
[10:16] Tudi drugih ovâc imam, ktere niso iz tega hleva; tudi té moram pripeljati, in poslušale bodo glas moj: in ena čreda bo, eden pastir. 
[10:17] Za to me oče ljubi, ker jaz dušo svojo pokladam, da jo zopet vzemem. 
[10:18] Nihče je ne jemlje od mene, nego sam od sebe jo pokladam. Oblast imam, da položim; in oblast imam, da jo zopet vzemem. To zapoved sem prejel od očeta svojega. 
[10:19] In med Judi nastane zopet razpor za voljo teh besed. 
[10:20] Govorilo pa jih je veliko od njih: Hudiča ima in neumen je: kaj ga poslušate? 
[10:21] Drugi so pravili: Kdor ima hudiča, ne govorí tako; ali more hudič slepcem odpirati oči? 
[10:22] Bil je pa praznik obnovljenja v Jeruzalemu, in bila je zima. 
[10:23] In sprehajal se je Jezus po lopi Solomonovej. 
[10:24] In obstopijo ga Judje, in govorili so mu: Doklej nas v nevednosti pustiš? Če si ti Kristus, povej nam na ravnost. 
[10:25] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Povedal sem vam, pa ne verujete. Dela, ktera jaz delam v ime očeta svojega, ta pričajo za-me. 
[10:26] To da vi ne verujete, ker niste od mojih ovâc, kakor sem vam povedal. 
[10:27] Moje ovce poslušajo glas moj, in jaz jih poznam; in za menoj gredó, 
[10:28] In jaz jim bom dal večno življenje; in na vekomaj ne bodo poginile, in nihče jih ne bo iztrgal iz moje roke. 
[10:29] Oče moj, kteri mih jih je dal, veči je od vseh, in nihče jih ne more iztrgati iz roke očeta mojega. 
[10:30] Jaz in oče sva eno. 
[10:31] In zopet zgrabijo Judje kamenje, da bi ga kamenjali. 
[10:32] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Veliko dobrih del sem vam pokazal od očeta svojega; za ktero od teh del me boste kamenjali? 
[10:33] Odgovoré mu Judjé, govoreč: Za dobro delo te ne bomo kamenjali, nego za kletvino, in ker se ti, ki si človek, delaš Boga. 
[10:34] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Ni li pisano v zakonu vašem: "Jaz sem rekel: bogovi ste?" 
[10:35] Če je tiste imenoval bogove, kterim je beseda Božja bila (in pismo se ne more razvezati,): 
[10:36] Kaj meni pa, ki me je oče posvetil in na svet poslal, pravite vi: Preklinjaš! ker sem rekel: Sin Božji sem? 
[10:37] Če ne delam del očeta svojega, ne verujete mi; 
[10:38] Če pa delam, če tudi meni ne verujete, verujte delom: da razpoznate in boste verovali, da je oče v meni, in jaz v njem. 
[10:39] In zopet so ga gledali prijeti; ali izmakne jim se iz rók. 
[10:40] In odide zopet na oni kraj Jordana, na kraj, kjer je poprej Janez bil, ko je krstil; in ostane tu. 
[10:41] In veliko jih pride k njemu; in pravili so: Janez res ni nobenega čudeža storil; ali karkoli je Janez povedal za tega, bilo je vse resnično. 
[10:42] In veliko jih je tu verovalo va-nj. 
[11:1] Bil je pa en bolnik, Lazar iz Betanije, iz vasí Marije in Marte sestre njene, 
[11:2] (A Marija, ktere brat Lazar je bolan bil, bila je ta, ki je pomazilila Gospoda z miro, in otrla noge njegove z lasmí svojimi.) 
[11:3] Sestri torej pošljete k njemu, govoreč: Gospod, glej, kogar ljubiš, bolan je. 
[11:4] Ko pa Jezus sliši, reče: Ta bolezen ni na smrt, nego na slavo Božjo, da se sin Božji po njej oslavi. 
[11:5] Jezus je pa Marto in sestro njeno in Lazarja ljubil. 
[11:6] Ko je torej slišal, da je bolan, tedaj je ostal dva dní na tistem mestu, kjer je bil. 
[11:7] Po tem pa reče učencem svojim: Pojdimo zopet v Judejo. 
[11:8] Učenci mu rekó: Rabi, ravnokar so te Judje hoteli kamenjati, pa greš zopet tje? 
[11:9] Jezus odgovorí; Nima li dan dvanajst ur? Če kdo po dnevu hodi, ne spotiče se, ker vidi luč tega sveta. 
[11:10] Če pa kdo po noči hodi, spotiče se, ker ni luči v njem. 
[11:11] To je povedal, in po tem reče: Lazar prijatelj naš je zaspal; pa grem, da ga zbudim. 
[11:12] Rekó mu tedaj učenci njegovi: Gospod, če je zaspal, ozdravel bo. 
[11:13] Rekel je pa Jezus za smrt njegovo; a oni so mislili, da pravi za spanje sna. 
[11:14] Tedaj jim Jezus razločno pové: Lazar je umrl. 
[11:15] In radujem se za voljo vas, da nisem tam bil, da boste verovali; pa pojdimo k njemu. 
[11:16] Tedaj reče Tomaž, (ki se imenuje Dvojček,) součencem: Pojdimo še mi, da umremo ž njim. 
[11:17] Ko pa pride Jezus, najde ga, da je uže štiri dní v grobu 
[11:18] (Bila je pa Betanija blizu Jeruzalema, kakih petnajst bežajev.) 
[11:19] In veliko izmed Judov jih je bilo prišlo k Marti in Mariji, da bi ji tolažili po njunem bratu. 
[11:20] Ko pa Marta zasliši, da Jezus gre, odide mu naproti; a Marija je domá sedela. 
[11:21] Marta tedaj reče Jezusu: Gospod, ko bi bil tu bil, brat moj ne bi bil umrl. 
[11:22] Pa tudi sedaj vém, da karkoli boš od Boga prosil, da ti bo dal Bog. 
[11:23] Reče jej Jezus: Vstal bo brat tvoj. 
[11:24] Marta mu reče: Vém, da bo vstal, o vstajanji poslednji dan. 
[11:25] Reče jej Jezus: Jaz sem vstajanje in življenje; kdor v mene veruje, živel bo, če tudi umre. 
[11:26] In vsak, kdor živí in veruje v mé, ne bo umrl vekomaj. Veruješ li to? 
[11:27] Reče mu: Dà, Gospod! jaz verujem, da si ti Kristus, sin Božji, ki je imel na svet priti. 
[11:28] In rekši to, odide, in pokliče skrivaj Marijo sestro svojo, govoreč: Učenik je tu in te kliče. 
[11:29] Ona, ko zasliši, hitro vstane in odide k njemu. 
[11:30] (Ni pa še Jezus prišel v vas: nego bil je na mestu, kjer ga je bila Marta srečala.) 
[11:31] Ko so pa Judje, kteri so bili ž njo v hiši in so jo tolažili, videli, da je Marija hitro vstala in izšla, odidejo za njo, govoreč: Na grob gre, da bo tam jokala. 
[11:32] Marija pa, ko pride tje, kjer je Jezus bil, in ga ugleda, pade mu pred noge, govoreč mu: Gospod, ko bi bil tu bil, brat moj ne bi bil umrl. 
[11:33] Jezus pa, ko jo vidi, da joka, in Jude, kteri so bili ž njo prišli, da jokajo, zgrozí se v duhu, in postane sam žalosten, 
[11:34] In reče: Kam ste ga položili? Rekó mu: Gospod, pridi in poglej! 
[11:35] Jezus se zajoka. 
[11:36] Judje so tedaj govorili: Glej, kako ga je ljubil! 
[11:37] A nekteri od njih rekó: Ali ni mogel ta, ki je slepemu oči odprl, storiti, da tudi ta ne bi bil umrl? 
[11:38] In Jezus se zopet zgrozí v sebi, in pride na grob. Bila je pa jama, in kamen je ležal na njej. 
[11:39] Jezus velí: Vzdignite kamen! Reče mu sestra ranjkega, Marta: Gospod, uže smrdí; kajti štiri dnî je v grobu. 
[11:40] Velí jej Jezus: Ali ti nisem rekel, da če boš verovala, videla boš slavo Božjo? 
[11:41] Tedaj vzdignejo kamen, kjer je mrtvi ležal. A Jezus povzdigne oči kvišku, in reče: Oče, zahvaljujem ti, da si me uslišal. 
[11:42] Pa jaz sem vedel, da me vsegdar poslušaš; ali rekel sem za voljo ljudstva, ktero okoli stojí, da bodo verovali, da si me ti poslal. 
[11:43] In ko je to rekel, zakliče z močnim glasom: Lazar, pojdi ven! 
[11:44] In mrtvi izide, povezan na nogah in rokah s povoji, in obraz njegov je bil obezan s prtom. Velí jim Jezus: Razvežite ga, in pustite, naj odide. 
[11:45] In od Judov, kteri so bili prišli k Mariji, in so videli, kaj je Jezus storil, verovalo jih je veliko va-nj. 
[11:46] A nekteri od njih odidejo k Farizejem, in povedó jim, kaj je Jezus storil. 
[11:47] In véliki duhovni in Farizeji zberó zbor, in govorili so: Kaj bomo storili? kajti ta človek dela velike čudeže. 
[11:48] Če ga tako pustimo, verovali bodo vsi va-nj; in prišli bodo Rimljani, in vzeli nam bodo zemljo in narod. 
[11:49] A eden od njih, neki Kajfa, kteri je bil tisto leto véliki duhoven, reče jim: Vi nič ne véste; 
[11:50] In tudi ne mislite, da nam je bolje, da eden človek umre za ljudstvo, nego da bi ves narod poginil. 
[11:51] Tega pa ni rekel sam od sebe; temveč ker je bil tisto leto véliki duhoven, prerokoval je, da mora Jezus za ves narod umreti; 
[11:52] In ne samo za narod, nego da tudi razkropljene otroke Božje zbere v eno čredo. 
[11:53] Od tega dné torej so sklenili, da ga bodo umorili. 
[11:54] Jezus pa ni več očitno hodil med Judi, nego odšel je odtod v kraj blizu puščave, v mesto, ktero so imenuje Efraim, in tu je prebival z učenci svojimi. 
[11:55] Bila je pa blizu Velika noč Judovska; in veliko iz tega kraja jih pride v Jeruzalem pred Veliko nočjó, da se očistijo. 
[11:56] In iskali so Jezusa, in pogovarjali so se med seboj, stoječ v tempeljnu: Kaj vam se zdí, da ne pride na praznik? 
[11:57] Dali so bili pa véliki duhovni in Farizeji zapoved, da če kdo zvé, kje da je, naj pové, da ga zgrabijo. 
[12:1] Šest dnî pred Veliko nočjó pa pride Jezus v Betanijo, kjer je Lazar bil, kteri je bil umrl, in ga je obudil iz mrtvih. 
[12:2] In napravijo mu tu pojedinjo, in Marta je stregla; a Lazar je bil eden od teh, kteri so ž njim sedeli za mizo. 
[12:3] Marija pa, vzemši funt prave dragocene nardove mire, pomazili noge Jezusove, in otre mu z lasmí svojimi noge; in hiša se napolni vonja od mire. 
[12:4] Tedaj reče eden od učencev njegovih, Juda Simonov Iškarijan, kteri ga je imel izdati: 
[12:5] Za kaj se ni prodala ta mira za tri sto grošev, in dala ubogim? 
[12:6] Rekel je pa to, ne da bi mu bilo skrb za uboge, nego ker je tat bil, in imel je mošnjo, in nosil je, kar se je metalo va-njo. 
[12:7] Jezus pa mu reče: Pusti jo; za dan pogreba mojega je to prihranila. 
[12:8] Kajti uboge imate vsegdar s seboj, a mene nimate vsegdar. 
[12:9] Zvedelo je pa veliko ljudstva izmed Judov, da je tu; ter pridejo ne samo za voljo Jezusa, nego da bi tudi Lazarja videli, kterega je bil obudil iz mrtvih. 
[12:10] Véliki duhovni pa se posvetujejo, da bi tudi Lazarja umorili; 
[12:11] Ker jih je za voljo njega veliko izmed Judov odhajalo, in verovali so v Jezusa. 
[12:12] Drugi dan pa veliko ljudstva, ktero je bilo prišlo na praznik, slišavši, da gre Jezus v Jeruzalem, 
[12:13] Vzemó palmove veje, in izidejo mu naproti, in vpili so: Hosana! Blagoslovljen, kteri gre v imenu Gospodovem, kralj Izraelov! 
[12:14] In Jezus najde osliča, in usede se na-nj, kakor je pisano: 
[12:15] "Ne boj se, hči Sionska! glej, kralj tvoj gre, sedeč na žrebetu oslice." 
[12:16] Tega pa učenci njegovi poprej niso razumeli; nego ko se je Jezus oslavil, tedaj so se spomenili, da je bilo to za njega pisano, in da so mu to storili. 
[12:17] A ljudstvo je pričevalo, ktero je bilo ž njim, ko je Lazarja poklical iz groba, in ga obudil iz mrtvih. 
[12:18] Za to mu je tudi ljudstvo naproti prišlo, ker je slišalo, da je ta čudež storil. 
[12:19] Farizeji tedaj rekó med seboj: Vidite, da nič ne opravite! Glej, svet je odšel za njim. 
[12:20] Bili so pa med tistimi, ki so dohajali, da bi molili na praznik, nekteri Grki. 
[12:21] Ti torej pristopijo k Filipu, ki je bil iz Betsajde Galilejske, in prosili so ga, govoreč: Gospod, Jezusa bi radi videli. 
[12:22] Filip pride, in pové Andreju; in Andrej in Filip povesta Jezusu. 
[12:23] Jezus pa jima odgovorí, govoreč: Prišel je čas, da se sin človečji oslavi. 
[12:24] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Zrno pšenično, če pade na zemljo in ne umrè, ono bo samo ostalo; če pa umrè, obrodí veliko sadú. 
[12:25] Kdor dušo svojo ljubi, izgubil jo bo; a kdor dušo svojo sovraži, ohranil jo bo za večno življenje. 
[12:26] Če kdo meni služi, naj gre za menoj; in kjer bom jaz, tam bo tudi služabnik moj: in če kdo meni služi, njega bo oče ljubil. 
[12:27] Sedaj je duša moja žalostna; in kaj hočem reči? Oče, reši me te ure! Pa za to sem prišel na to uro. 
[12:28] Oče, oslavi ime svoje: In glas se oglasi z neba: Oslavil sem ga, in zopet ga bom oslavil. 
[12:29] Ljudstvo torej, ktero je stalo in je slišalo, pravilo je, da je zagrmelo. Drugi so pravili: Angelj mu je govoril. 
[12:30] Jezus odgovorí in reče: Ta glas se ni oglasil za voljo mene, nego za voljo vas. 
[12:31] Sedaj je sodba tega sveta; sedaj bo vojvoda tega sveta izgnan ven. 
[12:32] In jaz, kedar bom povišan od zemlje, potegnil bom vse k sebi. 
[12:33] (To je pa pravil, da je na znanje dal, s kakošno smrtjo bo umrl.) 
[12:34] Odgovorí mu ljudstvo: Mi smo slišali iz zakona, da bo Kristus ostal vekomaj; in kako praviš ti: Sin človečji mora biti povišan? Kdo je ta sin človečji? 
[12:35] Reče jim torej Jezus: Še malo časa je luč z vami. Hodite, dokler imate luč, da vas ne objeme tema; in kdor po temi hodi, ne vé, kam gre. 
[12:36] Dokler luč imate, verujte v luč, da boste sinovi luči. To je Jezus povedal, in odšel je, in skril se je od njih. 
[12:37] In da si ravno je toliko čudežev storil pred njimi, niso verovali va-nj; 
[12:38] Da se izpolni beseda Izaija preroka, ktero je rekel: "Gospod, kdo je veroval našej besedi! In roka Gospodova komu se je razodela?" 
[12:39] Verovati pa za to niso mogli, ker je zopet rekel Izaija: 
[12:40] "Oslepil jim je očí, in okamenil jim je srce: da ne bi z očmí videli, in s srcem umeli in se spreobrnili, in bi jih uzdravil." 
[12:41] To je rekel Izaija, ko je videl slavo njegovo, in je govoril o njem. 
[12:42] Vendar jih je pa tudi veliko izmed knezov verovalo vanj; pa za voljo Farizejev niso priznavali, da ne bi bili izpahnjeni iz shajališč: 
[12:43] Kajti ljubili so slavo človeško bolj, nego slavo Božjo. 
[12:44] Jezus pa zavpije in reče: Kdor veruje v mé, ne veruje v mé, nego v tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[12:45] In kdor mene vidi, vidi tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[12:46] Jaz sem prišel luč na svet, da vsak, kdor veruje v mé, ne ostane v temi. 
[12:47] In če kdo moje besede sliši, in ne veruje, jaz ga ne bom sodil; ker nisem prišel, da bi svet sodil, nego da svet zveličam. 
[12:48] Kdor se mene odreka, in besed mojih ne sprejema, ima ga, kteri ga bo sodil: beseda, ktero sem govoril, ona ga bo sodila poslednji dan. 
[12:49] Kajti jaz nisem sam od sebe govoril; nego oče, kteri me je poslal, on mi je zapoved dal, kaj da naj povém in kaj naj govorim. 
[12:50] In vém, da je zapoved njegova večno življenje. Kar torej jaz govorim, govorim tako, kakor mi je oče povedal. 
[13:1] Pred praznikom velikonočnim pa, ko je vedel Jezus, da je njegov čas prišel, da prejde s tega sveta k očetu: ker je ljubil svoje, kteri so bili na svetu, ljubil jih je do konca. 
[13:2] In po večerji, (ko je bil uže hudič Judu Simonovemu Iškarijanu položil v srce, naj ga izdá,) 
[13:3] Vedoč Jezus, da mu je dal oče vse v roke, in da je od Boga izšel in k Bogu gre, 
[13:4] Vstane od večerje, in sleče oblačilo, in vzeme opasnik, ter se opaše. 
[13:5] Po tem vlije v umivalnico vode, in začne umivati učencem noge, in otirati z opasnikom, s kterim je bil opasan. 
[13:6] Ter pride k Simonu Petru: in on mu reče: Gospod, ti mi boš umival noge? 
[13:7] Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Kar jaz delam, ti sedaj ne véš; ali zvedel boš po tem. 
[13:8] Reče mu Peter: Ne boš mi umival nog, na vekomaj ne! Odgovorí mu Jezus: Če te ne umijem, ne boš imel deleža z menoj. 
[13:9] Reče mu Simon Peter: Gospod, ne samo nog mojih, nego tudi roke in glavo! 
[13:10] Reče mu Jezus: Kdor je umit, ne potrebuje, razen da noge umije, ker je ves čist; in vi ste čisti, ali ne vsi. 
[13:11] Poznal je namreč izdajalca svojega; za to je rekel: Niste vsi čisti. 
[13:12] Ko jim je pa umil noge, in je oblačilo svoje vzel, usede se zopet, in reče jim: Véste li, kaj sem vam storil? 
[13:13] Vi me imenujete: Učenik! in: Gospod! in prav pravite; ker sem. 
[13:14] Če sem pa jaz, Gospod in učenik, umil vam noge, dolžni ste tudi vi eden drugemu umivati noge. 
[13:15] Izgled sem vam dal namreč, da kakor sem jaz storil, tudi vi delajte tako. 
[13:16] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Hlapec ni veči od gospodarja svojega; tudi poslanec ni veči, kakor tisti, kteri je poslal. 
[13:17] Če to véste, blagor vam, če je storite. 
[13:18] Ne pravim za vse vas; jaz vém, ktere sem izvolil: ali da se izpolni pismo: "Ta, ki z menoj kruh jé, vzdignil je peto svojo zoper mé." 
[13:19] Uže sedaj vam pravim, predno se je zgodilo, da kedar se zgodí, verujete, da sam jaz. 
[13:20] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Če koga pošljem, kdor ga sprejme, sprejme mene: kdor pa mene sprejme, sprejme tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[13:21] Ko je Jezus to povedal, postane žalosten v duhu, in zatrdi in reče: Resnično resnično vam pravim, da me bo eden od vas izdal. 
[13:22] Učenci njegovi so se torej pogledovali med seboj, pomišljevaje, za kterega da pravi. 
[13:23] Slonel je pa za mizo eden učencev njegovih na naročji Jezusovem, kterega je Jezus ljubil. 
[13:24] Simon Peter torej namigne temu, da naj vpraša, kdo da bi bil, za kogar pravi. 
[13:25] In on leže Jezusu na prsi, in reče mu: Gospod, kdo je? 
[13:26] Jezus odgovorí: Ta je, komur bom jaz omočivši, grižljaj podal. In omočivši grižljaj, podá Judu Simonovemu Iškarijanu. 
[13:27] In po grižljaji, tedaj vnide va-nj satan. In Jezus mu reče: Kar delaš, stóri hitro. 
[13:28] Tega pa ni razumel nobeden od teh, kteri so sedeli za mizo, čemu mu je rekel. 
[13:29] Nekteri namreč so mislili, ker je Juda mošnjo imel, da mu Jezus pravi: Nakupi, kar nam je treba za praznik; ali, da naj dá kaj ubogim. 
[13:30] In on vzeme mošnjo, in izide; bila je pa noč. 
[13:31] Ko je pa izšel, reče Jezus: Sedaj se je sin človečji oslavil, in Bog se je oslavil v njem. 
[13:32] Če se je Bog oslavil v njem, oslavil bo tudi Bog njega v sebi, in precej ga bo oslavil. 
[13:33] Sinčeki! še malo sem z vami. Iskali me boste, in kakor sem Judom povedal: Kamor jaz grem, vi ne morete priti, pravim sedaj tudi vam. 
[13:34] Novo zapoved vam dajem, da se ljubíte med seboj; kakor sem jaz vas ljubil, da se tudi vi ljubíte med seboj. 
[13:35] V tem vas bodo poznali vsi, da ste moji učenci, če boste imeli ljubezen eden do drugega. 
[13:36] Reče mu Simon Peter: Gospod, kam greš? Odgovorí mu Jezus: Kamor grem, ne moreš sedaj za menoj iti; prišel boš pa pozneje za menoj. 
[13:37] Reče mu Peter: Gospod, za kaj ne morem sedaj za teboj iti? dušo svojo bom položil za-te. 
[13:38] Odgovorí mu Jezus: Dušo svojo boš položil za-me? Resnično resnično ti pravim: Ne bo zapel petelin, dokler me trikat ne zatajiš. 
[14:1] Ne bodi vam srce plašno! Verujte v Boga, in v mé verujte. 
[14:2] V hiši očeta mojega je veliko stanovališč; a če ne, povedal bi vam. Grem vam pripravljat prostora. 
[14:3] In ko odidem in vam prostor pripravim, prišel bom zopet, in vzel vas bom k sebi: da boste tudi vi tam, kjer bom jaz. 
[14:4] In kam jaz grem, véste, tudi pot véste. 
[14:5] Reče mu Tomaž: Gospod, ne vémo, kam greš; in kako moremo vedeti pot? 
[14:6] Reče mu Jezus: Jaz sem pot in resnica in življenje; nihče ne pride k očetu, razen po meni. 
[14:7] Ko bi mene poznali, poznali bi tudi očeta mojega; in odsihmal ga poznate, in videli ste ga. 
[14:8] Reče mu Filip: Gospod! pokaži nam očeta, in dosti nam je. 
[14:9] Reče mu Jezus: Toliko časa sem z vami, in nisi me poznal, Filip? Kdor je mene videl, videl je očeta: in kako praviš ti: Pokaži nam očeta? 
[14:10] Ne veruješ li, da sem jaz v očetu, in oče v meni? Besed, ktere vam jaz pravim, ne govorim sam od sebe; nego oče, kteri v meni prebiva, on dela dela. 
[14:11] Verujte mi, da sem jaz v očetu, in oče v meni; a če ne, verujte mi vsaj za voljo del. 
[14:12] Resnično resnično vam pravim: Kdor veruje v mé, tudi on bo delal dela, ktera jaz delam, in delal bo veča od teh: kajti jaz grem k očetu. 
[14:13] In karkoli boste v ime moje prosili, to bom storil: da se oslavi oče v sinu. 
[14:14] Če boste kaj prosili v ime moje, jaz bom storil. 
[14:15] Če me ljubite, izpolnjujte zapovedi moje. 
[14:16] In jaz bom prosil očeta, in drugega tolažnika vam bo dal, da ostane z vami vekomaj, 
[14:17] Duha resnice, kterega svet ne more prejeti, ker ga ne vidi, in ga tudi ne pozna; vi ga pa poznate, ker v vas prebiva, in v vas bo. 
[14:18] Ne bom vas pustil sirot; prišel bom k vam. 
[14:19] Še malo, in svet me ne bo videl; a vi me boste videli: ker jaz živim, živeli boste tudi vi. 
[14:20] Tisti dan boste vi razpoznali, da sem jaz v očetu svojem, in vi v meni, in jaz v vas. 
[14:21] Kdor zapovedi moje ima in jih izpolnjuje, on je ta, ki me ljubi; kdor pa mene ljubi, ljubil ga bo oče moj: in jaz ga bom ljubil, in razodel mu se bom sam. 
[14:22] Reče mu Juda, ne Iškarijan: Gospod! kako je to, da se boš nam razodel, in ne svetu? 
[14:23] Jezus odgovorí in mu reče: Če me kdo ljubi, izpolnjeval bo besedo mojo, in oče moj ga bo ljubil, in prišli bomo k njemu, in nastanili se bomo pri njem. 
[14:24] Kdor me ne ljubi, ta besed mojih ne izpolnjuje; in beseda, ktero slišite, ni moja, nego očeta, kteri me je poslal. 
[14:25] To sem vam povedal, dokler sem z vami. 
[14:26] Tolažnik pa, Duh sveti, kterega vam bo oče v ime moje poslal, on vas bo vse učil, in spominjal vas bo vsega, kar sem vam povedal. 
[14:27] Mir vam zapuščam, mir svoj vam dajem; ne dajem vam jaz, kakor svet daje. Ne bodi vam srce plašno in boječe! 
[14:28] Slišali ste, da sem vam jaz rekel: Grem, in prišel bom k vam. Ko bi me ljubili, veselili bi se, da sem rekel: K očetu grem; kajti oče moj je veči od mene. 
[14:29] In povedal sem vam sedaj, predno se je zgodilo, da kedar se zgodí, da boste verovali. 
[14:30] Ne bom več veliko z vami govoril; gre namreč vojvoda tega sveta, in na meni nima ničesar: 
[14:31] Nego da svet spozna, da ljubim očeta, in delam tako, kakor mi je oče zapovedal. Vstanite, pojdimo odtod! 
[15:1] Jaz sem prava trta, in oče moj je vinogradnik. 
[15:2] Vsako mladiko na meni, ktera ne rodí sadú, njo bo odrezal; in vsako, ktera rodí sad, očistil jo bo, da bo več sadú rodila. 
[15:3] Vi ste uže čisti, za voljo besede, ktero sem vam govoril. 
[15:4] Ostanite v meni, in jaz bom v vas. Kakor mladika sama od sebe ne more roditi sadú, če ne ostane na trti: tako tudi vi, če ne ostanete v meni. 
[15:5] Jaz sem trta, vi mladike. Kdor ostane v meni, in jaz v njem, ta bo rodil veliko sadú: kajti brez mene ne morete ničesar storiti. 
[15:6] Kdor ne ostane v meni, vržen bo ven kakor mladika, in osuší se, in zberó jih in vržejo na ogenj, in zgoré. 
[15:7] Če ostanete v meni, in besede moje v vas ostanejo: prosite, karkoli hočete, in zgodilo vam se bo. 
[15:8] S tem se bo oče moj oslavil, da obrodite veliko sadú; in moji učenci boste. 
[15:9] Kakor je oče mene ljubil, ljubim tudi jaz vas; ostanite v ljubezni mojej. 
[15:10] Če boste zapovedi moje izpolnjevali, ostali boste v ljubezni mojej; kakor sem jaz zapovedi očeta svojega izpolnil, in prebivam v ljubezni njegovej. 
[15:11] To sem vam povedal, da moja radost ostane v vas, in da se vaša radost dopolni. 
[15:12] Moja zapoved je ta, da se ljubite med seboj, kakor sem vas jaz ljubil. 
[15:13] Veče ljubezni od té nima nikdor, da kdo dušo svojo položi za prijatelje svoje. 
[15:14] Vi ste prijatelji moji, ako delate, kar vam ukazujem. 
[15:15] Ne imenujem vas več hlapcev, ker hlapec ne vé, kaj dela gospodar njegov; nego imenoval sem vas prijatelje, ker sem vam vse, kar sem slišal od očeta svojega, oznanil. 
[15:16] Niste izvolili vi mene, nego jaz sem izvolil vas, in postavil sem vas, da vi greste in obrodite sad, in da sad vaš ostane: da karkoli boste očeta v moje ime prosili, da vam bo dal. 
[15:17] To vam zapovedujem, da se ljubíte med seboj. 
[15:18] Če vas svet sovraži, védite, da je mene poprej sovražil, nego vas. 
[15:19] Ko bi bili od sveta, svet bi svoje ljubil; ker pa niste od sveta, nego sem vas jaz odbral od sveta, za to vas svet sovraži. 
[15:20] Spominjajte se besede, ktero sem vam jaz rekel: Hlapec ni veči od gospodarja svojega. Če so mene pregnali, pregnali bodo tudi vas; če so mojo besedo ohranili, ohranili bodo tudi vašo. 
[15:21] Ali to vse vam bodo delali za voljo imena mojega, ker ne poznajo tega, kteri me je poslal. 
[15:22] Ko ne bi bil prišel, in jim ne bi bil govoril, ne bi imeli greha; sedaj pa nimajo izgovora za grehe svoje. 
[15:23] Kdor mene sovraži, sovraži tudi očeta mojega. 
[15:24] Ko ne bi bil dél storil med njimi, ne bi imeli greha; sedaj so pa videli, in sovražijo mene in očeta mojega. 
[15:25] Pa da se izpolni beseda, ktera je pisana v zakonu njih: "Sovražili so me zastonj." 
[15:26] Kedar pa pride tolažnik, kterega vam bom jaz poslal od očeta, Duh resnice, kteri izhaja od očeta, on bo za-me pričal; 
[15:27] Pa tudi vi boste pričali, ker ste od začetka z menoj. 
[16:1] To sem vam povedal, da se ne pohujšate. 
[16:2] Izganjali vas bodo iz shajališč: prišel pa bo čas, da bo vsak, kdor vas bo moril, menil, da Bogu služi. 
[16:3] In to vam bodo delali, ker niso poznali očeta ne mene. 
[16:4] Ali to sem vam povedal, da se boste, kedar ta čas pride, spomenili tega, da sem vam jaz povedal; tega vam pa od začetka nisem povedal, ker sem z vami bil. 
[16:5] A sedaj grem k temu, kteri me je poslal, in nobeden od vas me ne vpraša: Kam greš? 
[16:6] Temveč ker sem vam to povedal, napolnila vam je žalost srce. 
[16:7] Ali jaz vam po pravici pravim: Bolje vam je, da jaz odidem. Kajti če ne odidem, ne bo prišel tolažnik k vam; če pa odidem, poslal vam ga bom. 
[16:8] In kedar on pride, prepričal bo svet greha in pravice in sodbe. 
[16:9] Greha namreč, ker ne verujejo v mé: 
[16:10] Pravice pa, ker grem k očetu svojemu, in me ne boste več videli; 
[16:11] A sodbe, ker je vojvoda tega sveta obsojen. 
[16:12] Še veliko vam imam povedati; pa sedaj ne morete nositi. 
[16:13] Kedar pa on pride, Duh resnice, napotil vas bo na vsako resnico; ne bo namreč govoril od sebe, nego govoril bo, kar bo slišal, in oznanjeval vam bo prihodnje rečí. 
[16:14] On bo mene oslavil, ker bo od mojega vzel in vam oznanil. 
[16:15] Vse, kar ima oče, moje je; za to sem rekel, da bo od mojega vzel in vam oznanil 
[16:16] Malo, in ne boste me videli; in zopet malo, in videli me boste; ker jaz grem k očetu. 
[16:17] Tedaj rekó nekteri od učencev njegovih med seboj: Kaj je to, kar nam pravi: Malo, in ne boste me videli; in zopet malo, in videli me boste? in: Ker jaz grem k očetu? 
[16:18] In govorili so: Kaj je to, kar pravi: malo? Ne vémo, kaj pravi. 
[16:19] Jezus pa spozná, da ga hočejo vprašati, in reče jim: Ali za to se pohujšujete med seboj, ker sem rekel: Malo, in ne boste me videli; in zopet malo, in videli me boste? 
[16:20] Resnično resnično vam pravim, da boste jokali vi in plakali, in svet se bo radoval; a vi boste žalostni: ali žalost vaša se bo premenila v radost. 
[16:21] Žena, kedar rodí, ima žalost, ker je čas nje prišel; ali kedar porodí dete, ne spominja se več britkosti, od radosti, da se je rodil človek na svet. 
[16:22] Tako tudi vas sedaj žalost objemlje; pa zopet vas bom videl, in srce vaše se bo radovalo, in radosti vaše vam ne bo nihče odvzel. 
[16:23] In tisti dan me ne boste ničesar vpraševali. Resnično resnično vam pravim, da karkoli boste očeta v ime moje prosili, dal vam bo. 
[16:24] Doslej niste v ime moje ničesar prosili. Prosite, in prejeli boste, da bo radost vaša dopolnjena. 
[16:25] To sem vam povedal v prilikah; ali prišel bo čas, ko vam ne bom več govoril v prilikah, nego vam bom odkrito oznanjeval za očeta. 
[16:26] Tisti dan boste v ime moje prosili; in ne pravim vam, da bom jaz prosil očeta za vas: 
[16:27] Kajti oče vas sam ljubi, ker ste vi mene ljubili, in ste verovali, da sem jaz izšel od Boga. 
[16:28] Izšel sem od očeta, in prišel sem na svet; in zopet zapuščam svet, in grem k očetu. 
[16:29] Rekó mu učenci njegovi; Glej, sedaj razločno govoriš, in prilike nobene ne praviš. 
[16:30] Sedaj vémo, da vse véš, in ti ni treba, da bi te kdo vpraševal. Po tem ti verujemo, da si od Boga izšel. 
[16:31] Odgovorí jim Jezus: Ali sedaj verujete? 
[16:32] Glej, prišel bo čas, in sedaj je prišel, da se boste razkropili vsak na svojo stran in mene boste samega pustili; pa nisem sam, ker je oče z menoj. 
[16:33] To sem vam povedal, da boste mir imeli v meni. Na svetu boste britkost imeli; ali ne bojte se, jaz sem svet premagal. 
[17:1] To je povedal Jezus, ter povzdigne očí svoje na nebo, in reče: Oče, prišel je čas; oslavi sina svojega, da tudi sin tvoj tebe oslavi: 
[17:2] Kakor si mu dal oblast nad vsem človeštvom, da vsem ktere si mu dal, dá večno življenje. 
[17:3] Večno življenje je pa to, da poznajo tebe edinega resničnega Boga, in kogar si poslal, Jezusa Kristusa. 
[17:4] Jaz sem te oslavil na zemlji; delo, ktero si mi dal, da ga storim, dodelal sem. 
[17:5] Sedaj pa oslavi, oče, ti mene sam pri sebi, s slavo, ktero sem imel pri tebi, predno je svet postal. 
[17:6] Razodel sem ime tvoje ljudém, ktere si mi dal od sveta; tvoji so bili, in meni si jih dal: in besedo tvojo so ohranili. 
[17:7] Sedaj vedó, da je vse, kar si mi dal, od tebe: 
[17:8] Kajti besede, ktere si meni dal, dal sem njim; in oni so sprejeli, in razpoznali so resnično, da sem od tebe izšel, in verovali so, da si me ti poslal. 
[17:9] Jaz prosim za-nje; ne prosim za svet, nego za té, ktere si mi dal, ker so tvoji. 
[17:10] In vse moje je tvoje, in tvoje moje; in oslavil sem se v njih. 
[17:11] In nisem več na svetu, in tí so na svetu, in jaz grem k tebi. Oče sveti! ohrani jih v ime svoje, ktere si mi dal, da bodo eno, kakor mi. 
[17:12] Dokler sem bil ž njimi na svetu, varoval sem jih v ime tvoje; ohranil sem jih, ktere si mi dal, in nobeden njih ni poginil, razen sin pogube, da se izpolni pismo. 
[17:13] A sedaj grem k tebi, in to govorim na svetu, da bodo imeli radost mojo izpolnjeno v sebi. 
[17:14] Jaz sem jim dal besedo tvojo, in svet jih sovraži, ker niso od sveta, kakor jaz nisem od sveta. 
[17:15] Ne prosim, da jih s sveta vzemi, nego da jih obvaruj zlega. 
[17:16] Od sveta niso, kakor jaz nisem od sveta. 
[17:17] Posveti jih v resnici svojej; tvoja beseda je resnica. 
[17:18] Kakor si mene poslal na svet, poslal sem tudi jaz njih na svet. 
[17:19] In za njih se jaz sam posvečujem, da bodo tudi oni posvečeni v resnici. 
[17:20] Ne prosim te pa samo za té, nego tudi za tiste, kteri bodo po njih besedi verovali v mé: 
[17:21] Da bodo vsi eno; kakor ti, oče, v meni, in jaz v tebi, da bodo tudi oni v nas eno: da bo svet veroval, da si me ti poslal. 
[17:22] In jaz sem slavo, ktero si meni dal, njim dal; da bodo eno, kakor smo mi eno: 
[17:23] Jaz v njih, in ti v meni, da bodo združeni v eno, in da spozna svet, da si me ti poslal, in si jih ljubil, kakor si mene ljubil. 
[17:24] Oče, ktere si mi dal, bočem, da kjer jaz bom, da bodo tudi oni z menoj: da bodo videli mojo slavo, ktero si mi dal, ker si me ljubil, predno je svet postal. 
[17:25] Oče pravični! svet tebe ni poznal, a jaz sem te poznal, in ti so poznali, da si me li poslal. 
[17:26] In oznanil sem jim ime tvoje, in oznanjeval ga bom: da bo ljubezen, s ktero si mene ljubil, v njih, in jaz v njih. 
[18:1] Rekši to Jezus, izide z učenci svojimi črez potok Cedron, kjer je bil vrt, v kterega vnide on in učenci njegovi. 
[18:2] Vedel je pa tudi Juda, izdajalec njegov, za ta kraj; ker se je pogostoma shajal Jezus tu z učenci svojimi. 
[18:3] Juda torej vzeme drhal, in služabnike od vélikih duhovnov in Farizejev, in pride tje s svetilnicami in bakljami in orožjem. 
[18:4] Jezus pa, ker je vse vedel, kaj se bo ž njim zgodilo, izide, in reče jim: Koga iščete? 
[18:5] Odgovoré mu: Jezusa Nazarečana. Jezus jim reče: Jaz sem. Stal je pa ž njimi tudi Juda, izdajalelec njegov. 
[18:6] Ko jim je pa rekel: Jaz sem, odstopili so nazaj, in padli so na zemljo. 
[18:7] In zopet jih vpraša: Koga iščete? Oni pa rekó: Jezusa Nazarečana. 
[18:8] Jezus odgovorí: "Rekel sem vam, da sem jaz. Če torej mene iščete, pustite, naj ti odidejo. 
[18:9] Da se izpolni beseda, ktero jim je bil rekel: Ktere si mi dal, nobenega od njih nisem izgubil. 
[18:10] A Simon Peter je imel meč, in izdere ga, in udari hlapca vélikega duhovna, in odseka mu desno uho. Ime pa je bilo hlapcu Malha. 
[18:11] Pa reče Jezus Petru: Vtakni meč svoj v nožnice. Ali naj keliha, kterega mi je podal oče, ne pijem? 
[18:12] Tedaj drhal in poglavar in služabniki Judovski Jezusa zgrabijo, in zvežejo ga. 
[18:13] In odpeljejo ga najprej k Anu; bil je namreč tast Kajfa, kteri je bil tisto leto véliki duhoven. 
[18:14] Bil je pa Kajfa tisti, kteri je bil Judom nasvetoval, da je bolje, da eden človek za ljudstvo umre. 
[18:15] Šel je pa za Jezusom Simon Peter, in neki drugi učenec. Ta učenec je bil pa z vélikim duhovnom znan, ter vnide z Jezusom na dvor vélikega duhovna. 
[18:16] A Peter je stal zunaj pri vratih. Tedaj izide drugi učenec, kteri je bil z vélikim duhovnom znan, in reče vratarici, in odpelje Simona noter. 
[18:17] Dekla vratarica pa reče Petru: Ali nisi tudi ti izmed učencev tega človeka? On reče: Nisem. 
[18:18] A hlapci in služabniki so bili zanetili ogenj, ker je bilo mraz, ter so stali in se ogrevali; stal je pa tudi Peter med njimi in se je grel. 
[18:19] A véliki duhoven vpraša Jezusa za učence njegove, in za nauk njegov. 
[18:20] Jezus mu odgovorí: Jaz sem očitno govoril svetu; jaz sem vsegdar učil v shajališči in v tempeljnu, kjer se vsegdar Judje shajajo, in skrivaj nisem ničesar govoril. 
[18:21] Kaj vprašuješ mene? Vprašaj tiste, kteri so slišali, kaj sem jim govoril; glej, oni vedó, kaj sem jaz govoril. 
[18:22] Ko je pa to rekel, udari eden od služabnikov, kteri so tam stali, Jezusa po licu, in reče: Tako odgovarjaš vélikemu duhovnu? 
[18:23] Odgovorí mu Jezus: Če sem hudo govoril, izpričaj, da je hudo; če pa dobro, po kaj me biješ? 
[18:24] Ana ga pošlje zvezanega k vélikemu duhovnu Kajfu. 
[18:25] A Simon Peter je stal in se grel. Rekó mu tedaj: Ali nisi tudi ti izmed učencev njegovih? On utají, in reče: Nisem. 
[18:26] Eden od hlapcev vélikega duhovna, rojak tistemu, kteremu je bil Peter odsekal uho, reče: Te li nisem jaz videl ž njim na vrtu? 
[18:27] Peter pa zopet utají, in precej zapoje petelin. 
[18:28] A Jezusa so odpeljali od Kajfa v sodnišnico. Bilo je pa zjutraj; in oni niso šli v sodnišnico, da se ne bi oskrunili, nego da bi jedli velikonočno jagnje. 
[18:29] Tedaj izide Pilat k njim, in reče: Kakošno tožbo imate zoper tega človeka? 
[18:30] Odgovoré in rekó mu: Ko ta ne bi bil hudodelnik, to ti ga ne bi bili izročili. 
[18:31] Pa jim Pilat reče: Vzemite ga vi, in sodite ga po svojej postavi. Judje pa mu rekó: Mi ne smemo nikogar umoriti. 
[18:32] Da se izpolni Jezusova beseda, ktero jim je rekel, ko je zaznamoval, s kakošno smrtjo bo umrl. 
[18:33] In Pilat vnide zopet v sodnišnico, in pokliče Jezusa, in reče mu: Ti si kralj Judovski? 
[18:34] Odgovorí mu Jezus: Praviš li to sam od sebe, ali so ti drugi za-me rekli? 
[18:35] Pilat odgovorí: Jeli sem jaz Jud? Tvoj narod in véliki duhovni so te meni izročili; kaj si storil? 
[18:36] Jezus odgovorí: Moje kraljestvo ni s tega sveta; ko bi bilo moje kraljestvo s tega sveta, moji služabniki bi bili branili, da ne bi bil Judom izročen: sedaj pa kraljestvo moje ni odtod. 
[18:37] Tedaj mu Pilat reče: Torej kralj si ti? Jezus odgovorí: Ti praviš, da sem jaz kralj. Jaz sem za to rojen, in za to sem prišel na svet, da pričam resnico. Vsak, kdor je od resnice, posluša glas moj. 
[18:38] Pilat mu reče: Kaj je resnica? In ko je to rekel, izide zopet k Judom, in reče jim: Jaz ne nahajam nobene krivice na njem. 
[18:39] Je pa navada pri vas, da vam enega izpustim na Veliko noč; hočete li torej, da vam izpustim kralja Judovskega? 
[18:40] Pa zavpijejo zopet vsi, govoreč: Ne tega, nego Baraba. Bil je pa Baraba razbojnik. 
[19:1] Tedaj Pilat Jezusa vzeme, in biča. 
[19:2] In vojaki spletó krono s trnja in mu jo denejo na glavo, in oblečejo mu škrlaten plašč, 
[19:3] In govorili so: Zdrav, kralj Judovski! in bíli so ga po licu. 
[19:4] Pilat pa zopet izide ven, in reče jim: Glej, peljem vam ga ven, da spoznate, da ne nahajam na njem nobene krivice. 
[19:5] In Jezus izide ven, noseč trnjevo krono, in škrlatni plašč. In reče jim: Glej, človek! 
[19:6] Ko ga pa véliki duhovni in služabniki ogledajo, zavpijejo, govoreč: Križaj! križaj! Velí jim Pilat: Vzemite ga vi in križajte; kajti jaz ne nahajam nobene krivice na njem. 
[19:7] Odgovoré mu Judje: Mi imamo postavo, in po postavi našej je dolžen umreti, ker se je sina Božjega naredil. 
[19:8] Ko je pa Pilat to besedo slišal, zbojí se bolj. 
[19:9] In vnide zopet v sodnišnico, in reče Jezusu: Odkod si ti? Jezus pa mu ne dá odgovora. 
[19:10] Tedaj mu Pilat reče: Meni ne govoriš? Ne véš li, da imam oblast križati te, in da imam oblast izpustiti te? 
[19:11] Jezus odgovorí: Ne imel bi nobene oblasti nad menoj, da ti ni dano od zgorej: za to ima tisti, kteri me je tebi izročil, veči greh. 
[19:12] Odsihmal je Pilat gledal, da bi ga izpustil. A Judje so kričali, govoreč: Če tega izpustiš, nisi prijatelj cesarju. 
[19:13] Ko je pa Pilat to besedo slišal, pripelje ven Jezusa, in sede na sodišče, na mesto, ktero se imenuje Litostroton, Hebrejski pa Gabata. 
[19:14] Bilo je pa v petek pred Veliko nočjó, okoli šeste ure. In reče Judom: Glej, kralj vaš! 
[19:15] Oni pa zavpijejo: Vzemi, vzemi, križaj ga! Reče jim Pilat: Kralja vašega bom križal? Véliki duhovni odgovoré: Nimamo kralja, razen cesarja. 
[19:16] Tedaj jim ga izročí, naj ga križajo. Ter vzemó Jezusa in odpeljejo. 
[19:17] In noseč križ svoj, izide na mesto, imenovano Črepinjek, ktero se Hebrejski imenuje Golgota. 
[19:18] Tu ga razpnó, in ž njim dva druga od ene in druge straní, posredi pa Jezusa. 
[19:19] Napisal je pa Pilat, tudi napis, in del ga je na križ; bilo je pa pisano: Jezus Nazarečan kralj Judovski. 
[19:20] Ta napis je torej veliko Judov bralo, ker je bil kraj, kjer so Jezusa razpeli, blizu mesta; in bilo je pisano Hebrejski, Grški, Latinski. 
[19:21] Pravili so torej véliki duhovni Judovski Pilatu: Ne piši: Kralj Judovski; nego, da je sam rekel: Kralj sem Judovski. 
[19:22] Pilat odgovorí: Kar sem pisal, pisal sem. 
[19:23] Vojaki pa, ko so bili Jezusa razpeli, vzemó obleko njegovo, (in napravijo štiri dele, vsakemu vojaku del,) in suknjo. A suknja ni bila šivana, nego od vrha vsa iztkana. 
[19:24] Za to rekó med seboj: Trgali je ne bomo, nego srečkajmo za njo, čegava bo; da se izpolni pismo, ktero pravi: "Razdelili so obleko mojo med seboj, in za oblačilo moje so vrgli kocko." In vojaki storé tako. 
[19:25] Stale so pa pri križu Jezusovem mati njegova in sestra matere njegove Marija Kleopova, in Marija Magdalena. 
[19:26] Ko pa ugleda Jezus mater, in učenca, da stojí, kterega je ljubil, reče materi svojej: Žena, glej, sin tvoj! 
[19:27] Po tem reče učencu: Glej, mati tvoja! In od tega časa jo je vzel učenec k sebi. 
[19:28] Po tem, vedoč Jezus, da je uže vse dopolnjeno, da se izpolni pismo, reče: Žejen sem! 
[19:29] Stala je pa tam posoda polna octa; in oni napolnijo gobo z octom, in ovijejo jo okoli izopa, ter mu pritaknejo k ustom. 
[19:30] Ko je pa Jezus ocet okusil, reče: Dopolnjeno je! in nakloni glavo, in izročí duha. 
[19:31] Judje pa, da ne ostane truplo v soboto na križu, ker je bil petek, (bil je namreč ta dan sobotni velik.) zaprosijo Pilata, naj jim goleni prebijejo, in jih snemejo. 
[19:32] Vojaki torej pridejo in prebijejo prvemu goleni in drugemu, kteri je bil ž njim križan. 
[19:33] Ko pa pridejo do Jezusa, in vidijo, da je uže umrl, ne polomijo mu goleni: 
[19:34] Nego eden od vojakov mu prebode s sulico rebra, in precej izide kri in voda. 
[19:35] In ta, ki je videl, priča, in pričanje njegovo je resnično, in on vé, da govori resnico, da boste vi verovali. 
[19:36] Zgodilo pa se je to, da se izpolni pismo: "Kost njegova se ne bo prelomila." 
[19:37] In zopet drugo pismo pravi: "Pogledali bodo, kterega so prebodli." 
[19:38] Po tem pa zaprosi Pilata Jožef iz Arimateje, (ker je bil učenec Jezusov, to da skrivaj za voljo strahú Judovskega,) da bi snel truplo Jezusovo: in Pilat dovoli. Ter pride in sneme truplo Jezusovo. 
[19:39] Pride pa tudi Nikodem, (kteri je bil poprej po noči prišel k Jezusu, in prinese z miro pomešane aloje kakih sto funtov. 
[19:40] In vzemeta truplo Jezusovo, in zavijeta ga v prte z dišavami vred, kakor imajo Judje navado pokopavati. 
[19:41] Bil je pa na mestu, kjer je bil križan, vrt, in na vrtu nov grob, v kterega še nikoli nobeden ni bil položen. 
[19:42] Tu torej, za voljo petka Judovskega, ker je bil grob blizu, položita Jezusa. 
[20:1] A prvi dan tedna pride Marija Magdalena zgodaj, ko je še tema bila, na grob; in ugleda, da je kamen odvaljen od groba. 
[20:2] Tedaj odbeží in pride k Simonu Petru in drugemu učencu, kterega je Jezus ljubil, in reče jima: Vzeli so gospoda iz groba, in ne vémo, kam so ga položili. 
[20:3] In Peter izide in drugi učenec, in prideta na grob. 
[20:4] Bežala sta pa oba vkupej; in drugi učenec je hitreje bežal kakor Peter, in pride prvi na grob, 
[20:5] In sklonivši se, ugleda povoje, da ležé; ali vstopil ni. 
[20:6] Tedaj pride tudi Simon Peter za njim, in vnide v grob, in ugleda povoje, da ležé; 
[20:7] A prt, kteri je bil na glavi njegovej, ni ležal z drugimi prti, nego bil je posebej zvit na enem kraji. 
[20:8] Tedaj vnide tudi drugi učenec, kteri je bil prvi prišel na grob, in videl je, in veroval je. 
[20:9] Nista še namreč vedela pisma, da mora od mrtvih vstati. 
[20:10] In odšla sta učenca zopet k svojim. 
[20:11] A Marija je zunej pri grobu stala in jokala. Ko je pa jokala, skloni se v grob, 
[20:12] In ugleda dva angelja v belih oblačilih, da sedita, eden pri glavi, in eden pri nogah, kjer je bilo ležalo truplo Jezusovo. 
[20:13] In rečeta jej ona: Žena, kaj jokaš? Reče jima: Ker so Gospoda mojega vzeli, in ne vém, kam so ga položili. 
[20:14] In ko je to rekla, obrne se nazaj, in ugleda Jezusa, da stojí; ni pa vedela, da je Jezus. 
[20:15] Reče jej Jezus: Žena, kaj jokaš? koga iščeš? Ona, misleč, da je vrtnar, reče mu: Gospod, če si ga ti odnesel, povej mi, kam si ga položil; in jaz ga bom vzela. 
[20:16] Reče jej Jezus: Marija! Ona se obrne, in reče mu: Rabuni! (kar se pravi: Učenik.) 
[20:17] Reče jej Jezus: Ne dotikaj se me, ker se še nisem vrnil k očetu svojemu. Pojdi pa k bratom mojim, in povej jim: Grem k svojemu in vašemu očetu, in svojemu Bogu in vašemu Bogu. 
[20:18] Marija Magdalena pride, in oznani učencem, da je videla Gospoda, in da jej je to rekel. 
[20:19] Ko je pa pozno bilo, tisti prvi dan tedna, in so bile duri zaprte, kjer so bili učenci zbrani, za voljo strahú Judovskega, pride Jezus in stopi na sredo, in reče jim: Mir vam! 
[20:20] In ko je to rekel, pokaže jim roke in rebra svoja. In razveselé se učenci njegovi, videč Gospoda. 
[20:21] A Jezus jim zopet reče: Mir vam! Kakor je oče mene poslal, tudi jaz pošiljam vas. 
[20:22] In ko je to rekel, dahne, in reče jim: Prejmite svetega Duha. 
[20:23] Kterimkoli boste grehe odpustili, odpustili jim se bodo; kterimkoli jih boste zadržali, zadržali jim se bodo. 
[20:24] Tomaž pa, eden od dvanajsterih, ki se imenuje Dvojček, ni bil ž njimi, ko je Jezus prišel. 
[20:25] Pravili so mu torej drugi učenci: Videli smo Gospoda, On jim pa reče: Če ne vidim na rokah njegovih rane od žrebljev, in ne položim prsta svojega v rano od žrebljev, in ne vložim roke svoje v rebra njegova: ne bom veroval. 
[20:26] In črez osem dnî so bili zopet učenci njegovi notri, in Tomaž ž njimi. Jezus pride, in duri so bile zaprte, in stopi na sredo, in reče: Mir vam! 
[20:27] Po tem reče Tomažu: vloži prst svoj sém, in poglej roke moje; in podaj roko svojo, in položi v rebra moja: in ne bodi neveren, nego veren. 
[20:28] In Tomaž odgovorí, in reče mu: Gospod moj in Bog moj! 
[20:29] Reče mu Jezus: Ker si me videl, Tomaž, veruješ; blagor jim, kteri ne vidijo pa verujejo. 
[20:30] In še veliko drugih čudežev je Jezus storil pred učenci svojimi, kteri niso zapisani v teh bukvah. 
[20:31] A ti so zapisani, da boste verovali, da Jezus je Kristus sin Božji, in da boste verovaje, življenje imeli v ime njegovo. 
[21:1] Po tem se je Jezus zopet prikazal učencem na morji Tiberijadskem; prikazal se je pa tako-le; 
[21:2] Bili so skupaj Simon Peter in Tomaž, ki se imenuje Dvojček, in Natanael iz Kane Galilejske, in Zebedejeva, in dva druga izmed učencev njegovih. 
[21:3] Reče jim Simon Peter: Ribe grem lovit. Rekó mu: Tudi mi pojdemo s teboj. Ter izidejo in vstopijo precej v ladjo, in tisto noč niso nič vjeli. 
[21:4] Ko je pa uže jutro napočilo, stal je Jezus na bregu: ali učenci niso vedeli, da je Jezus. 
[21:5] In reče jim Jezus: Otroci! jeli imate kakošne jedí? Odgovoré mu: Ne. 
[21:6] On jim pa reče: Vrzite mrežo na desno stran ladje, pa boste našli. Ter vržejo, in niso je več mogli vleči od množice rib. 
[21:7] Tedaj reče učenec, ta, kterega je Jezus ljubil, Petru: Gospod je. Simon Peter pa, ko zasliši, da je Gospod, opaše si srajco, (bil je namreč nag,) in skoči v morje. 
[21:8] A drugi učenci pridejo na ladjo, (niso bili namreč daleč od zemlje, nego kakih dvesto komolcev,) in vlekli so mrežo z ribami. 
[21:9] Ko pa izstopijo na zemljo, ugledajo ogenj naložen in na njem ribo položeno, in kruh. 
[21:10] Velí jim Jezus: Prinesite od rib, ktere ste sedaj vjeli. 
[21:11] Simon Peter vstopi, in izvleče mrežo na zemljo, polno velikih rib sto in tri in petdeset; in da si ravno jih je toliko bilo, ni se mreža raztrgala. 
[21:12] Velí jim Jezus: Pridite, obedujte! Nobeden pa od učencev si ni upal vprašati ga: Kdo si ti? vedoč, da je Gospod. 
[21:13] In Jezus pride, in vzeme kruh, in dá jim, in ravno tako ribo. 
[21:14] To se je uže v tretje prikazal Jezus učencem svojim, odkar je vstal od mrtvih. 
[21:15] A ko so poobedovali, reče Jezus Simonu Petru: Simon Jonov, ljubiš li me bolj, nego té? Reče mu: Dà, Gospod! ti véš, da te ljubim. Reče mu: Pasi jagnjeta moja. 
[21:16] Reče mu zopet drugoč: Simon Jonov, ali me ljubiš? Reče mu: Dà, Gospod! ti veš, da te ljubim. Veli mu: Pasi ovce moje. 
[21:17] Reče mu v tretje: Simon Jonov, ali me ljubiš? Peter postane žalosten, da mu je v tretje rekel: Ali me ljubiš? in reče mu: Gospod! ti vse véš; ti znaš, da te ljubim. Veli mu Jezus: Pasi ovce moje. 
[21:18] Resnično resnično ti pravim: Ko si bil mlajši, opasoval si se sam, in hodil si, kamor si hotel; kedar boš pa star, raztegnil boš roke svoje, in drugi te bo opasal, in odpeljal te bo, kamor ne boš hotel. 
[21:19] To je pa povedal, da je na znanje dal, s kakošno smrtjo bo oslavil Boga. In ko je to povedal, reče mu: Pojdi za menoj! 
[21:20] Obrnivši se pa Peter, ugleda učenca, kterega je Jezus ljubil, da gre za njim, kteri je bil na večerji tudi legel na prsi njegove, in je bil rekel: Gospod! kdo je tisti, ki te bo izdal? 
[21:21] Ko tega Peter ugleda, reče Jezusu: Gospod! Kaj pa ta? 
[21:22] Reče mu Jezus: Če hočem, da ostane dotlej, ko pridem, kaj tebi za to? Ti pojdi za menoj. 
[21:23] In razglasila se je med brati ta beseda: Ta učenec ne bo umrl. Ali Jezus mu ni bil rekel, da ne bo umrl; nego: Če hočem, da ostane dotlej, ko pridem, kaj tebi za to? 
[21:24] Ta učenec je ta, ki pričuje za to, in je napisal to; in vémo, da je pričevanje njegovo resnično. 
[21:25] Je pa še drugega veliko, kar je storil Jezus, in to, ko bi se posamez vse napisalo, menim, da tudi ves svet ne bi imel prostora za bukve, ktere bi se napisale. Amen. 

### Acts

[1:1] Prvo torej knjigo sem napisal o vsem, o Teofil, kar je jel Jezus delati in pa učiti, 
[1:2] Noter do dné, ko se je gor vzel, potem ko je zapovedi dal aposteljnom, ktere je bil po svetem Duhu izvolil. 
[1:3] Kterim se je tudi po trpljenji svojem živega pokazal, z mnogimi gotovimi znamenji, in jim se je štirideset dnî prikazoval, in govoril o kraljestvu Božjem. 
[1:4] In ko se je ž njimi sešel, zapovedal jim je, naj ne odidejo iz Jeruzalema, nego čakajo obljube očetove, ktero ste slišali od mene; 
[1:5] Kajti Janez sicer je krstil z vodo, ali vi se boste krstili z Duhom svetim, ne dolgo po teh dnéh. 
[1:6] Tí pa, kteri so se bili sešli, vpraševali so ga torej, govoreč: Gospod! ali boš v teh dnéh zopet postavil kraljestvo Izraelovo? 
[1:7] On pa jim reče: Ni vaše, da bi znali čas ali uro, ktero je Bog svojej oblasti pridržal; 
[1:8] Nego prejeli boste moč, ko pride sveti Duh na vas, in boste mi priče v Jeruzalemu in po vsej Judeji in Samariji in noter do kraja zemlje. 
[1:9] In ko je to povedal, vzdignil se je vpričo njih: in oblak ga je vzel izpred njih očî. 
[1:10] In ko so gledali za njim, ko je šel na nebo, in glej, moža dva pristopita k njim v belej obleki, 
[1:11] Ktera tudi rečeta: Možjé Galilejci! kaj stojite in zrete na nebo? Ta Jezus, ki se je gor vzel od vas na nebo, ta bo prišel, kakor ste ga videli, da je šel na nebo. 
[1:12] Tedaj so se vrnili v Jeruzalem z gore, ktera se imenuje Oljska, in je blizu Jeruzalema, en sobotni dan hodá. 
[1:13] In ko so bili noter prišli, šli so gor v gornjo izbo, kjer so prebivali: Peter in pa Jakob in Janez in Andrej, Filip in Tomaž, Jernej in Matevž, Jakob Alfejev in Simon Zelot in Juda Jakobov, 
[1:14] Vsi ti so bili ene misli stanovitni v molitvi in prošnji, z ženami in Marijo materjo Jezusovo, in z brati njegovimi. 
[1:15] In v te dní vstane Peter sredi učencev, in reče (bilo je pa ljudî kakih sto in dvajset imen). 
[1:16] Možjé bratje! moralo se je izpolniti to pismo, ktero je prerekel sveti Duh z ustmi Davidovimi, za Juda, kteri je bil vodnik tem, ki so vjeli Jezusa; 
[1:17] Kajti prištet je bil nam, in prejel je bil del te službe. 
[1:18] Ta torej je pridobil njivo od nepravičnega plačila, in obesil se je, in razpočil se je po sredi, in izsul se je ves drob njegov. 
[1:19] In na znanje je prišlo vsem, kteri prebivajo okoli Jeruzalema, tako, da se imenuje tisto polje v lastnem njih jeziku Akeldama, to je Krvavo polje. 
[1:20] Pisano je namreč v bukvah psalmov: "Dvor njegov naj bo pust, in nikogar naj ne bo, kteri bi prebival v njem;" in: "Škofijstvo njegovo naj prejme drugi." 
[1:21] Za to je treba, da od teh móž, kteri so bili z nami ves čas, dokler je Gospod Jezus z nami prebival, 
[1:22] Začenši od krsta Janezovega noter do dné, ko se je gor vzel od nas: da bo eden od teh z nami vred priča vstajenja njegovega. 
[1:23] Ter postavijo dva, Jožefa, ki se imenuje Barzaba, s priimkom Just, in Matija. 
[1:24] In moleč rekó: Ti, Gospod, ki poznaš srca vseh, pokaži, kterega od teh dveh si izvolil, 
[1:25] Da prejme del te službe in aposteljstva, iz kterega je izpadel Juda, da je odšel na svoj kraj. 
[1:26] In vržejo kocke za nju, in kocka pade na Matija, in prištet je bil enajsterim aposteljnom. 
[2:1] In ko pride petdeseti dan, bili so vsi ene misli vkupej. 
[2:2] Kar vstane šum z neba kakor puhanje silnega vetra, in napolni vso hišo, kjer so sedeli. 
[2:3] Ter prikažejo jim se razdeljeni jeziki kakor ognjeni, in sedejo na vsakega od njih. 
[2:4] In vsi se napolnijo Duha svetega, in začnó govoriti v drugih jezikih, kakor jim je Duh dajal izgovarjati. 
[2:5] Prebivali pa so v Jeruzalemu Judje, možjé pobožni, od vsakega naroda, kteri so pod nebom. 
[2:6] Ko se je pa zaslišal ta glas, snide se množica, in groza jih obide; kajti slišal je vsak od njih, da govoré v njegovem jeziku. 
[2:7] In zavzemali so se in čudili, govoreč med seboj: Glej, niso li vsi ti, ki govoré, Galilejci? 
[2:8] In kako mi slišimo vsak svoj jezik, v kterem smo se rodili? 
[2:9] Parčani in Medijani in Elamljani, in kteri prebivamo v Mezopotamiji, in pa Judeji in Kapadociji, Pontu in v Aziji, 
[2:10] Frigiji in pa Pamfiliji, Egiptu in v straneh Libije, ktera je pri Cireni, in prišelci iz Rima, Judje in pojudeni, 
[2:11] Krečani in Arabljani: slišimo, da nam govoré v naših jezikih velika dela Božja. 
[2:12] In vsi so se zavzemali, in strmeli so, govoreč eden drugemu: Kaj če to biti? 
[2:13] A drugi so se posmehovali, in govorili so: "Sladkega vinca so se napili." 
[2:14] Tedaj se vstopi Peter z enajsterimi, in povzdigne glas svoj, in reče jim: Možjé Judje in vsi, kteri prebivate okoli Jeruzalema! to vam bodi na znanje, in poslušajte besede moje. 
[2:15] Ti namreč niso, kakor vi menite, pijani, ko je še le tretja ura dné; 
[2:16] Nego to je, kar je rečeno po preroku Joelu: 
[2:17] "In poslednje dní bo, pravi Bog, izlil bom od duha svojega na vse človeštvo, in prerokovali bodo sinovi vaši in hčere vaše; in mladeniči vaši bodo videli prikazni, in starcem vašim se bodo sanjale sanje. 
[2:18] In tudi na hlapce svoje in na dekle svoje bom tiste dní izlil od duha svojega in prerokovali bodo. 
[2:19] In pokazal bom čudeže gori na nebu, in znamenja doli na zemlji: kri in ogenj in kajenja dima. 
[2:20] Solnce se bo premenilo v temo, in mesec v kri, predno pride véliki in slavni dan Gospodov. 
[2:21] In zgodilo se bo, da vsak, kdor bo klical ime Gospodovo, zveličal se bo." 
[2:22] Možjé Izraelci! slišali ste te besede: Jezusa Nazarečana, moža, kterega je Bog potrdil med vami z močmí in čudeži in znamenji, ktera je Bog po njem storil med vami, kakor tudi sami véste, 
[2:23] Tega, po posebnem sklepu in previdnosti Božjej izdanega, vzeli ste, in po rokah krivičnikov pribili in umorili; 
[2:24] Kterega je Bog obudil, razvezavši vezí smrti, ker ni bilo mogoče, da bi ga bila ona držala, 
[2:25] Kajti David pravi za-nj: "Gledal sem Gospoda vedno pred seboj, ker je na desnej strani mene, da ne omahnem. 
[2:26] Za to se je oveselilo srce moje, in obradoval se je jezik moj; pa še tudi telo moje bo počivalo v upanji; 
[2:27] Ker ne boš pustil duše moje v peklu, in tudi ne boš dal, da bi svetnik tvoj videl trohnenje. 
[2:28] Naznanil si mi pota življenja; napolnil me boš z veseljem pred obličjem svojim." 
[2:29] Možjé bratje! naj bo dovoljeno govoriti vam svobodno ob očaku Davidu, da je umrl in pokopan bil, in grob njegov je med nami do tega dné. 
[2:30] Prerok torej, in vedoč, da mu je Bog s prisego prisegel, da bo po telesu iz semena ledja njegovega zbudil Kristusa, in ga posadil na prestol njegov: 
[2:31] Videl je naprej, in povedal je za vstajenje Kristusovo, da se duša njegova ni pustila v peklu, in tudi telo njegovo ni videlo trohnenja. 
[2:32] Tega Jezusa je Bog obudil, čemur smo mi vsi priče. 
[2:33] Z desnico Božjo torej povišan, in prejemši obljubo svetega Duha od očeta, izlil je to, kar vi sedaj vidite in slišite. 
[2:34] Kajti David ni šel gor na nebesa, nego sam pravi: "Rekel je Gospod gospodu mojemu: Sedí meni na desno, 
[2:35] Dokler ne položim sovražnikov tvojih nogam tvojim za podnožje." 
[2:36] Za gotovo torej vedi vsa hiša Izraelova, da ga je za Gospoda in Kristusa naredil Bog, tega Jezusa, kterega ste vi križali. 
[2:37] Ko so pa to slišali, zbode jih v srce, ter rekó Petru in drugim aposteljnom: Kaj nam je storiti, možjé bratje? 
[2:38] Peter jim pa reče: Spokorite se, in krsti naj se vsakdo izmed vas v ime Jezusa Kristusa za odpuščanje grehov; in prejeli boste dar svetega Duha. 
[2:39] Kajti za vas je obljuba, in za otroke vaše, in za vse, kteri so daleč, kterekoli bo poklical Gospod Bog naš. 
[2:40] In z mnogimi drugimi besedami je pričeval in opominjal jih, govoreč: Otmite se od tega hudobnega roda. 
[2:41] Kteri so torej besedo njegovo radi sprejeli, krstili so se; in pridružilo se je tisti dan kake tri tisoči duš. 
[2:42] Bili so pa stanovitni v nauku apostolskem in v družbi in v lomljenji kruha in v molitvah: 
[2:43] Obšel pa je vsako dušo strah, in veliko čudežev in znamenj se je godilo po aposteljnih. 
[2:44] Vsi pa, kteri so verovali, bili so vkupej, in imeli so vse občno, 
[2:45] In lastnine in imenja so prodajali, in razdajali so jih vsem, kakor je kdo potreboval. 
[2:46] In vsak dan so bili stanovitno ene misli v tempeljnu, in lomili so po hišah kruh, in prejemali so jed z veseljem in priprostim srcem, 
[2:47] Hvaleč Boga in imajoč milost pri vsem ljudstvu. A Gospod je pridajal cerkvi vsak dan teh, kteri so se zveličevali. 
[3:1] A Peter in Janez sta šla vkupej gor v tempelj ob uri molitve, ob devetih. 
[3:2] In nosili so nekega moža, kteri je hrom bil iz telesa matere svoje; in pokladali so ga vsak dan pred tempeljnova vrata, ktera se imenujejo Lepa, da je prosil miloščine od teh, kteri so hodili v tempelj. 
[3:3] Ta, videvši Petra in Janeza, da hočeta iti v tempelj, prosil je, da bi prejel miloščine. 
[3:4] Peter pa, pogledavši na-nj z Janezom, reče: Poglej na naju! 
[3:5] In on je gledal na nju, misleč, da bo kaj prejel od nju. 
[3:6] Peter pa reče: Srebra in zlata nimam; kar pa imam, to ti dam. V ime Jezusa Kristusa Nazarečana, vstani in hodi! 
[3:7] In prijemši ga za desno roko, vzdigne ga: in precej so se utrdila stopala njegova in gležnji. 
[3:8] In poskočivši, stal je in hodil, in vnide ž njima v tempelj, hodeč in poskakujoč in hvaleč Boga. 
[3:9] In videlo ga je vse ljudstvo da hodi in hvali Boga; 
[3:10] In poznali so ga, da je tisti, ki je za voljo miloščine sedel pri Lepih vratih tempeljnovih in napolnijo se strmenja in groze nad tem, kar mu se je prigodilo. 
[3:11] Ko se je pa hromi ta, ki je bil ozdravel, držal Petra in Janeza, priteče k njim vse ljudstvo v lopo, ki se imenuje Solomonova, in strmeli so. 
[3:12] Videč pa to Peter, odgovorí ljudstvu: Možjé Izraelci! kaj se čudite temu, ali kaj naju gledate, kakor da bi bila s svojo močjó ali oblastjo storila, da ta hodi? 
[3:13] Bog Abrahamov, in Izakov, in Jakobov, Bog očetov naših oslavil je sina svojega Jezusa, kterega ste vi izdali, in zatajili ga pred obličjem Pilatovim, ko je on sodil, naj se izpustí. 
[3:14] A vi ste svetnika in pravičnega zatajili, in prosili ste, naj vam dá ubijalca. 
[3:15] A začetnika življenja ste umorili, kterega je Bog obudil iz mrtvih, čemur smo mi priče. 
[3:16] In za voljo vere v ime njegovo je tega, ki ga vidite in poznate, utrdilo ime njegovo; in vera, ki je po njem, dala mu je popolno to zdravje vpričo vseh vas. 
[3:17] Ali sedaj, bratje, vém, da ste iz nevednosti storili, kakor tudi poglavarji vaši. 
[3:18] Bog pa, kar je bil naprej oznanil z ustmi vseh prerokov svojih, da bo Kristus trpel, dopolnil je tako. 
[3:19] Spokorite se torej in izpreobrnite, da se izbrišejo grehi vaši: da pridejo časi ohlajenja od obličja Gospodovega, 
[3:20] In pošlje oznanjenega vam Jezusa Kristusa, 
[3:21] Kterega mora sicer nebo sprejeti do časov, ko se uravna vse, kar je Bog povedal z ustmi svetih prerokov svojih od nekedaj. 
[3:22] Mojzes namreč je rekel očakom: "Preroka vam bo zbudil Gospod Bog vaš izmed bratov vaših, kakor mene; njega poslušajte v vsem, karkoli vam bo govoril. 
[3:23] Bo pa, da vsaka duša, ktera ne bo poslušala tega preroka, iztrebila se bo iz ljudstva." 
[3:24] Pa tudi vsi preroki od Samuela in po tem, kolikorkoli jih je govorilo, oznanili so te dní. 
[3:25] Vi ste sinovi prerokov in zaveze, ktero je storil Bog z očaki našimi, govoreč Abrahamu: "In v semenu tvojem se bodo blagoslovili vsi narodi zemlje." 
[3:26] Vam najprej je zbudil Bog sina svojega Jezusa, in poslal, da vas blagoslovi, da se vsak od vas obrne od hudobij svojih. 
[4:1] Ko sta pa ljudstvu govorila, pristopijo k njima duhovni in poglavar tempeljna in Saduceji. 
[4:2] Kteri so bili nevoljni, da učita ljudstvo in oznanjujeta v Jezusu vstajanje od mrtvih. 
[4:3] In položé na nju roke, in denejo ju v ječo do jutra; kajti bil je uže večer. 
[4:4] Veliko teh pa, kteri so besedo slišali, verovalo jih je; in postalo je število móž kakih pet tisoči. 
[4:5] Zgodí se pa drugi dan, da se zberó njih poglavarji in starešine in pismarji v Jeruzalemu, 
[4:6] In Ana véliki duhoven in Kajfa in Janez in Aleksander, in kolikor jih je bilo iz višega duhovskega rodú. 
[4:7] In postavivši ju na sredo, vpraševali so: S kakošno močjó, ali v čegavo ime sta vidva to storila? 
[4:8] Tedaj Peter, napolnivši se Duha svetega, reče jim: Poglavarji naroda in starešine! 
[4:9] Če naju danes izprašujete za dobroto, ktero sva storila bolnemu človeku, kako je on ozdravel: 
[4:10] Bodi na znanje vsem vam, in vsemu ljudstvu Izraelovemu, da v ime Jezusa Kristusa Nazarečana, kterega ste vi križali, kterega je Bog obudil iz mrtvih, po tem stoji ta pred vami zdrav. 
[4:11] Ta je kamen, kterega ste vi zidarji zavrgli, kteri je postal glava oglu. 
[4:12] In v nikomer drugem ni zveličanja; kajti ni ga drugega imena pod nebom danega ljudém, po kterem bi se mi mogli zveličati. 
[4:13] Videč pa srčnost Petrovo in Janezovo, in vedoč, da sta neučena in priprosta človeka, čudili so se; in poznali so ju, da sta z Jezusom bila. 
[4:14] In videč človeka, kteri je ozdravel, da stojí ž njima, niso kaj imeli zoper reči. 
[4:15] In zapovedó jima, naj odideta ven iz zbora, in posvetujejo se med seboj, 
[4:16] Govoreč: Kaj bomo storili tema človekoma? kajti da se je znani čudež po njima zgodil, znano je vsem, kteri prebivajo v Jeruzalemu, in ne moremo utajiti. 
[4:17] Ali da se ne razglasí dalje med ljudstvom, zapretimo jima, naj nobenemu človeku več ne govorita o tem imenu. 
[4:18] In poklicavši ju, zapovedó jima, naj nikoli več ne govorita in učita v ime Jezusovo. 
[4:19] A Peter in Janez odgovarjajoč jim, rečeta: Sodite, je li prav pred Bogom, da bi vas bolj poslušala, nego Boga. 
[4:20] Ne moreva namreč, da tega, kar sva videla in slišala, ne bi govorila. 
[4:21] Oni pa, zapretivši jima, izpusté ju, ko niso nahajali, kako bi ju kaznovali, za voljo ljudstva, ker so vsi hvalili Boga za to, kar se je zgodilo. 
[4:22] Imel je namreč več nego štirideset let ta človek, na kterem se je zgodil ta čudež ozdravljenja. 
[4:23] Ko so ju pa izpustili, prideta k svojim, in povesta jim, kaj so jima véliki duhovni in starešine rekli. 
[4:24] Oni pa, ko so to slišali, povzdignejo ene misli glas k Bogu, in rekó: Gospod, ti Bog, ki si ustvaril nebo in zemljo in morje in vse, kar je v njih; 
[4:25] Kteri si z ustmi Davida hlapca svojega rekel: "Za kaj so se togotili pogani, in ljudstva izmišljala prazne reči? 
[4:26] Postavili so se kralji zemlje, in poglavarji so se zbrali vkupej zoper Gospoda, in zoper Kristusa njegovega." 
[4:27] Zbrali so se namreč zares zoper svetega sina tvojega Jezusa, kterega si pomazilil, Herod in Pontijski Pilat s pogani in ljudstvom Izraelovim, 
[4:28] Da storé, kar je roka tvoja in sklep tvoj sklenil, da naj se zgodí. 
[4:29] In sedaj, Gospod, poglej na njih pretenje, in daj hlapcem svojim, da bodo z vso srčnostjo govorili besedo tvojo, 
[4:30] S tem, da stegneš roko svojo na uzdravljanje, in da se znamenja in čudeži godé po imenu svetega sina tvojega Jezusa. 
[4:31] In ko so odmolili, potrese se mesto, na kterem so bili zbrani, in vsi se napolnijo Duha svetega, in govorili so besedo Božjo srčno. 
[4:32] A množica teh, kteri so verovali, bila je enega srca in enega duha; in nihče ni govoril, da je od tega, kar je imel, njegovega kaj, nego vse jim je bilo občno. 
[4:33] In z veliko močjó so dajali pričevanje aposteljni za vstajenje Gospoda Jezusa, in milost velika je bila na vseh njih. 
[4:34] Ni ga bilo namreč ubogega med njimi. Kajti kolikor jih je bilo, kteri so imeli njive ali hiše, prodajali so, in donašali so ceno tega, kar so prodali, 
[4:35] In pokladali so aposteljnom pred noge; in delilo se je vsakemu, kakor je kdo potreboval. 
[4:36] Jozej pa, kteremu so aposteljni priimek Barnaba dali (kar se tolmači: Sin tolažbe), Levit, iz Cipra po rodu, 
[4:37] Ker je imel njivo, prodal je, in prinesel je ceno, in položil je aposteljnom pred noge. 
[5:1] A neki mož Ananija po imenu, s Safiro ženo svojo prodal je posestvo, 
[5:2] In utajil je od cene, z vedezom žene svoje: in prinesel je en del in položil aposteljnom pred noge. 
[5:3] Peter pa reče: Ananija! za kaj je napolnil satan srce tvoje, da si se zlagàl svetemu Duhu, in si utajil od cene njive? 
[5:4] Ali ne bi bila, ko bi bila ostala, tebi ostala; in prodana, ali ni bila v tvojej oblasti? Kaj, da si to reč položil v srce svoje? Nisi se zlagàl ljudém, nego Bogu. 
[5:5] Ko je pa Ananija te besede slišal, padel je in je izdahnil. In velik strah je obšel vse, kteri so to poslušali. 
[5:6] Vstavši pa mladeniči, vzemó ga, in odnesó ven in pokopljejo. 
[5:7] Zgodí se pa kake tri ure pozneje, pa vnide žena njegova, ne vedoč, kaj se je zgodilo. 
[5:8] Odgovorí pa jej Peter: Povej mi, ali sta za toliko prodala njivo? Ona pa reče: Dà, za toliko. 
[5:9] Peter jej pa reče: Kaj, da sta se dogovorila, da bosta izkušala Duha Gospodovega? Glej, noge teh, ki so pokopali moža tvojega, pred durmi so, in ponesó te ven. 
[5:10] In pri tej priči mu je padla pred noge, in izdahnila je. In ko mladeniči vstopijo, najdejo jo mrtvo, in odnesó jo ven in pokopljejo poleg moža njenega. 
[5:11] In obšel je strah velik vso cerkev, in vse, kteri so to slišali. 
[5:12] Po rokah pa aposteljnov godilo se je veliko znamenj in čudežev med ljudstvom: (In bili so vsi ene misli v lopi Solomonovej; 
[5:13] A od drugih jim se ni upal nihče pridružiti: nego poveličevalo jih je ljudstvo. 
[5:14] In če dalje bolj so pristopali, kteri so verovali Gospodu, množice móž in pa žen.) 
[5:15] Tako, da so bolnike na ulice nosili in pokladali na postelje in odre, da bi vsaj senca mimo gredočega Petra koga od njih obsenčila. 
[5:16] Shajala pa se je tudi množica iz okolnih mest v Jeruzalem, in donašali so bolnike in ktere so mučili nečisti duhovi; in vsi so ozdravljali. 
[5:17] Vstavši pa véliki duhoven in vsi, kteri so bili ž njim, od ločinke Saducejske, napolnijo se nenavidnosti, 
[5:18] In položé roke svoje na aposteljne, in denejo jih v občinsko ječo. 
[5:19] Ali angelj Gospodov odprè po noči vrata ječe, in izpeljavši jih, reče: 
[5:20] Pojdite, in vstopite se, in govorite v tempeljnu ljudstvu vse besede tega življenja. 
[5:21] Oni pa, ko so to slišali, vnidejo zjutraj v tempelj, ter so učili. Ko pa pride véliki duhoven in kteri so bili ž njim, skličejo zbor in vse starešinstvo sinov Izraelovih, in pošljejo v ječo, naj jih pripeljejo. 
[5:22] Ko pa služabniki pridejo, ne najdejo jih v ječi; in vrnejo se in sporočé, 
[5:23] Govoreč: Ječo smo sicer našli z vso skrbjo zaprtó, in varuhe stoječe pred vratmi; ko smo pa odprli, nismo nikogar notri našli. 
[5:24] Ko so pa slišali te besede duhoven in pa poglavar tempeljna in véliki duhovni, strmeli so nad njimi, kaj bi to bilo. 
[5:25] Pa pride nekdo in jim sporoči, govoreč: Glej, možjé, ktere ste deli v ječo, stojé v tempeljnu in učé ljudstvo. 
[5:26] Tedaj odide poglavar s služabniki, ter jih pripelje, ne s silo, ker so se bali ljudstva, da jih ne bi kamenjalo. 
[5:27] In ko jih pripeljejo, postavijo jih pred zbor, in vpraša jih véliki duhoven, 
[5:28] Govoreč: Ali vam nismo ostro naročili, da ne učite v to ime? in glej, napolnili ste Jeruzalem z naukom svojim, in hočete na nas spraviti kri tega človeka. 
[5:29] Odgovarjajoč pa Peter in aposteljni, rekó: Boga je treba bolj poslušati, nego ljudî. 
[5:30] Bog očakov naših je obudil Jezusa, kterega ste vi na les obesili in umorili. 
[5:31] Tega je Bog z desnico svojo povišal za poglavarja in zveličarja, da dá Izraelu pokoro in odpuščanje grehov. 
[5:32] In mi smo mu priče teh reči, in pa Duh sveti, kterega je dal Bog tem, kteri so njemu pokorni. 
[5:33] Ko so pa to slišali, srdili so se, in mislili so jih umoriti. 
[5:34] Pa vstane neki Farizej v zboru, Hamaliel po imenu, učenik postave spoštovan od vsega ljudstva, in ukaže, naj aposteljne malo ven denejo. 
[5:35] In reče jim: Možjé Izraelci! pomislite dobro za te ljudí, kaj hočete storiti. 
[5:36] Kajti pred temi dnevi je vstal Tevda, govoreč, da je on nekaj, in pridružilo mu se je število móž kakih štiri sto; on je bil ubit, in vsi, kteri so ga poslušali, razšli so se, in bili so na nič dejani. 
[5:37] Za tem je vstal Juda Galilejec, v dnéh popisovanja, in potegnil je dosti ljudstva za seboj; in on je poginil, in vsi, kteri so ga poslušali, razkropili so se. 
[5:38] In za to vam sedaj pravim, da odstopite od teh ljudi, in pustíte jih; kajti če je od ljudî ta naklep ali to delo, razdrlo se bo; 
[5:39] Če je pa od Boga, ne morete ga razdreti: da se kako ne najde nad vami, da se Bogu ustavljate. 
[5:40] In poslušali so ga, in poklicavši aposteljne, pretepó jih, in naročé jim, naj ne govoré v ime Jezusovo, ter jih izpusté. 
[5:41] In oni so šli veseli izpred zbora, da so bili vredni spoznani, za ime njegovo sramoto prejeti. 
[5:42] In niso nehali v tempeljnu in po hišah vsak dan učiti in oznanjevati Jezusa Kristusa. 
[6:1] V te dní pa, ko so se učenci množili, vstane godrnjanje Grkov zoper Hebrejce, da se pri vsakdanjej delitvi njih vdove zanemarjajo. 
[6:2] In dvanajsteri pokličejo množico učencev, in rekó: To ne gre, da bi mi besedo Božjo opuščali, in oskrbljevali mize. 
[6:3] Ozrite se torej, bratje, po sedmih možéh poštenih izmed sebe, kteri so polni Duha svetega in modrosti, da jih postavimo nad tem opravilom; 
[6:4] A mi se bomo molitve in službe besede držali. 
[6:5] In ta beseda je bila vsej množici po godi; ter izvolijo Štefana, moža polnega vere in Duha svetega, in Filipa, in Prohora, in Nikanora, Timona in Parmena, in Nikolaja izpreobrnjenca iz Antijohije. 
[6:6] Te postavijo pred aposteljne; in molivši, položé na-nje roke. 
[6:7] In beseda Božja je rastla, in število učencev se je silno množilo v Jeruzalemu; tudi velika truma duhovnov je bila pokorna veri. 
[6:8] Štefan pa, poln vere in moči, delal je čudeže in velika znamenja med ljudmi. 
[6:9] In vstane jih nekaj iz shajališča, ktero se imenuje Libertinsko in Cirenejsko in Aleksandrinsko, in teh, kteri so bili iz Cilicije in Azije, in prepirali so se s Štefanom; 
[6:10] Ali niso se mogli upirati modrosti in Duhu, po kterem je govoril. 
[6:11] Tedaj podšuntajo možé, kteri naj bi rekli: Slišali smo ga govoriti kletvine zoper Mojzesa in Boga. 
[6:12] Ter nadražijo ljudstvo in starešine in pismarje, in napadejo in zgrabijo ga, in pripeljejo v zbor, 
[6:13] In postavijo krive priče, ktere so govorile: Ta človek ne neha govoriti kletvin zoper to sveto mesto in postavo. 
[6:14] Slišali smo ga namreč, da pravi: Ta Jezus Nazarečan bo razdel to mesto, in premenil bo šege, ktere nam je izročil Mojzes. 
[6:15] In pogledavši na-nj vsi, kteri so sedeli v zboru, videli so obličje njegovo kakor obličje angelja. 
[7:1] Tedaj reče véliki duhoven: Je li to tako? 
[7:2] On pa reče: Možjé bratje in očetje, poslušajte! Bog slave se je prikazal očetu našemu Abrahamu, ko je bil v Mezopotamiji, predno se je nastanil v Haranu, 
[7:3] In rekel mu je: "Izidi iz zemlje svoje, in od rodovine svoje, in pojdi v zemljo, ktero ti bom pokazal." 
[7:4] Tedaj je izšel iz zemlje Kaldejske, in nastanil se je v Haranu. In odtod, ko je bil oče njegov umrl, preselil ga je v zemljo, v kterej vi sedaj prebivate. 
[7:5] In ni mu dal nasledstva v njej, ne za stopinjo noge; in obljubil jo je bil njemu dati v posest, in semenu njegovemu za njim, ko še ni imel sina. 
[7:6] Rekel pa je Bog tako: "Seme tvoje bo tuje v tujej zemlji, in podvrgli ga bodo sužnosti, in hudo bodo delali ž njim, štiri sto let. 
[7:7] In narod, kteremu bodo služili, sodil bom jaz," rekel je Bog; "in po tem bodo izšli, in služili bodo meni na tem mestu." 
[7:8] In dal mu je zavezo obreze; in tako je rodil Izaka, in obrezal ga je osmi dan; in Izak Jakoba, in Jakob dvanajstere očake. 
[7:9] In očaki so iz nevošljivosti Jožefa prodali v Egipet; in bil je Bog ž njim. 
[7:10] In rešil ga je iz vseh nadlog njegovih, in dal mu je milost in modrost pred Faraonom kraljem Egiptovskim, in postavil ga je za poglavarja nad Egiptom in vso hišo svojo. 
[7:11] Prišla pa je lakota na vso zemljo Egiptovsko in Kanaansko, in velika nadloga; in niso našli živeža očaki naši. 
[7:12] Slišavši pa Jakob, da je žita v Egiptu, poslal je prvikrat očake naše. 
[7:13] In v drugo so spoznali Jožefa bratje njegovi, in znana je postala Faraonu rodovina Jožefova. 
[7:14] Poslavši pa Jožef, poklical je očeta svojega Jakoba, in vso rodovino svojo, pet in sedemdeset duš. 
[7:15] In sešel je Jakob v Egipet, in umrl je on in očetje naši; 
[7:16] In prenesli so jih v Sihem, in položili v grob, kterega je kupil Abraham za ceno srebra od sinov Hemorja očeta Sihemovega. 
[7:17] Ko se je pa bližal čas obljube, ktero je prisegel Bog Abrahamu, narastlo je ljudstvo in umnožilo se v Egiptu, 
[7:18] Dokler ni vstal drugi kralj, kteri ni poznal Jožefa. 
[7:19] Ta je zvijaško storil z rodom našim, in zatrl je očete naše, da so morali izpostavljati otroke svoje, da ne živé. 
[7:20] V ta čas se je rodil Mojzes, in bil je prijeten Bogu: kteri je bil tri mesece rejen v hiši očeta svojega. 
[7:21] A ko je izpostavljen bil, vzela ga je hči Faraonova, in odgojila ga je sebi za sina. 
[7:22] In naučil se je Mojzes vse modrosti Egiptovske; in bil je mogočen v besedah in v dejanjih. 
[7:23] Ko je pa dopolnil štirideset let, prišlo mu je na misel obiskati brate svoje sinove Izraelove. 
[7:24] In ko je videl nekoga, da trpí krivico, obranil ga je, in maščeval je tega, kteri je krivico trpel, in ubil je Egipčana. 
[7:25] Menil je pa, da bratje njegovi umejo, da jim po njegovej roki hoče dati Bog odrešenje ali oni niso razumeli. 
[7:26] A drugi dan je prišel k njim, ko so se bojevali, in miril jih je, govoreč: "Možjé, vi ste bratje; po kaj delate krivico eden drugemu?" 
[7:27] Tisti pa, ki je delal krivico bližnjemu, odpahne ga, govoreč: Kdo te je postavil za poglavarja in sodnika nad nami? 
[7:28] Ali me ti hočeš ubiti, kakor si ubil včeraj Egipčana?" 
[7:29] Mojzes je pa pobegnil na to besedo, in bil je tujec v zemlji Madijamskej, kjer je rodil dva sina. 
[7:30] In ko se je dopolnilo štirideset let, prikazal mu se je v puščavi gore Sinajske angelj Gospodov v plamenu gorečega grma. 
[7:31] Mojzes pa, ko je to videl, začudil se je prikazni; in ko je pristopil, da bi pogledal, oglasil mu se je glas Gospodov: 
[7:32] "Jaz sem Bog očetov tvojih, Bog Abrahamov in Bog Izakov in Bog Jakobov." Mojzes pa je strepetal, in ni upal pogledati. 
[7:33] Reče pa mu Gospod: "Izuj obutalo z nog svojih; kajti mesto, na kterem stojiš, sveta je zemlja. 
[7:34] Dobro sem videl stisko naroda svojega, ki je v Egiptu, in njih zdihovanje sem slišal; in sešel sem, da jih rešim. In sedaj pridi, poslal te bom v Egipet." 
[7:35] Tega Mojzesa, kteremu so se bili uprli, govoreč: "Kdo te je postavil za poglavarja in sodnika? tega je Bog za poglavarja in odrešenika poslal po roki angelja, kteri mu se je bil prikazal v grmu. 
[7:36] Ta jih je izpeljal, delajoč čudeže in znamenja v zemlji Egiptovskej in Rdečem morji, in v puščavi štirideset let. 
[7:37] Ta je tisti Mojzes, ki je rekel sinovom Izraelovim: "Preroka vam bo obudil Gospod Bog izmed bratov vaših, kakor mene; njega poslušajte." 
[7:38] Ta je tisti, ki je bil pri množici v puščavi z angeljem, kteri mu je govoril na gori Sinajskej, in z očeti našimi, kteri je prejel besede življenja, da jih nam dá; 
[7:39] Kteremu niso hoteli pokorni biti očetje naši, nego so ga zavrgli, in obrnili srca svoja v Egipet, 
[7:40] Rekši Aronu: "Naredi nam bogove, kteri bodo hodili pred nami; kajti ta Mojzes, ki nas je izpeljal iz zemlje Egiptovske, ne vémo, kaj mu se je zgodilo." 
[7:41] In vlili so tele tiste dni, in darovali so daritev maliku, in veselili so se del rok svojih. 
[7:42] In odvrnil se je Bog, in izdal jih je, naj služijo ozvezdju neba, kakor je pisano v bukvah prerokov: "Ali ste mi darovali zaklanice in daritve štirideset let v puščavi, hiša Izraelova? 
[7:43] In ponesli ste šator Molohov, in zvezdo boga svojega Remfana, podobe, ktere ste naredili, da ste jim se poklanjali; in preselil vas bom za Babilon." 
[7:44] Šator pričevanja so imeli očetje naši v puščavi, kakor jim je zapovedal ta, ki je rekel Mojzesu, naj ga naredí po podobi, ktero je videl; 
[7:45] Kterega so tudi prejeli očetje naši, in ponesli z Jezusom, v posestvo poganov, ktere je izgnal Bog izpred obličja očetov naših, noter do dnî Davida; 
[7:46] Kteri je milost našel pred Bogom, in je prosil, da bi našel prebivališče Bogu Jakobovemu. 
[7:47] A Solomon mu je sezidal hišo. 
[7:48] Ali Najviši ne prebiva v tempeljnih z rokami narejenih, kakor prerok pravi: 
[7:49] "Nebo mi je stol, in zemlja podnožje nogam mojim. Kakošno hišo mi boste zidali? pravi Gospod. Ali ktero je mesto za počivanje moje? 
[7:50] Ni li roka moja vsega tega naredila?" 
[7:51] Trdovratni in neobrezanih src in ušes! vi se vedno Duhu svetemu upirate; kakor očetje vaši, tudi vi. 
[7:52] Kterega od prerokov niso pregnali očetje vaši? In pomorili so te, kteri so naprej oznanili prihod pravičnega, kakor izdajalci in ubijalci ste sedaj vi postali; 
[7:53] Kteri ste prejeli postavo po naredbi angeljev, in je niste ohranili. 
[7:54] Ko so pa to slišali, togotili so se v srcih svojih, in škripali so z zobmí zoper njega. 
[7:55] On pa, poln Duha svetega, ozrè se na nebo, in ugleda slavo Božjo, in Jezusa, da stojí na desnici Božjej. 
[7:56] In reče: Glej, vidim nebesa odprta, in sina človečjega, da stoji na desnici Božjej. 
[7:57] In zakričavši z močnim glasom, zataknejo ušesa svoja, in planejo ene misli na-nj. 
[7:58] In izpahnivši ga ven iz mesta, pobijali so ga s kamenjem. In priče so položile oblačila svoja pred noge mladeniču, kteremu je bilo imel Savel. 
[7:59] In pobijali so s kamenjem Štefana, kteri je klical in govoril: Gospod Jezus, sprejmi duh moj! 
[7:60] In pokleknivši, zavpije z močnim glasom: Gospod, ne postavi jim tega greha! In rekši to, zaspal je. 
[8:1] Savel pa je bil privolil na njegovo smrt. In vstalo je ta dan veliko preganjanje zoper cerkev, ktera je bila v Jeruzalemu; in vsi so se razkropili po krajih Judejskih in Samarijskih, razen aposteljnov. 
[8:2] Pokopali pa so Štefana možjé pobožni, in plakali so zeló za njim. 
[8:3] A Savel je zatiral cerkev, in hodil je po hišah, in vlačil je možé in žene, ter izdajal v ječo. 
[8:4] Tí pa, kteri so se bili razkropili, hodili so okrog, oznanjujoč besedo. 
[8:5] A Filip, ko jo prišel dol v mesto Samarijsko, oznanjeval jim je Kristusa. 
[8:6] In pazilo je ljudstvo enega duha na to, kar je Filip pravil, poslušajoč in gledajoč znamenja, ktera je delal. 
[8:7] Kajti duhovi nečisti so iz mnogih, kteri so jih imeli, vpijoč z močnim glasom, izhajali. In veliko mrtvoudnih in hromih je ozdravelo. 
[8:8] In bila je velika radost v tem mestu. 
[8:9] Bil je pa neki mož po imenu Simon, kteri je poprej čaral v mestu, in mamil ljudstvo Samarijsko, govoreč, da je on nekaj velikega; 
[8:10] Kterega so vsi poslušali od najmanjega do največega, govoreč: Ta je vélika moč Božja. 
[8:11] Poslušali so ga pa za to, ker jih je bil dolgo časa mamil s čarobnimi deli. 
[8:12] Ko so pa verovali Filipu, kteri je oznanjeval, kar kraljestvo Božje in ime Jezusa Kristusa zadeva, krščevali so se možjé in žene. 
[8:13] Tedaj je Simon tudi sam veroval; in krstivši se, držal se je Filipa. In videč znamenja in čudeže velike, kteri so se godili, strmel je. 
[8:14] Slišavši pa aposteljni, kteri so bili v Jeruzalemu, da je sprejela Samarija besedo Božjo, pošljejo jim Petra in Janeza. 
[8:15] In ko sta prišla dol, molila sta za-nje, da bi prejeli Duha svetega. 
[8:16] (Kajti na nobenega od njih še ni bil prišel, nego bili so samo krščeni v ime Gospoda Jezusa.) 
[8:17] Tedaj sta pokladala roke na-nje, in prejemali so Duhu svetega. 
[8:18] Videvši pa Simon, da se po pokladanji rok aposteljnov daje Duh sveti, prinese jima denarjev, 
[8:19] Govoreč: Dajta tudi meni to oblast, da, na kogarkoli položim roke, prejme Duha svetega. 
[8:20] Peter mu pa reče: Srebro tvoje naj s teboj vred pogine, da si pomislil, da se dar Božji more dobiti za denarje. 
[8:21] Nimaš ga dela ne deleža v tej reči; kajti srce tvoje ni pravo pred Bogom. 
[8:22] Spokóri se torej od te hudobije svoje, in prosi Boga, da bi li se odpustila misel srca tvojega. 
[8:23] Kajti vidim te, da si v grenkem žolči in zvezi krivice. 
[8:24] Odgovarjajoč pa Simon, reče: Prosita vidva za-me Gospoda, da ne pride nič tega na mé, kar sta rekla. 
[8:25] Ona tedaj, popričavši in govorivši besedo Gospodovo, vrnila sta se v Jeruzalem, in mnogim vasém Samarijanskim sta oznanila evangelj. 
[8:26] Angelj pa Gospodov reče Filipu, govoreč: Vstani in pojdi proti poldnevu, na cesto, ktera peljá iz Jeruzalema dol v Gazo; ona je pusta. 
[8:27] In vstavši, odšel je. In glej, mož iz Etijopije skopljenec, komornik Kandake Kraljice Etijopske, kteri je bil nad vsemi zakladi njenimi, in je bil prišel molit v Jeruzalem, 
[8:28] Vračal se je, in sedeč na vozu svojem, prebiral je preroka Izaija. 
[8:29] Duh pa reče Filipu: Pristopi in pridruži se temu vozu. 
[8:30] Pritekši pa Filip, sliši ga, da bere preroka Izaija, ter reče: Ali pa umeš, kar bereš? 
[8:31] On pa reče: Kako bi mogel, če me kdo ne napoti? Ter zaprosi Filipa, naj vstopi in sede k njemu. 
[8:32] Vrsta pa pisma, ktero je bral, bila je ta: Kakor ovca na zaklanje se je odpeljal, in kakor je jagnje pred tistim, kteri ga striže, brez glasú: tako ni odprl ust svojih. 
[8:33] V ponižanji njegovem se je preklicala sodba njegova; a rod njegov kdo bo razložil? kajti življenje njegovo se bo vzelo od zemlje." 
[8:34] Odgovarjajoč pa skopljenec Filipu, reče: Prosim te, o kom govorí to prerok? o sebi, ali o kterem drugem? 
[8:35] Filip pa odpre usta svoja, in začenši od tega pisma, oznani mu Jezusa. 
[8:36] Ko sta pa šla po poti, prideta k nekej vodi: in skopljenec reče: Glej, voda! kaj brani krstiti mi se? 
[8:37] Filip pa reče: Če veruješ iz vsega srca, smeš. In odgovarjajoč, reče: Verujem, da je Jezus Kristus sin Božji. 
[8:38] In ukaže voz ustaviti: in snideta oba v vodo, Filip in pa skopljenec: in krsti ga. 
[8:39] Ko sta bila pa izšla iz vode, vzel je Duh Gospodov Filipa; in ni ga več videl skopljenec: šel je pa vesel svoj pot. 
[8:40] A Filip se je našel v Azotu; in gredoč skozi, oznanjeval je evangelj vsem mestom, dokler ni prišel v Cezarejo. 
[9:1] Savel pa, kteri je še dihtel pretenje in smrt zoper učence Gospodove, pristopi k vélikemu duhovnu, 
[9:2] In izprosi od njega pisem v Damask do shajališč, da če najde koga od tega pota, bodi si možé ali žene, da jih zvezane pripelje v Jeruzalem. 
[9:3] A ko je bil na poti, zgodí se, da se je bližal Damasku: in nagloma ga obsije svetloba z neba. 
[9:4] In padši na zemljo, zasliši glas, da mu pravi: Savel, Savel, kaj me preganjaš? 
[9:5] Pa reče: Kdo si, Gospod? A Gospod reče: Jaz sem Jezus, kterega ti preganjaš; težko ti je proti ostnu brcati. 
[9:6] In trepetaje in strmeč, reče: Gospod! Kaj hočeš, da naj storím? In Gospod mu reče: Vstani in vnidi v mesto, in tam ti se bo povedalo, kaj ti je treba storiti. 
[9:7] Možjé pa, kteri so ž njim šli, ustavili so se, in strmeli so, ko so glas sicer slišali, pa nikogar niso videli. 
[9:8] In vstal je Savel od tâl; in z odprtimi očmí svojimi ni nikogar videl. Tedaj ga primejo za roko in pripeljejo v Damask. 
[9:9] In tri dní ni videl, in ni jedel ne pil. 
[9:10] Bil je pa neki učenec v Damasku po imenu Ananija; in reče mu Gospod v prikazni: Ananija! On pa reče: Glej me, Gospod! 
[9:11] A Gospod njemu: Vstani in pojdi v ulico, ktera se imenuje Ravna, in vprašaj v hiši Judovej po imenu Savla, Taršana. Kajti glej, moli, 
[9:12] In videl je v prikazni moža po imenu Ananija, da je vstopil in položil na-nj roko, da spregleda. 
[9:13] Ananija pa odgovorí: Gospod! slišal sem od mnogih za tega moža, koliko hudega je storil svetim tvojim v Jeruzalemu. 
[9:14] In tu ima oblast od vélikih duhovnov vezati vse, kteri kličejo ime tvoje. 
[9:15] Pa mu Gospod reče: Pojdi; kajti posoda izvoljena mi je on, da ponese ime moje pred pogane in kralje, in sinove Izraelove. 
[9:16] Jaz namreč mu bom pokazal, koliko mu je treba za ime moje pretrpeti. 
[9:17] In Ananija odide, in vnide v hišo, in položivši na-nj roke, reče: Savel brat! Gospod me je poslal, Jezus, kteri ti se je prikazal na poti, po kterej si šel, da spregledaš in se napolniš Duha svetega. 
[9:18] In precej so odpadle od očî njegovih kakor luskinje, in spregledal je precej, in vstavši, krstil se je; 
[9:19] In vzemši jedí, okrepčal se je. Bil je pa Savel z učenci, kteri so bili v Damasku, nekaj dnî, 
[9:20] In precej je po shajališčih oznanjeval Jezusa, da je on sin Božji. 
[9:21] In zavzemali so se vsi, kteri so poslušali, in govorili so: Ni li ta tisti, ki je pregnal v Jeruzalemu te, kteri so klicali to ime, in je za to sem prišel, da jih povezane popelje vélikim duhovnom? 
[9:22] Savel pa je če dalje močneji prihajal, in osramotoval je Jude, kteri so prebivali v Damasku, dokazujoč, da je ta Kristus. 
[9:23] Ko je pa minolo dosti dní, posvetujejo se Judje, da bi ga umorili. 
[9:24] Ali Savel zvé njih zalezovanje. In stražili so pri vratih noč in dan, da bi ga umorili. 
[9:25] Ali učenci ga vzemó po noči, in spusté po zidu, po vrvi v koši. 
[9:26] Ko je pa prišel Savel v Jeruzalem, izkusil se je pridružiti učencem; ali vsi so se ga bali, ker niso verjeli, da je učenec. 
[9:27] Barnaba ga pa vzeme in pripelje k aposteljnom, in razloží jim, kako je bil na poti videl Gospoda, in da je ž njim govoril, in kako je v Damasku srčno oznanjeval ime Jezusovo. 
[9:28] In prebival je ž njimi v Jeruzalemu; in srčno je oznanjeval ime Gospoda Jezusa. 
[9:29] In govoril je in se prepiral z Grki; a oni so gledali, da bi ga umorili. 
[9:30] Zvedevši pa to bratje, odpeljejo ga dol v Cezarejo, in pošljejo ga v Tars. 
[9:31] In cerkve po vsej Judeji in Galileji in Samariji so imele mir, in utrjevale so se, in hodile so v strahu Gospodovem, in umnoževale so se s tolažbo Duha svetega. 
[9:32] Zgodí se pa, da Peter, ko je obiskoval vse, pride tudi k svetim, kteri so prebivali v Lidi. 
[9:33] In tu najde nekega človeka Eneja po imenu, kteri je uže osem let ležal na odru, in je bil mrtvouden. 
[9:34] In reče mu Peter: Eneja! Jezus Kristus te uzdravlja; vstani in postelji si sam. In precej je vstal. 
[9:35] In videli so ga vsi, kteri so prebivali v Lidi in Saronu, in izpreobrnili so se h Gospodu. 
[9:36] A v Jopi je bila neka učenka po imenu Tabita (ktera se, če raztolmačiš, imenuje Srna); ta je bila polna dobrih del in miloščin, ktere je dajala. 
[9:37] Zgodilo pa se je v te dni, da je zbolela in umrla; in omivši jo, položili so jo v vrhnjo izbo. 
[9:38] Ker je pa Lida blizu Jope, in so učenci slišali, da je Peter v njej, pošljejo dva moža k njemu, proseč, naj ne odlaša priti do njih. 
[9:39] Vstavši pa Peter, odide ž njima; in ko pride, odpeljejo ga v vrhnjo izbo, in obstopijo ga vse vdove, jokajoč in pokazujoč suknje in oblačila, ktera jim je delala Srna, dokler je bila ž njimi. 
[9:40] Izgnavši pa vse ven Peter, poklekne in moli; in obrnivši se k truplu, reče: Tabita, vstani! In ona odpre očí svoje; in ko ugleda Petra, sede. 
[9:41] In podavši jej roko, vzdigne jo; in poklicavši svete in vdove, pokaže jo živo. 
[9:42] In razglasí se po vsej Jopi, in veliko jih je verovalo v Gospoda. 
[9:43] Zgodí pa se, da je dosti dnî prebil v Jopi pri nekem Simonu strojarji. 
[10:1] Bil je pa neki mož v Cezareji po imenu Kornelij, stotnik trume, ktera se je imenovala Italijska, 
[10:2] Pobožen in bogaboječ z vso hišo svojo, kteri je dajal veliko miloščine ljudém, in je molil k Bogu neprenehoma; 
[10:3] Videl je v prikazni razločno, okoli devete ure dné, angelja Božjega, da je prišel k njemu, in mu je rekel: Kornelij! 
[10:4] On pa, pogledavši na-nj in uplašivši se, reče: Kaj je, Gospod? Pa mu reče: Molitve tvoje in miloščine tvoje so prišle v spomin pred Bogom. 
[10:5] In sedaj pošlji v Jopo móž, in pokliči Simona, kteri ima priimek Peter; 
[10:6] On gostuje pri nekem Simonu strojarji, komur je hiša pri morji: on ti bo povedal, kaj ti je treba storiti. 
[10:7] Ko je pa angelj, kteri je s Kornelijem govoril, odšel, pokliče dva od domačih svojih, in pobožnega vojaka izmed teh, kteri so mu služili; 
[10:8] In razloživši jim vse, pošlje jih v Jopo. 
[10:9] A drugi dan, ko so bili ti na poti in so se mestu bližali, izide Peter na streho molit, okoli šeste ure, 
[10:10] In postane lačen, in hotel je jesti. Ko so pa oni pripravljali, zamakne se, 
[10:11] In ugleda nebo odprto, in nekako posodo da shaja na-nj, kakor velik prt, za čvetere ogle privezana, in se spušča na zemljo; 
[10:12] V kterej so bile vse štirinogate in divje in lazeče živali zemlje, in tice nebeške. 
[10:13] In oglasí mu se glas: Vstani, Peter, zakolji in jej! 
[10:14] Peter pa reče: Nikakor ne, Gospod! kajti nikoli nisem jedel kaj nagnjusnega ali nečistega. 
[10:15] In glas mu zopet v drugo reče: Kar je Bog očistil, ne imej ti za nagnjusno. 
[10:16] To pa se je zgodilo trikrat. In zopet se je vzela posoda gor na nebo. 
[10:17] Ko je pa Peter sam pri sebi strmel, kaj bi bila ta prikazen, ktero je videl, in glej, možjé, kteri so bili poslani od Kornelija, izprašali so hišo Simonovo, in stali so pred vratmi; 
[10:18] In poklicavši, vpraševali so, če Simon s priimkom Peter tu gostuje. 
[10:19] Ko je pa Peter premišljeval o prikazni, reče mu Duh: Glej, trije možjé te iščejo; 
[10:20] Vstani torej, in snidi, in pojdi ž njimi, brez pomišljevanja; kajti jaz sem jih poslal. 
[10:21] In Peter snide k možém, kteri so bili od Kornelija k njemu poslani, in reče: Glej, jaz sem, kterega iščete; kaj je vzrok, za voljo kterega ste prišli? 
[10:22] Oni pa rekó: Kornelij stotnik, mož pravičen in pobožen, imajoč dobro pričevanje od vsega naroda Judovskega, prejel je povelje od angelja svetega, naj te pokliče v hišo svojo, da sliši besede od tebe. 
[10:23] Tedaj jih noter pokliče in vzeme pod streho. A drugi dan izide Peter ž njimi, in nekaj bratov, kteri so bili v Jopi, odide ž njim. 
[10:24] In drugi dan vnidejo v Cezarejo; a Kornelij jih je pričakoval, sklicavši rojake svoje in bližnje prijatelje. 
[10:25] Ko se pa zgodi, da Peter vnide, pride mu Kornelij naproti, in pade na noge, ter se pokloni. 
[10:26] Peter pa ga vzdigne, govoreč: Vstani! tudi jaz sem človek. 
[10:27] In govoreč ž njim, vnide in najde jih veliko zbranih, 
[10:28] In reče jim: Vi véste, kako nespodobno je možu Judu družiti se ali hoditi k tujcu; in meni je Bog pokazal, naj ne imenujem nikogar nagnjusnega ali nečistega. 
[10:29] Za to sem tudi brez pomišljevanja prišel, ko sem bil poklican. Vprašujem torej, iz kterega vzroka ste me poklicali? 
[10:30] In Kornelij reče: Od četrtega dné noter do te ure sem se postil, in ob devetej uri sem molil v hiši svojej; in glej, mož se postavi pred menoj v svetlem oblačilu, in reče: 
[10:31] Kornelij, uslišana je molitev tvoja, in miloščine tvoje so v spominu pred Bogom. 
[10:32] Pošlji torej v Jopo, in pokliči Simona s priimkom Petra; on gostuje v hiši Simona strojarja pri morji: on ti bo povedal, ko pride. 
[10:33] Za to sem precej poslal k tebi; in ti si prav storil, da si prišel. Sedaj torej vsi mí pred Bogom stojimo, da slišimo vse, kar ti je zapovedano od Boga. 
[10:34] Tedaj Peter odpre usta, in reče: V resnici vidim, da Bog ne gleda na lice, 
[10:35] Nego v vsakem narodu, kdor se ga bojí in dela pravico, prijeten mu je. 
[10:36] Besedo, ktero je poslal sinovom Izraelovim, oznanjujoč mir po Jezusu Kristusu (ta je vsem Gospod): 
[10:37] Vi véste, kaj se je zgodilo po vsej Judeji, počenši od Galileje, po krstu, kterega je oznanjeval Janez: 
[10:38] Jezusa iz Nazareta, kako ga je pomazilil Bog z Duhom svetim in močjó; kteri je prešel, delajoč dobroto in uzdravljajoč vse, ktere je bil hudič posedel, ker je bil Bog ž njim. 
[10:39] In mi smo priče vsemu, kar je storil v deželi Judovskej, in v Jeruzalemu: kterega so na les obesili in umorili. 
[10:40] Tega je Bog obudil tretji dan, in dal mu je, da se je pokazal. 
[10:41] Ne vsemu ljudstvu, nego pričam poprej izvoljenim od Boga, nam, kteri smo ž njim jedli in pili, potem ko je bil vstal od mrtvih, 
[10:42] In ukazal nam je, naj oznanjujemo ljudstvu, in pričamo, da je on odločeni od Boga sodnik živih in mrtvih. 
[10:43] Temu vsi preroki pričajo, da bo po imenu njegovem prejel odpuščanje grehov vsak, kdor veruje va-nj. 
[10:44] Ko je Peter še govoril te besede, pade Duh sveti na vse, kteri so poslušali. 
[10:45] In zavzemó se verni iz obreze, kteri so bili s Petrom prišli, da se je tudi na pogane izlil dar Duha svetega; 
[10:46] Kajti slišali so jih govoriti jezike, in poveličevati Boga. Tedaj odgovorí Peter: 
[10:47] Ali more kdo vodo zabraniti, da se ne bi krstili ti, ki so Duha svetega prejeli, kakor tudi mi? 
[10:48] In ukaže jih krstiti v ime Gospoda. Tedaj ga zaprosijo, naj bi ostal pri njih nekoliko dnî. 
[10:49] 
[11:1] Slišali pa so aposteljni in bratje, kteri so bili v Judeji, da so tudi pogani sprejeli besedo Božjo. 
[11:2] In ko je prišel Peter v Jeruzalem, prepirali so se z njim, kteri so bili iz obreze, 
[11:3] Govoreč: K možém neobrezanim si šel, in jedel si ž njimi. 
[11:4] Peter pa začne, in izkladal jim je po vrsti, govoreč: 
[11:5] Jaz sem v mestu Jopi molil, in videl sem v zamaknenji prikazen, da je shajala nekaka posoda, kakor velik prt, in se je za čvetere ogle spuščala z neba, in prišla noter do mene. 
[11:6] In pogledavši va-njo, opazim in ugledam štirinogate in divje in lazeče živali zemlje, in tice nebeške. 
[11:7] In zaslišim glas, da mi pravi: Vstani, Peter, zakolji in jej! 
[11:8] In rekel sem; Nikakor ne, Gospod! kajti nagnjusnega ali nečistega ni nikoli nič prišlo v usta moja. 
[11:9] Odgovorí pa mi glas v drugo z neba: Kar je Bog očistil, ne imej ti za nagnjusno. 
[11:10] To pa se je zgodilo trikrat, in zopet se je potegnilo vse na nebo. 
[11:11] In glej, precej se trije možjé postavijo pred hišo, v kterej sem bil, poslani iz Cezareje k meni. 
[11:12] In reče mi Duh, naj grem brez pomišljevanja ž njimi. Prišlo je pa z menoj tudi tehle šest bratov, in vstopili smo v hišo moževo. 
[11:13] In povedal nam je, kako je videl angelja v hiši svojej, da je pristopil in mu rekel: Pošlji v Jopo móž, in pokliči Simona s priimkom Petra, 
[11:14] Kteri ti bo govoril besede, po kterih se boš zveličal ti in vsa hiša tvoja. 
[11:15] Ko sem pa jel govoriti, pade sveti Duh na-nje, kakor tudi na nas v začetku. 
[11:16] Tedaj sem se spomenil besede Gospodove, kakor je povedal: "Janez sicer je krstil z vodo, ali vi se boste krstili z Duhom svetim." 
[11:17] Ko jim je torej Bog dal ravno ta dar, kakor tudi nam, kteri smo verovali v Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa: kdo pa sem bil jaz, da bi bil mogel Bogu zabraniti? 
[11:18] Ko so pa to slišali, umolknili so, in slavili so Boga, govoreč: Torej tudi poganom je Bog dal pokoro za življenje. 
[11:19] Ti pa, kteri so se bili razkropili za voljo stiske, ktera je nastala za Štefana, prišli so noter do Fenicije, nikomur ne govoreč besede, razen samo Judom. 
[11:20] Bili so pa nekteri od njih možjé Ciprani in Cirenci, kteri so, ko so bili prišli v Antijohijo, govorili tudi Grkom, in oznanjevali Gospoda Jezusa. 
[11:21] In bila je roka Gospodova ž njimi; in veliko število jih je verovalo in izpreobrnilo se h Gospodu. 
[11:22] In prišel je glas o tem do ušes cerkve, ktera je bila v Jeruzalemu; in poslali so Barnaba, naj odide do Antijohije. 
[11:23] Ta, ko je prišel, in je videl milost Božjo, oveselil se je, in prosil je vse, naj s stanovitnim srcem ostanejo v Gospodu. 
[11:24] Kajti bil je mož dober in poln Duha svetega in vere. In pridružilo se je veliko ljudstva Gospodu. 
[11:25] Tedaj izide Barnaba v Tars iskat Savla; in ko ga je našel, pripelje ga v Antijohijo. 
[11:26] In zbirala sta se celo leto v cerkvi, in učila sta dosti ljudstva, in imenovali so se učenci najprej v Antijohiji Kristjani. 
[11:27] V te dní so pa prišli iz Jeruzalema preroki v Antijohijo. 
[11:28] In vstavši eden od njih po imenu Agab, oznani po Duhu, da bo lakota velika po vsem svetu; ktera je tudi bila za Klavdija cesarja. 
[11:29] Tedaj učenci, vsak po zmožnosti svojej, sklenejo v pomoč poslati bratom, kteri so prebivali v Judeji; 
[11:30] Kar so tudi storili, poslavši starešinam po roki Barnabovej in Savlovej. 
[12:1] V ta čas pa vzdigne Herod kralj roke, da bi nektere od cerkve mučil. 
[12:2] In umorí Jakoba brata Janezovega z mečem. 
[12:3] In videvši, da je po godi Judom, sklene tudi Petra vjeti (bili so pa dnevi presnih kruhov); 
[12:4] Kterega je tudi vjel in posadil v ječo, in izročil štirim četvericam vojakov, naj ga varujejo, in hotel ga je po Velikej noči izpeljati pred ljudstvo. 
[12:5] Petra torej so sicer varovali v ječi; a cerkev je molila za-nj k Bogu neprenehoma. 
[12:6] Ko ga je pa imel Herod izpeljati, tisto noč je spal Peter med dvema vojakoma, okovan v dvojne verige; a varuhi pred vratmi so stražili ječo. 
[12:7] In glej, angelj Gospodov pristopi, in svetloba se zasveti v ječi; in udarivši Petra v rebra, zbudí ga, govoreč: Vstani hitro! In spadle so mu verige z rok. 
[12:8] In reče mu angelj: Opaši se, in obuj opanke svoje. In storil je tako. In reče mu: Ogrni plašč svoj, in pojdi za menoj. 
[12:9] In izšel je, in šel je za njim; in ni vedel, da je res, kar se je godilo po angelji, nego menil je, da vidi prikazen. 
[12:10] Ko sta bila pa prešla mimo prve straže in druge, prideta do železnih vrat, ktera so držala v mesto, in ta jima se sama od sebe odpró. Ter izideta, in prideta v eno ulico, in precej odstopi angelj od njega. 
[12:11] In ko pride Peter k sebi, reče: Sedaj vém res, da je poslal Gospod angelja svojega, in me je otel iz roke Herodove in vsega čakanja ljudstva Judovskega. 
[12:12] In razmislivši to, pride do hiše Marije matere Janeza s priimkom Marka, kjer je bilo veliko zbranih, kteri so molili. 
[12:13] Ko je pa Peter na vežna vrata potrkal, pristopi deklica po imenu Roda poslušat. 
[12:14] In spoznavši glas Petrov, od veselja ni odprla vrat, nego odbežala je noter, in sporočila je, da stojí Peter pred vratmi. 
[12:15] Oni jej pa rekó: Meša ti se. A ona je trdila, da je tako. Oni so pa govorili: Angelj njegov je. 
[12:16] A Peter je čakal in trkal. Ko pa odpró, ugledajo ga, in ostrmé. 
[12:17] Namignivši pa z roko, naj molčé, razloží jim, kako ga je Gospod izpeljal iz ječe. In reče: Sporočite to Jakobu in bratom. In izšel je, in odšel je v drugi kraj. 
[12:18] Ko se je pa zdanilo, ni bil majhen strah med vojaki, kaj da se je s Petrom zgodilo. 
[12:19] Herod pa, ko ga je zahteval in ga ni našel, izpraša varuhe, in ukaže jih odpeljati: in snide iz Judeje v Cezarejo, ter je tu živel. 
[12:20] Bil je pa Herod jezen na Tirce in Sidonce; a oni enodušno pridejo k njemu, in pregovorivši Blasta komornika kraljevega, prosili so mirú, za to, ker je njih dežela dobivala živež iz kraljeve. 
[12:21] A odločeni dan se je oblekel Herod v kraljevo oblačilo, in sedši na sodišče, govoril jim je. 
[12:22] Ljudstvo pa je vpilo: Božji glas je to, a ne človeški. 
[12:23] Pri tej priči pa ga je udaril angelj Gospodov, za to ker ni dal slave Bogu: in sneden od črvov je umrl. 
[12:24] A beseda Gospodova je rastla in razširjala se. 
[12:25] A Barnaba in Savel sta se vrnila iz Jeruzalema, ko sta bila opravila službo, in vzela sta s seboj tudi Janeza s priimkom Marka. 
[13:1] Bili so pa v cerkvi, ktera je bila v Antijohiji, nekteri preroki in učeniki: Barnaba in Simeon, ki se je imenoval Niger, in Lucij Cirenec, in Manahen, s Herodom četrtnikom odgojen, in Savel. 
[13:2] Ko so pa oni službo Gospodu opravljali in se postili, reče sveti Duh: Odločite mi Barnaba in Savla za delo, na ktero sem ju poklizal. 
[13:3] Tedaj, postivši se in molivši, položé roke na nju, ter ju odpusté. 
[13:4] Ta torej, poslana od Duha svetega, snideta v Selevcijo, in odtod se odpeljeta po morji na Ciper. 
[13:5] In ko sta prišla v Salamino, oznanjevala sta besedo Božjo po shajališčih Judovskih; imela sta pa tudi Janeza za služabnika. 
[13:6] In ko sta prešla otok noter do Pafa, najdeta nekega vražarja, lažnjivega preroka Juda, kteremu je bilo ime Barjezu, 
[13:7] In je bil z namestnikom Sergijem Pavlom, pametnim možem. Ta, poklicavši Barnaba in Savla, želel je slišati besedo Božjo. 
[13:8] Ali ustavljal jima se je Elima, vražar (tako namreč se tolmači ime njegovo), gledajoč, da bi namestnika odvrnil od vere. 
[13:9] Savel pa, ki se tudi Pavel imenuje, poln Duha svetega, pogledavši na-nj, 
[13:10] Reče: O polni vsake zvijače in vsake hudobije, sin hudičev, sovražnik vsake pravice! ali ne boš nehal prevračati pravih potov Gospodovih? 
[13:11] In sedaj, glej, roka Gospodova je zoper té, in slep boš in ne boš videl solnca do časa. In pri tej priči je padel na-nj mrak in tema, in tipajoč okoli, iskal je vodnika. 
[13:12] Tedaj je namestnik, ko je videl, kaj se je zgodilo, veroval, in čudil se je nauku Gospodovemu. 
[13:13] Odpeljavši pa se iz Pafa Pavel in kteri so bili ž njim, pridejo v Pergo Pamfilijsko. Janez pa se loči od nju, in vrne se v Jeruzalem. 
[13:14] Ona pa, ko sta bila odšla iz Perge, prideta v Antijohijo Pisidijsko, in vnideta v sobotni dan v shajališče, in sedeta. 
[13:15] Po branji postave in prerokov pa pošljejo poglavarji shajališča k njima, govoreč: Moža brata! če je v vaju beseda tolažbe za ljudstvo, govorita. 
[13:16] Vstavši torej Pavel, pomigne z roko, naj umolknejo, ter reče: Možjé Izraelci, in kteri se bojite Boga, poslušajte! 
[13:17] Bog naroda tega Izraelovega je izvolil očete naše, in povišal je ljudstvo, ko so prebivali v zemlji Egiptovskej, in s povzdigneno roko jih je izpeljal iž nje. 
[13:18] In okoli štirideset let je potrpel ž njih šegami v puščavi. 
[13:19] In pokončavši sedem narodov v zemlji Kanaanskej, razdelil jim je po kocki njih zemljo. 
[13:20] In po tem, kakih štiri sto in petdeset let, dal jim je sodnike do Samuela preroka. 
[13:21] In odtlej so zahtevali kralja, in dal jim je Bog Savla sina Kisovega, moža iz rodú Benjaminovega, štirideset let. 
[13:22] In ko je bil tega zavrgel, obudil jim je Davida za kralja, kteremu je tudi rekel, pričevaje: "Našel sem Davida Jesejevega, moža po srcu svojem, kteri bo izpolnjeval vso voljo mojo." 
[13:23] Iž njegovega semena je Bog po obljubi obudil Izraelu zveličarja Jezusa, 
[13:24] Ko je oznanil Janez pred prihodom njegovim krst pokore vsemu ljudstvu Izraelovemu. 
[13:25] Ko je pa Janez tek svoj dopolnjeval, govoril je: "Kdo menite, da sem jaz? Nisem jaz, nego glej, prišel bo za menoj, komur nisem vreden obutala odvezati z nog." 
[13:26] Možjé bratje, sinovi rodú Abrahamovega, in kteri se med vami bojé Boga! vam se je poslala beseda tega življenja. 
[13:27] Kajti tí, kteri prebivajo v Jeruzalemu, in njih poglavarji, ker tega niso poznali, odsodili so ga, in tako so glasove prerokov, kteri se vsako soboto beró, dopolnili; 
[13:28] In nobene krivice smrtne niso našli, in prosili so Pilata, naj ga pogubí. 
[13:29] In ko so dopolnili vse, kar je bilo pisano za njega, sneli so ga z lesa in položili v grob. 
[13:30] A Bog ga je obudil iz mrtvih, 
[13:31] In pokazoval se je več dnî tem, kteri so bili ž njim vred prišli iz Galileje v Jeruzalem, kteri so priče njegove pred ljudstvom. 
[13:32] In mi vam oznanjujemo obljubo, ktera se je obljubila očetom, da je to Bog izpolnil nam njih otrokom, obudivši Jezusa, 
[13:33] Kakor je tudi v drugem psalmu pisano: "Sin moj si ti; jaz sem te danes rodil." 
[13:34] Da ga je pa obudil iz mrtvih, da se ne vrne več v trohnenje, rekel je tako: "Dal vam bom svetinjo Davidovo zvesto." 
[13:35] Za to pravi tudi na drugem mestu: "Ne boš dal, da bi svetnik tvoj videl trohnenje." 
[13:36] Kajti David, ko je bil ob času svojem poslužil volji Božjej, zaspal je, in položili so ga k očetom njegovim, in videl je trohnenje. 
[13:37] Ta pa, ki ga je Bog obudil, ni videl trohnenja. 
[13:38] Znano vam torej bodi, možjé bratje! da vam se po njem odpuščanje grehov oznanjuje; 
[13:39] In od vsega, od česar se v Mojzesovej postavi niste mogli opravičiti, opravičil se bo v tem vsak, kdor veruje. 
[13:40] Glejte torej, da ne pride na vas, kar je rečeno v prerokih: 
[13:41] "Glejte, zaničevalci! in čudite se in izginite; kajti delo bom jaz storil v dnéh vaših, delo, kteremu ne boste verovali, če vam kdo pové." 
[13:42] Ko sta pa izšla iz shajališča Judovskega, prosili so ju pogani, naj bi jim drugo soboto govorila te besede. 
[13:43] In ko se je zbor razšel, odšlo je veliko Judov in pobožnih izpreobrnencev za Pavlom in Barnabom, ktera sta, govoreč jim, prigovarjala, naj ostanejo v milosti Božjej. 
[13:44] A drugo soboto se je skoro vse mesto zbralo, da bi slišali besedo Božjo. 
[13:45] Videč pa Judje ljudstvo, napolnijo se nenavidnosti, in govorili so zoper to, kar je pravil Pavel, nasprotujoč in preklinjajoč. 
[13:46] Tedaj Pavel in Barnaba srčno rečeta: Vam se je morala najprej govoriti beseda Božja; ko jo pa zametujete, in se nevredne štejete večnega življenja, glej, obračava se do poganov. 
[13:47] Kajti tako nam je zapovedal Gospod: "Postavil sem te za luč poganom, da boš na zveličanje noter do kraja zemlje." 
[13:48] Ko so pa pogani to slišali, veselili so se, in slavili so besedo Gospodovo, in verovali so, kolikor jih je bilo odločenih za večno življenje. 
[13:49] In razširjala se je beseda Gospodova po vsej deželi. 
[13:50] Judje pa nadražijo pobožne in poštene žene in prvake mestne, in zbudé preganjanje zoper Pavla in Barnaba, in izženó ju iz svojih krajev. 
[13:51] A ona sta otresla prah z nog svojih na njih, in prišla sta v Ikonijo. 
[13:52] Učenci pa so so napolnjevali radosti in Duha svetega. 
[14:1] Zgodí se pa v Ikoniji, da sta šla vkupej v shajališče Judovsko, in sta govorila, tako, da je veliko mnoštvo Judov in Grkov verovalo. 
[14:2] Tisti Judje pa, kteri niso verovali, podpihajo in nadražijo duše poganov zoper brate. 
[14:3] Ali ostala sta dosti časa, govoreč srčno v Gospodu, kteri je pričeval besedo milosti svoje, in je dajal, da so se znamenja in čudeži godili po njunih rokah. 
[14:4] In množica mestna se razdelí; in eni so bili z Judi, eni pa z aposteljnoma. 
[14:5] Ko so se pa vzdignili pogani in Judje s poglavarji svojimi, da bi ju zasramotili in kamenjali, 
[14:6] Zvesta, in pobegneta v Likaonski mesti Listro in Derbo, in okolico, 
[14:7] In tu sta oznanjevala evangelj. 
[14:8] In sedel je v Listri en mož bolan na nogah, hrom iz telesa matere svoje, kteri ni bil nikoli hodil. 
[14:9] Ta je poslušal Pavla, ko je govoril; in on pogleda nanj, in videvši, da ima vero, da bo ozdravel, 
[14:10] Reče z močnim glasom: Stopi na noge svoje po konci! In skočil jo, in hodil je. 
[14:11] Ljudstvo pa, ko je videlo, kar je Pavel storil, povzdignejo glas svoj, govoreč Likaonski: Bogova sta v človeškej podobi sešla k nam. 
[14:12] In imenovali so Barnaba Jupiterja; a Pavla Merkurija, ker je bil on načelnik besede. 
[14:13] Duhoven pa Jupiterjev, ki je bil pred mestom, pripelje juncev, in prinese vencev pred vrata, in hotel jima je z ljudstvom darovati. 
[14:14] Ko sta pa aposteljna Barnaba in Pavel to slišala, raztrgala sta oblačila svoja, in skočila sta med ljudstvo kričeč, 
[14:15] In govoreč: Možjé! kaj to delate? Tudi midva sva umrljiva, vam enaka človeka, ktera vam oznanjujeva, da se od teh praznih reči obrnite k živemu Bogu, kteri je ustvaril nebo in zemljo in morje in vse, kar je v njih; 
[14:16] Kteri je v preteklih časih pustil vse narode, da so hodili po svojih potih: 
[14:17] Vendar pa ni sebe brez pričevanja pustil, delajoč dobrote, dajoč nam z neba dež in rodovitne čase, napolnjujoč srca naša z jedjó in veseljem. 
[14:18] In govoreč to, komaj sta ustavila ljudstvo, da jima ni darovalo. 
[14:19] Med tem pa pride nekaj Judov iz Antijohije in Ikonije, in pregovorivši ljudstvo, kamenjali so Pavla in izvlekli iz mesta, misleč, da je umrl. 
[14:20] Ko so ga pa učenci obstopili, vstane in vnide v mesto; in drugi dan izide z Barnabom v Derbo. 
[14:21] In ko sta oznanila evangelj temu mestu, in sta mnoge podučila, vrnila sta se v Listro in Ikonijo in Antijohijo, 
[14:22] Potrjujoč duše učencev, opominjajoč, da naj ostanejo v veri, in da nam je treba po mnogih stiskah vniti v kraljestvo Božje. 
[14:23] In postavivši jim starešine po cerkvah, molivši s postom, izročila sta jih Gospodu, v kterega so verovali. 
[14:24] In prešla sta Pisidijo in prišla v Pamfilijo. 
[14:25] In govorivši v Pergi besedo, sešla sta v Atalijo; 
[14:26] In odtod sta se odpeljala po morji v Antijohijo, odkoder sta bila izročena milosti Božjej na delo, ktero sta dokončala. 
[14:27] Ko sta pa prišla in sta zbrala cerkev, sporočila sta, koliko reči je Bog ž njima storil, in da je odprl poganom vrata vere. 
[14:28] In prebila sta tu ne malo časa z učenci. 
[15:1] In pride jih nekaj iz Judeje, in učili so brate: Če se ne obrežete po šegi Mojzesovej, ne morete zveličati se. 
[15:2] Ko je torej nastal razpor, in se Pavel in Barnaba nista malo prepirala ž njimi, sklenejo, da naj odidejo Pavel in Barnaba in nekteri drugi izmed njih gor k aposteljnom in starešinam v Jeruzalem, za voljo tega vprašanja. 
[15:3] Oni torej spremljeni od cerkve, šli so skozi Fenicijo in Samarijo, pripovedovaje izpreobrnenje poganov; in delali so veliko radost vsem bratom. 
[15:4] Ko so pa prišli v Jeruzalem, sprejela jih je cerkev in aposteljni in starešine, in sporočili so, koliko rečî je Bog ž njima storil. 
[15:5] Ali vstalo jih je nekaj od ločinke Farizejske, kteri so bili verovali, in govorili so: Obrezovati se morajo, in naročiti se mora, naj postavo Mojzesovo izpolnjujejo. 
[15:6] In aposteljni in starešine se zberó, da to reč presodijo. 
[15:7] Ko so se pa veliko prepirali, vstane Peter in jim reče: Možjé bratje! vi véste, da je od prvih dnî Bog izmed nas izbral, da so iz mojih ust slišali pogani besedo evangelja, in so verovali. 
[15:8] In Bog, kteri pozná srca, popričal jim je, davši jim Duha svetega, kakor tudi nam. 
[15:9] In nobenega razločka ni postavil med nami in njimi, ko je po veri očistil njih srca. 
[15:10] Sedaj torej, kaj izkušate Boga, da nakladate učencem jarem na vrat, kterega ne očetje naši, ne mi nismo mogli ponesti? 
[15:11] Nego po milosti Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa verujemo, da se bomo zveličali, kakor tudi oni. 
[15:12] Tedaj je vsa množica umolknila, in poslušali so Barnaba in Pavla, ktera sta pripovedovala, kolika znamenja in čudeže je Bog storil po njima med pogani. 
[15:13] Ko sta umolknila, odgovorí Jakob, govoreč: Možjé bratje, čujte me! 
[15:14] Simon je povedal, kako je Bog najprej obiskal pogane, da bi prejel iž njih ljudstvo imenu svojemu; 
[15:15] In s tem se vjemajo besede prerokov, kakor je pisano: 
[15:16] "Po tem se bom vrnil, in sezidal bom zopet dom Davidov, ki je padel; in razvalino njegovo bom zopet sezidal, in povzdignil ga bom: 
[15:17] Da ljudjé, kteri ostanejo, poiščejo Gospoda, in vsi narodi, na ktere se je ime moje poklicalo: pravi Gospod, kteri vse to dela." 
[15:18] Bogu so od vekomaj znana vsa dela njegova. 
[15:19] Za to jaz sodim, naj se ne nadlegujejo, kteri se od poganov obračajo k Bogu. 
[15:20] Nego piše naj jim se, da naj se zdržujejo ognjušenja od malikov in kurbarije in udavljenega in krvi: 
[15:21] Kajti Mojzes jih od starodavnih časov po vseh mestih ima, kteri ga oznanjujejo, ko se po shajališčih vsako soboto bere. 
[15:22] Tedaj so aposteljni in starešine z vso cerkvijo sklenili izvoliti možé izmed sebe, in poslali v Antijohijo s Pavlom in Barnabom: Juda s priimkom Barsaba, in Sila, znamenita moža med brati. 
[15:23] In pisali so po njunih rokah to: Aposteljni in starešine in bratje pozdravljajo brate izmed poganov, kteri so po Antijohiji in Siriji in Ciliciji. 
[15:24] Ker smo slišali, da so nekteri izmed nas izšli, in so vas zbegali z besedami, in zmotili duše vaše, govoreč, da se obrezujte in izpolnjujte postavo, kterim nismo zapovedali; 
[15:25] Sklenili smo ene misli zbrani izvoliti možé in poslati k vam, z ljubljenima našima Barnabom in Pavlom, 
[15:26] Človekoma, ktera sta dala duši svoji za ime Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[15:27] Poslali smo torej Juda in Sila, ktera bosta tudi sama z besedo povedala ravno to. 
[15:28] Dopadlo je namreč svetemu Duhu in nam, nobenega bremena več ne nakladati vam, razen teh potrebnih rečî: 
[15:29] Da se zdržujte malikom darovanega in krví in udavljenega in kurbarije. Če se boste tega varovali, boste prav delali. Zdravi! 
[15:30] In ko so jih bili odpravili, prišli so v Antijohijo; in zbravši množico, izročili so pismo. 
[15:31] Ko so pa prebrali, razveselili so se tolažbe. 
[15:32] A Juda in Sila, ktera sta bila tudi preroka, utolažila sta z mnogimi besedami brate, in utrdila. 
[15:33] In ko sta tu nekaj časa prebila, odpustili so ju bratje v miru k aposteljnom. 
[15:34] Sklenil je pa Sila tam ostati. 
[15:35] A Pavel in Barnaba sta živela v Antijohiji, in učila sta in oznanjevala, tudi z mnogimi drugimi, besedo Gospodovo. 
[15:36] A črez nekoliko dnî reče Pavel Barnabu: Vrniva se in obiščiva brate svoje po vseh mestih, v kterih sva oznanila besedo Gospodovo, kako se imajo. 
[15:37] Barnaba je pa hotel, da bi vzela s seboj Janeza, ki se je imenoval Marka. 
[15:38] Ali Pavlu se je za dobro zdelo, da tega, ki se je ločil od nju iz Pamfilije, in ni šel ž njima na delo, ne bi jemala s seboj. 
[15:39] Za to vstane razpor, tako, da sta se ločila eden od drugega, in je Barnaba vzel Marka, in se je odpeljal po morji na Ciper; 
[15:40] A Pavel izbere Sila, in izide, priporočen milosti Božjej od bratov. 
[15:41] In hodil je po Siriji in Ciliciji, in utrjeval je cerkve. 
[16:1] Pride pa v Derbo in Listro; in glej, neki učenec je bil tu po imenu Timotej, sin neke žene Judinje, ktera je verovala, očeta pa Grka; 
[16:2] Za kterega so dobro pričali bratje, kteri so bili v Listri in Ikoniji. 
[16:3] Tega je hotel Pavel, da bi šel ž njim, in vzemši, obreže ga za voljo Judov, kteri so bili v tistih krajih; kajti vedeli so vsi za očeta njegovega, da je Grk. 
[16:4] Ko so pa hodili po mestih, priporočevali so jim, naj izpolnjujejo ustave, ktere so sklenili aposteljni in starešine v Jeruzalemu. 
[16:5] In cerkve so se utrjevale v veri, in množilo se je njih število vsak dan. 
[16:6] In ko so prehodili Frigijo in Galacijsko deželo, zabranil jim je sveti Duh govoriti besedo v Aziji. 
[16:7] In ko so prišli v Mižijo, izkušali so iti v Bitinijo: ali Duh jim ni pustil. 
[16:8] A ko so prešli Mižijo, snidejo v Troado. 
[16:9] In prikaže se Pavlu po noči prikazen. Neki mož Macedonec je stal, proseč ga in govoreč: Pridi v Macedonijo in pomagaj nam. 
[16:10] Ko je bil pa prikazen videl, ogledali smo se precej, da izidemo v Macedonijo, prepričani, da nas je Gospod poklical, da jim oznanimo evangelj. 
[16:11] Ko smo se torej odpeljali iz Troade, prišli smo na ravnost v Samotracijo, in drugi dan v Neapolj. 
[16:12] In odtod v Filipe, ktero je prvo mesto straní Macedonske, selišče. V tem mestu pa smo se nekoliko dnî mudili, 
[16:13] In v sobotni dan smo izšli iz mesta k vodi, kjer je bil navadni kraj molitve, in sedši, govorili smo ženam, ktere so so bile zbrale. 
[16:14] In neka žena po imenu Lidija, ktera je prodajala škrlat, iz mesto Tijatirskega, bogaboječa, poslušala je; in odprl jej je Bog srce, da je pazila na to, kar je Pavel govoril. 
[16:15] Ko se je pa krstila, in hiša njena, prosila je, govoreč: Če mislite, da sem Gospodu verna, vnidite v hišo mojo in ostanite; in primorala nas je. 
[16:16] Zgodí se pa, ko smo šli na molitev, sreča nas neka deklica, ktera je imela duha vedeža, in je veliko dobička dajala gospodarjem svojim z vedeževanjem. 
[16:17] Ta je bila šla za Pavlom in nami, in vpila je, govoreč: Ti ljudje so služabniki Boga najvišega, kteri vam oznanjujejo pot zveličanja. 
[16:18] A to je delala veliko dnî. Pavla je pa bolelo, in obrnivši se, reče duhu: Ukazujem ti po imenu Jezusa Kristusa, da izidi iž nje. In izšel je še tisto uro. 
[16:19] Ko so pa videli gospodarji njeni, da je izšlo upanje njih dobička, primejo Pavla in Sila, in odvlečejo ju na trg k poglavarjem. 
[16:20] In pripeljavši ju k poglavarjem, rekó: Ti ljudjé motijo naše mesto, ker so Judje; 
[16:21] In oznanjujejo šege, kterih mi ne smemo sprejemati ne izpolnjevati, ker smo Rimljani. 
[16:22] In ljudstvo vstane zoper nju; in poglavarji jima raztrgajo oblačila, in veleli so ju šibati. 
[16:23] In ko so ju zeló pretepli, vržejo ju v ječo, naročivši varuhu ječe, naj ju skrbno varuje. 
[16:24] In on, prejemši takošno zapoved, vrže ju v najnotranjo ječo, in dene jima noge v klado. 
[16:25] A o polnoči sta Pavel in Sila molila in hvalila Boga; in jetniki so ju poslušali. 
[16:26] Kar vstane potres velik, tako, da se je temelj ječe zganil; in pri tej priči so se odprla vsa vrata, in vsem je odpadlo železje. 
[16:27] Ko se je pa varuh ječe prebudil, in je videl vrata ječe odprta, izdere meč in hotel se je umoriti, misleč, da so jetniki pobegnili. 
[16:28] Pavel pa zakliče z močnim glasom, govoreč: Ne storí si nič žalega; saj smo vsi tu. 
[16:29] On pa, izprosivši luč, poletí noter, in pade drhtajoč Pavlu in Silu pred noge. 
[16:30] In izpeljavši ju ven, reče: Gospoda! kaj mi je treba storiti, da se zveličam? 
[16:31] Ona pa rečeta: Veruj v Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, in zveličal se boš ti in hiša tvoja. 
[16:32] In govorila sta mu besedo Gospodovo, in vsem, kteri so bili v hiši njegovej. 
[16:33] In vzel ju je še tisto uro nočí, in izmil od ran, in krstil se je on in vsi njegovi precej. 
[16:34] In odpeljavši ju v hišo svojo, postavil je mizo, in veselil se je, da je z vso hišo veroval v Boga. 
[16:35] Ko se je pa zdanilo, pošljejo poglavarji beriče, govoreč: Izpusti te ljudí. 
[16:36] In varuh ječe sporočí te besede Pavlu: Poslali so poglavarji, da se imata izpustiti; sedaj torej izidita, in pojdita v miru. 
[16:37] Ali Pavel jim reče: Šibali so naju očitno, neobsojena, človeka Rimljana, in vrgli v ječo: in sedaj naju skrivaj izpuščajo? Ne tako; nego sami naj pridejo in naju izpeljejo. 
[16:38] In beriči sporočé te besede poglavarjem; in uplašijo se, slišavši, da sta Rimljana. 
[16:39] Ter pridejo in ju zaprosijo: in izpeljavši ju, prosili so, naj izideta iz mesta. 
[16:40] In ko sta bila izšla iz ječe, prišla sta k Lidiji; in videvši brate, utolažila sta jih, in izšla sta. 
[17:1] In šla sta skozi Amfipolj in Apolonijo, in prišla sta v Solun, kjer je bilo shajališče Judovsko. 
[17:2] In Pavel vnide po navadi k njim, in razgovarjal se je ž njimi tri sobote iz pisem, 
[17:3] Razkladajoč in dokazujoč, da je bilo treba, da je Kristus trpel in vstal od mrtvih, in da ta Jezus, kterega vam jaz oznanjujem, je Kristus. 
[17:4] In nekteri od njih so verovali, in pridružili so se Pavlu in Silu, in od pobožnih Grkov velika množica, in imenitnih žen ne malo. 
[17:5] Ali trdovratni Judje so zavidali, in privzemši nekaj hudobnih móž izmed drhali, in zbravši trumo, nadražili so mesto; in obstopili so hišo Jazonovo, in iskali so ju, da bi ju izpeljali pred ljudstvo. 
[17:6] Ko ju pa niso našli, povlečejo Jazona in nektere brate pred starešine mestne, vpijoč: Ti, ki so ves svet razdražili, ti so tudi sèm prišli; 
[17:7] Ktere je sprejel Jazon; in ti vsi delajo zoper cesarjeve zapovedi govoreč, da je nekdo drugi kralj, Jezus. 
[17:8] In razdražili so ljudstvo in starešine mestne, kteri so to poslušali. 
[17:9] In ko so bili prejeli zadostenje od Jazona in drugih, pustili so jih. 
[17:10] Bratje pa naglo po noči odpravijo Pavla in Sila v Berejo; in ko tje prideta, odideta v shajališče Judovsko. 
[17:11] Ti so bili pa blagosrčniji od Solunskih; ti so sprejeli besedo z vsem poželenjem, in vsak dan so preiskovali pisma, če je to tako. 
[17:12] In tako jih je veliko od njih verovalo, in poštenih Grških žen in móž ne malo. 
[17:13] Ko so pa Judje Solunski zvedeli, da tudi v Bereji oznanjuje Pavel besedo Božjo, pridejo tudi tje, in vzdignejo ljudstvo. 
[17:14] Ali bratje so tedaj Pavla naglo odpravili, da je šel v primorje; a Sila in Timotej sta ostala tam. 
[17:15] Ti pa, kteri so bili Pavla spremili, pripeljali so ga do Aten; in ko so prejeli sporočilo do Sila in Timoteja, naj bi kar najhitreje prišla k njemu, vrnili so se. 
[17:16] Ko ju je pa Pavel v Atenah čakal, vname se duh njegov v njem, ko je videl, da je mesto malikovanju udano; 
[17:17] In razgovarjal se je v shajališči z Judi in pobožnimi, in na trgu vsak dan s tistimi, na ktere je naletel. 
[17:18] Nekteri od Epikurejskih in Stojskih modrijanov so so pa prepirali ž njim; in eni so govorili: Kaj hoče ta kvasé povedati? a drugi: Zdi se, da je oznanjevalec tujih bogov: ker jim je Jezusa in vstajanje oznanjeval. 
[17:19] In vzemó ga in odpeljejo na Areopag, govoreč: Moremo li zvedeti, kakošen je ta novi nauk, kterega ti oznanjuješ? 
[17:20] Kajti nekaj novega nam nosiš v ušesa; za to hočemo zvedeti, kaj če to biti. 
[17:21] (Vsi Atenjani pa in tujci, kteri so prihajali, niso imeli drugega opraviti, nego kaj novega pripovedovati ali poslušati.) 
[17:22] Pavel pa, vstopivši se sredi Areopaga, reče: Možjé Atenjani! po vsem vas vidim, da ste nekako preverni. 
[17:23] Ko sem namreč prehajal in ogledoval svetišča vaša, našel sem tudi oltar, na kterem je bilo napisano: Nepoznanemu bogu. Kogar torej častite, da si ravno ga ne poznate, tega vam jaz oznanjujem. 
[17:24] Bog, kteri je ustvaril svet in vse, kar je v njem, ta, ki je gospodar neba in zemlje, ne prebiva v tempeljnih, kteri so z rokami narejeni; 
[17:25] In ne streže mu se s človeškimi rokami, kakor da bi česa potreboval, ko sam daje vsem življenje in dihanje in vse; 
[17:26] In je ustvaril iz ene krví ves rod človeški, da prebiva po vsem licu zemlje, in je odločil odmenjene čase in meje njih prebivanja: 
[17:27] Da bi iskali Gospoda, ne bi li ga kako otipali ali našli; da si ravno ni daleč od nobenega od nas. 
[17:28] Kajti v njem živimo in se gibljemo in smo; kakor so tudi nekteri pesnikov vaših rekli: "Kajti tudi rodú njegovega smo." 
[17:29] Ker smo torej Božjega rodú, ne smemo misliti, da je božanstvo enako zlatu ali srebru ali kamenu, izrezanemu po umetnosti in izmišljenji človekovem. 
[17:30] Bog torej, ne gledajoč na čase nevednosti, oznanjuje sedaj vsem ljudém povsodi, naj delajo pokoro; 
[17:31] Zato, ker je postavil dan, ko bo sodil ves svet po pravici, po možu, kterega je odločil, podavši vero vsem s tem, da ga je obudil od mrtvih. 
[17:32] Ko so pa slišali vstajanje mrtvih, nekteri so se posmehovati, a drugi so rekli: O tem te bomo drugoč slišali. 
[17:33] In tako je odšel Pavel izmed njih. 
[17:34] A nekteri možjé so mu se pridružili in so verovali; med kterimi je bil Dionizij Areopagitski, in žena po imenu Damara, in drugi ž njima. 
[18:1] Po tem je pa Pavel, ko se je bil ločil iz Aten, prišel v Korint. 
[18:2] In našel je nekega Juda po imenu Akvila, iz Ponta po rodu, kteri je bil nedavno prišel iz Italije, in Priscilo ženo njegovo (za to, ker je bil zapovedal Klavdij, da imajo vsi Judje iti iz Rima), in prišel je k njima. 
[18:3] In ker je bil ravno tistega rokodelstva, ostal je pri njima in je delal; bila sta pa po rokodelstvu delalca šatorov. 
[18:4] In prepiral se je v shajališči vsako soboto, in prigovarjal je Judom in Grkom. 
[18:5] Ko sta pa prišla iz Macedonije Sila in Timotej, pričeval je Pavel navdušen Judom, da Jezus je Kristus. 
[18:6] Ko so pa oni nasprotovali in preklinjali, otrese oblačila, in reče jim: Kri vaša vam pridi na glavo; čist jaz odslej k poganom pojdem. 
[18:7] In ko je odšel odtod, prišel je v hišo nekega Justa po imenu, kteri je častil Boga, in kogar hiša je bila tik shajališča. 
[18:8] Krisp pa, poglavar shajališča, veroval je v Gospoda z vso hišo svojo; in veliko Korinčanov, kteri so poslušali, verovalo je in krščevalo se. 
[18:9] Reče pa Gospod Pavlu po noči v prikazni: Ne boj se, nego govori in ne molči; 
[18:10] Kajti jaz sem s teboj, in nihče te ne bo napadel, da bi ti kaj storil: ker imam veliko ljudstva v tem mestu. 
[18:11] In prebil je tu eno leto in šest mesecev, učeč pri njih besedo Božjo. 
[18:12] Ko je bil pa Galijon namestnik v Ahaji, napadli so Judje enodušno na Pavla; in pripeljali so ga na sodišče, 
[18:13] Govoreč: Ta nagovarja ljudí, naj časté Boga zoper postavo. 
[18:14] Ko je pa hotel Pavel usta odpreti, reče Galijon Judom: Ko bi bila kaka krivica ali dejanje hudobno, o Judje, poslušal bi vas po dolžnosti; 
[18:15] Ker je pa vprašanje za besedo in imena in za vaše postave, glejte sami: kajti jaz ne čem biti sodnik v teh rečéh. 
[18:16] In odgnal jih je od sodišča. 
[18:17] Tedaj zgrabijo vsi Grki Sostena poglavarja shajališča, in bíli so ga pred sodiščem; ali Galijon se ni nič zmenil za to. 
[18:18] A Pavel je še dosti dní ostal, in poslovivši se z brati, odpeljal se je po morji v Sirijo, in ž njim Priscila in Akvila; in ostrigel je v Kenhrah glavo: imel je namreč obljubo. 
[18:19] In pride v Efez, In onadva pustí tam; a on vnide v shajališče, in prepiral se je z Judi. 
[18:20] Ko so ga pa prosili, naj bi dalje časa ostal pri njih, ni pritrdil; 
[18:21] Nego poslovil se je ž njimi, govoreč: Prihodnji praznik moram po vsakej ceni praznovati v Jeruzalemu; ali vrnil se bom, če Bog hoče, zopet k vam. In odpeljal se je iz Efeza. 
[18:22] In ko je prišel v Cezarejo, šel je gor in je pozdravil cerkev, in sešel je v Antijohijo. 
[18:23] In ko se je nekaj časa pomudil, izšel je, in prehodil je zapored Galacijsko stran in Frigijo, utrjujoč vse učence. 
[18:24] Prišel je pa v Efez neki Jud po imenu Apolo, Aleksandrijan po rodu, mož razgovoren, učen v pismih. 
[18:25] Ta je bil podučen v potu Gospodovem, in, goreč v duhu, govoril je in učil pridno to, kar zadeva Gospoda, in poznal je samo krst Janezov. 
[18:26] In ta je jel srčno oznanjevati v shajališči. Ko sta ga pa Akvila in Priscila slišala, vzela sta ga, in razložila sta mu pot Gospodov natanjčneje. 
[18:27] A ko je hotel iti v Ahajo, opomenili so ga bratje, in pisali so učencem, naj ga sprejmó. In ko je prišel, pripomogel je mnogo tistim, kteri so verovali po milosti. 
[18:28] Kajti trdo je Jude neprenehoma zavračeval pred ljudstvom, dokazujoč iz pišem, da Jezus je Kristus. 
[19:1] Zgodí se pa, ko je bil Apolo v Korintu, da Pavel, prehodivši gorenje strani, pride v Efez; in ko je našel nekaj učencev, 
[19:2] Reče jim: Ali ste prejeli Duha svetega, ko ste postali verni? Oni mu pa rekó: Saj še slišali nismo, da je sveti Duh. 
[19:3] In reče jim: Na kaj torej ste se krstili? Oni pa rekó: Na krst Janezov. 
[19:4] Pavel pa reče: Janez je krstil s krstom spokore, govoreč ljudstvu, da naj verujejo v tega, kteri bo za njim prišel, to je v Kristusa Jezusa. 
[19:5] Ko so pa to slišali, krstili so se v ime Gospoda Jezusa. 
[19:6] In ko je položil Pavel roke na-nje, prišel je sveti Duh na-nje, in govorili so jezike in prerokovali. 
[19:7] Bilo je pa vseh móž kakih dvanajst. 
[19:8] In ko je prišel v shajališče, govoril je srčno, tri mesece prepirajoč se in učeč o kraljestvu Božjem. 
[19:9] Ko so bili pa nekteri otrpneli in niso hoteli pokorni biti, hudo govoreč o potu Gospodovem pred množico, odstopil je od njih, in odločil je učence, in učil je vsak dan v šoli nekega Tirana. 
[19:10] In to se je godilo dve leti, tako, da so vsi, kteri so prebivali v Aziji, slišali besedo Gospoda Jezusa, Judje in Grki. 
[19:11] In čudeže ne majhne je delal Bog po rokah Pavlovih; 
[19:12] Tako, da so na bolnike pokladali potne prte od života njegovega in opasnike, in puščale so jih bolezni, in duhovi hudobni so izhajali iž njih. 
[19:13] In izkušali so nekteri izmed Judov, kteri so okrog hodili in hudiče rotili, klicati na tiste, kteri so imeli duhove hudobne, ime Gospoda Jezusa, govoreč: Zaklinjamo vas pri Jezusu, kterega Pavel oznanjuje. 
[19:14] Bilo je pa nekih sedem sinov Skeve Juda, vélikega duhovna, kteri so to delali. 
[19:15] Odgovarjajoč pa duh hudobni, reče: Jezusa poznam, in Pavla vém; vi pa, kdo ste? 
[19:16] In skočivši človek, v kterem je bil duh hudobni, na-nje, premagal jih je, in zdelal jih je tako, da so nagi in ranjeni ubežali iz tiste hiše. 
[19:17] To je pa prišlo na znanje vsem Judom in Grkom, kteri so prebivali v Efezu; in obšel jih je strah vse, in poveličevalo se je ime Gospoda Jezusa. 
[19:18] In mnogo teh, kteri so verovali, dohajalo je in izpovedovali so se, in razodevali so dela svoja. 
[19:19] A mnogi tistih, kteri so uganjali vraže, znesli so bukve, in sežgali so jih pred vsemi; in ko so preudarili njih ceno, našli so, da so veljale petdeset tisoči srebrnikov. 
[19:20] Tako krepko je beseda Božja rastla in utrjevala se. 
[19:21] A ko se je to dopolnilo, nameni Pavel v duhu, da prehodivši Macedonijo in Ahajo, pojde v Jeruzalem, in reče: Po tem, ko bom tam, moram tudi Rim videti. 
[19:22] In poslal je v Macedonijo dva od tistih, kteri so mu služili, Timoteja in Erasta; a sam je ostal nekaj časa v Aziji. 
[19:23] Vstal je pa v ta čas ne majhen hrup za voljo pota Gospodovega. 
[19:24] Neki Demetrij namreč po imenu, srebrar, ki je delal Dijani srebrne cerkvice, dajal je umetnikom ne malo dela; 
[19:25] In sklicavši te, in druge takošne delalce, reče: Možjé! véste, da imamo od tega dela zaslužek svoj; 
[19:26] In vidite in slišite, da ne samo v Efezu, nego skoro po vsej Aziji je ta Pavel veliko ljudstva pregovoril in odvrnil, govoreč, da bogovi, kteri so z rokami narejeni, niso bogovi. 
[19:27] Ni pa samo to v nevarnosti, da bo delo naše na nič prišlo, nego tudi vélike boginje Dijane tempelj se bo za nič štel, in poginilo bo veličastvo te, ktero vsa Azija in ves svet častí. 
[19:28] Ko so pa to slišali, napolnijo se jeze, in kričali so, govoreč: Velika je Dijana Efežanov! 
[19:29] In napolni se vse mesto zmešnjave; in zaženó se enodušno na gledališče, in zgrabijo Gaja in Aristarha, Macedonca tovariša Pavlova. 
[19:30] Ko je pa Pavel hotel vniti med ljudstvo, niso mu pustili. 
[19:31] Pa tudi nekteri od Azijskih poglavarjev, kteri so mu bili prijatelji, poslali so k njemu, in prosili so ga, naj se ne podá v gledališče. 
[19:32] Vpili so pa eni to, drugi drugo; kajti bil je zbor poln zmešnjave, in največ jih je bilo med njimi, kteri niso vedeli, po kaj so se sešli. 
[19:33] A nekteri izmed ljudstva so izvlekli Aleksandra, ko so ga Judje naprej tiščali; Aleksander pa zamahme z rokó, da naj umolknejo, in hotel je ljudstvu odgovoriti. 
[19:34] Ko so pa spoznali, da je Jud, vzdignejo vsi en glas, in vpili so kaki dve uri: Velika je Dijana Efežanov! 
[19:35] Pisar pa, ko je ljudstvo upokojil, reče: Možjé Efežani! kdo pa je človek, kteri ne vé, da mesto Efežanov častí véliko boginjo Dijano in od Jupiterja padlo podobo? 
[19:36] Ker se torej to ne more tajiti, treba je, da se umirite, in ne delate nič naglo. 
[19:37] Kajti pripeljali ste te ljudí, kteri niso ne tempeljna oropali, ne boginje vaše preklinjali. 
[19:38] Če imajo pa Demetrij in umetniki, kteri so ž njim, tožbo zoper koga, sodnije so, in namestniki so; naj tožijo eden drugega. 
[19:39] Če pa kaj drugega iščete, obravnalo se bo v postavnem zboru. 
[19:40] Kajti v nevarnosti smo, da bomo zatoženi za voljo današnjega punta, ko nimamo nobenega vzroka, s kterim bi mogli odgovor dati za ta hrup. 
[19:41] In rekši to, razpustil je zbor. 
[20:1] Ko je pa hrup nehal, pokliče Pavel učence, in poslovivši se, izide, da odide v Macedonijo. 
[20:2] In prehodivši te straní, in utolaživši jih z mnogimi besedami, pride v Grško. 
[20:3] In prebivši tu tri mesece, sklene, ker so ga Judje, ko se je imel po morji odpeljati v Sirijo, zalezovali, vrniti se skozi Macedonijo. 
[20:4] Spremljal ga je pa noter do Azije Sopater iz Bereje; od Solunjanov pa Aristarh in Sekund, in Gaj iz Derbe in Timotej: a od Azijanov: Tihik in Trofim. 
[20:5] Ti so bili šli naprej, in čakali so nas v Troadi. 
[20:6] A mi smo se po dnevih presnih kruhov po morji odpeljali iz Filipov, in prišli smo k njim v Troado v petih dnéh, kjer smo se sedem dnî mudili. 
[20:7] A prvi dan po soboti, ko so se učenci zbrali, da bi lomili kruh, govoril jim je Pavel, ker je hotel drugi dan iziti, in podaljšal je govor svoj do polnoči. 
[20:8] Bilo pa je dosti svetilnic v vrhnjej izbi, kjer so bili zbrani. 
[20:9] In sedel je neki mladenič po imenu Evtih na oknu, premagan od trdega spanja, in ko je Pavel dolgo govoril, omahnil je v spanji, in padel je s tretjega nadstropja dol, in vzdignili so mrtvega. 
[20:10] Pavel pa snide, in pade na-nj, in objemši ga, reče: Umirite se; kajti duša njegova je v njem. 
[20:11] In odšedši gor, in prelomivši kruh, okusil je, in govoril je mnogo noter do dné, in tako je izšel. 
[20:12] A mladeniča so bili pripeljali živega, in utolažili so se ne malo. 
[20:13] A mi smo stopili na ladjo, in odpeljali smo se v Ason, kjer smo imeli sprejeti Pavla; kajti tako je bil naročil, hoteč sam peš hoditi. 
[20:14] Ko se je bil pa v Asonu k nam pridružil in smo ga sprejeli, prišli smo v Mitileno. 
[20:15] In odpeljavši se odtod, prišli smo drugi dan Hiju nasproti; in en dan potem smo se priplavili k Samu; in ko smo v Trogiliji prenočili, prišli smo drugi dan v Milet. 
[20:16] Odločil je bil namreč Pavel, da bomo pri Efezu mimo šli, da se ne bi v Aziji zamudil; kajti hitel je, da bi, ako bi mu bilo mogoče, na binkoštni dan v Jeruzalemu bil. 
[20:17] Poslal je pa iz Mileta v Efez, in poklical je starešine cerkve. 
[20:18] Ko so pa prišli k njemu, reče jim: Vi véste od prvega dné, ko sem prišel v Azijo, kako sem ves čas z vami bil. 
[20:19] Služeč Gospodu z vso ponižnostjo in mnogimi solzami in izkušnjami, ktere so mi se dogodile za voljo zalezovanja Judov; 
[20:20] Kako nisem nič koristnega izpustil, da vam ne bi bil oznanil in učil vas očitno in po hišah. 
[20:21] Pričevaje Judom in Grkom izpreobrnenje k Bogu, in vero v Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[20:22] In sedaj, glej, jaz zvezan v duhu, grem v Jeruzalem, ne vedoč, kaj mi se bo v njem prigodilo, 
[20:23] Razen, da Duh sveti po vseh mestih priča, govoreč, da me ječa in stiske čakajo. 
[20:24] Ali mene nič ne skrbí, in tudi življenje moje mi ni drago, da le dokončam tek svoj z radostjo, in službo, ktero sem prejel od Gospoda Jezusa, da popričam evangelj milosti Božje. 
[20:25] In sedaj glej, jaz vém, da ne boste več videli obličja mojega, vi vsi, med kterimi sem hodil, oznanjujoč kraljestvo Božje. 
[20:26] Za to vam pričujem današnji dan, da sem čist od krví vseh; 
[20:27] Kajti nisem se umaknil, da vam ne bi bil oznanil vse volje Božje. 
[20:28] Pazite torej na-se, in na vso čredo, v kterej vas je Duh sveti postavil za škofe, da pasete cerkev Božjo, ktero je pridobil s krvjó svojo. 
[20:29] Kajti jaz vém to, da bodo po odhodu mojem prišli med vas grabljivi volkovi, kteri ne bodo prizanašali čredi: 
[20:30] In izmed vas samih bodo stali možjé, kteri bodo napačno govorili, da bi potegnili učence za seboj. 
[20:31] Za to čujte, spominjajoč se, da tri leta noč in dan nisem nehal s solzami opominjati vsakega izmed vas. 
[20:32] In sedaj vas, bratje, priporočam Bogu in besedi milosti njegove, kteri more sezidati in dati vam delež med vsemi posvečenimi. 
[20:33] Srebra ali zlata ali oblačila nisem od nikogar poželel; 
[20:34] Saj sami véste, da to, kar je bilo treba meni in tistim, kteri so bili z menoj, prislužile so té-le roke. 
[20:35] Vse sem vam pokazal, da je tako treba truditi se in sprejemati slabe, in spominjati se besed Gospoda Jezusa, da je on rekel: "Mnogo bolje je dajati, nego jemati." 
[20:36] In ko je to povedal, poklekne na kolena svoja, in molil je z vsemi njimi. 
[20:37] In velik jok je vstal med vsemi; in objemši Pavla, poljubovali so ga: 
[20:38] Žalostni največ za voljo besede, ktero je rekel, da ne bodo več videli obličja njegovega. In spremili so ga na ladjo. 
[21:1] Ko se je pa zgodilo, da smo se odtrgali od njih in smo se odpeljali, prišli smo na ravnost v Kon, drugi dan v Rod, in odtod v Pataro, 
[21:2] In ko smo našli ladjo, ktera je imela jadrati v Fenicijo, vstopili smo in smo se peljali. 
[21:3] Ko smo pa Ciper ugledali, pustili smo ga na levej, in peljali smo se v Sirijo, in prišli smo v Tir; tu namreč je imela ladja iztovoriti blago. 
[21:4] In ko smo učencev našli, ostali smo tu sedem dnî; ti so govorili Pavlu po Duhu, naj ne hodi gor v Jeruzalem. 
[21:5] Ko so se pa dnevi izpolnili, izšli smo, in spremljali so nas vsi z ženami in otroci noter do predmestja, in pokleknivši na bregu, molili smo. 
[21:6] In ko smo se poslovili eden od drugega, stopili smo v ladjo; a oni so se vrnili domú. 
[21:7] Mi pa, ko smo vožnjo iz Tira dokončali, prišli smo dol v Ptolemajdo; in pozdravivši se z brati, ostali smo en dan pri njih. 
[21:8] A drugi dan smo izšli, Pavel in kteri smo bili ž njim, in prišli smo v Cezarejo; in šli smo v hišo Filipa evangelista, ki je bil eden od sedmerih, in ostali smo pri njem. 
[21:9] Ta pa je imel štiri hčere device, ktere so prerokovale. 
[21:10] Ko smo se pa več dnî mudili, pride iz Judeje neki prerok po imenu Agab. 
[21:11] In ko je prišel k nam, vzeme pas Pavlov, in zvezavši si roke in noge, reče: To velí sveti Duh: Moža, kogar je ta pas, bodo tako zvezali Judje v Jeruzalemu, in izročili ga bodo poganom v roke. 
[21:12] Ko smo pa to slišali, prosili smo mi in ondejšnji, naj ne hodi gor v Jeruzalem. 
[21:13] Ali Pavel odgovorí: Kaj delate, da jokate in mi cepate srce? Kajti jaz nisem le pripravljen zvezan biti, nego tudi umreti v Jeruzalemu za ime Gospoda Jezusa. 
[21:14] In ko ga nismo mogli pregovoriti, umolknili smo, rekši: Volja Gospodova naj bo. 
[21:15] A po teh dnéh smo se odpravili, in šli smo gor v Jeruzalem. 
[21:16] Šlo je pa tudi učencev iz Cezareje z nami, kteri so peljali s seboj nekega Mnasona iz Cipra, starega učenca, pri kterem smo imeli gostovati. 
[21:17] In ko smo prišli v Jeruzalem, sprejeli so nas bratje ljubeznjivo. 
[21:18] A drugi dan je šel Pavel z nami k Jakobu, in prišli so vsi starešine. 
[21:19] In ko se je bil ž njimi pozdravil, razložil je vse po vrsti, kaj je storil Bog med pogani po njegovej službi. 
[21:20] Oni pa, ko so to slišali, slavili so Gospoda; in rekó mu: Vidiš, brat! koliko tisoči Judov je, kteri so sprejeli vero: in vsi so vneti za postavo. 
[21:21] Slišali pa so za-te, da učiš odstop od Mojzesa vse Jude, kteri so med pogani, govoreč, naj ne obrezujejo sinov svojih, in da naj se tudi po šegah ne ravnajo. 
[21:22] Kaj bi torej? Množica se bo gotovo zbrala; kajti slišali bodo, da si prišel. 
[21:23] To torej stóri, kar ti povemo: Mi imamo štiri možé, kteri imajo obljubo na sebi; 
[21:24] Té vzemi, in očisti se ž njimi, in plačaj, naj si ostrižejo glave, in vsi bodo zvedeli, da to, kar so za-te slišali, ni res, nego da tudi sam tako živiš, da izpolnjuješ postavo. 
[21:25] Za tiste pa, kteri so izmed poganov sprejeli vero, presodili smo mi, in pisali smo, da naj nič takošnega ne izpolnjujejo, razen da naj se varujejo malikom darovanega in krvi in udavljenega in kurbarije. 
[21:26] Tedaj je Pavel vzel možé, in očistivši se ž njimi drugi dan, šel je v tempelj, in naznanjeval je, kedaj se bodo izpolnili dnevi očiščevanja, dokler se ni darovala daritev za vsakega od njih. 
[21:27] Ko so se pa sedmeri dnevi imeli izpolniti, nekteri Judje, kteri so prišli iz Azije, ugledavši ga v tempeljnu, nadražijo vse ljudstvo, ter položé roke na-nj, 
[21:28] Kričeč: Možjé Izraelci, pomagajte! Ta je tisti človek, ki zoper ljudstvo in postavo in ta kraj vse povsodi uči; in vrh tega je tudi Grke pripeljal v tempelj, in oskrunil je ta sveti kraj. 
[21:29] (Kajti videli so bili poprej Trofima Efežana ž njim v mestu, za kterega so mislili, da ga je Pavel v tempelj pripeljal.) 
[21:30] In vse mesto se je vzdignilo, in drlo je ljudstvo skupej; in zgrabivši Pavla, vlekli so ga iz tempeljna: in precej so se vrata zaprla. 
[21:31] Ko so ga pa iskali umoriti, pride glas do jezernika vojaške trume, da se je ves Jeruzalem spuntal. 
[21:32] In on precej vzeme vojakov in stotnikov, in priteče nad-nje. Ko so pa ugledali jezernika in vojake, nehali so bíti Pavla. 
[21:33] Tedaj se jezernik približa in ga prime, in velí ga vkleniti v dve verigi; in vpraša, kdo da je, in kaj da je storil. 
[21:34] In eni so vpili to, a drugi drugo med ljudstvom. Ko pa ni mogel gotovega zvedeti za voljo hrupa, ukaže ga v grad odpeljati. 
[21:35] In ko je prišel do stopnic, prigodí se, da so ga morali vojaki nesti za voljo sile ljudstva; 
[21:36] Kajti šla je za njim množica ljudstva, kričeč: Pogubi ga! 
[21:37] In ko je imel vniti v grad Pavel, reče jezerniku: Ali smem nekaj govoriti s teboj? On pa reče: Znaš Grški? 
[21:38] Nisi li ti tisti Egipčan, ki je pred temi dnevi punt napravil, in izpeljal v puščave štiri tisoči razbojnikov? 
[21:39] Pavel pa reče: Jaz sem Jud iz Tarsa, meščan ne neznanega mesta v Ciliciji; prosim pa te, dovoli mi govoriti ljudstvu. 
[21:40] In ko mu je dovolil, namigne Pavel z roko ljudstvu, naj umolknejo; in ko je nastala velika tihota, pregovorí v Hebrejskem jeziku, govoreč: 
[22:1] Možjé bratje in očetje! čujte sedaj moj odgovor k vam. 
[22:2] (Ko so pa slišali, da jim v Hebrejskem jeziku govorí, bili so še bolj tiho.) In reče: 
[22:3] Jaz sem mož Jud, rojen v Tarsu Cilicijskem, odgojen pa v tem mestu pri nogah Gamalijelovih, podučen na tanko v očetovskej postavi, vnet za Boga, kakor ste vsi vi danes. 
[22:4] Jaz sem preganjal ta pot noter do smrti, vežoč in izdajoč v ječe možé in žene, 
[22:5] Kakor mi tudi véliki duhoven priča, in vse starešinstvo; od kterih sem tudi pisem prejel do bratov in sem šel v Damask, da bi pripeljal tudi tiste, kteri so tam bili, zvezane v Jeruzalem, da bi se mučili. 
[22:6] Zgodí pa se, ko sem šel in sem se bližál Damasku, okoli poldneva, da me nagloma obsije velika svetloba z neba; 
[22:7] In padel sem na tla, in slišal sem glas, da mi pravi: Savel, Savel! kaj me preganjaš? 
[22:8] Jaz sem pa odgovoril: Kdo si, Gospod? In reče mi: Jaz sem Jezus Nazarečan, kterega ti preganjaš. 
[22:9] Tisti pa, kteri so bili z menoj, videli so sicer svetlobo, in uplašili so se; ali glasú niso slišali, kteri mi je govoril. 
[22:10] In rekel sem: Kaj naj storim, Gospod? A Gospod mi reče: Vstani in pojdi v Damask; in tam ti se bo povedalo vse, kar ti je odločeno, da storiš. 
[22:11] Ko pa nisem videl od bliščeče te svetlobe, peljali so me za roko, kteri so bili z menoj, in prišel sem v Damask. 
[22:12] Neki Ananija pa, človek pobožen po postavi, kteri ima pričevanje od vseh Judov, kteri tam prebivajo, 
[22:13] Pride k meni, in vstopivši se, reče mi: Savel brat, spreglej! In jaz sem še tisti čas pogledal na-nj. 
[22:14] On pa reče: Bog očetov naših te je izvolil, da spoznaj voljo njegovo, in vidiš pravičnega, in slišiš glas iz ust njegovih; 
[22:15] Kajti boš mu priča pri vseh ljudéh tega, kar si videl in slišal. 
[22:16] In sedaj, kaj se obotavljaš? Vstani, in krsti se, in operi grehe svoje, poklicavši ime Gospodovo. 
[22:17] Zgodí se pa, ko sem se bil vrnil v Jeruzalem, in sem v tempeljnu molil, da sem se zamaknil, 
[22:18] In videl sem ga, in rekel mi je: Pohiti in izidi naglo iz Jeruzalema, ker ne bodo sprejeli pričevanja tvojega za-me. 
[22:19] In jaz sem rekel: Gospod! sami vedó, da sem jaz zapiral in bíl po shajališčih té, kteri so verovali v tebe; 
[22:20] In ko se je prelivala kri Štefana pričevalca tvojega, tudi jaz sem stal zraven, in privolil sem na smrt njegovo, in varoval sem oblačila tistih, kteri so ga pobijali. 
[22:21] In reče mi: Pojdi; kajti jaz te bom daleč poslal med pogane. 
[22:22] In poslušali so ga do te besede, ter povzdignejo glas svoj, govoreč: Vzemi z zemlje takošnega; ker ni prav, da živí. 
[22:23] Ko so pa kričali, in metali oblačila, in prah lučali k višku, 
[22:24] Ukaže ga jezernik v grad odpeljati, rekši, naj ga z biči iztezajo, da bi zvedel, za kakošno krivico tako vpijejo nad njim. 
[22:25] Ko so ga pa z jermeni pritegnili, reče Pavel stotniku, kteri je tam stal: Smete li človeka Rimljana, in neobsojenega bičati? 
[22:26] Slišavši pa to stotnik, pristopi in sporočí jezerniku, govoreč: Glej, kaj boš storil; kajti ta človek je Rimljan. 
[22:27] Pristopivši pa jezernik, reče mu: Povej mi, če si ti Rimljan? On pa reče: Dà. 
[22:28] In jezernik odgovorí: Jaz sem za veliko denarja to državljanstvo pridobil. A Pavel reče: Jaz sem se pa tudi rodil. 
[22:29] Tedaj so precej odstopili od njega, kteri so ga imeli tezati; pa tudi jezernik se je bal, ko je zvedel, da je Rimljan, in da ga je bil zvezal. 
[22:30] Drugi dan pa, ker je hotel za gotovo zvedeti, za kaj ga Judje tožijo, razveže ga od vezî, in ukaže priti velikemu duhovnu in vsemu zboru njihovemu; in pripeljavši Pavla dol, postavi ga pred-nje. 
[23:1] In Pavel, pogledavši na zbor, reče: Možjé bratje! jaz sem z vso dobro vestjó živel pred Bogom do današnjega dné. 
[23:2] Véliki duhoven Ananija pa ukaže tistim, kteri so pri njem stali, naj ga udarijo po ustih. 
[23:3] Tedaj mu Pavel reče: Udaril te bo Bog, stena pobeljena! in ti sediš, da bi me sodil po postavi, in zoper postavo me veliš bíti? 
[23:4] Tisti pa, kteri so zraven stali, rekó: Vélikega duhovna Božjega preklinjaš? 
[23:5] Pa reče Pavel: Nisem vedel, bratje, da je véliki duhoven; pisano je namreč: "Poglavarja naroda svojega ne preklinjaj." 
[23:6] Vedoč pa Pavel, da je eden del Saducejev, a drugi Farizejev, zavpije v zboru: Možjé bratje, jaz sem Farizej, sin Farizejev; za voljo upanja in vstajanja mrtvih sem na sodbi. 
[23:7] Ko je pa to rekel, nastane razpor med Farizeji in Saduceji, in množica se razdelí. 
[23:8] Kajti Saduceji pravijo, da ni vstajanja, in tudi angelja in duha ne; a Farizeji trdijo oboje. 
[23:9] In vstata je velika krika; in vstavši pismarji od strani Farizejske, pobijali so, govoreč: Nič hudega ne nahajamo na tem človeku; če mu je pa duh govoril ali angelj, ne nasprotujmo Bogu. 
[23:10] Ko je pa vstal razpor velik, bal se je jezernik, da ne bi Pavla raztrgali, ter ukaže, naj snidejo vojaki in ga potegnejo izmed njih, in odpeljejo v grad. 
[23:11] Drugo noč pa pristopi Gospod k njemu, in reče: Ne boj se, Pavel! kajti kakor si v Jeruzalemu pričal za-me, tako moraš tudi v Rimu pričati. 
[23:12] Ko se je pa zdanilo, zbere se nekaj Judov, in zaroté se, govoreč, da ne bodo ne jedli ne pili, dokler ne ubijejo Pavla. 
[23:13] Bilo jih je pa več kakor štirideset, kteri so se bili tako zakleli. 
[23:14] Ti pristopijo k vélikim duhovnom in starešinam, in rekó: S prisego smo se zakleli, da ne bomo ničesar okusili, dokler Pavla ne ubijemo. 
[23:15] Sedaj torej vi z zborom naznanite jezerniku, naj ga pripelje jutri k vam, kakor da bi hoteli kaj natančnijega zvedeti za njegove zadeve; a mi smo pripravljeni, da ga ubijemo, predno se približa. 
[23:16] Slišavši pa sin sestre Pavlove za to zalezovanje, pride in vnide v grad, in sporočí Pavlu. 
[23:17] Poklicavši pa Pavel enega od stotnikov, reče: Tega mladeniča odpelji k jezerniku; kajti ima mu nekaj sporočiti. 
[23:18] On ga torej vzeme in pripelje k jezerniku, in reče: Jetnik Pavel me je poklical in prosil, naj tega mladeniča popeljem k tebi, kteri ima nekaj s teboj govoriti. 
[23:19] In jezernik ga prime za roko in odide na stran, in vpraševal je: Kaj je, kar mi imaš povedati? 
[23:20] Pa reče: Judje so se dogovorili, da te bodo prosili, da bi jutri pripeljal Pavla v zbor, kakor da bi hoteli kaj natančnijega izprašati za-nj. 
[23:21] Ti jih pa ne poslušaj; kajti zalezuje ga izmed njih več kakor štirideset móž, kteri so se zarotili, da ne bodo ne jedli ne pili, dokler ga ne umoré; in sedaj so pripravljeni, in čakajo tvojega odgovora. 
[23:22] Tedaj jezernik mladeniča odpustí, naročivši mu, naj nikomur ne pové, da si mi to naznanil. 
[23:23] In poklicavši dva stotnika, reče: Pripravita dve sto vojakov, da pojdejo do Cezareje, in sedemdeset konjikov, in dve sto strelcev, po tretjej uri nočí; 
[23:24] In pripeljejo naj živino, da Pavla posadé in zdravega pripeljejo k Feliksu, poglavarju. 
[23:25] In napiše pismo, ktero se je tako-le glasilo. 
[23:26] Klavdij Lizija pozdravlja častitega poglavarja Feliksa. 
[23:27] Tega moža so Judje zgrabili, in hoteli so ga umoriti; ali prišel sem z vojsko, in otél sem ga, ko sem zvedel, da je Rimljan. 
[23:28] Hoteč pa zvedeti vzrok, za kaj ga tožijo, peljal sem ga v njih zbor. 
[23:29] In našel sem, da ga tožijo za vprašanja njih postave, da pa nima nobene krivice, za ktero bi bil vreden smrti ali vezî. 
[23:30] Ko mi se je pa naznanil naklep, kterega so kovali Judje zoper tega moža, poslal sem precej k tebi sporočivši tudi tožnikom, naj pred teboj povedó, kar imajo zoper njega. Zdrav! 
[23:31] Tedaj so vojaki, kakor jim se je bilo naročilo, Pavla vzeli in odpeljali po noči v Antipatrido. 
[23:32] A drugi dan so se vrnili v grad, pustivši konjike, da so šli ž njim. 
[23:33] Ti pa, ko so prišli v Cezarejo, oddali so pismo poglavarju, in postavili so Pavla pred-nj. 
[23:34] Poglavar pa, ko je prebral in vprašal, iz ktere dežele da je, in je zvedel, da iz Cilicije: 
[23:35] Zaslišal te bom, reče, kedar tudi tožniki tvoji pridejo. In ukazal je, naj ga varujejo v dvoru Herodovem. 
[24:1] Črez pet dnî pa snide véliki duhoven Ananija s starešinami in govornikom nekim Tertulom; in ti pridejo pred poglavarja zoper Pavla. 
[24:2] Ko je bil pa poklican, začne tožiti Tertul, govoreč: 
[24:3] Da imamo veliko mirú po tebi, in pravice in sreče, ktero se narodu temu godé po tvojej previdnosti, vselej in povsodi, častiti Feliks! sprejemamo z vso hvaležnostjo. 
[24:4] Ali da te ne bom dalje nadlegoval, prosim, da bi nas poslušal ob kratkem po svojej dobroti. 
[24:5] Našli smo namreč tega človeka, da je kuga, in budí punt zoper vse Jude po vsem svetu, in je vodnik ločinki Nazaretskej, 
[24:6] Kteri je izkusil tudi tempelj oskruniti; kterega smo tudi zgrabili in po svojej postavi hoteli soditi; 
[24:7] Ali prišel je Lizija jezernik, ter ga je z veliko silo iz rok naših odpeljal, 
[24:8] Ukazavši tožnikom njegovim, naj gremo k tebi; od njega boš mogel sam, ko izprašaš, vse to zvedeti, za kar ga mi tožimo. 
[24:9] Pritrdili pa so tudi Judje, govoreč, da je to tako. 
[24:10] Pavel pa odgovorí, ko mu je poglavar namignil, da naj govorí: Ker vém, da si veliko let sèm sodnik temu narodu, odgovarjal bom to, kar se mene tiče, toliko srčneje: 
[24:11] Ko lahko zvéš, da ni več, kakor dvanajst dnî, kar sem prišel molit v Jeruzalem. 
[24:12] In niso me našli v tempeljnu, da bi se bil s kom prepiral ali da bi bil napravljal hrup med ljudstvom, ne po shajališčih, ne po mestu; 
[24:13] In tudi izkazati ne morejo, za kar me sedaj tožijo. 
[24:14] To ti pa priznavam, da po poti, ktero imenujejo ločinko, tako služim Boga očakov, verovaje vse, kar je po postavi in v prerokih pisano, 
[24:15] Upanje imajoč na Boga, kterega tudi oni sami čakajo, da bo vstajanje mrtvim, pravičnim in nepravičnim. 
[24:16] V tem si pa sam prizadevam, da bi brezmadežno vest imel pred Bogom in ljudmí vsegdar. 
[24:17] Črez več pa let sem prišel miloščino delit narodu svojemu in daritve; 
[24:18] Pri tem so me našli očiščenega v tempeljnu, ne z ljudstvom ne s hrupom, neki Judje iz Azije, 
[24:19] Kteri bi imeli predte priti in tožiti, če kaj imajo zoper mene. 
[24:20] Ali naj ti sami povedó, če so našli krivico na meni, ko sem stal pred zborom; 
[24:21] Razen za voljo tega edinega glasú, s kterim sem zavpil, stoječ med njimi: Za voljo vstajanja mrtvih me sodite danes. 
[24:22] Slišavši pa to Feliks, odloží jim, na tanko vedoč, kar ta pot zadeva, in reče: Kedar Lizija jezernik snide, razsodil bom vašo stvar. 
[24:23] In ukazal je stotniku, da se ima Pavel varovati, in da naj se nikomur od njegovih ne brani streči mu ali dohajati k njemu. 
[24:24] A črez nekaj dnî pride Feliks z Družilo ženo svojo, ktera je bila Judinja, in pokliče Pavla, in slišal ga je o veri v Kristusa. 
[24:25] Ko je pa govoril on o pravici in zdržljivosti in prihodnjej sodbi, uplaši se Feliks, in odgovorí: Za sedaj pojdi; a kedar bom prigoden čas imel, poklical te bom. 
[24:26] Zraven se je pa tudi nadejal, da mu bo Pavel dal denarja, da bi ga izpustil; za to ga je tudi pogostoma klical in se razgovarjal ž njim. 
[24:27] Ko ste se pa izpolnili dve leti, prejme Feliks nastopnika Porcija Festa; hoteč pa Feliks Judom ugoditi, pustil je Pavla zvezanega. 
[25:1] Fest torej, ko je bil prišel v deželo, izšel je črez tri dnî iz Cezareje v Jeruzalem. 
[25:2] In prišli so k njemu véliki duhovni in prvaki Judovski zoper Pavla, in prosili so ga, 
[25:3] Iskajoč milosti zoper njega, da bi ga poslal v Jeruzalem, in zalezovali so, da bi ga umorili na poti. 
[25:4] Fest pa odgovorí, da se Pavel varuje v Cezareji, in da on sam kmalu pojde tje. 
[25:5] Kteri torej od vas morejo, reče, naj z menoj snidejo, in če je kakošna krivica na tem možu, naj ga tožijo. 
[25:6] In prebivši med njimi ne več kakor deset dnî, snide v Cezarejo, in drugi dan sede na sodišče, in ukaže Pavla pripeljati. 
[25:7] Ko ga pa pripeljejo, obstopijo ga Judje, kteri so prišli iz Jeruzalema, in prinašali so zoper Pavla mnoge in težke krivice, kterih niso mogli izkazati, 
[25:8] Ko se je Pavel zagovarjal: Nič se nisem pregrešil ne zoper postavo Judovsko, ne zoper tempelj, ne zoper cesarja. 
[25:9] Fest pa, hoteč Judom ugoditi, odgovorí Pavlu in reče: Hočeš iti gor v Jeruzalem, da te tam sodim za to? 
[25:10] Pavel pa reče: Na cesarjevem sodišči stojim, kjer me je treba soditi; Judom nisem nobene krivice storil, kakor tudi ti dobro veš. 
[25:11] Kajti če sem kriv, in sem kaj smrti vrednega storil, ne branim se umreti; če pa nič tega ni, česar me dolžé, ne more me nihče njim izdati. Na cesarja se sklicujem. 
[25:12] Tedaj Fest, pogovorivši se z zborom, reče: Na cesarja si se sklical, k cesarju pojdeš. 
[25:13] Ko je pa minilo nekoliko dnî, prideta Agripa kralj in Bernika v Cezarejo pozdravljat Festa. 
[25:14] Ko sta se pa več dnî tam mudila, pové Fest kralju zadevo Pavlovo, govoreč: Nekega moža je pustil Feliks v ječi, 
[25:15] Za voljo kterega so, ko sem bil v Jeruzalemu, prišli k meni véliki duhovni in starešine Judovski, proseč, naj ga obsodim; 
[25:16] Kterim sem odgovoril, da ni navada pri Rimljanih, da bi se izdal kakošen človek na smrt; dokler obtoženi nima pred licem tožnikov, in ne prejme mesta, da se zagovarja za krivico. 
[25:17] Ko so se torej tu sešli, sedel sem brez vsega odlašanja drugi dan na sodišče, in ukazal sem moža pripeljati; 
[25:18] Kogar tožniki stoječ tam, niso nobene takošne krivice očitali, kakoršnih sem pričakoval jaz; 
[25:19] Nego nekošna vprašanja o svojej praznej veri so imeli zoper njega, in o nekošnem Jezusu, kteri je umrl, za kogar je Pavel trdil, da živí. 
[25:20] Jaz pa, ne vedoč, kaj bi na to vprašanje odgovoril, rekel sem, ako bi hotel iti v Jeruzalem, in tam sojen biti za to, 
[25:21] Ko se je pa Pavel oglasil, da naj ga varujemo do Avgustove sodbe, ukazal sem ga varovati, dokler ga ne pošljem k cesarju. 
[25:22] Agripa pa Festu reče: Rad bi tudi jaz tega človeka slišal. On pa: Jutri, reče, ga boš slišal. 
[25:23] Drugi dan pa, ko je prišel Agripa in Bernika z veliko slavo, in sta vstopila v sodnišnico, z jezerniki in najimenitnijimi mestnimi možmi, in je bil Fest ukazal, pripeljejo Pavla. 
[25:24] In Fest reče: Agripa kralj, in vsi možjé, kteri ste tu z nami! vidite tega, za voljo kterega me je vsa množica Judov nadlegovala v Jeruzalemu in tu, kričeč, da ne sme več živeti. 
[25:25] Jaz pa, ko sem spoznal, da ni nič smrti vrednega storil, in se je tudi on sam sklical na cesarja, sklenil sem ga poslati; 
[25:26] Za kterega nimam kaj gotovega pisati gospodarju: za to sem ga pripeljal pred vas, in zlasti pred tebe, kralj Agripa, da bom, ko se izpraša, imel kaj pisati. 
[25:27] Kajti neumno mi se zdí poslati zvezanega, krivice pa njegove ne naznaniti. 
[26:1] Agripa pa Pavlu reče: Dopušča ti se, da sam zase govoriš. Tedaj se je Pavel zagovarjal, stegnivši roko: 
[26:2] Srečnega se štejem, kralj Agripa, da se imam danes pred teboj zagovarjati za vse, česar me Judje dolžé: 
[26:3] Zlasti, ker vém, da poznaš vse šege in prepire, kteri so med Judi: za to te prosim, da bi me potrpežljivo poslušal. 
[26:4] Življenje torej moje od mladosti, kakošno je bilo od začetka med narodom mojim v Jeruzalemu, vedó vsi Judje, 
[26:5] Poznajoč me od začetka (če hočejo pričati), da sem po najostrejšej ločinki vere naše živel ko Farizej. 
[26:6] In sedaj stojim pred sodbo za voljo upanja obljube, ktero je obljubil Bog očetom našim; 
[26:7] Ktero dvanajsteri rodovi naši, služeč Bogu noč in dan, upajo doseči. Za voljo tega upanja sem, kralj Agripa! tožen od Judov. 
[26:8] Kaj? Neverjetno vam se zdí, da Bog mrtve obuja? 
[26:9] Tudi jaz sem sicer menil, da moram zoper ime Jezusa Nazarečana veliko nasprotnega storiti; 
[26:10] Kar sem tudi storil v Jeruzalemu, in veliko svetih sem jaz v ječe zaprl, ko sem bil od vélikih duhovnov oblast prejel. In ko so jih morili, pristajal sem na sodbo. 
[26:11] In po vseh shajališčih sem jih pogosto mučil in silil preklinjati: in neizmerno sem divjal zoper nje, in preganjal sem jih tudi noter do vnanjih mest; 
[26:12] In ko sem za tega voljo šel v Damask z oblastjo in dovoljenjem od vélikih duhovnov: 
[26:13] O poldne na potu sem videl, kralj, z neba luč svetlejšo od svetlobe solnčne, ktera je obsijala mene in tiste, kteri so bili z menoj. 
[26:14] In ko smo vsi padli na zemljo, slišal sem glas, da mi pravi v Hebrejskem jeziku: Savel! Savel! kaj me preganjaš? Težko ti je proti ostnu brcati. 
[26:15] Jaz sem pa rekel: Kdo si, Gospod? On pa reče: Jaz sem Jezus, kterega ti preganjaš. 
[26:16] Ali vstani in stopi na noge svoje; za to namreč sem ti se prikazal, da te naredim za služabnika in pričo tega, kar si videl, in tega, v čemer ti se bom pokazoval; 
[26:17] In otél te bom od ljudstva in poganov, med ktere te sedaj pošiljam, 
[26:18] Da jim odpreš očí, da se izpreobrnejo od teme k luči, in od oblasti satanove k Bogu: da prejmó odpuščanje grehov, in delež med svetimi po veri, ktera je v mene. 
[26:19] Za to, kralj Agripa! nisem bil nepokoren nebeškej prikazni, 
[26:20] Nego sem najprej tem, kteri so v Damasku in v Jeruzalemu, in po vsej deželi Judejskej, a po tem poganom oznanil, naj se spokoré in izpreobrnejo k Bogu, delajoč vredna dela pokore. 
[26:21] Za tega voljo so me Judje v tempeljnu zgrabili in izkusili z rokami umoriti. 
[26:22] Ali dobivši pomoč, ktera je od Boga, stojim do današnjega dné, in pričam malim in velikim, ne govoreč nič drugega nego, kar so govorili preroki, da se bo zgodilo, in Mojzes: 
[26:23] Da bo Kristus trpel, in da bo, prvi iz vstajanja mrtvih, luč oznanjeval narodu in poganom. 
[26:24] Ko je pa to odgovarjal, reče Fest z močnim glasom: Mešaš se, Pavel! Velika učenost tvoja ti jemlje um. 
[26:25] On pa reče: Ne mešam se, vrli Fest, nego besede resnice in razumnosti govorim. 
[26:26] Saj vé za to kralj, pred kterim tudi svobodno govorim; ne verujem namreč, da bi mu bilo od tega kaj neznano: kajti to se ni godilo v kotu. 
[26:27] Veruješ, kralj Agripa, prerokom? Vém, da veruješ. 
[26:28] Agripa pa Pavlu reče: Malo, pa me boš pregovoril, da Kristjan postanem. 
[26:29] Pavel pa reče: Želel bi od Boga, da, bodi si malo ali veliko, da ne bi samo ti, nego tudi vsi, kteri poslušajo danes, takošni bili, karkošen sem tudi jaz, razen vezî teh. 
[26:30] In ko je to izgovoril, vstane kralj in poglavar, in Bernika, in kteri so ž njimi sedeli; 
[26:31] In ko so bili na stran odšli, razgovarjali so se, govoreč: Ta človek ni nič smrti ali vezî vrednega storil. 
[26:32] Agripa pa Festu reče: Izpustil bi se lahko ta človek, da se ni sklical na cesarja. 
[27:1] Kakor je bilo pa sklenjeno, da se imamo po morji odpeljati v Italijo, izročili so Pavla in nekaj drugih jetnikov stotniku, po imenu Juliju, od cesarske trume. 
[27:2] In stopivši na ladjo Adramitsko, da se popeljemo poleg Azijskih krajev, odrinili smo: in bil je z nami Aristarh Macedonec iz Soluna. 
[27:3] In drugi dan smo prišli v Sidon. In Julij je priljudno ravnal s Pavlom, in dovolil mu je k prijateljem iti in dati si postreči. 
[27:4] In ko smo odtod odrinili, peljali smo se za Ciprom, ker so nam bili vetrovi nasproti. 
[27:5] In ko smo morje, ktero je med Cilicijo in Pamfilijo, prepluli, prišli smo v Miro Licijsko. 
[27:6] In tu je našel stotnik ladjo Aleksandrijsko, ktera je jadrala v Italijo, in del nas je va-njo. 
[27:7] Ko smo se bili pa mnogo dnî počasi vozili, in komaj proti Gnidu prišli, ker nam veter ni dal, dopluli smo pod Kret pri Salmonu. 
[27:8] In komaj se vozeč mimo njega, prišli smo v neki kraj, kteri se imenuje Dobro Pristanišče, poleg kterega je bilo blizu mesto Laseja. 
[27:9] Ko je bilo pa veliko časa prešlo, in je bila vožnja že nevarna, ker je uže tudi post minul, opominjal je Pavel, 
[27:10] Govoreč jim: Možjé! vidim, da hoče vožnja z nevoljo in veliko izgubo biti, ne le za blago in ladjo, nego tudi za življenje naše. 
[27:11] Ali stotnik je krmarju in gospodarju ladje bolj verjel, nego temu, kar je Pavel pravil. 
[27:12] In ker pristanišče ni bilo pripravno za zimovanje, sklenili so skoro vsi, odpeljati se odtod, ne bi li kako mogli priti do Fenike, da bi prezimili v pristanišči Kretskem, ktero gleda proti jugu in zahodnjemu severju. 
[27:13] Ko je pa jug potegnil, misleč, da bodo namen dosegli, odrinili so, in peljali so se blizu ob Kretu. 
[27:14] Ali ne dolgo po tem se vzdigne njemu nasproti vihar vrtinec, kteri se imenuje Vzhodnji sever. 
[27:15] Ko je pa ladjo zaneslo, in se ni mogla vetru upirati, izročili smo jo valovom, in nosili so nas. 
[27:16] Ko nas je pa pod neki otočič, kteri se imenuje Klavda, zaneslo, komaj smo mogli zadržati čolnič; 
[27:17] In ko so ga vzdignili, poslužili so se pripomočkov, in ovili so ladjo; in boječ se, da ne bi na kleče zadeli, spustili so jadra, in tako so se peljali. 
[27:18] Ko nas je pa vihar hudo metal, izmetavali so drugi dan. 
[27:19] In tretji dan smo s svojimi rokami ladijno orodje izmetali. 
[27:20] Ko se pa ne solnce ne zvezde niso pokazale več dnî, in ni majhena burja pritiskala, izginilo je uže vsako upanje, da bi se oteli. 
[27:21] In ko se uže dolgo časa ni jedlo, tedaj Pavel, stoječ sredi njih, reče: Imeli bi bili, o možjé! poslušati me in ne odriniti od Kreta, in obvarovati se te nevolje in izgube; 
[27:22] A sedaj vas opominjam, da bodite srčni: kajti nobeno življenje od vas se ne bo izgubilo, razen ladja. 
[27:23] Prikazal mi se je namreč to noč angelj Božji, kogar sem, in komur služim, 
[27:24] Govoreč: Ne boj se, Pavel! pred cesarjem imaš stati; in glej, podaril ti je Bog vse, kteri se peljejo s teboj. 
[27:25] Za to bodite srčni, možjé! ker verujem Bogu, da se bo tako zgodilo, kakor mi je bilo rečeno. 
[27:26] Imamo pa na neki otok naleteti. 
[27:27] Ko je pa štirinajsta noč prišla, in smo se vozili po Jadranskem morji, okoli polnočí zdelo se je mornajem, da jim se bliža neki kraj. 
[27:28] In izmerivši globočino, najdejo dvajset sežnjev; a ko so malo dalje prišli, in so zopet izmerili globočino, našli so petnajst sežnjev. 
[27:29] In boječ se, da ne bi na skalnata mesta naleteli, vrgli so s krma štiri mačke, in želeli so, da bi se dan naredil. 
[27:30] Ko so pa mornarji gledali pobegniti iz ladje, in so spustili čolnič v morje, z izgovorom, kakor da hočejo s prednjega konca mačke spustiti, 
[27:31] Reče Pavel stotniku in vojakom: Če ti ne ostanejo v ladji, to se vi oteti ne morete. 
[27:32] Tedaj so vojaki odsekali vrvi čolniču, in pustili so, da je izpadel. 
[27:33] A ko se je uže danilo, prosil je Pavel vse, da naj vzemó jedi, govoreč: Štirinajsti dan je danes, kar čakate in živite brez jedi, ne vzemši ničesar. 
[27:34] Za to vas prosim, da vzemite jedí; kajti to je za vaše zdravje: ker nikomur od vas ne bo las z glave spadel. 
[27:35] In ko je to rekel, vzel je kruh, in zahvalil je Boga pred vsemi; in prelomivši, jel je jesti. 
[27:36] Tedaj so vsi srčneji postali, in vzeli so tudi oni jedí. 
[27:37] Bilo nas je pa vseh duš na ladji dve sto šest in sedemdeset. 
[27:38] In ko so se nasitili jedí, olajšali so ladjo, izmetavši žito v morje. 
[27:39] Ko se je pa zdanilo, niso poznali dežele; ugledajo pa neki zaliv, ki je imel breg, na kterega so mislili, ko bi mogli, izvleči ladjo. 
[27:40] In ko so bili mačke vzdignili, prepustili so ladjo morju, odvezavši obenem vrví krmil; in razpeli so prednje jadro po vetru, in vozili so se proti bregu. 
[27:41] Ko so pa naleteli na kraj, kteri je imel po obéh stranéh morje, zaudarili so z ladjo ob peč; in prednji konec se je nasadil in je ostal trd, a krm se je razbijal od sile valovja. 
[27:42] Vojaki pa so se dogovorili, da bodo jetnike pomorili, da ne bi kdo izplaval in pobegnil. 
[27:43] Stotnik pa, hoteč Pavla ohraniti, prepové njih naklep, in ukaže, naj tisti, kteri znajo plavati, najprej izkočijo in izidejo na zemljo; 
[27:44] Drugi pa nekteri na deskah, nekteri pa na kosovih od ladje: in tako se je zgodilo, da so vsi živi izšli na zemljo. 
[28:1] In ko so se bili oteli, tedaj so spoznali, da se otok imenuje Melita. 
[28:2] Divjaki pa so nam izkazovali ne majheno ljudmilost; kajti naložili so grmado, in sprejeli so nas vse, za dež, ki je šel, in za mraz. 
[28:3] Ko je pa zgrabil Pavel kup hoste, in je del na ogenj, izide gad od vročine, in obesi mu se za roko. 
[28:4] Ko so pa videli divjaki, da mu visi zver na roki, govorili so med seboj: Gotovo je ta človek ubijalec, kterega, otetega iz morja, pravica maščevalka ne pustí živeti. 
[28:5] On pa otrese zver na ogenj, in nič hudega mu se ni zgodilo. 
[28:6] Oni so pa čakali, da bo otekel ali h krati padel in umrl. Ko so pa dolgo čakali, in so videli, da mu se nič hudega ne zgodí, premenili so so, in pravili so, da je bog. 
[28:7] Okoli tega kraja pa so bile pristave poglavarja otoka, po imenu Publija, kteri nas je sprejel in tri dní prijazno gostil. 
[28:8] Zgodí se pa, da je oče Publijev od mrzlice in griže bolan ležal: k temu Pavel vnide, In molivši, položi na-nj roke, in uzdravil ga je. 
[28:9] In ko se je to zgodilo, dohajali so tudi drugi, kteri so imeli bolezni na otoku, in ozdravljali so se; 
[28:10] Kteri so nas tudi z velikimi častmi častili, in ko smo odšli, naložili so, kar je bilo potreba. 
[28:11] A po treh mesecih smo se odpeljali na ladji Aleksandrijskej, ktera je bila prezimila na otoku, in je imela znamenje Dvojčkov. 
[28:12] In pripeljavši se v Sirakuze, ostali smo tu tri dni. 
[28:13] Odtod smo se okoli peljali, in prišli smo v Regijo, in ko je en dan potem potegnil jug, prišli smo drugi dan v Puteole. 
[28:14] Tu smo našli bratov, in prosili so nas, naj bi pri njih prebili sedem dni; in tako smo prišli v Rim. 
[28:15] In odtod, ko so bratje slišali za nas, izšli so nam naproti noter do Agapijevega Trga in Treh Krčem; in ko jih je videl Pavel, zahvalil je Boga, in napolnil se je zaupanja. 
[28:16] Ko smo pa prišli v Rim, izročil je stotnik jetnike vojvodu; a Pavlu se je dovolilo prebivati, kjer sam hoče, z vojakom, kteri ga je varoval. 
[28:17] Zgodí pa se po treh dnéh, da skliče Pavel prvake Judovske; in ko so se sešli, govoril jim je: Možjé bratje! da si ravno jaz ničesar nisem storil zoper narod ali šege očetovske, vendar so me zvezanega iz Jeruzalema izročili v roke Rimljanom; 
[28:18] Kteri so me, zaslišavši me, hoteli izpustiti, za to, ker ni bilo nobene smrtne krivice na meni. 
[28:19] Ko so se pa Judje ustavljali, prisiljen sem bil sklicati se na cesarja, ne kakor da bi narod svoj imel za kaj tožiti. 
[28:20] Za voljo tega torej vzroka sem vas poklical, da bi vas videl in ogovoril; kajti za voljo upanja Izraelovega sem okovan v to verigo. 
[28:21] Oni mu pa rekó: Mi nismo ne pisem za-te prejeli iz Judeje, in tudi nobeden izmed bratov ni prišel, da bi sporočil ali govoril kaj o tebi hudega. 
[28:22] Prosimo pa slišati od tebe, kaj da misliš; kajti za to ločinko nam je znano, da jej se povsodi zoper govorí. 
[28:23] In ko so mu odločili dan, prišlo jih je k njemu v stanovanje veliko; kterim je razlagal, pričevaje, kraljestvo Božje, in izkazujoč jim to, kar se dotiče Jezusa, iz postave Mojzesove in prerokov, od zore do mraka. 
[28:24] In nekteri so verovali temu, kar jim je pravil, a nekteri niso verovali. 
[28:25] In ker niso bili ene misli med seboj, odhajali so, ko je rekel Pavel eno besedo: Dobro je povedal sveti Duh po Izaiji preroku očetom našim, 
[28:26] Govoreč: "Pojdi k temu ljudstvu in reci: S sluhom boste slišali, in ne boste umeli; in z očmí boste gledali, in ne boste videli. 
[28:27] Kajti okamenelo je srce temu ljudstvu, in z ušesi težko slišijo, in očí svoje so zatisnili: da ne bi kako z očmí videli, in z ušesi slišali, in s srcem umeli in izpreobrnili se, ter bi jih uzdravil." 
[28:28] Bodi vam torej znano, da se je poganom poslalo zveličanje Božje: oni bodo tudi poslušali. 
[28:29] In ko je to povedal, odšli so Judje, in imeli so mnogo prepira med seboj. 
[28:30] Ostal je pa Pavel celi dve leti v svojem najetem stanovanji, in sprejemal je vse, kteri so dohajali k njemu, 
[28:31] Oznanjujoč kraljestvo Božje in učeč to, kar je Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, z vso srčnostjo, in nikdor mu ni branil. 

### Romans

[1:1] Pavel služabnik Jezusa Kristusa, poklican apostelj, odločen za evangelj Božji, 
[1:2] (Kterega je najprej obljubil po prerokih svojih v pismih svetih,) 
[1:3] O svojem sinu, (rojenem iz semena Davidovega po mesu, 
[1:4] Potrjenem za sina Božjega v moči z duhom svetosti po vstajanji mrtvih,) Jezusu Kristusu, Gospodu našem, 
[1:5] (Po kterem smo prejeli milost in aposteljstvo na poslušnost vere med vsemi pogani za ime njegovo, 
[1:6] Med kterimi ste tudi vi, poklicani Jezusa Kristusa,) 
[1:7] Vsem, kteri so v Rimu, ljubljenim Božjim, poklicanim svetim, milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:8] Najprej se pa zahvaljujem Bogu svojemu po Jezusu Kristusu za vse vas, da se vera vaša oznanja po vsem svetu; 
[1:9] Kajti priča mi je Bog, kteremu služim v duhu svojem v evangelji sina njegovega, da se vas neprenehoma spominjam, 
[1:10] Vsegdar v svojih molitvah proseč, da bi se mi kako uže posrečilo v volji Božjej priti k vam. 
[1:11] Kajti močno želim videti vas, da bi vam dal kakošen duhovni dar za potrjenje vaše; 
[1:12] A to je, da se skup porazveselimo z vami s skupno vero, vašo in mojo. 
[1:13] Ne čem pa, bratje, da bi ne vedeli, da sem mnogi krat namenil priti k vam, (pa sem bil zadržan noter do sedaj,) da bi kakošen sad dobil tudi med vami, kakor tudi med drugimi pogani. 
[1:14] Grkom in pa divjakom, modrim in pa neumnim sem dolžnik. 
[1:15] Tako, kar se mene tiče, voljen sem tudi vam, kteri ste v Rimu, evangelj oznaniti. 
[1:16] Kajti ne sramujem se evangelja Kristusovega, ker je moč Božja na zveličanje vsakemu, kteri veruje, Judu pa najprej in Grku. 
[1:17] Ker se pravica Božja v njem razodeva iz vere v vero, kakor je pisano: "A pravični bo od vere živel." 
[1:18] Kajti razodeva se jeza Božja z neba na vsako nepobožnost in krivico ljudî, kteri resnico v krivici zadržujejo; 
[1:19] Kajti kar je znano za Boga, očitno je med njimi, ker jim je Bog razodel. 
[1:20] Ker kar se na njem ne more videti, to se od ustvarjenja sveta opaža in vidi na delih: njegova večna moč in božanstvo, da jih ni moči zagovarjati. 
[1:21] Kajti spoznavši Boga, niso ga kakor Boga postavili niti mu zahvalili, nego zmelo se jim je v njih mislih in potamnelo je njih nerazumno srce. 
[1:22] Izdajajoč se za modre, ponoreli so, 
[1:23] In premenili so slavo netrohljivega Boga s podobo obraza trohljivega človeka in ptic in četveronogih živali in lazečih zverin. 
[1:24] Za to jih je tudi izročil Bog v željah src v nečistost, da se skrunijo njih telesa med njimi samimi; 
[1:25] Kteri so premenili resnico Božjo v laž in so izkazali večo čast in službo stvoru nego stvarniku, kteri je blagoslovljen na veke. Amen. 
[1:26] Za to jih je izročil Bog v sramotne strasti, kajti njih ženske so premenile naravno upotrebljevanje v protinaravno; 
[1:27] A enako so tudi možki, zavrgši naravno upotrebljevanje ženske, unetili se v svojej želji eden za drugega, možki z možkimi sram počinjaje in zasluženo plačo svoje zmote na sebi samih prejemaje. 
[1:28] In kakor niso odobrili, Boga imeti v spoznanji, izročil jih je Bog popačenej pameti, da so delali, kar ni spodobno, 
[1:29] Ter so bili napolnjeni vsake krivice, kurbarstva, malopridnosti, lakomnosti, hudobnosti, polni zavisti, ubojstva, prepira, zvijače, zlobnosti; 
[1:30] Prišepetovalci, obrekovalci, zaničevalci Boga, grozovitniki, ošabniki, bahači, izmišljevalci hudega, roditeljem nepokorni; 
[1:31] Nerazumni, ne držeči zaveze, brez ljubezni, nespravljivi, nemilostni; 
[1:32] Kteri, če ravno so spoznali Božjo pravico, da so, kteri taka dela delajo, vredni smrti, ne samo to delajo, nego tudi privoljujejo na to s temi, kteri to delajo. 
[2:1] Za to se ne moreš zagovarjati, o človek vsak, kterikoli sodiš; kajti v čemer sodiš drugega, sebe samega obsojaš, ker ravno tisto delaš, kteri sodiš. 
[2:2] Vemo pa, da sodba Božja prihaja po resnici na té, kteri taka dela delajo. 
[2:3] Jeli pač misliš to, o človek, kteri sodiš tiste, kteri taka dela delajo, a to delaš, da boš ti ubežal sodbi Božjej? 
[2:4] Jeli bogastvo njegove dobrote in prizanesljivosti in potrpljivosti zaničuješ, ne vedoč, da te dobrota Božja na spokornost vodi? 
[2:5] S svojo trdovratnostjo pa in z nepokornim srcem spravljaš sebi samemu jezo za dan jeze in razodetja pravične sodbe Boga, 
[2:6] Kteri bo dal vsakemu po njegovih delih: 
[2:7] Tistim namreč, kteri s stanovitnostjo v dobrem delu slavo in čast in netrohljivost iščejo, večno življenje; 
[2:8] A prepirljivim in resnici nepokornim, krivici pa pokornim, srd in jezo. 
[2:9] Stiska in zadrega na vsako dušo človeka, kteri hudo dela, najprej pa na Juda in Grka; 
[2:10] A slava in čast in mir vsakemu, kteri dobro dela, najprej pa Judu in Grku: 
[2:11] Ker Bog ne gleda, kdo je kdo. 
[2:12] Kajti kterikoli so brez postave pregrešili, brez postave bodo tudi poginili, in kterikoli so v postavi pregrešili, po postavi se bodo sodili, 
[2:13] (Kajti kteri poslušajo postavo, niso pravični pred Bogom, nego kteri po postavi delajo, opravičili se bodo. 
[2:14] Ker kedar pogani, kteri nimajo postave, po naravi, kar je postavno delajo, ti so, ne imajoč postave, sami sebi postava; 
[2:15] Kteri kažejo, da je delo po postavi zapisano v njih srcih, ker jim je vest za pričo in se misli med seboj tožijo ali tudi zagovarjajo), 
[2:16] Na dan, kedar bo sodil Bog skrivnosti ljudske, poleg mojega evangelja po Jezusu Kristusu. 
[2:17] Glej, ti imaš ime Jud in naslanjaš se na postavo in hvališ se z Bogom, 
[2:18] In poznaš voljo in izbiraš, kar je bolje, ker si naučen od postave, 
[2:19] In si sam prepričan, da si vodnik slepih, svetlost tistih, kteri so v mraku, 
[2:20] Podučevalec nerazumnih, učitelj neučenih, imajoč obrazec znanja in resnice v postavi. 
[2:21] Kteri torej učiš drugega, sebe li ne učiš? kteri oznanjaš, naj se ne krade, kradeš? 
[2:22] Kteri govoriš, naj se ne prešestvuje, prešestvuješ? kteri odurjaš malike, svetišče okradaš? 
[2:23] Kteri se hvališ s postavo, s prestopom postave Bogu nečast delaš? 
[2:24] "Ker se ime Božje po vas preklinja med pogani," kakor je pisano. 
[2:25] Obreza je res da hasnovita, če po postavi delaš; če si pa prestopnik postave, postala je tvoja obreza neobreza. 
[2:26] Če torej obreza pravice postave varuje, ne bo li se njegova neobreza za obrezo vzela? 
[2:27] In sodila bo neobreza od narave, ktera postavo izpolnjuje, tebe s črko in obrezo prestopnika postave. 
[2:28] Kajti ni Jud, kteri je po zvunanjem Jud, tudi ni obreza, ktera je zvunaj na mesu, 
[2:29] Nego ta je Jud, kteri je znotraj in obreza srca v duhu, ne v črki, to je obreza; komur hvala ne od ljudî, nego od Boga, 
[3:1] Kaj ima torej Jud obilneje? ali kaj hasni obreza? 
[3:2] Mnogo, vsakakor: kajti prvič zaupali mu so se izreki Božji. 
[3:3] Pa kaj, če niso verovali nekteri? bo li njih nevera vero Božjo odpravila? 
[3:4] Bog ne daj! nego Bog naj bo resničen, a vsak človek lažnjivec, kakor je pisano: "Da se opravičiš v svojih besedah in zmagaš, kedar te bodo sodili.", 
[3:5] Če pa naša krivica Božjo pravico potrjuje, kaj porečemo? da je nepravičen Bog, kedar se jezi? Po človeku govorim. 
[3:6] Bog ne daj! ker kako bo sodil Bog svet? 
[3:7] Kajti če se resnica Božja v mojej laži poobilša na njegovo slavo, za kaj bi bil še tudi jaz kakor grešnik sojen? 
[3:8] In ne smemo li, (kakor kričé na nas in pravijo nekteri da mi govorimo), storiti hudo, da pride dobro? Teh le čaka pravična sodba. 
[3:9] Kaj torej? jeli smo bolji? nikakor: kajti prej smo dokazali, da so Judje in pa Grki vsi pod grehom. 
[3:10] Kakor je pisano: "Da ni pravičnega ne enega: 
[3:11] Ni ga, kteri bi bil razumen, ni ga, kteri bi iskal Boga. 
[3:12] Vsi so se uganili, ob enem so se izpridili; ni ga, kteri bi delal dobro, ni ga le enega ne." 
[3:13] "Grob odprt je njih grlo, s svojimi jeziki goljufno govoré: "kačji strup je pod njih ustnicami." 
[3:14] "Njih usta so polna kletve in grenkobe." 
[3:15] "Hitre so njih noge, da kri prelijó." 
[3:16] "Potrtje in nadloga je na njih potih." 
[3:17] "In poti mira niso spoznali." 
[3:18] "Ni straha Božjega pred njih očmi." 
[3:19] Vemo pa, da vse, kar postava govori, govori tem, kteri so v postavi, da se vsaka usta zamašé in kriv postane ves svet Bogu; 
[3:20] Kajti iz del postave se ne bo opravičilo nobeno meso pred njim, ker skozi postavo prihaja spoznanje greha. 
[3:21] Sedaj pa se je brez postave pravica Božja pokazala, spričevana od postave in prerokov. 
[3:22] A pravica Božja z vero Jezusa Kristusa v vse in na vse, kteri verujejo, ker ga ni razločka; 
[3:23] Kajti vsi so pregrešili ter jim manjka slave Božje, 
[3:24] In opravičujejo se daroma z njegovo milostjo po odkupljenji v Jezusu Kristusu, 
[3:25] Kterega si je najprej odménil Bog za pomirjenje po veri v njegovej krvi, da pokaže svojo pravico z odpuščenjem prejšnjih grehov; 
[3:26] V potrpljenji Božjem, da pokaže svojo pravico v sedanjem času, da je on pravičen in da opravičuje tega, kteri je iz vere Kristusove. 
[3:27] Kje je torej hvala? Zavrgla se je. Po kakošnej postavi? jeli dél? ne, nego po postavi vere. 
[3:28] Mislimo torej, da se z vero opravičuje človek, brez del postave. 
[3:29] Jeli je Bog samo Judovski? jeli ni tudi poganski? Dà, tudi poganski. 
[3:30] Kajti eden je Bog, kteri bo opravičil obrezo iz vere in neobrezo po veri. 
[3:31] Postavo torej odpravljamo z vero? Bog ne daj! nego postavo stavimo. 
[4:1] Kaj torej porečemo, da je Abraham naš oče našel po mesu? 
[4:2] Kajti če se je Abraham iz del opravičil, ima hvalo, ali ne pri Bogu. 
[4:3] Ker kaj pravi pismo? "Veroval pa je Abraham in zaračunilo se mu je za pravico." 
[4:4] A tistemu, kteri dela, ne računi se plača po milosti, nego po dolgu; 
[4:5] Tistemu pa, kteri ne dela, a veruje v tistega, kteri opravičuje nepobožnega, računi se njegova vera za pravico. 
[4:6] Kakor tudi David pravi, da je blago človeku, komur Bog računi pravico brez del. 
[4:7] "Blagor jim, kterim so se odpustile nepostavnosti, in kterih grehi so se pokrili." 
[4:8] "Blagor možu, kteremu ni zaračunil Gospod greha." 
[4:9] Blago torej to le je v obrezi ali v neobrezi? Kajti pravimo, da se je zaračunila Abrahamu vera za pravico. 
[4:10] Kako torej se mu je zaračunila? kedar je bil v obrezi ali v neobrezi? Ne v obrezi, nego v neobrezi. 
[4:11] In prejel je znamenje obreze, pečat pravice vere, ktera je v neobrezi, da bi bil oče vseh, kteri verujejo v neobrezi, da bi se zaračunilo tudi njim za pravico; 
[4:12] In da bi bil oče obreze ne samo tistim, kteri so iz obreze, nego tudi tistim, kteri hodijo po stopinjah vere v neobrezi očeta našega Abrahama; 
[4:13] Kajti ni se dala s postavo obljuba Abrahamu ali njegovemu semenu, da bo dedič sveta, nego s pravico vere. 
[4:14] Ker če so dediči ti, kteri so iz postave, prazna je vera in brez veljave obljuba. 
[4:15] Kajti postava jezo napravlja, ker kjer ni postave, tudi ni prestopa. 
[4:16] Za to iz vere, da po milosti, da bi bila trdna obljuba vsakemu semenu, ne samo tistemu, ktero je iz postave, nego tudi tistemu, ktero je iz vere Abrahama, kteri je oče vseh nas, 
[4:17] (Kakor je pisano: "Za očeta mnogih narodov sem te postavil.") pred Bogom, kteremu je veroval, kteri oživlja mrtve in kliče to, kar ni, kakor da je. 
[4:18] Kteri je veroval na up proti upu, da postane oče mnogih narodov poleg rečenega: "Tako bo seme tvoje." 
[4:19] In ne oslabevši v veri ni premislil svojega telesa uže umrtvljenega, ker je imel blizu sto let, in mrtvosti maternice Sarine. 
[4:20] A na obljubo Božjo ni posumnjil z nevero, nego ojačil se je v veri davši čast Bogu. 
[4:21] In popolnoma prepričavši se, da je, kar je obljubil, mogoč tudi storiti. 
[4:22] Za to se mu je tudi zaračunilo za pravico. 
[4:23] Ali ni napisano samo za njega, da se mu je zaračunilo; 
[4:24] Nego tudi za nas, kterim ima biti zaračunjeno, kteri verujemo v tistega, kteri je obudil Jezusa Gospoda našega iz mrtvih, 
[4:25] Kteri je bil dan za grehe naše in je vstal za opravičenje naše. 
[5:1] Opravičivši se torej z vero, imamo mir z Bogom po Gospodu našem Jezusu Kristusu, 
[5:2] Po kterem smo tudi pristop dobili z vero v to milost, v kterej stojimo in hvalimo se z upom slave Božje. 
[5:3] Pa ne samo to, nego se tudi hvalimo v stiskah vedoč, da stiska potrpljivost dela, 
[5:4] A potrpljivost izkušenost, izkušenost pa up, 
[5:5] A up ne osramočuje, ker je ljubezen Božja izlita v srcih naših po Duhu svetem danem nam. 
[5:6] Kajti Kristus je, ko smo mi še slabi bili, svoj čas za nepobožne umrl, 
[5:7] Ker bo težko kdo za pravičnega umiral, za dobrega lahko da se kdo drzne umreti. 
[5:8] Pokazuje pa Bog svojo ljubezen do nas, da je, ko smo mi še grešniki bili, Kristus za nas umrl. 
[5:9] Mnogo bolje se bomo torej, opravičivši se sedaj v krvi njegovej, po njem jeze rešili. 
[5:10] Kajti če smo se spravili z Bogom s smrtjo njegovega sina, dokler smo sovražniki bili, s tem bolje se bomo zveličali spravivši se v njegovem življenji. 
[5:11] Pa ne samo to, nego se tudi hvalimo z Bogom po Gospodu svojem Jezusu Kristusu, po kterem smo sedaj spravo dobili. 
[5:12] Za to kakor je po enem človeku greh na svet prišel in po grehu smrt, in tako je na vse ljudî smrt prišla, v komer so vsi pregrešili. 
[5:13] Kajti greh je bil noter do postave na svetu, ali se greh ne računi, dokler ni postave. 
[5:14] Nego zakraljevala je smrt od Adama do Mojzesa tudi nad temi, kteri niso pregrešili na spodobo Adamovega prestopa, kteri je podoba tega, kteri je imel priti. 
[5:15] Ali ni kakor pregreha tako tudi dar, kajti če so po pregrehi enega mnogi pomrli, za mnogo boljo se jo milost Božja in dar v milosti enega človeka Jezusa Kristusa na mnoge poobilšal. 
[5:16] In dar ni kakor greh enega, ker obsojenje je bilo iz ene pregrehe na pogubo, a dar iz mnogih pregreh na opravičenje. 
[5:17] Kajti če je za pregreho enega smrt zakraljevala po tem enem, za mnogo bolje bodo tisti, kteri prejemajo obilnost milosti in darú pravice, v življenji kraljevali po enem Jezusu Kristusu. 
[5:18] Kakor je torej po pregrehi enega prišlo obsojenje na vse ljudi, tako je tudi po pravičnosti enega prišlo na vse ljudi opravičenje življenja. 
[5:19] Kajti kakor so po neposlušnosti enega človeka grešni postali mnogi, tako bodo tudi po poslušnosti enega pravični postali mnogi. 
[5:20] A postava je zravni tega prišla, da se pomnoži pregreha, a kjer se pregreha pomnoži, tam se še bolje poobilša milost, 
[5:21] Da bi, kakor je zakraljeval greh za smrt, tako tudi zakraljevala milost s pravico na večno življenje po Jezusu Kristusu Gospodu našem. 
[6:1] Kaj torej porečemo? bomo li ostali v grehu, da se milost pomnoži? 
[6:2] Bog ne daj! Kteri smo umrli grehu, kako bomo še živeli v njem? 
[6:3] Ne veste li, kterikoli smo se pokrstili v Kristusa Jezusa, da smo se v njegovo smrt pokrstili? 
[6:4] Torej smo se vkup ž njim pokopali po krstu v smrt, da bi, kakor je vstal Kristus iz mrtvih po očetovej slavi, tako tudi mi hodili v novem življenji. 
[6:5] Kajti če smo ž njim enaki po podobnosti njegove smrti, tudi bomo po podobnosti vstajenja, 
[6:6] Vedoč to, da je bil stari naš človek ž njim na križ razpet, da se grešno telo zatare, da bi več ne služili grehu. 
[6:7] Kajti kteri je umrl, opravičen je od greha. 
[6:8] Če smo pa umrli s Kristusom, verujemo, da bomo tudi živeli ž njim, 
[6:9] Vedoč, da Kristus, vstavši iz mrtvih, več ne umira; smrt nad njim več ne gospoduje. 
[6:10] Ker da je umrl, grehu je umrl na enkrat, a da živi, živi Bogu. 
[6:11] Tako tudi vi za se mislite, da ste mrtvi grehu, a živi Bogu v Kristusu Jezusu Gospodu našem. 
[6:12] Ne kraljuje naj torej greh v vašem smrtnem telesu, da ga poslušate v poželenjih njegovih. 
[6:13] Tudi ne dajte svojih udov grehu za orožje krivice, nego dajte sebe Bogu kakor kteri ste živi iz mrtvih, in ude svoje Bogu za orožje pravice. 
[6:14] Kajti greh ne bo nad vami gospodoval, ker niste pod postavo, nego pod milostjo. 
[6:15] Kaj torej? bomo li grešili, ker nismo pod postavo, nego pod milostjo? Bog ne daj! 
[6:16] Ne veste li, komur dajete sebe za sluge v poslušnost, da ste tistega sluge, kogar poslušate; ali greha za smrt, ali pa poslušnosti za pravico? 
[6:17] A hvala Bogu, da ste bili sužnji grehu, pa ste iz srca posluhnili podobo nauka, v ktero ste se izročili. 
[6:18] Osvobodivši se pa greha postali ste služabniki pravice. 
[6:19] Po človeški govorim za voljo slabosti vašega mesa. Kajti kakor ste dali svoje ude za sužnje nečistosti in nepostavnosti na nepostavnost, tako dajte sedaj svoje ude za sluge pravici na posvečenje. 
[6:20] Kajti kedar ste bili sužnji greha, svobodni ste bili pravice. 
[6:21] Kakošen sad ste torej imeli ta krat od tega, za kar se sedaj sramujete? Kajti konec onega je smrt. 
[6:22] Sedaj pa, osvobodivši se greha, a postavši Božji služabniki, imate sad svoj posvečenje, a konec večno življenje. 
[6:23] Kajti plača za greh je smrt, a dar Božji večno življenje v Kristusu Jezusu Gospodu našem. 
[7:1] Ne veste li, bratje, (tistim namreč, kteri postavo poznajo, govorim,) da postava gospoduje nad človekom, kolikor časa živi? 
[7:2] Kajti omožena žena je s postavo privezana na moža, dokler on živi; če jej pa umre, odvezana je od moža. 
[7:3] Za to se bo torej prešestnica imenovala, če, dokler nje mož živi, postane žena drugega moža; če pa mož umre, prosta je od postave, da ne bo prešestnica, če postane žena drugega moža. 
[7:4] Tako, bratje moji, ste tudi vi umrli postavi po telesu Kristusovem, da postanete drugega, tistega, kteri je iz mrtvih vstal, da sad obrodimo Bogu. 
[7:5] Kajti ko smo bili v mesu, delale so v naših udih grešne strasti zbujene po postavi, da smrti sad obrodé. 
[7:6] Sedaj smo se pa rešili postave, ko je odmrlo to, v čemer smo bili držani tako, da služimo v novosti duha in ne v starini črke. 
[7:7] Kaj torej porečemo? postava je greh? Bog ne daj! Ali greha nisem spoznal razen s postavo, kajti za poželenje bi ne bil vedel, ko bi postava ne govorila; "Ne poželi." 
[7:8] Ko je pa priložnost dobil greh po zapovedi, napravil je v meni vsako poželenje; kajti greh brez postave je bil mrtev. 
[7:9] A jaz sem živel brez postave nekdaj, ko je pa zapoved prišla, oživel je greh, 
[7:10] A jaz sem umrl in našlo se je, da mi je ta zapoved, ktera je bila za življenje, za smrt. 
[7:11] Kajti greh, dobivši priložnost z zapovedjo, ukanil me je in ž njo umoril. 
[7:12] Tako je postava sveta in zapoved sveta in pravična in dobra. 
[7:13] Dobro je torej meni postalo smrt? Bog ne daj! Nego greh, da se pokaže greh, pripravljajoč mi z dobrim smrt, da postane črez mero grešen greh po zapovedi. 
[7:14] Kajti vemo, da je postava duhovna, a jaz sem mesen, suženj pod oblastjo greha. 
[7:15] Ker kar delam, ne umejem, kajti kar hočem, tega ne delam, nego kar sovražim, to delam. 
[7:16] Če pa to delam, kar ne čem, pritrjam postavi, da je dobra. 
[7:17] Sedaj pa uže nič več jaz ne delam tega, nego v meni prebivajoči greh. 
[7:18] Kajti vem, da ne prebiva v meni, (to je v mojem mesu,) dobro, ker hoteti, to je pri meni, ali do konca doganjati dobro, tega ne nahajam. 
[7:19] Kajti dobro, kar hočem, ne delam, nego hudo, kar ne čem, delam. 
[7:20] Če pa to delam, kar ne čem jaz, nič več jaz tega ne delam, nego v meni prebivajoči greh. 
[7:21] Nahajam torej postavo, kedar hočem dobro delati, da se me hudo drži. 
[7:22] Kajti veselim se postavi Božjej po notranjem človeku; 
[7:23] Ali vidim drugo postavo v svojih udih, ktera se ustavlja postavi uma mojega in me zavjema z grešno postavo, ktera je v mojih udih. 
[7:24] Jaz nesrečni človek! kdo me bo otel iz telesa te smrti? 
[7:25] Zahvaljujem se Bogu po Jezusu Kristusu Gospodu našem. Tako torej sam jaz z duhom služim postavi Božjej, a z mesom postavi greha. 
[8:1] Nobenega torej obsojenja ni za té, kteri so v Kristusu Jezusu in ne živé po mesu, nego po duhu. 
[8:2] Kajti postava duha življenja v Kristusu Jezusu me je osvobodila od postave greha in smrti; 
[8:3] Ko je bilo to postavi nemogoče, ker je bila oslabljena po mesu, poslal je Bog svojega sina v podobi grešnega mesa in je za greh obsodil greh v mesu, 
[8:4] Da se pravičenje postave izpolni v nas, kteri živimo ne po mesu, nego po duhu. 
[8:5] Kajti, kteri so po mesu, mislijo na to, kar je meseno, a kteri so po duhu, na to, kar je duhovno. 
[8:6] Kajti meseno mišljenje je smrt, a duhovno mišljenje je življenje in mir. 
[8:7] Za to ker je meseno mišljenje sovraštvo do Boga, ker se Božjej postavi ne podlaga, ker se tudi ne more. 
[8:8] Kteri so pa v mesu, Bogu ugodni biti ne morejo. 
[8:9] A vi niste v mesu, nego v duhu, če Božji duh prebiva v vas; če pa kdo duha Kristusovega nima, ta ni njegov. 
[8:10] Če je pa Kristus v vas, telo je mrtvo za voljo greha, duh pa življenje za voljo pravice. 
[8:11] Če pa duh tistega, kteri je obudil Jezusa iz mrtvih, prebiva v vas, oživil bo tisti, kteri je obudil Kristusa iz mrtvih, tudi smrtna telesa vaša po duhu svojem prebivajočem v vas. 
[8:12] Tako smo torej, bratje, dolžniki ne mesu, da živimo po mesu; 
[8:13] Kajti če po mesu živite, imate umreti, če pa z duhom mesena dela morite, živeli boste. 
[8:14] Ker so vsi, kterekoli duh vodi, sinovi Božji. 
[8:15] Kajti niste zopet prejeli duha sužnjosti za strah, nego prejeli ste duha posinstva, v kterem kličemo; aba, oče! 
[8:16] Sam ta duh spričuje našemu duhu, da smo otroci Božji. 
[8:17] Če smo pa otroci, tudi smo dediči, in sicer dediči Božji in sodediči Kristusovi, če ž njim trpimo, da se tudi ž njim oslavimo. 
[8:18] Kajti mislim, da trpljenja sedanjega časa nimajo vrednosti proti slavi, ktera se ima razodeti nad nami. 
[8:19] Kajti željno čakanje stvora čaka razodetja sinov Božjih; 
[8:20] Ker je stvor podložen ničemurnosti, ne iz dobre volje, nego za voljo tistega, kteri ga je podložil, na upanje, 
[8:21] Da se bo tudi sam stvor osvobodil sužnjosti skaze na svobodo slave otrôk Božjih. 
[8:22] Kajti vemo, da vsak stvor zdihuje in čuti hude bolečine noter do sedaj. 
[8:23] Pa ne samo on, nego tudi sami imajoči prvino duha, tudi mi sami v sebi zdihujemo čakajoč posinstva, odkupljenja svojega telesa. 
[8:24] Kajti z upanjem smo se zveličali. Upanje pa, ktero se vidi, ni upanje, ker kar kdo vidi, kaj tudi upa? 
[8:25] Če pa upamo, česar ne vidimo, s potrpljivostjo čakamo. 
[8:26] Tako pa tudi duh pomaga našim slabostim; ker kaj bomo prosili kakor treba ne vemo; nego duh sam prosi za nas z neizrečenimi zdihi. 
[8:27] Kteri pa srca izkuša, vé, kaj je misel duha, ker poleg Boga prosi za svetnike. 
[8:28] Vemo pa, da tem, kteri Boga ljubijo, vse zdaja k dobremu, tem, kteri so poklicani po sklepu; 
[8:29] Ker ktere je naprej spoznal, té je tudi odločil, da bodo enaki obličju njegovega sina, da bi on prvorojeni bil med mnogimi brati. 
[8:30] In ktere je odločil, té je tudi poklical; in ktere je poklical, té je tudi opravičil; in ktere je opravičil, té je tudi oslavil. 
[8:31] Kaj tedaj porečemo na to? Če je Bog z nami, kdo je proti nam? 
[8:32] Kteri lastnemu sinu ni zanesel, nego ga je za vse nas dal, kako ne bo tudi ž njim nam vsega podaril? 
[8:33] Kdo bo tožil proti izbranim Božjim? Bog, kteri opravičuje. 
[8:34] Kdo je, kteri bo obsodil? Kristus, kteri je umrl, pa je še tudi vstal, kteri je tudi na desnici Boga, kteri tudi prosi za nas. 
[8:35] Kdo nas bo razločil od ljubezni Kristusove? stiska ali nadloga, ali preganjanje, ali lakota, ali nagota, ali nevarnost, ali meč? 
[8:36] (Kakor je pisano: "Za voljo tebe nas moré celi dan, imajo nas kakor ovce za klanje.") 
[8:37] Ali v vsem tem premagujemo po tistem, kteri nas jo ljubil. 
[8:38] Kajti prepričan sem, da ne smrt, ne življenje, ne angelji, ne poglavarstva, ne moči, ne sedanjost, ne prihodnjost, 
[8:39] Ne višina, ne globočina, ne druga ktera stvar nas ne bo mogla ločiti od ljubezni Božje, ktera je v Kristusu Jezusu Gospodu našem. 
[9:1] Resnico govorim v Kristusu, ne lažem, to mi spričuje moja vest v duhu svetem, 
[9:2] Da imam veliko žalost in neprenehano bolečino v svojem srcu. 
[9:3] Kajti želel bi, da bi bil sam jaz preklet od Kristusa za svoje brate, kteri so mi v rodu po mesu; 
[9:4] Kteri so Izraelci, kterih je posinstvo, in slava, in zaveze, in postavodajstvo, in služba, in obljube, 
[9:5] Kteri so očetje, in od kterih je Kristus po mesu, kteri je Bog nad vsemi blagoslovljen na veke. Amen. 
[9:6] Ni pa tako, da je beseda Božja izgubljena, ker niso vsi ti Izraelci, kteri so od Izraela. 
[9:7] Tudi kteri so seme Abrahamovo, niso vsi otroci, nego: "Izaku se ti bo imenovalo seme." 
[9:8] To je, niso ti, kteri so otroci mesa, otroci Božji, nego otroci obljube računijo se za seme. 
[9:9] Kajti beseda obljube je ta: "Ta čas bom prišel in Sara bo imela sina." 
[9:10] Pa ne samo ona, nego tudi Rebeka, z enim imajoč otroke, z Izakom očetom našim; 
[9:11] Kajti ko se še nista narodila, tudi ne storila kaj dobrega ali hudega, da bi ostal sklep Božji poleg izbire, 
[9:12] Ne za voljo del, nego za voljo tistega, kteri kliče, reklo se jej je: "Veči bo služil manjšemu." 
[9:13] Kakor je pisano: "Jakoba sem ljubil, a Ezava sovražil." 
[9:14] Kaj torej porečemo? krivica je pri Bogu? Bog ne daj! 
[9:15] Kajti Mojzesu govori: "Pomiloval bom, kogar pomilujem, in usmilil se ga bom, kogar se usmiljujem." 
[9:16] To torej ni v moči ne tega, kteri hoče, ne tega, kteri ne če, nego Boga, kteri pomiluje. 
[9:17] Kajti pismo govori Faraonu: "Za to sem te obudil, da pokažem na tebi svojo moč, in da se oznani moje ime po vsej zemlji." 
[9:18] Tako torej, kogar hoče, pomiluje, a kogar hoče, trdi. 
[9:19] Porečeš mi torej; kaj se še toži? kdo njegovej volji nasprotuje? 
[9:20] Ali kdo si ti, o človek, kteri se z Bogom pregovarjaš? poreče li izdelek izdelovalcu: za kaj si me naredil tako? 
[9:21] Nima li oblasti lončar nad glino, da iz ravno tiste grude naredi eno posodo za čast, a drugo za nečast? 
[9:22] Če je Bog hotel pokazati jezo in razglasiti svojo moč, prenesel je v velikej potrpljivosti posode jeze pripravljene za pogubo. 
[9:23] In da bi razglasil bogastvo slave svoje na posodah usmiljenja, ktere je naprej pripravil za zlavo, 
[9:24] Ktere nas je tudi poklical ne samo izmed Judov, nego tudi izmed poganov; 
[9:25] (Kakor tudi pri Oseji pravi: "Imenoval bom ne moje ljudstvo svoje ljudstvo, in ne ljubico ljubico." 
[9:26] In bode, na mestu, kjer se jim je reklo: "Niste moj narod vi, tam se bodo imenovali sinovi Boga živega." 
[9:27] Izaija pa vpije nad Izraelom: "Ko bi bilo število sinov Izraelovih kolikor morskega peska, ostanek se bo zveličal." 
[9:28] Kajti besedo je dokončeval in skrajševal v pravici, da bo besedo skrajšano storil Gospod na zemlji." 
[9:29] In kakor je najprej povedal Izaija: "Ko bi Gospod: Sabaot, ne bil pustil nam semena, kakor Sodoma bili bi postali in Gomori podobni.") 
[9:30] Kaj torej porečemo? da so pogani, kteri niso iskali pravice, dobili pravico, ali pravico, ktera je iz vere; 
[9:31] A Izrael iskajoč postavo pravice na postavo pravice ni zadel? 
[9:32] Za voljo česa? ker ni iz vere, nego kakor iz del pravice; kajti spotaknili so se ob kamen spotike, 
[9:33] Kakor je pisano: Glej, polagam v Sionu kamen spotike in skalo pohujšanja; in kdorkoli veruje v njega, osramotil se ne bo. 
[10:1] Bratje, dobra želja mojega srca in molitev k Bogu je za zveličanje Izraela. 
[10:2] Kajti spričujem jim, da imajo vnetost za Boga, ali ne po spoznanji. 
[10:3] Kajti ne poznavajoč Božje pravice in iščoč svojo lastno pravico utrditi, niso se pravici Božjej podložili. 
[10:4] Ker je konec postave Kristus na pravico vsakemu, kteri veruje. 
[10:5] Kajti Mojzes piše za pravico, ktera je od postave: "Človek, kteri je to storil, živel bo v tem." 
[10:6] A pravica, ktera je iz vere, tako govori: "Ne reci v srcu svojem: Kdo pojde gor na nebo? to je, da Kristusa dol popelje; 
[10:7] Ali: "Kdo pojde dol v brezno? to je, da Kristusa iz mrtvih gor popelje." 
[10:8] Ali kaj pravi: "Blizu tebe je beseda, v ustih tvojih in v srcu tvojem;" to je beseda vere, ktero oznanjujemo. 
[10:9] Ker če spoznavaš z usti svojimi Gospoda Jezusa in veruješ v svojem srcu, da ga je Bog obudil iz mrtvih, zveličal se boš. 
[10:10] Kajti s srcem se veruje v pravico, a z usti se spoznava za zveličanje. 
[10:11] Kajti pismo pravi: "Kdorkoli veruje v njega, osramotil se ne bo." 
[10:12] Ker ni razločka med Judom in pa Grkom, ker je ravno tisti gospod vseh, bogat za vse; kteri kličejo njega. 
[10:13] Kajti vsak, kteri bo klical ime Gospodovo, zveličal se bo. 
[10:14] Kako torej bodo klicali tistega, v kterega niso verovali? kako bodo verovali, kterega niso slišali? kako bodo slišali brez oznanjevalca? 
[10:15] A kako bodo oznanjevali, če niso poslani? kakor je pisano: "Kako lepe so noge teh, kteri oznanjujejo mír, kteri oznanjujejo dobro!" 
[10:16] Ali vsi niso bili poslušni evangelju, kajti Izaija pravi: "Gospod, kdo je verjel temu, kar je slišal od nas?" 
[10:17] Tako je vera od slišanja, a slišanje po besedi Božjej. 
[10:18] Ali pravim: Niso li slišali? Se vé da: "Po vsej zemlji je izšel njih glas in na kraje naseljenega sveta njih besede." 
[10:19] Ali pravim: Ni li spoznal Izrael? Prvi Mojzes govori: "Jaz vas bom razdražil po ne ljudstvu, po ljudstvu nerazumnem razjezil vas bom." 
[10:20] A Izaija se drzne in pravi: "Našli so me ti, kteri me niso iskali, razodet sem bil tem, kteri za me niso prašali." 
[10:21] K Izraelu pa govori: "Ves dan sem molil roke svoje k ljudstvu neverujočemu in se pregovarjajočemu." 
[11:1] Pravim torej: Jeli Bog zavrgel, ljudstvo svoje? Bog ne daj! kajti tudi jaz sem Izraelec, iz semena Abrahamovega, iz rodu Benjaminovega. 
[11:2] Ni zavrgel Bog ljudstva svojega, kterega je najprej spoznal. Jeli ne veste, kaj pravi za Elija pismo? kakor se toži Bogu na Izraela govoreč: 
[11:3] "Gospod, preroke tvoje so poubili in oltare tvoje so razkopali, in jaz sem ostal sam in iščejo dušo mojo." 
[11:4] Ali kaj pravi njemu Božji odgovor? "Pustil sem sebi sedem tisoč mož, kteri niso pripognili kolena pred Baalom." 
[11:5] Tako je torej tudi v sedanjem času ostanek po izbiri milosti. 
[11:6] Če pa iz milosti, ni več iz del, kajti bi milost več ne bila milost; a če iz del, več ni milost, kajti bi delo več ne bilo delo. 
[11:7] Kaj torej? Česar je iskal Izrael, tega ni dobil, a izbira je dobila, drugi pa so bili zaslepljeni, 
[11:8] (Kakor je pisano: "Dal jim je Bog duha brljavega, oči, da ne vidijo, in ušesa, da ne slišijo,) noter do današnjega dné. 
[11:9] In David pravi: "Postane naj jim njih miza za zanjko in za lov, in za pohujšanje in za povračilo; 
[11:10] Potamné naj njih oči, da ne vidijo, in njih hrbet čisto upogni." 
[11:11] Pravim torej: Jeli so se spotaknili, da padejo? Bog ne daj! nego od njih pregrehe je zveličanje za pogane, da bi jih na posnemanje razdražili. 
[11:12] Če je pa njih pregreha bogastvo za svet in njih izguba bogastvo za pogane, koliko bolje njih polnost! 
[11:13] Kajti vam poganom govorim, in dokler sem jaz apostelj poganov, hvalim svojo službo, 
[11:14] Ne bi li kako na posnemanje razdražil svoje meso in zveličal ktere izmed njih; 
[11:15] Ker če je njih zavrženje sprava sveta, kaj bi bilo sprejetje, če ne življenje iz mrtvih? 
[11:16] Če je pa prvina sveta, tudi je testo, in če je korenina sveta, tudi so veje. 
[11:17] Če so se pa nektere veje odlomile, a ti, ker si bil divja olika, vcepil si se na nje in postal sodeležnik olikove korenine in tolšče, 
[11:18] Ne hvali se z vejami; če pa hvališ, ne nosiš ti korenine, nego korenina tebe. 
[11:19] Porečeš torej: Odlomile so se veje, da bi se jaz vcepil. 
[11:20] Dobro, za voljo nevere so se odlomile, ti pa z vero stojiš. Ne prevzetuj, nego boj se. 
[11:21] Ker če Bog naravnim vejam ni prizanesel, da tudi tebi kako ne prizanese. 
[11:22] Glej torej dobroto in ostrost Božjo: nad temi, kteri so padli, ostrost, a nad teboj dobroto, če ostaneš v dobroti; če ne, tudi ti boš posekan. 
[11:23] A oni, če ne ostanejo v neveri, vcepili se bodo, kajti Bog je mogoč zopet jih vcepiti. 
[11:24] Kajti če si ti odsekan od olike po naravi divje in si se vcepil proti naravi na pravo oliko, koliko bolje ti le, kteri se bodo vcepili na lastno oliko? 
[11:25] Kajti ne čem, da bi vi, bratje, ne vedeli skrivnosti, (da bi ne bili sami v sebi razumni,) da je trdokornost Izraela deloma zadela, dokler ne vnide polnost poganov. 
[11:26] In tako se bo zveličal ves Izrael, kakor je pisano: "Prišel bo iz Siona rešitelj in odvrnil nepobožnost od Jakoba; 
[11:27] In to jim je od mene zaveza, kedar odvzamem njih grehe." 
[11:28] Poleg evangelja so sicer sovražniki za voljo vas, a poleg izbire so ljubljenci za voljo očetov. 
[11:29] Kajti brez kesanja so darovi in klicanje Božje, 
[11:30] Ker kakor tudi vi nekdaj niste verjeli Bogu, a sedaj ste usmiljenje dobili po njih neveri; 
[11:31] Tako tudi ti sedaj niso verjeli, po vašem usmiljenji da bi tudi oni usmiljenje dobili. 
[11:32] Kajti zaprl je Bog vse v neverstvo, da bi se vseh usmilil. 
[11:33] O globočina bogastva in modrosti in znanja Božjega! kako neizvedljive so njegove sodbe in kako nezasledljive njegove poti! 
[11:34] Kajti: "kdo je spoznal misel Gospodovo?" 
[11:35] Ali: "kdo je bil njemu svetovalec?" Ali: "kdo je njemu naprej dal, ter mu se bo nazaj dajalo?" 
[11:36] Kajti od njega in po njem in v njem je vse, njemu slava na veke! Amen. 
[12:1] Opominjam vas torej, bratje, po usmiljenji Božjem, da podaste telesa svoja za žrtvo živo, sveto, prijetno Bogu, pametno službo svojo. 
[12:2] In ne ravnajte se poleg veka tega, nego premenjujte se z obnavljanjem uma svojega, da izkusite ktera je volja Božja dobra in prijetna in popolna. 
[12:3] Kajti pravim po milosti, ktera mi je dana, vsakemu, kdor je med vami, naj ne misli o sebi bolje, nego je treba misliti, nego naj misli pametno, kakor je Bog vsakemu podelil mero vere. 
[12:4] Kajti kakor imamo v enem telesu mnoge ude, a vsi udje nimajo ravno tistega opravka, 
[12:5] Tako smo mnogi eno telo v Kristusu, a po eden smo eden drugega udje. 
[12:6] Imamo pa darove po milosti, ktera nam je dana, razne: bodi si preroštvo, poleg razmere vere; 
[12:7] Bodi si službo, v službi; bodi si kdor uči, v učenji, 
[12:8] Bodi si kdor opominja, v opominjanji; kdor podeljuje, v priprostosti; kdor je nad kaj postavljen, v skrbljivosti; kdor se usmiljuje, v veselji. 
[12:9] Ljubezen bodi nehinavska, odurjajte hudo, držite se dobrega. 
[12:10] Z bratovsko ljubeznijo eden drugega srčno ljubite, s častjo eden drugega premagujte; 
[12:11] V opravku ne bodite leni, v duhu bodite vroči, Gospodu služite; 
[12:12] V upanji se veselite, v stiski bodite strpljivi, v molitvi stanovitni; 
[12:13] Potreb svetih se udeležujte, gostoljubnost iščite; 
[12:14] Blagoslavljajte tiste, kteri vas preganjajo, blagoslavljajte, a ne preklinjajte; 
[12:15] Veselite se z veselimi, in jokajte z jokajočimi; 
[12:16] Bodite ene misli med seboj, ne mislite na visoke stvari, nego z nizkimi se zlagajte; ne bodite razumni sami v sebi. 
[12:17] Nikomur hudega za hudo ne vračajte. Premišljujte to, kar bi bilo dobro pričo vseh ljudî. 
[12:18] Če je mogoče, kolikor je v vašej moči, imejte mir z vsemi ljudmi. 
[12:19] Ne maščujte se sami, ljubljeni, nego dajte mesto jezi, kajti pisano je: "Moje je maščevanje, jaz bom povračal, govori Gospod." 
[12:20] Če je torej lačen tvoj sovražnik, siti ga, če je žejen! poji ga, kajti to delajoč kopičil mu boš žarjavo oglje na glavo. 
[12:21] Ne daj se hudemu premagati, nego premagaj v dobrem hudo. 
[13:1] Vsaka duša naj se višim oblastim podlaga, kajti ni oblasti razen od Boga, in te oblasti, ktere so, postavljene so od Boga. 
[13:2] In tako, kdor se ustavlja oblasti, ustavlja se naredbi Božjej, a kteri se ustavljajo, sebi bodo obsojenje prejeli. 
[13:3] Kajti poglavarji niso strah dobrih del, nego hudih. Hočeš pa ne bati se oblasti? Dobro delaj, imel boš hvalo od nje; 
[13:4] Kajti Božji služabnik je tebi na dobro. Če pa hudo delaš, boj se; kajti zastonj meča ne nosi, ker je Božji služabnik, kaznovalec na jezo tega, kteri hudo dela. 
[13:5] Za kaj treba je podlagati se, ne samo za voljo jeze, nego tudi za voljo svesti. 
[13:6] Kajti za to tudi davke plačujete, za kaj služabniki so Božji pa se ravno s tem stanovitno pečajo. 
[13:7] Dajte torej vsem, kar ste dolžni: komur davek, davek; komur mito, mito; komur strah, strah; komur čast, čast. 
[13:8] Nikomur ničesar dolžni ne bodite, razen da ljubite eden drugega, kajti kdor ljubi drugega, postavo je izpolnil: 
[13:9] Ker: "Ne prešestvuj, ne ubijaj, ne kradi, ne prisegaj po krivem, ne želi," in če je ktera druga zapoved, ta le beseda jo obsega: "Ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe." 
[13:10] Ljubezen bližnjemu hudega ne napravlja. Izpolnjenje torej postave je ljubezen. 
[13:11] In to delajmo vedoč za čas, da je ura, da se že iz spanja zbudimo; kajti sedaj nam je bliže zveličanje, nego kedar smo vero sprejeli. 
[13:12] Noč je minula, a dan se je približal; odvrzimo torej dela tmine in oblecimo se v orožje svetlosti. 
[13:13] Kakor po dnevi, spodobno hodimo, ne v pojedinjah in pijanščinjah, ne v kurbarstvih in hotljivostih, ne v prepiru in zavisti; 
[13:14] Nego oblecite Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa in ne delajte si skrbi za meso na poželenja. 
[14:1] A slabega v veri sprejemljite ne na razločevanje misli, 
[14:2] Kajti eden veruje, da sme vse jesti, a kdor je slab, sočivo jé. 
[14:3] Kdor jé, naj ne zaničuje tistega, kteri ne jé, in kdor ne jé, naj ne sodi tistega, kteri jé, kajti Bog ga je sprejel. 
[14:4] Ti kdo si, kteri sodiš tujega hlapca? Lastnemu gospodarju stoji ali pada, ali vstal bo, kajti mogoč je Bog postaviti ga. 
[14:5] Eden razloča dan od dneva, a drugi sodi, da so vsi dnevi enaki. Vsak naj se v lastnem razumu popolno prepriča. 
[14:6] Kdor razloča dan, Gospodu razloča, in kdor ne razloča dneva, Gospodu ne razloča; kdor jé, Gospodu jé, ker se Bogu zahvaljuje, in kdor ne jé, Gospodu ne jé in se zahvaljuje Bogu. 
[14:7] Kajti nikdor nas sebi ne živi in nikdor sebi ne umira. 
[14:8] Kajti če živimo, Gospodu živimo, in če mrjemo, Gospodu mrjemo; če torej živimo, če mrjemo, Gospodovi smo. 
[14:9] Kajti za to je Kristus umrl in vstal in zopet oživel, da gospoduje nad mrtvimi in živimi. 
[14:10] Ti pa za kaj sodiš brata svojega? ali tudi ti, za kaj zaničuješ brata svojega? ker vsi se bomo postavili pred sodišče Kristusovo. 
[14:11] Kajti pisano je: "Živim jaz, govori Gospod, da se bo meni pripognilo vsako koleno, in vsak jezik bo Boga spoznaval." 
[14:12] Tako bo torej vsak nas za se odgovor dajal Bogu. 
[14:13] Nič več torej eden drugega ne sodimo, nego presodite bolje, da ne stavite spotike bratu ali pohujšanja. 
[14:14] Vem in prepričan sem v Gospodu Jezusu, da nič ni nečisto po sebi, razen kdor misli, da je kaj nečisto, za njega je nečisto. 
[14:15] Če se pa za voljo jedi tvoj brat žalosti, nič več ne hodiš po ljubezni. Ne pogubljaj s svojo jedjo tistega, za kterega je Kristus umrl. 
[14:16] Ne dajte torej, da se preklinja vaše dobro. 
[14:17] Kajti Božje kraljestvo ni jed ne pijača, nego pravica in mir in radost v Duhu svetem. 
[14:18] Ker kdor v tem služi Kristusu, ugoden je Bogu in izkušen ljudem. 
[14:19] Za to se torej poganjajmo za mir in za zbujanje eden drugega na pobožnost. 
[14:20] Za voljo jedi ne razdiraj dela Božjega; vse je sicer čisto, ali hudo za človeka, kteri jé na spotiko. 
[14:21] Dobro je, ne jesti mesa in ne piti vina ne ničesar, nad čimer bi se brat tvoj spotikal ali pohujševal ali slabil. 
[14:22] Ti imaš vero? sam za se jo imej pred Bogom; blagor mu, kdor ne sodi samega sebe v tem, kar ima za dobro. 
[14:23] Kdor pa razloča, obsojen je, če je, kajti ni po veri; a vse, kar ni po veri, greh je. 
[15:1] Dolžni pa smo mi, kteri smo močni, slabosti slabih nositi in ne samim sebi po godu delati. 
[15:2] Kajti vsak vas naj dela bližnjemu po godu na dobro za zbujanje pobožnosti. 
[15:3] Kajti tudi Kristus ni sebi po godu storil, nego kakor je pisano: "Ogovori tistih, kteri so tebe ogovarjali, padli so na me." 
[15:4] Ker karkoli se je poprej napisalo, napisalo se je za naš nauk, da s potrpljivostjo in s tolažbo pisem up imamo. 
[15:5] A Bog potrpljivosti in tolažbe naj vam da ene misli biti med seboj po Kristusu Jezusu, 
[15:6] Da enodušno z enimi usti slavite Boga in očeta Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[15:7] Za to sprejemljite eden drugega, kakor je tudi Kristus sprejel nas na slavo Božjo. 
[15:8] Pravim namreč, da je Jezus Kristus sluga postal obreze za voljo resnice Božje, da bi potrdil obljube očetov. 
[15:9] Pogani naj pa za voljo usmiljenja Boga poslavé, kakor je pisano: "Za to te bom spoznaval med pogani, in imenu tvojemu prepeval." 
[15:10] In zopet pravi: "Oveselite se, pogani, z njegovim ljudstvom." 
[15:11] In zopet: "Hvalite Gospoda vsi pogani in pohvalite ga vsa ljudstva." 
[15:12] In zopet Izaija pravi: "Bode korenina Jesejeva in kteri bo vstal gospodovat nad pogani; v njega bodo upali pogani." 
[15:13] Bog upanja pa naj vas napolni vsake radosti in mira v verovanji, da bi imeli obilnost v upanji, v moči duha svetega. 
[15:14] A prepričan sem, bratje moji, tudi sam jaz za vas, da ste tudi vi sami polni dobrote, napolnjeni vsakega znanja, mogoči tudi eden drugega svariti. 
[15:15] Pa sem vam drzneje napisal, bratje, deloma, da vas zopet opomenem, po milosti, ktero mi je Bog dal. 
[15:16] Da bom služabnik Jezusa Kristusa med pogani, opravljajoč sveto službo evangelja Božjega, da postane prinesek poganov prijeten, posvečen v duhu svetem. 
[15:17] Imam torej hvalo v Kristusu Jezusu gledé Boga. 
[15:18] Kajti ne bom se predrznil govoriti kaj, kar ni napravil Kristus po meni, za poslušnost poganov, z besedo in dejanjem, 
[15:19] V moči znamenj in čudežev, v moči duha Božjega tako, da sem od Jeruzalema in po okolici tja do Ilirika izpolnil evangelj Kristusov, 
[15:20] Tako namreč prizadevajoč si, da se oznanja evangelj ne, kjer se je imenoval Kristus, da bi na tujej podlagi ne zidal, 
[15:21] Nego kakor je pisano: "Kterim se ni oznanilo za njega, videli bodo, in kteri niso slišali, razumeli bodo." 
[15:22] To me je tudi naj bolje oviralo, da nisem prišel k vam. 
[15:23] Sedaj pa nič več mesta ne imajoč v teh zemljah, a imajoč željo priti k vam od več let, 
[15:24] Kedar pojdem na Španjsko, pridem k vam, ker upam tam tudi potujoč videti vas in da me boste vsi spremili tja, ko se vas poprej nekoliko navoljim. 
[15:25] Sedaj pa potujem v Jeruzalem služit svetim. 
[15:26] Kajti Macedonija in Ahaja sta sklenili nekakošen sklad storiti za uboge onih svetih, kteri so v Jeruzalemu. 
[15:27] Sklenili sta, tudi dolžni sta jim; kajti če so deležniki postali njih duhovnih stvari pogani, dolžni so tudi v telesnih stvareh postreči jim. 
[15:28] To torej končavši in zapečativši jim ta sad, odpotoval bom preko vas na Španjsko. 
[15:29] A vem, kedar pridem k vam, da bom prišel v polnem blagoslovu evangelja Kristusovega. 
[15:30] Prosim pa vas, bratje, po Gospodu našem Jezusu Kristusu in po ljubezni duha, da mi pomorete v molitvah za me k Bogu; 
[15:31] Da se rešim tistih, kteri ne verujejo v Judeji, in da moja služba za Jeruzalem prijetna postane svetim; 
[15:32] Da v radosti pridem k vam po volji Božjej in si skupej z vami odpočijem. 
[15:33] A Bog mira bodi z vsemi vami! Amen. 
[16:1] Priporočam vam pa Febo sestro našo, ktera je služabnica cerkve Kenhrejske, 
[16:2] Da bi jo sprejeli v Gospodu spodobno za svete in jej pomogli, v kterejkoli stvari bi vas potrebovala, ker je tudi ona mnogim pomogla in tudi samemu meni. 
[16:3] Pozdravite Priscilo in Akvila pomagalca moja v Kristusu Jezusu, 
[16:4] (Ktera sta za dušo mojo svoj vrat podvrgla; kterima se ne samo jaz zahvaljujem, nego tudi vse cerkve poganske), 
[16:5] In njih domačo cerkev. Pozdravite Epeneta, ljubljenega mojega, kteri je prvina iz Ahaje v Kristusu. 
[16:6] Pozdravite Marijo, ktera se je mnogo potrudila za nas; 
[16:7] Pozdravite Andronika in Junija, moja sorodnika in moja sojetnika, ktera sta znamenita med aposteljni, ktera sta tudi bila pred menoj v Kristusu. 
[16:8] Pozdravite Amplija, ljubljenega mojega v Gospodu; 
[16:9] Pozdravite Urbana, pomagalca našega v Kristusu, in Stahija, ljubljenega mojega, 
[16:10] Pozdravite Apela, izkušenega v Kristusu, pozdravite domače Aristobulove; 
[16:11] Pozdravite Herodijona, sorodnika mojega. Pozdravite domače Narcisove, kteri so v Gospodu. 
[16:12] Pozdravite Trifeno in Trifoso, kteri sta se potrudili v Gospodu. Pozdravite Persido ljubljeno, ktera se je mnogo potrudila v Gospodu. 
[16:13] Pozdravite Rufa, izbranega v Gospodu, in mater njegovo in mojo. 
[16:14] Pozdravite Asinkrita, Flegonta, Herma, Patroba, Hermeja in brate, kteri so ž njimi. 
[16:15] Pozdravite Filologa in Julijo, Nereja in sestro njegovo in Olimpana in vse svete, kteri so ž njimi. 
[16:16] Pozdravite eden drugega v poljubku svetem. Pozdravljajo vas cerkve Kristusove. 
[16:17] Prosim vas pa, bratje, da gledate na tiste, kteri delajo razpore in pohujšanja proti nauku, kterega ste se vi naučili in izognite se jim. 
[16:18] Kajti taki Gospodu našemu Jezusu Kristusu ne služijo, nego svojemu trebuhu, in z dobrikavim govorom in lepo besedo prekanjujejo srca nehudobnih, 
[16:19] Ker se je vaša poslušnost razšla med vse. Radujem se torej nad vami, pa hočem, da ste modri za dobro, a priprosti za hudo. 
[16:20] Bog mira pak bo potrl satana pod vašimi nogami v hitrem. Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vami! Amen. 
[16:21] Pozdravljajo vas Timotej, moj pomagalec, in Lucij in Jason in Sosipater, sorodniki moji. 
[16:22] Pozdravljam vas jaz Tercij, kteri sem napisal ta list, v Gospodu. 
[16:23] Pozdravlja vas Gaj, gostilnik moj in vse cerkve. Pozdravlja vas Erast, mestni ključar, in Kvart brat. 
[16:24] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vsemi vami! Amen. 
[16:25] Tistemu pa, kteri je mogoč vas utrditi po evangelji mojem in oznanjevanji Jezusa Kristusa, po odkritji skrivnosti od večnih časov zamolčane, a razodete sedaj po preroških pismih, poleg zapovedi večnega Boga, za poslušnost vere med vse pogane oznanjene, 
[16:26] Samemu modremu Bogu po Jezusu Kristusu slava na veke! Amen.  Rimljanom je napisan od Korinta po Febi služabnici cerkve Kenhrejske. 
[16:27] 

### I Corinthians

[1:1] Pavel poklican apostelj Jezusa Kristusa po volji Božjej in Sosten brat, 
[1:2] Cerkvi Božjej v Korintu, posvečenim v Kristusu Jezusu, poklicanim svetim z vsemi, kteri kličejo ime Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa na vsakem mestu, svojem in našem. 
[1:3] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:4] Zahvaljujem se pa Bogu svojemu vsegdar za vas, za milost Božjo dano vam v Kristusu Jezusu, 
[1:5] Da ste v vsem obogateli v njem, v vsakej besedi in v vsakem umenji, 
[1:6] Kakor se je pričevanje Kristusovo utrdilo med vami, 
[1:7] Tako da ne zmanjkuje nobenega dara vam čakajočim odkritja Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[1:8] Kteri vas bo tudi utrdil do kraja, da boste nekrivični na dan Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:9] Zvest je Bog, po kterem ste poklicani na občinstvo sina njegovega Jezusa Kristusa Gospoda našega. 
[1:10] Opominjam vas pa, bratje, v imenu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, da vsi eno govorite in da ne bodo med vami razdori, nego da boste utrjeni v enem umu in enej misli. 
[1:11] Kajti izvedel sem za vas, bratje moji, od Hlojinih domačih, da so prepiri med vami. 
[1:12] Pravim pa to, da vsak vas govori: Jaz sem Pavlov, jaz pa Apolov, jaz pa Kefov, a jaz Kristusov. 
[1:13] Jeli je Kristus razdeljen? jeli je bil Pavel na križ razpet za vas, ali ste se v ime Pavlovo pokrstili? 
[1:14] Hvalim Boga, da nisem nikogar vas krstil razen Krispa in Gaja, 
[1:15] Da kdo ne poreče, da sem v svoje ime krstil. 
[1:16] Krstil sem pa tudi Stefanov dom, več pa ne vem, če sem koga krstil. 
[1:17] Kajti Kristus me ni poslal krščevat, nego oznanjevat evangelj, ne v modrosti besede, da se ne izprazni križ Kristusov. 
[1:18] Kajti beseda križa je tistim, kteri se pogubljajo, neumnost, nam pa, kteri se zveličujemo, je moč Božja. 
[1:19] Kajti pisano je: "Pogubil bom modrost modrih in razumnost razumnih bom zavrgel." 
[1:20] Kje je modri? Kje pismar? Kje preiskovalec tega veka? Jeli ni v neumnost preobrnil Bog modrosti tega sveta? 
[1:21] Ker kedar v modrosti Božjej ni spoznal svet po modrosti Boga, sklenil je Bog po neumnosti oznanjevanja zveličati té, kteri verujejo. 
[1:22] Kajti tudi Judje znamenja prosijo, in Grki modrosti iščejo. 
[1:23] A mi oznanjujemo Kristusa na križ razpetega, Judom torej pohujšanje a Grkom neumnost. 
[1:24] Samim pa, kteri so poklicani, Judom in pa Grkom Kristusa, Božjo moč in Božjo modrost, 
[1:25] Ker je neumnost Božja modrejša od ljudî in slabost Božja je močnejša od ljudî. 
[1:26] Kajti glejte poklic svoj, bratje, da niste mnogi modri po mesu, ne mnogi močni, ne mnogi imenitni. 
[1:27] Ali kar je neumno tega sveta, to si je Bog izbral, da modre osramoti, in kar je slabo tega sveta, to si je Bog izbral, da osramoti, kar je močno. 
[1:28] In kar je neimenitno tega sveta in zaničevano, izbral si je Bog, in to kar ni, da uniči to kar je, 
[1:29] Da se ne pohvali nobeno meso pričo njega. 
[1:30] A vi ste iz njega v Kristusu Jezusu, kteri nam je postal modrost od Boga, pravica in pa posvečenje in odrešenje, 
[1:31] Dà, kakor je pisano: "Kdor se hvali, v Gospodu naj se hvali." 
[2:1] In jaz, ko sem prišel k vam, bratje, nisem prišel z visokostjo besede ali modrosti oznanjevat vam pričevanja Božjega, 
[2:2] Kajti nisem sodil, da vem kaj med vami razen Jezusa Kristusa in tega na križ razpetega. 
[2:3] In jaz sem v slabosti in v strahu in mnogem trepetu prišel med vas. 
[2:4] In govor moj in oznanjevanje moje ni bilo v pregovorljivih besedah človeške modrosti, nego v dokazovanji duha in moči, 
[2:5] Da bi vera vaša ne bila v modrosti človeškej, nego v moči Božjej. 
[2:6] Ali modrost govorimo, ktera je med popolnimi, a ne modrosti tega veka, niti poglavarjev tega veka, kteri se uničujejo. 
[2:7] Nego govorimo modrost Božjo v skrivnosti, tisto skrito, ktero je odločil Bog pred vekovi za našo slavo, 
[2:8] Ktere nikdor izmed poglavarjev tega veka ni spoznal; ker ko bi jo bili spoznali, ne bi bili Gospoda slave na križ razpeli. 
[2:9] Nego kakor je pisano: "Kar oko ni videlo in uho ni slišalo in v srce človeku ni prišlo, to je pripravil Bog tem, kteri ga ljubijo." 
[2:10] Nam pa je Bog razodel po duhu svojem, kajti duh vse preiskuje, tudi globočine Božje. 
[2:11] Ker kdo vé izmed ljudi, kaj je v človeku, razen človečji duh, kteri je v njem? Tako tudi nikdor ne ve, kaj je v Bogu, razen Božji duh. 
[2:12] Mi pa nismo duha tega sveta prejeli, nego duha, kteri je iz Boga, da vemo, kaj nam je darovano od Boga. 
[2:13] Kar tudi govorimo, ne v učenih besedah človečje modrosti, nego v učenih duha svetega, duhovne stvari z duhovnimi primerjaje, 
[2:14] Telesni človek pa ne sprejema, kar je od duha Božjega, ker mu je neumnost in ne more umeti, ker se duhovno razsoja, 
[2:15] Duhovni pa vse razsoja; a njega samega nikdor ne razsoja. 
[2:16] "Ker kdo je spoznal um Gospodov, kteri ga bo podučil?" A mi um Kristusov imamo. 
[3:1] Tudi jaz, bratje, nisem mogel govoriti vam kakor duhovnim, nego kakor mesenim, kakor neučenim v Kristusu. 
[3:2] Z mlekom sem vas napojil in ne z jedjo, kajti še niste mogli in tudi še sedaj ne morete, 
[3:3] Ker ste še meseni: kajti kjer so med vami zavist in prepir in nezložnosti, niste li meseni, in postopate po človeku? 
[3:4] Ker kedar kdo pravi: "Jaz sem Pavlov", a drugi: "Jaz sem Apolov," niste li meseni? 
[3:5] Kdo je torej Pavel, a kdo Apolo, nego služabnika, po kterih ste vero prejeli in kakor je vsakemu Gospod dal? 
[3:6] Jaz sem posadil, Apolo je polil, ali Bog je dal, da je zraslo. 
[3:7] Tako ni ne tisti kaj, kteri sadi, ne kteri poliva, nego kteri daje rasti, Bog. 
[3:8] A ta, kteri sadi in kteri poliva, sta eno; vsak pa bo lastno plačo prejel po lastnem trudu; 
[3:9] Kajti Božji sodelalci smo; Božja njiva, Božje poslopje ste. 
[3:10] Po milosti Božjej, ktera mi je dana, položil sem, kakor moder zidar podstavo, a drugi na njo zida; ali vsak naj gleda, kako na njo zida. 
[3:11] Kajti druge podstave nikdor ne more položiti razen položene, ktera je Jezus Kristus. 
[3:12] Če pa kdo zida na tej podstavi zlato, srebro, drago kamenje, drva, seno, strn; 
[3:13] Vsakega delo bo očito poslalo; kajti dan bo razodel, ker se bo v ognji odkrilo, in delo vsakega, kakošno je, ogenj bo izkusil. 
[3:14] Če ostane koga delo, ktero je nazidal, prejel bo plačo. 
[3:15] Če koga delo izgori, kvaren bo; sam pa se bo zveličal, ali tako, kakor po ognji. 
[3:16] Ne veste, da ste tempelj Božji, in duh Božji prebiva v vas? 
[3:17] Če kdo pokvari tempelj Božji, pokvaril bo tega Bog, kajti je tempelj Božji svet, kteri ste vi. 
[3:18] Nikdor naj sebe ne ukanjuje; če kdo misli, da je moder med vami v tem veku, naj neumen postane, da postane moder. 
[3:19] Kajti modrost tega sveta je neumnost pri Bogu, ker je pisano: "Kteri grabi modre v njih lastnej zvijači." 
[3:20] In zopet: "Gospod pozna misli modrih, da so prazne." 
[3:21] Tako naj se nikdor ne hvali z ljudmi, kajti vse je vaše, 
[3:22] Bodi si Pavel, bodi Apolo, bodi Kefa, bodi svet, bodi življenje, bodi smrt, bodi sedanje ali bodoče; vse je vaše, 
[3:23] Vi pa Kristusovi, a Kristus Božji. 
[4:1] Tako naj za nas misli človek, kakor da smo hlapci Kristusovi in oskrbniki skrivnosti Božjih. 
[4:2] Kar se pa v ostalem išče od oskrbnikov, to je, da se vsak zvest najde. 
[4:3] Meni je pa to najmanje, da me sodite vi ali človečji dan; ali tudi sam sebe ne sodim. 
[4:4] Kajti ničesar sam sebi nimam očitati, ali to me ne opravičuje; a sodnik mi je Gospod. 
[4:5] Tako pred časom nič ne sodíte, dokler ne pride Gospod, kteri bo razsvetil, kar je skrito tme in odkril misli srčne, in tedaj se bo hvala zgodila vsakemu od Boga. 
[4:6] To sem pa, bratje, obrnil na se in na Apola za voljo vas; da se od naju naučite ne više o sebi misliti, nego je pisano, da se nikdor nad nikogar ne napihujete za drugega. 
[4:7] Ker kdo te razloča? kaj pa imaš, česar nisi prejel? če si pa tudi prejel, kaj se hvališ, kakor da nisi prejel? 
[4:8] Uže ste nasičeni, uže ste obogateli, brez nas ste zakraljevali, in Bog daj, da bi bili zakraljevali, da bi tudi mi z vami zakraljevali. 
[4:9] Ker mislim, da je Bog nas aposteljne poslednje postavil kakor te, kteri so za smrt odločeni, ker smo postali pogled svetu in angeljem in ljudém. 
[4:10] Mi smo neumni za voljo Kristusa, a vi razumni v Kristusu; mi slabi, a vi močni; vi slavni, a mi brez časti. 
[4:11] Noter do te ure tudi trpimo lakoto in žejo in goli smo in bijejo nas za ušesa in nimamo stalnega mesta, 
[4:12] In trudimo se delajoč z lastnimi rokami; ko nas izmerjajo, blagoslavljamo; ko nas preganjajo, trpimo; 
[4:13] Ko nas preklinjajo, molimo; kakor smeti sveta smo postali, vseh opláčina noter do sedaj. 
[4:14] Ne pišem tega, da bi vas sramotil, nego vas kakor svoje ljubljene otroke svarim. 
[4:15] Kajti če imate deset tisoči učiteljev v Kristusu, ali nimate mnogo očetov, ker v Kristusu Jezusu po evangelji sem vas jaz rodil. 
[4:16] Prosim vas torej, bodite moji posnemalci. 
[4:17] Za to sem vam poslal Timoteja, kteri je dete moje ljubljeno in verno v Gospodu, kteri vas bo opomenil mojih poti, ktere so v Kristusu, kakor povsodi v vsakej cerkvi učim. 
[4:18] Kakor da ne bi k vam prišel, napihnili so se nekteri. 
[4:19] Ali prišel bom kmalu k vam, če Gospod hoče, in bom spoznal ne besedo napihnenih, nego moč. 
[4:20] Kajti ni v besedi kraljestvo Božje, nego v moči. 
[4:21] Kaj hočete? da pridem k vam s šibo ali z ljubeznijo in v duhu krotkosti? 
[5:1] Celo se sliši, da je kurbarstvo med vami, in to tako kurbarstvo, kakoršno se tudi med pogani ne imenuje, da ima nekdo ženo svojega očeta. 
[5:2] In vi ste napihneni in niste rajši žalovali, da bi se odpravil iz sredi vas tisti, kteri je tako delo storil? 
[5:3] Ker jaz kakor nenazoči s telesom ali nazoči z duhom odsodil sem uže kakor nazoči, da se tisti, kteri je tako napravil, 
[5:4] V imenu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, kedar se zberete vi in moj duh, z močjo: Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[5:5] Izročí satanu na pogubo mesa, da se duh zveliča na dan Gospoda Jezusa. 
[5:6] Ni dobra hvala vaša. Jeli ne veste, da malo kvasa vse testo skisa? 
[5:7] Izčistite torej stari kvas, da boste novo testo, kakor ste presni; kajti tudi naša pasha se je za nas zaklala, Kristus. 
[5:8] Za to praznujmo ne v starem kvasu hudobe in napačnosti, nego v presnini čistote in resnice. 
[5:9] Pisal sem vam v listu, da se ne mešate s kurbarji. 
[5:10] In ne sploh s kurbarji tega sveta, ali lakomci, ali roparji, ali malikovalci; kajti drugače bi vam bilo iz tega sveta iti. 
[5:11] Sedaj sem vam pa pisal, da se ne mešate, če je ta, kteri se brat imenuje, kurbar, ali lakomec, ali malikovalec, ali psovač, ali pijanec, ali ropar. S takim tudi da ne jeste. 
[5:12] Kajti kaj je meni mari, da tudi sodim tiste, kteri so zunej? Ne sodite li vi tistih, kteri so notri? 
[5:13] Kteri so pa zunej, tiste sodi Bog. Odpravite hudobnika izmed sebe. 
[6:1] Drzne li se kdo vas imajoč tožbo na drugega pravdati se pred nepravičnimi in ne pred svetimi? 
[6:2] Ne veste li, da bodo sveti svet sodili? in če bo po vas sojen svet, kaj ste nevredni sodeb najmanjših stvari? 
[6:3] Ne veste, da bomo angelje sodili, nikar li stvari, ktere dotičejo življenje? 
[6:4] Kedar imate torej sodbe, ktere dotičejo življenje, postavljate za sodnike tiste, kteri niso nič cenjeni v cerkvi. 
[6:5] Na sramoto vam govorim. Tako ga ni modrega med vami ne enega, kteri bo mogel razsoditi med bratom svojim, 
[6:6] Nego se brat z bratom pravda, in to pred nevernimi? 
[6:7] Uže to je torej celo slabo pri vas, da sodbe imévate med seboj. Za kaj si ne dajete rajši krivice delati? za kaj se rajši ne dajete oškodovati? 
[6:8] Nego, vi krivico delate in oškodovávate, in to brate. 
[6:9] Ne veste li, da krivični kraljestva Božjega ne bodo podedovali? Ne ukanjujte se: ne kurbarji, ne malikovalci, ne prešestniki, ne mehkuži, ne moželežniki, 
[6:10] Ne tatje, ne lakomci, ne pijanci, ne obrekovalci, ne roparji kraljestva Božjega podedovali ne bodo. 
[6:11] In to ste bili nekteri, ali ste se umili, ali ste se posvetili, ali ste se opravičili v imenu Gospoda Jezusa in v duhu Boga našega. 
[6:12] Vse mi je dopuščeno, ali ni vse koristno; vse mi je dopuščeno, ali jaz se ne bom dal čemu premagati. 
[6:13] Jedi so za trebuh, a trebuh za jedi, ali Bog bo onega in te pokončal. Telo pa ni za kurbarstvo, nego za Gospoda in Gospod za telo. 
[6:14] Bog je pa tudi Gospoda obudil, in vas bo obudil s svojo močjo. 
[6:15] Ne veste, da so vaša telesa udje Kristusovi? Vzemši torej ude Kristusove storil bom kurbine ude? Bog ne daj! 
[6:16] Jeli ne veste, kdor se s kurbo druži, da je eno telo? "Kajti, dejal je, ta dva bosta eno meso." 
[6:17] A kdor se z Gospodom druži, eden je duh. 
[6:18] Bežite od kurbarstva. Vsak drugi greh, kterega če človek storí, je zunej telesa; kdor se pa kurbá, greši proti lastnemu telesu. 
[6:19] Jeli ne veste, da je vašo telo tempelj duha svetega, kteri je v vas, kterega imate od Boga, in niste sami svoji? 
[6:20] Kajti kupljeni ste za drago ceno. Postavite torej Boga v telesu svojem in v duhu svojem, kar je Božje. 
[7:1] Za to pa, kar ste mi pisali: dobro je človeku žene ne dotikati se. 
[7:2] A da ne bo kurbarstva, za to imej vsak svojo ženo in vsaka imej svojega moža. 
[7:3] Ženi mož dolžno dobrovoljnost dajaj, tako isto tudi žena možu. 
[7:4] Žena nad svojim telesom nima oblasti, nego mož; tako isto tudi nad svojim telesom nima oblasti mož, nego žena. 
[7:5] Ne utezajte se eden drugemu razen z dogovorom za čas, da utegnete postiti se in moliti; in zopet se na to snidite, da vas ne izkuša satan za voljo nezdržljivosti vaše. 
[7:6] To pa govorim iz prizanesljivosti, ne po zapovedi. 
[7:7] Kajti hočem, da bi bili vsi ljudje, kakor sem jaz: ali vsak ima lasten dar od Boga, ta tako, a ta tako. 
[7:8] Pravim pa neoženjenim in vdovcem: dobro jim je, če ostanejo, kakor jaz. 
[7:9] Če se pa ne zdržujejo, naj v zakon stopijo, ker je bolje v zakon stopiti, nego pa goreti. 
[7:10] Zakonskim pa naročam ne jaz, nego Gospod, naj se žena od moža ne razloča. 
[7:11] Če se pa tudi razloči, naj ostane brez moža ali pa naj se z možem spravi, in mož naj žene ne odpušča. 
[7:12] Drugim pa jaz pravim, ne Gospod: če ima kteri brat ženo nevernico in ona privoljuje prebivati ž njim, naj je ne odpušča, 
[7:13] In žena, če ima moža nevernika in on privoljuje prebivati ž njo, naj ga ne odpušča. 
[7:14] Kajti posvečen je mož nevernik po ženi in posvečena žena nevernica po moži, ker če ne, nečisti so vaši otroci, sedaj so pa sveti. 
[7:15] Če se pa nevernik razloča, naj se razloča; ni vezan brat ali sestra v takih stvareh; na mir pa nas je poklical Bog. 
[7:16] Ker kaj veš, žena, če moža zveličaš? ali kaj veš, mož, če ženo zveličaš? 
[7:17] Le kakor je vsakemu podelil Bog, kakor je vsakega poklical Gospod, tako naj ravna; in tako po vseh cerkvah velevam. 
[7:18] Obrezan li je kdo poklican? naj si kožice ne navlači; v neobrezi je kdo poklican? naj se ne obrezuje. 
[7:19] Obreza ni nič in neobreza ni nič, nego izpolnjevanje Božjih zapovedi. 
[7:20] Vsak naj v tem poklicu, v kterem je bil poklican, ostane. 
[7:21] Suženj si bil poklican? ne maraj; ali če tudi moreš postati svoboden, udeleži se rajši svobode. 
[7:22] Kajti kdor je v Gospodu poklican suženj, svobodnik je Gospodov, tako tudi, kdor je svobodnik poklican, suženj je Kristusov. 
[7:23] Za drago ceno ste kupljeni, ne postanite sužnji ljudem. 
[7:24] Vsakdo, bratje, naj ostane pred Bogom v tem, v čemer je poklican. 
[7:25] Za device pa Gospodove zapovedi nimam, ali dajem svèt, kakor kteri sem milost prejel od Gospoda, da bi bil veren. 
[7:26] Menim torej, da bo to dobro za sedanjo potrebo, da je dobro človeku tako biti. 
[7:27] Privezan si na ženo? ne išči razveze. Razvezan si od žene? ne išči žene. 
[7:28] A če se tudi oženiš, ne pregrešiš; tudi devica, če se omoži, ne pregreší; stisko pa po mesu bodo taki imeli; a jaz vam prizanašam. 
[7:29] To pa pravim, bratje, ker je čas, kteri preostaja, prikrajšan, da bodo tudi tisti, kteri imajo žene, kakor bi jih ne imeli; 
[7:30] In kteri jokajo, kakor bi ne jokali; in kteri se veselé, kakor bi se ne veselili; in kteri kupujejo, kakor bi ne imeli; 
[7:31] In kteri vživajo ta svet, kakor bi ga ne vživali; kajti prehaja obraz tega sveta. 
[7:32] Hočem pa, da ste brez skrbi. Kdor je neoženjen, skrbi za Gospodovo, kako bo Gospodu ugodil; 
[7:33] Kdor se je pa oženil, skrbi za posvetno, kako bo ženi ugodil. 
[7:34] Drugo je žena in drugo devica. Ktera je brez moža, skrbi za to, kar je Gospodovo, da je sveta s telesom in z duhom. Ktera je pa omožena, skrbi za to, kar je posvetno, kako bo ugodila možu. 
[7:35] To pa vam samim na korist govorim, ne da vržem zanjko na vas, nego za spodobno in stanovitno službo Gospodovo brez ovire. 
[7:36] A če kdo méni, da je sramota za devico njegovo, ko bi bila v zrelej dobi in bi tako imela biti, kar hoče naj dela, ne greši; možé naj jih. 
[7:37] Kdor pa stoji trden v srcu svojem in nima potrebe, a ima oblast nad lastno voljo, in je tako odločil v svojem srcu, da obvaruje svojo devico, dobro dela. 
[7:38] Tako tudi, kdor jo moží, dobro dela; a kdor je ne moží, bolje dela. 
[7:39] Žena je vezana s postavo, dokler živi njen mož; če jej pa mož umre, svobodna je, da se omoží s komer hoče, samo v Gospodu. 
[7:40] Ali srečnejša je, če tako ostane, po mojej misli, kajti mislim, da imam tudi jaz duha Božjega. 
[8:1] Za mališke žrtve pa vemo, ker imamo vsi znanje. Znanje napihuje, a ljubezen zbuja pobožnost. 
[8:2] Če kdo misli, da kaj ve, nikakor ni spoznal, kako je treba spoznati. 
[8:3] Če pa kdo ljubi Boga, ta je spoznan od njega. 
[8:4] Za jedenje maliških žrtev torej vemo, da malik ni nič na svetu, in da ni drugega boga razen enega. 
[8:5] Kajti če tudi so, kteri se imenujejo bogovi, bodi si na nebu, bodi si na zemlji, (kakor je bogov mnogo in gospodov mnogo,) 
[8:6] Ali za nas je eden Bog oče, od kterega je vse in mi v njem; in eden Gospod Jezus Kristus, po kterem je vse in mi po njem. 
[8:7] Ali ni v vseh znanja, kajti nekteri v svesti si, da je malik kaj, noter od seh dob, kakor mališke žrtve jedó in njih vest, ker je slaba, skruni se. 
[8:8] Jed pa nas ne dela prijetnih pred Bogom; kajti če jemo, nismo nič veči, niti manjši, če ne jemo. 
[8:9] Gletje pa, da kako ta vaša oblast ne postane spotika slabim. 
[8:10] Kajti če kdo ugleda tebe, kteri imaš znanje, v mališkej cerkvi ležati za mizo, jeli se ne bo njegova vest, ker je slab, zbujala na jedenje maliških žrtev? 
[8:11] In pogubil se bo po tvojem znanji ta slabi brat za kterega je Kristus umrl? 
[8:12] Tako grešeč zoper brate in bijoč njih slabo vest grešite, zoper Kristusa. 
[8:13] Za to če jed pohujšuje brata mojega, ne bom jedel mesa na veke, da si brata ne pohujšam. 
[9:1] Nisem apostelj? nisem svoboden? nisem li Jezusa Kristusa Gospoda našega videl? niste li vi moje delo v Gospodu? 
[9:2] Če drugim nisem apostelj, ali vam sem, kajti pečat mojega aposteljstva ste vi v Gospodu. 
[9:3] Moje zagovarjanje tem, kteri me sodijo, je to: 
[9:4] Jeli nimamo oblasti jesti in piti? 
[9:5] Jeli nimamo oblasti sestro ženo s seboj voditi, kakor tudi drugi aposteljni in bratje Gospodovi in Kefa? 
[9:6] Ali sam jaz in Barnaba nimava oblasti to delati? 
[9:7] Kdo služi za vojnika na lastne stroške kdaj? kdo sadi vinograd in od njegovega sada ne jé? ali kdo pase čredo in od mleka črede ne jé? 
[9:8] Jeli po človeku to govorim? ne govori li to tudi postava? 
[9:9] Kajti v Mojzesovej postavi je pisano: "Ne zaveži gobca mlatečemu volu." Jeli Bog skrbi za vole? 
[9:10] Govori li vsakakor za nas? Dà, za voljo nas je pisano: "Z upanjem mora orati, kdor orje, in kdor mlati, od upanja svojega del imeti z upanjem." 
[9:11] Če smo vam mi duhovno posejali, veliko li je, če bomo mi vaše meseno želi? 
[9:12] Če imajo drugi del te vaše oblasti, čemu ne s tem bolje mi? Ali nismo se poslužili te oblasti, nego vse prenašamo, da kakošne ovire ne damo evangelju Kristusovemu. 
[9:13] Ne veste, da ti, kteri opravljajo sveto službo, od svetinje jedó, kteri služijo oltarju, da se z oltarjem delé? 
[9:14] Tako je tudi Gospod naredil, da ti, kteri oznanjujejo evangelj, od evangelja žive. 
[9:15] Jaz pa ničesar tega nisem upotrebil in nisem napisal tega, da bi se tako zgodilo z menoj, kajti rajši umrem, nego da mi kdo mojo slavo uniči. 
[9:16] Ker če oznanjam evangelj, ni mi se hvaliti, ker mi je to treba, a gorjé mi, če evangelja ne oznanjam. 
[9:17] Kajti če iz dobre volje to delam, plačo imam; če pa po sili, oskrbništvo mi je zaupano. 
[9:18] Kaj je torej moja plača? da oznanjujoč evangelj zastonj dam evangelj Kristusov, da bi hudo ne upotrebil svoje oblasti v evangelji. 
[9:19] Kajti ko sem bil svoboden od vseh, storil sem se suženj vseh, da bi jih več pridobil. 
[9:20] In bil sem Judom kakor Jud, da bi Jude pridobil; a tem, kteri so bili pod postavo, kakor pod postavo, da bi pridobil te, kteri so bili pod postavo. 
[9:21] Tistim pa, kteri so bili brez postave, kakor da bi bil brez postave, (dasi ravno ne brez postave Bogu, nego v postavi Kristusu,) da bi pridobil tiste, kteri so bili brez postave. 
[9:22] Bil sem slabim kakor slab, da bi pridobil slabe. Vsem sem bil vse, da bi vsakakor neke zveličal. 
[9:23] To pa delam za voljo evangelja, da bi del od njega prejel. 
[9:24] Ne veste, da tisti, kteri na tekališči tekó, vsi tekó, a eden prejema darilo? Tako tecite, da bi prejeli. 
[9:25] Vsak pa, kteri se bori, zdržuje se od vsega: oni torej, da dobé strohljiv venec, a mi nestrohljiv. 
[9:26] Jaz torej tako tečem, ne kakor na negotovo; tako se borim, ne kakor bi po zraku mahal. 
[9:27] Nego tarem svoje telo in usužnjujem, da ne bi kako drugim oznanjevavši sam zavržljiv bil. 
[10:1] Ne čem pa, bratje, da bi ne vedeli, da so naši očetje vsi pod oblakom bili in so vsi skozi morje prešli, 
[10:2] In so se vsi v Mojzesa krstili v oblaku in v morji, 
[10:3] In so vsi ravno tisto duhovno jed jedli, 
[10:4] In so vsi ravno tisto duhovno pijačo pili; kajti pili so iz duhovne spremljajoče skale, a ta skala je bila Kristus. 
[10:5] Ali veči del njih ni bil po godu Bogu, kajti so bili pobiti v puščavi. 
[10:6] To pa so izgledi za nas postali, da bi ne želeli hudega, kakor so tudi oni poželeli. 
[10:7] Tudi ne bodite malikovalci, kakor nekteri njih, kakor je pisano: "Sedlo je ljudstvo jest in pit in vstalo igrat." 
[10:8] Tudi ne kurbajmo se, kakor so se nekteri izmed njih kurbali in padlo jih je v enem dnevi tri in dvajset tisoč. 
[10:9] Tudi ne izkušajmo Kristusa, kakor so tudi nekteri izmed njih izkušali in so poginili od kač. 
[10:10] Tudi ne mrmrajte, kakor so nekteri izmed njih mrmrali in so poginili od pogubnika. 
[10:11] To se je pa vse godilo njim za izglede, a napisalo se je za svarilo nam, na ktere so prišli konci vekov. 
[10:12] Tako kdor misli, da stoji, naj gleda, da ne pade. 
[10:13] Ni vas nobeno izkušanjé prijelo, razen človeško: veren je Bog, kteri vam ne bo dal izkušanim biti nad vašo moč nego bo storil z izkušanjem tudi izhod, da boste mogli prenesti. 
[10:14] Za to, ljubljeni moji, bežite od malikovalstva. 
[10:15] Kakor pametnim govorim; razsodite vi, kar pravim. 
[10:16] Kelih blagoslova, kterega blagoslavljamo, ni li podeljevanje krvi Kristusove! Kruh, kterega lomimo, ni li podeljevanje telesa Kristusovega? 
[10:17] Kajti smo en kruh, eno telo mnogi, ker vsi imamo del od tega enega kruha. 
[10:18] Glejte Izraela po mesu: niso li, kteri žrtve jedó, deležniki oltarja? 
[10:19] Kaj torej pravim? da je malik kaj? ali da je mališka žrtva kaj? 
[10:20] Nego kar žrtvujejo pogani, da žrtvujejo vragom in ne Bogu. Ne čem pa, da boste vi deležniki vragov. 
[10:21] Ne morete keliha Gospodovega piti in keliha vražjega, ne morete imeti dela od mize Gospodove in mize vražje. 
[10:22] Dražimo li naj Gospoda? jeli smo močnejši od njega? 
[10:23] Vse mi je dopuščeno, ali ni vse koristno; vse mi je dopuščeno, ali vse ne zbuja na pobožnost. 
[10:24] Nikdor naj svojega ne išče, nego vsak to, kar je drugega. 
[10:25] Vse, kar se prodaja v mesnici, jejte nič ne popraševaje voljo vesti. 
[10:26] Kajti Gospodova je zemlja in kar jo napolnjuje. 
[10:27] Če vas pa kliče kdo nevernikov in hočete iti, jejte vse, kar se pred vas stavi, nič ne popraševaje za voljo vesti. 
[10:28] Če vam pa kdo poreče: "To je mališka žrtva", ne jejte za voljo tistega, kteri je to obznanil in za voljo vesti; kajti Gospodova je zemlja in kar jo napolnjuje. 
[10:29] Ali ne pravim za tvojo vest, nego za onega drugega; ker čemu bi mojo svobodo sodila tuja vest? 
[10:30] Če imam jaz del hvale, za kaj bi se preklinjal za to, za kar se zahvaljujem? 
[10:31] Če torej jeste ali pijete ali kaj delate, vse delajte Bogu na slavo. 
[10:32] Bodi brez spotike Judom in Grkom in cerkvi Božjej. 
[10:33] Kakor tudi jaz vsem o vsakem po godu delam ne iščoč, kar je koristno samemu, nego to, kar mnogim, da se zveličajo. 
[11:1] Posnemalci moji bodite, kakor sem tudi jaz Kristusov. 
[11:2] Hvalim vas pa, bratje, da se v vsem mene spominjate in držite zapovedi, kakor sem vam jih dal. 
[11:3] Hočem pa, da veste, da je vsakemu možu glava Kristus, a glava ženi mož, glava pa Kristusu Bog. 
[11:4] Vsak mož, kteri moli ali prerokuje s pokrito glavo, sramoti svojo glavo. 
[11:5] A vsaka žena, ktera moli ali prerokuje razoglava, sramoti svojo glavo, kajti je to toliko, kakor bi bila ostrižena. 
[11:6] Ker če se ne pokriva žena, naj se tudi striže; če je pa sramota za ženo striči se ali briti, naj se pokriva. 
[11:7] Mož ne sme glave pokrivati, kajti je podoba in slava Božja, a žena je slava moževa. 
[11:8] Kajti ni mož od žene, nego žena od moža. 
[11:9] Kajti ni ustvarjen mož za voljo žene, nego žena za voljo moža. 
[11:10] Za to mora imeti žena oblast na glavi za voljo angeljev. 
[11:11] Sicer ni ne mož brez žene, ne žena brez moža, v Gospodu. 
[11:12] Kajti kakor je žena od moža, tako je tudi mož po ženi, a vse je od Boga. 
[11:13] Sami med seboj presodite, je li spodobno za ženo, da razoglava Boga moli. 
[11:14] Ali ne uči li vas sama natura, da je možu, če pušča dolge lase rasti, sramota? 
[11:15] A ženi, če si pušča dolge lase, slava? kajti dani so jej lasje na mesto pokrivala. 
[11:16] Če se pa zdí, da je kdo prepirljiv, mi te navade nimamo, tudi cerkve Božje ne. 
[11:17] To naročaje ne hvalim, da se ne na bolje, nego na huje zbirate. 
[11:18] Kajti prvič, kedar se zbirate v cerkvi, slišim, da so razpori med vami, in deloma to verjamem; 
[11:19] Ker je potrebno, da so ločinke med vami, da se pokažejo med vami, kteri so izkušeni. 
[11:20] Ko se torej zbirate na eno mesto, to ni Gospodovo večerjo jesti. 
[11:21] Kajti vsak svojo večerjo pred sebe jemlje ter jé, in tako jo eden lačen, a drugi se opija. 
[11:22] Jeli nimate hiš, da jeste in pijete? Ali zamečete li cerkev Božjo in sramotite tiste, kteri nimajo? Kaj naj vam rečem? hvalil vas bom v tem? Ne hvalim. 
[11:23] Kajti jaz sem prejel od Gospoda, kar sem tudi vam izročil, da je Gospod Jezus tisto noč, v kterej je bil izdajan, vzel kruh, 
[11:24] In zahvalivši se prelomil in rekel: "Vzemite, jejte: to je moje telo, ktero se za vas lomi, to delajte na moj spomin;" 
[11:25] Tako tudi kelih po večerji govoreč: "Ta kelih je novi zakon v mojej krvi; to delajte, kolikorkoli krat pijete, na moj spomin." 
[11:26] Kajti kolikorkoli krat jeste ta kruh in ta kelih pijete, smrt Gospodovo oznanjujete, dokler ne pride. 
[11:27] Tako kdor jé ta kruh in pije ta kelih nevredno, kriv bo telesa in krvi Gospodove. 
[11:28] Ali človek naj izkuša sam sebe in tako jé od kruha in od keliha pije; 
[11:29] Kajti kdor jé in pije nevredno, obsojenje sebi jé in pije ne razsojajoč telesa Gospodovega. 
[11:30] Za to so med vami mnogi slabi in bolni in spí jih veliko. 
[11:31] Kajti ko bi mi sebe razsojali, ne bili bi sojeni. 
[11:32] Ko smo pa sojeni, strahuje nas Gospod, da ne bi bili s svetom obsojeni. 
[11:33] Tako, bratje moji, ko se zbirate k jedi, eden drugega čakajte. 
[11:34] Če je pa kdo lačen, doma naj jé, da bi se na obsojenje ne shajali. Drugo bom uredil, kedar pridem. 
[12:1] A za duhovne stvari ne čem, bratje, da bi ničesar ne znali. 
[12:2] Veste, da ste pogani bili in hodili k nemim malikom, kakor so vas vodili; 
[12:3] Za to vam dajem na znanje, da nikdor v duhu Božjem govoreč ne govori prekletstva Jezusu, in nikdor ne more reči Gospoda Jezusa razen v Duhu svetem. 
[12:4] So pa razločki darov, ali eden je Duh, 
[12:5] In so razločki službe, ali eden je Gospod. 
[12:6] In so razločki del, ali eden je Bog, kteri dela vse v vsem. 
[12:7] A vsakemu se daje razodetje Duha na korist. 
[12:8] Kajti enemu se po Duhu daje beseda modrosti, a drugemu beseda znanja po ravno tistem Duhu, 
[12:9] Drugemu pa vera v ravno tistem Duhu, a drugemu dar ozdravljanja v ravno tistem Duhu; 
[12:10] A drugemu dela moči, drugemu pa preroštvo, a drugemu razločevanje duhov, drugemu pa raznovrstnost jezikov, a drugemu razkladanje jezikov. 
[12:11] A vse to dela ravno tisti Duh, razdeljujoč po svojej volji vsakemu kakor hoče. 
[12:12] Kajti kakor je telo eno in ude ima mnogo, a vsi udje enega telesa, če tudi jih je mnogo, eno so telo; tako tudi Kristus. 
[12:13] Ker smo se v enem Duhu mi vsi v eno telo krstili, bodi si Judje, bodi si Grki, bodi si sužnji, bodi si svobodni, in vsi smo se v enega Duha napojili. 
[12:14] Kajti telo ni eden ud, nego mnogi. 
[12:15] Če reče noga: "nisem roka, nisem od telesa," je li za to ni od telesa? 
[12:16] In če reče uho: "nisem oko, nisem od telesa," jeli za to ni od telesa? 
[12:17] Ko bi bilo celo telo oko, kje bi bil sluh? ko bi bilo celo sluh, kje bi bil voh? 
[12:18] Sedaj je pa Bog postavil ude enega vsakega izmed njih po telesu, kakor je hotel. 
[12:19] Ko bi bili pa vsi eden ud, kje bi bilo telo? 
[12:20] Sedaj so pa mnogi udje, a telo eno. 
[12:21] Pa oko ne more reči roki: "ni mi to treba," ali zopet glava nogama: "ni mi vaju treba." 
[12:22] Nego s tem bolje so potrebnejši udje telesa, kteri se slabejši zdé; 
[12:23] In kteri nam se zdé manje častni na telesu, okoli teh stavimo obilnejšo čast, in naši nespodobni imajo obilnejšo spodobnost. 
[12:24] A našim spodobnim pa tega ni treba. Ali Bog je zložil telo, davši pomanjkljivemu večo čast, 
[12:25] Da bi ne bilo razpora v telesu, nego da bi udje enako skrbeli eden za drugega. 
[12:26] In če trpi eden ud, ž njim trpé vsi udje, a če se slavi eden ud, ž njim se veselé vsi udje. 
[12:27] Vi pa ste telo Kristusovo in udje med seboj; 
[12:28] In nektere si je postavil Bog v cerkvi prvič za aposteljne, drugič za preroke, tretjič za učitelje; po tem moči, za tem dari ozdravljanja, pomaganja, vladanja, raznovrstnost jezikov. 
[12:29] Jeli so vsi aposteljni? jeli vsi preroki? jeli vsi učitelji? jeli vsi moči? 
[12:30] Jeli imajo vsi darove ozdravljanja? jeli vsi jezike govoré? jeli vsi razkladajo? 
[12:31] Hrepenite pa za boljšimi darovi, in še boljšo pot vam kažem. 
[13:1] Ko bi človeške jezike govoril in angeljske, a ljubezni ne bi imel, bil bi brneča med zvenčeče cimbale. 
[13:2] In ko bi imel preroštvo in bi vedel vse skrivnosti in vse znanje, in ko bi imel vso vero tako, da bi gore prestavljal, a ljubezni ne bi imel, nič nisem. 
[13:3] In ko bi na koščke porazdajal vse, kar imam, in ko bi dal svoje telo, da se sežgem, a ljubezni ne bi imel, nič mi ne koristi. 
[13:4] Ljubezen je potrpljiva, dobrotljiva; ljubezen ni nevoščljiva, ljubezen se ne hvali, ne napihuje se; 
[13:5] Ne vede se nespodobno, ne išče svojega, ne togoti se, ne misli hudega; 
[13:6] Ne raduje se krivici, a raduje se resnici; 
[13:7] Vse pokriva, vse veruje, vse upa, vse prenaša. 
[13:8] Ljubezen nikoli ne prestaja, a bodi si preroštva, nehala bodo; bodisi jeziki, umolknili bodo; bodi si znanje, nehalo bo. 
[13:9] Kajti nekoliko poznamo in nekoliko prerokujemo. 
[13:10] Kedar pa pride, kar je popolno, tedaj bo to nekoliko nehalo. 
[13:11] Ko sem bil otrok, kakor otrok sem govoril, kakor otrok sem mislil, kakor otrok sem razsojal, ko sem pa mož postal, opustil sem stvari otročje. 
[13:12] Kajti sedaj vidimo še skozi zrcalo v uganjki, ta krat pa bomo z licem v lice; sedaj še poznam nekoliko, ta krat pa bom spoznal, kakor sem bil tudi jaz spoznan. 
[13:13] Sedaj pa ostaja vera, upanje, ljubezen, to troje; naj veča od njih pa je ljubezen. 
[14:1] Hrepenite za ljubeznijo, a trudite se za duhovne stvari, bolje pa, da prerokujete. 
[14:2] Kajti kdor govori v jeziku, ne govori ljudém, nego Bogu, ker nikdor ne sluša; z duhom pa govori skrivnosti; 
[14:3] A kdor prerokuje ljudém, govori na zbujanje pobožnosti in na opominjanje in na tolažbo. 
[14:4] Kajti kdor v jeziku govori, sam sebe zbuja na pobožnost, kdor pa prerokuje, cerkev zbuja na pobožnost. 
[14:5] Hočem pa, da vsi govorite jezike, bolje pa, da prerokujete, kajti veči je, kdor prerokuje, nego kdor govori jezike, razen če razklada, da bi se cerkev zbudila na pobožnost. 
[14:6] Sedaj pa, bratje, če pridem k vam jezike govoreč, kaj vam bom koristil, če vam ne bom govoril ali v razodetji, ali v znanji, ali v preroštvu, ali v nauku? 
[14:7] Kakor brezdušne stvari, ktere glas dajo, bodi si piščal, ali gosli, če razločka v glasovih ne dajo, kako se bo umelo, kaj se piska ali gode? 
[14:8] Ker če nerazločen glas trobenta dá, kdo se bo pripravil za boj? 
[14:9] Tako tudi vi, če z jezikom razumljive besede ne daste, kako se bo umelo, kaj pravite? kajti v zrak boste govorili. 
[14:10] Toliko vrst glasov, postavim, je na svetu, in nobeden izmed njih ni brez znamenovanja. 
[14:11] Če torej ne vem moči glasa, mutec bom govorečemu in govoreči bo meni mutec. 
[14:12] Tako tudi vi, ko se trudite za duhovne darí, glejte, da boste za pobožno zbujevanje cerkve bogati. 
[14:13] Za to, kdor govori v jeziku, naj moli, da bi razkladal. 
[14:14] Kajti če molim v jeziku, duh moj moli, a um moj je brez sada. 
[14:15] Kaj torej? molil bom z duhom, a molil bom tudi z umom; prepeval bom z duhom, a prepeval bom tudi z umom. 
[14:16] Ker če blagosloviš z duhom, ta, kteri je nepodučen, kako poreče amen na tvoj blagoslov, ko ne ve, kaj govoriš? 
[14:17] Ti se, res da, dobro zahvaljuješ, ali drugi se ne zbuja na pobožnost. 
[14:18] Zahvaljujem se svojemu Bogu, da bolje od vseh vas jezike govorim. 
[14:19] Toda v cerkvi rajši pet besed s svojim umom rečem, da tudi druge podučim, nego pa tisoč besed v jeziku. 
[14:20] Bratje, ne bodite deca, nego v zlobi bodite deca, a v umu bodite popolni. 
[14:21] V postavi je pisano: "Z drugimi jeziki in z drugimi ustnicami bom govoril temu ljudstvu, in tudi tako me ne bodo poslušali, govori Gospod." 
[14:22] Tako so jeziki za znamenje ne tem, kteri verujejo, nego nevernim, in preroštvo ne nevernim, nego tem, kteri verujejo. 
[14:23] Ko bi se torej sešla cerkev vsa na eno mesto, in bi vsi jezike govorili in vnišli bi tudi nepodučeni ali neverniki, je li ne porekó, da norite? 
[14:24] Ko bi pa vsi prerokovali a vnišel bi kak nevernik ali nepodučen, ozmerjajo ga vsi, sodijo ga vsi. 
[14:25] In tako se skrivnosti njegovega srca razodevajo, in tako padši na obraz molil bo Boga oznanjujoč, da je Bog za res v vas. 
[14:26] Kaj je torej, bratje? Kedar se shajate, vsak vas ima psalm, ima nauk, jezik ima, razodetje ima, razkladanje ima: vse naj se zgodi na zbujevanje pobožnosti. 
[14:27] Če v jeziku kdo govori, naj govorita po dva ali k večemu po trije in eden za drugim, in eden naj razklada. 
[14:28] Ko bi pa ne bilo razkladalca, molči naj v cerkvi, a sebi naj govori in Bogu. 
[14:29] Preroka naj pa govorita dva ali trije, drugi naj pa razsojajo. 
[14:30] Če se pa drugemu, kteri sedí, kaj razodene, prvi naj molči. 
[14:31] Kajti morete eden po eden vsi prerokovati, da se vsi učé in vsi opominjajo. 
[14:32] In duhovi preroški podlagajo se prerokom. 
[14:33] Ker Bog ni Bog punta, nego in mira, kakor po vseh cerkvah svetniških. 
[14:34] Žene vaše naj v cerkvah molčé, kajti ni jim dopuščeno govoriti, nego podlagati se, kakor tudi postava pravi. 
[14:35] A če se hočejo česa naučiti, doma naj svoje može prašajo; kajti grdo je ženam v cerkvi govoriti. 
[14:36] Je li od vas beseda Božja izšla? je li k vam samim prišla? 
[14:37] Če kdo misli, da je prerok ali duhoven, spozna naj, kar vam pišem, da so Gospodove zapovedi. 
[14:38] Če pa kdo ne vé, naj ne vé. 
[14:39] Tako, bratje, trudite se, da prerokujete in govoriti v jezikih nikar ne branite. 
[14:40] Vse naj se spodobno in po redu godi. 
[15:1] Napominjam vam pa, bratje, evangelj, kterega sem vam oznanil, kterega ste tudi sprejeli, v kterem tudi stojite, 
[15:2] Po kterem se tudi zveličujete, če držite, kakor sem vam oznanil, če le niste zastonj verovali. 
[15:3] Kajti izročil sem vam najprej to, kar sem prejel, da je Kristus umrl za naše grehe, poleg pisem, 
[15:4] In da je bil pokopan in da je vstal tretji dan poleg pisem, 
[15:5] In da se je prikazal Kefu, po tem dvanajsterim; 
[15:6] Po tem se je prikazal črez pet sto bratom na en krat, kterih največ noter do sedaj živi, nekaj jih je pa tudi pozaspalo. 
[15:7] Za tem se je prikazal Jakobu, po tem aposteljnom vsem; 
[15:8] In izmed vseh naj na zadnje, kakor kakemu prezgodaj rojenemu, prikazal se je tudi meni. 
[15:9] Kajti jaz sem najmanjši izmed aposteljnov, kteri nisem vreden imenovati se apostelj, ker sem preganjal cerkev Božjo. 
[15:10] Ali po milosti Božjej sem kar sem, in njegova milost proti meni se ni izpraznila in natrudil sem se bolje od vseh njih, ali ne jaz, nego milost Božja, ktera je z menoj. 
[15:11] Bodi si torej jaz ali oni, tako oznanjujemo in tako ste verovali. 
[15:12] Če se oznanjuje, da je Kristus iz mrtvih vstal, kako pravijo nekteri med vami, da ni vstajanja mrtvih? 
[15:13] Če pa ni vstajanja mrtvih, tudi Kristus ni vstal. 
[15:14] A če Kristus ni vstal, prazno je po tem naše oznanjevanje, prazna pa tudi vera vaša. 
[15:15] Nahajamo se pa tudi lažnjive priče Božje, kajti smo popričali zoper Boga, da je obudil Kristusa, kterega ni obudil, če mrtvi ne vstajajo. 
[15:16] Kajti če mrtvi ne vstajajo, tudi Kristus ni vstal. 
[15:17] A če Kristus ni vstal, zastonj je vera vaša, še ste v grehih svojih. 
[15:18] Po tem so se tudi, kteri so v Kristusu zaspali, pogubili. 
[15:19] Če samo v tem življenji v Kristusa upamo, vredni smo obžalovanja najbolje od vseh ljudî. 
[15:20] Sedaj pa je Kristus vstal iz mrtvih, postal je prvina tistih, kteri so pozaspali. 
[15:21] Zakaj, ko je bila po človeku smrt, tudi je po človeku vstajanje mrtvih. 
[15:22] Kajti kakor v Adamu vsi umirajo, tako bodo tudi v Kristusu vsi oživeli. 
[15:23] Ali vsak v lastnem redu: prvina Kristus, za tem ti, kteri so Kristusovi v prihodu njegovem; 
[15:24] Po tem konec, kedar izročí kraljestvo Bogu in očetu, kedar odpravi vsako poglavarstvo in vsako oblast in moč. 
[15:25] Kajti mora kraljevati noter dotle, dokler ne dene vseh sovražnikov pod svoje noge. 
[15:26] A najzadnji sovražnik se bo odpravila smrt. 
[15:27] Kajti: "Vse je podložil pod njegove noge," ali ko je rekel: "Vse je podloženo," očitno je, da razen tega, kteri mu je vse podložil. 
[15:28] Kedar se pa vse njemu podloži, tedaj se bo tudi sam sin podložil temu, kteri je vse njemu podložil, da bi Bog bil vse v vsem. 
[15:29] Sicer kaj počnó, kteri se krščujejo za mrtve, če sploh mrtvi ne vstajajo? kaj se tudi krščujejo za mrtve? 
[15:30] Za kaj se tudi mi nevarnostim nastavljamo vsako uro? 
[15:31] Vsak dan umiram, pri vašej hvali, bratje, ktero imam v Kristusu Jezusu Gospodu našem. 
[15:32] Kajti če sem se po človeku boril z zvermi v Efezu, kakošno imam korist, če mrtvi ne vstajajo? Jejmo in pijmo, kajti jutri bomo umrli! 
[15:33] Ne dajte se zavesti! Pačijo dobre navade slabi pogovori. 
[15:34] Predramite se pravično in ne grešite; kajti poznanja Božjega nekteri nimajo, na sramoto vam pravim. 
[15:35] Ali poreče kdo: Kako vstajajo mrtvi? in v kakošnem telesu prihajajo? 
[15:36] Nespametni! ti kar seješ, oživelo ne bo, če ni umrlo; 
[15:37] In kar seješ, ne seješ telesa, ktero ima biti, nego golo zrno, postavimo, pšenično ali ktero drugo; 
[15:38] A Bog mu daje telo, kakor hoče, in vsakemu semenu svoje telo. 
[15:39] Ni vse meso enako meso, nego je drugo meso človečje, drugo meso živinsko, drugo ribje, in drugo ptičje. 
[15:40] So tudi telesa nebeška in telesa zemeljska, ali je druga slava nebeških, a druga zemeljskih; 
[15:41] Druga je slava solnca in druga slava meseca, in druga slava zvezd, kajti zvezda se od zvezde loči v slavi. 
[15:42] Tako tudi vstajanje mrtvih: seje se v trohljivosti, vstaja pa v netrohljivosti; 
[15:43] Seje se v nečasti, vstaja v slavi; seje se v slabosti, vstaja v moči; 
[15:44] Seje se telo telesno, vstaja telo duhovno; je telo telesno, in je telo duhovno. 
[15:45] Tako je tudi pisano: "Postal je prvi človek Adam v dušo živo;" zadnji Adam v duh oživljajoč. 
[15:46] Ali ni prvo duhovno, nego telesno, po tem duhovno. 
[15:47] Prvi človek je iz zemlje, prstén; drugi človek, gospod je z neba. 
[15:48] Kakoršen je bil prsteni, taki so prsteni, in karkoršen nebeški, taki so nebeški. 
[15:49] In kakor smo nosili podobo prstenega, nosili bomo tudi podobo nebeškega. 
[15:50] To pa pravim, bratje, da meso in kri Božjega kraljestva podedovati ne moreta, tudi trohljivost netrohljivosti ne deduje. 
[15:51] Lej, skrivnost vam govorim: "Vsi ne bomo zaspali, a vsi se bomo spremenili. 
[15:52] V hipu, v trenotku z očmi, v poslednjem glasu trobente, kajti trobentalo se bo, in mrtvi bodo vstajali netrohljivi, in mi se bomo izpremenili. 
[15:53] Ker to trohljivo mora obleči netrohljivost, in to smrtno obleči brezsmrtnost. 
[15:54] Kedar pa to trohljivo obleče netrohljivost, in to smrtno obleče brezsmrtnost, tedaj se bo zgodila tista beseda napisana: "Požrla se je smrt v zmagi." 
[15:55] "Kje je, smrt, tvoje želo? kje je, pekel, tvoja zmaga?" 
[15:56] Želo smrti pa je greh, a moč greha postava. 
[15:57] Ali hvala Bogu, kteri nam daje zmago po Gospodu našem Jezusu Kristusu. 
[15:58] Za to, bratje moji ljubljeni, bodite stanovitni, nepremakljivi, obilni vsegdar v delu Gospodovem, vedoč, da vaš trud ni prazen v Gospodu. 
[16:1] A gledé zbire za svete storite tudi vi tako, kakor sem naredil za Galatijske cerkve. 
[16:2] Prvi dan po sobotah naj vsak vas pri sebi deva na stran in spravlja, kolikor mu se dobro zdí, da ne bodo zbire ta krat, kedar pridem. 
[16:3] Kedar pa pridem, pošljem tiste, ktere za dobre za to spoznate po listih, da odnesó vaš blagoslov v Jeruzalem; 
[16:4] Ko bi pa vredno bilo, da tudi jaz grem, pojdejo z menoj. 
[16:5] Prišel bom pa k vam, kedar Macedonijo prejdem, (kajti šel bom skozi Macedonijo). 
[16:6] A pri vas se more biti pomudim, ali pa tudi črez zimo ostanem, da me vi spremite, kedar bom hodil. 
[16:7] Kajti ne čem vas le mimo gredé videti, a upam nekoliko časa pri vas ostati, če Gospod ukrene, 
[16:8] Ostal pa bom v Efezu noter do binkošti. 
[16:9] Kajti vrata so mi odprta velika in široka in nasprotnikov je mnogo. 
[16:10] Če pa pride Timotej, glejte, da bo brez straha pri vas; kajti opravlja Gospodovo delo kakor jaz. 
[16:11] Nikdor naj ga torej ne zaničuje, a odpošljite ga v miru, da pride k meni, ker ga pričakujem z brati. 
[16:12] Gledé brata Apola pa: mnogo sem ga prosil, da bi prišel k vam z brati, in nikakor ga ni bila volja sedaj priti, a prišel bo, kedar utegne. 
[16:13] Čujte, stojte v veri, možki se držite, trdni bodite. 
[16:14] Vse vaše naj se v ljubezni godi. 
[16:15] Prosim vas pa, bratje: veste za Štefanov dom, da je prvina v Ahaji, in da so se na služenje svetim odločili; 
[16:16] Da se tudi vi podlagate takim in vsakemu, kteri ž njimi dela in se trudi. 
[16:17] Veselim se pa prihoda Stefanovega in Fortunatovega in Ahajikovega, ker so mi nadomestili, da nisem vas pogrešal; 
[16:18] Zakaj spokojili so mojega duha in vašega. Spoštujte torej take. 
[16:19] Pozdravljajo vas cerkve Azijske; pozdravljata vas v Gospodu mnogo Akvila in Priscila s cerkvijo v njunem domu. 
[16:20] Pozdravljajo vas bratje vsi; pozdravite eden drugega v svetem poljubku. 
[16:21] Pozdrav z mojo, Pavlovo roko. 
[16:22] Če kdo ne ljubi Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, preklet bodi, maràn athà! 
[16:23] Milost Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa z vami! 
[16:24] Moja ljubezen z vami vsemi v Kristusu Jezusu! Amen.  Korinčanom prvi list pisan iz mesta Filipov a poslan po Štefanu in Fortunatu in Ahajiku in Timoteji. 

### II Corinthians

[1:1] Pavel apostelj Jezusa Kristusa po volji Božjej in Timotej brat, cerkvi Božjej v Korintu s svetimi vsemi, kteri so po vsej Ahaji. 
[1:2] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:3] Blagoslovljen Bog in oče Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, oče usmiljenosti in Bog vsake tolažbe, 
[1:4] Kteri nas tolaži v vsakej stiski s tolažbo, s ktero tolaži nas same Bog; 
[1:5] Kajti kakor so obilna trpljenja Kristusova za nas, tako je po Kristusu obilna tudi tolažba naša. 
[1:6] Če smo pa stiskani, za vašo tolažbo in zveličanje je, ktero se dela v prenašanji istih trpljenj, ktera tudi mi trpimo; če se pa tolažimo, za vašo tolažbo in zveličanje je, in upanje naše je trdno za vas; 
[1:7] Vedoč, da kakor ste deležniki trpljenj, tako ste tudi tolažbe. 
[1:8] Kajti ne čemo, da bi ne vedeli, bratje, za stisko našo, ktera se je dogodila nam v Aziji, da nas je preobtežila črez moč, tako da smo obupali tudi živeti. 
[1:9] Ali sami v sebi smo smrtno obsodo imeli, naj bi ne upali v sebi, nego v Bogu, kteri obuja mrtve; 
[1:10] Kteri nas je iz tolike smrti otel in otima, v kterega upamo, da bo še otimal, 
[1:11] Če pripomagate tudi vi za nas z molitvijo, da bi se za dar, kterega imamo po mnogih ljudéh, mnogi zahvalili za voljo nas. 
[1:12] Kajti hvala naša je to, priča vesti naše, da smo se v prostosti in čistosti Božjej, ne v mesenej modrosti, nego v milosti Božjej vedli na svetu, posebno pa med vami. 
[1:13] Ker vam drugega ne pišemo, nego kar berete ali kar spoznavate, a upam, da boste tudi do konca spoznavali. 
[1:14] Kakor ste deloma tudi spoznali nas, da smo hvala vaša, kakor tudi vi naša, na dan Gospoda Jezusa. 
[1:15] In s tem zaupanjem sem hotel k vam priti poprej, da bi drugo milost imeli, 
[1:16] In po vas preko priti v Macedonijo in zopet iz Macedonije priti k vam in od vas spremljen biti v Judejo. 
[1:17] Ko sem torej to hotel, je li sem lahkomišljeno ravnal? ali kar sklepam, po mesu sklepam, da bi bilo pri meni, "da, da" in "ne, ne?" 
[1:18] Ali zvest je Bog, da beseda naša k vam ni bila "da" in, "ne" 
[1:19] Kajti Božji sin Jezus Kristus, kterega smo med vami oznanili jaz in Silvan in Timotej, ni bil "da" in "ne", nego "da" je v njem bilo. 
[1:20] Ker kolikor je obetov Božjih, v njem so "da" in v njem amen Bogu na slavo po nas. 
[1:21] Ta pa, kteri potrjuje nas z vami v Kristusa in nas jo pomazilil, Bog je, 
[1:22] Kteri nas je tudi zapečatil in dal zalog duha v srcih naših. 
[1:23] A jaz za pričo Boga k sebi kličem na svojo dušo, da iz prizanašanja do vas še nisem prišel v Korint; 
[1:24] Ne da gospodujemo z vašo vero, nego sodelalci smo radosti vaše, kajti z vero stojite. 
[2:1] Odsodil sem pa v sebi to, da zopet ne pridem v žalosti k vam. 
[2:2] Kajti če jaz žalostim vas, kdo je, kteri bi me razveselil, če ne ta, kteri se žalostí po meni? 
[2:3] In napisal sem vam to isto, da ne bi žalosti imel, ko pridem, od teh, za ktere bi se imel radovati, nadejajoč se za vas vse, da je moja radost vseh vas radost. 
[2:4] Kajti z veliko stisko in s srčno težavo sem vam pisal z mnogimi solzami, ne da se žalostite, nego da ljubezen spoznate, ktero imam obilno do vas. 
[2:5] Če je pa kdo vžalostil, ni mene vžalostil, le nekoliko, da ne obtežujem vseh vas. 
[2:6] Dosti je takemu ta kazen od več njih; 
[2:7] Tako da nasproti rajši vi odpustite in potolažite, da bi kako preobilna žalost ne utopila takega. 
[2:8] Za to vas opominjam, da potrdite do njega ljubezen. 
[2:9] Kajti za to sem tudi pisal, da spoznam izkušenost vašo; je li ste v vsem poslušni. 
[2:10] Komur pa kaj odpustite, njemu tudi jaz; kajti jaz, če sem kaj odpustil, komur sem odpustil, za voljo vas sem pred obličjem Kristusovim, 
[2:11] Da bi nas ne ukanil satan, kajti niso nam njegove misli neznane. 
[2:12] A ko sem prišel v Troado za voljo evangelja Kristusovega, in so mi bila vrata odprta v Gospodu, 
[2:13] Nisem imel mira v duhu svojem, ker nisem našel Tita brata; nego vzemši slovo od njih, šel sem ven v Macedonijo. 
[2:14] Ali Bogu hvala, kteri nam vsegdar zmago daje v Kristusu, in dišavo znanosti, svoje razodeva po nas na vsakem mestu. 
[2:15] Ker smo Kristusova prijetna dišava Bogu v teh, kteri se zveličujejo in v tistih, kteri se pogubljajo. 
[2:16] Enim je dihet smrti za smrt, a drugim dihet življenja za življenje, in za to kdo je zmožen? 
[2:17] Kajti nismo kakor mnogi, kteri preobračajo besedo Božjo, nego kakor iz čistote, nego kakor iz Boga, pričo Boga v Kristusu govorimo; 
[3:1] Začinjamo li zopet sami sebe hvaliti? ali potrebujemo, kakor nekteri, priporočilih listov na vas ali od vas? 
[3:2] List naš ste vi, vpisan v naših srcih, poznan in bran od vseh ljudî; 
[3:3] Kteri se pokazujete, da ste list Kristusov izdan od nas, pisan ne s črnilom, nego z duhom Boga živega, ne na kamenenih pločah, nego na mesenih pločah srca. 
[3:4] A zaupanje tako imamo po Kristusu v Boga; 
[3:5] Ne da bi bili zmožni sami po sebi izmisliti kaj kakor sami iz sebe, nego je naša zmožnost od Boga; 
[3:6] Kteri nas je tudi zmožne storil, da smo služabniki novega zakona, ne črke, nego duha, kajti črka ubija, a duh oživlja, 
[3:7] Če je pa služba smrti v črkah vrezana v kamene bila v slavi tako, da niso mogli pogledati sinovi Izraelovi v obličje Mojzesovo za voljo slave obličja njegovega, ktera je minljiva, 
[3:8] Kako ne bo mnogo bolje služba duha v slavi? 
[3:9] Kajti če je služba obsojenja v slavi, za mnogo bolje je obilna služba pravice v slavi. 
[3:10] Ker tudi ni bilo oslavljeno, kar se je oslavilo v tem delu, za voljo prevelike slave. 
[3:11] Kajti če je v slavi, kar prestaja, za mnogo bolje je v slavi, kar ostaja. 
[3:12] Imajoč torej toliko upanje, veliko zaupnost upotrebljujemo. 
[3:13] In ne kakor je Mojzes deval zagrinjalo na svoje obličje, da ne bi videli sinovi Izraelovi konca tega, kar prestaja; 
[3:14] Ali obtrdele so njih misli, kajti noter do današnjega dné isto zagrinjalo pri branji starega zakona ostaja neodgrnjeno, ker se v Kristusu odpravlja; 
[3:15] Nego do danes, kedar se bere Mojzes, zagrinjalo na njih srcih leži. 
[3:16] Kedar se bo pa zgodilo spreobrnjenje k Gospodu, sname se zagrinjalo. 
[3:17] A Gospod je duh; kjer je pa duh Gospodov, tam je svoboda. 
[3:18] A mi vsi, kteri z odkritim obličjem slavo Gospodovo jasno gledamo, premenjujemo se v ravno tisto podobo iz slave v slavo, kakor od Gospodovega duha. 
[4:1] Za to imajoč to službo, kakor smo usmiljenje dobili, ne oslabevamo. 
[4:2] Nego odrekli smo se skrivnih del sramote ter ne hodimo v zvijačah: tudi ne preobračamo besede Božje, nego z razodevanjem resnice stavimo sami sebe pred vsako vest človečjo pričo Boga. 
[4:3] Če je pa tudi zakrit evangelj naš, v tistih je zakrit, kteri se pogubljajo; 
[4:4] V kterih je Bog tega veka oslepil pameti nevernih, da jim ne zasveti svetlost evangelja slave Kristusa, kteri je podoba Božja. 
[4:5] Kajti sami sebe ne oznanjujemo, nego Kristusa Jezusa Gospoda; a sami sebe kakor služabnike vaše za voljo Jezusa. 
[4:6] Ker Bog, kteri je rekel iz tme luči zasvetiti, sam je, kteri je zasvetil v srcih naših na svetlost poznanja slave Božje v obličji Jezusa Kristusa. 
[4:7] Imamo pa ta zaklad v lončenih posodah, da bi bila preobilnost moči Božja in ne iz nas. 
[4:8] V vsem nas stiskajo, ali nismo na tesnem; v zadregah smo, ali ne omagujemo. 
[4:9] Preganjajo nas, ali nismo zapuščeni; pobijajo nas, ali ne ginemo. 
[4:10] Vsegdar umiranje Gospoda Jezusa na telesu s seboj nosimo, da bi se tudi življenje Jezusovo na našem telesu pokazalo. 
[4:11] Kajti vedno se mi živi na smrt izdajemo za voljo Jezusa, da bi se tudi življenje Jezusovo pokazalo na smrtnem mesu našem. 
[4:12] Tako smrt v nas dela, a življenje v vas. 
[4:13] A imajoč istega duha vere poleg pisanega; "Veroval sem, za to sem govoril", tudi mi verujemo, za to tudi govorimo; 
[4:14] Vedoč, da kteri je obudil Gospoda Jezusa, obudil bo tudi nas po Jezusu in postavil z vami. 
[4:15] Kajti vse je za voljo vas, da bi milost pomnožena po mnogih zahvalo poobilšala na slavo Božjo. 
[4:16] Za to ne pešamo; ali če se tudi zunanji naš človek pokončuje, pa se notranji obnavlja od dne do dne. 
[4:17] Kajti sedanja lahka stiska naša spravlja nam obilno, preobilno večno vse pretežno slavo, 
[4:18] Ker ne gledamo nato, kar se vidi, nego na to, kar se ne vidi; kajti to, kar se vidi, začasno je, ali kar se ne vidi, večno je. 
[5:1] Ker vemo, če zemeljska naša hiša prebivanja razpade, da imamo prebivališče od Boga, hišo ne z rokami napravljeno, večno v nebesih. 
[5:2] Kajti tudi v tem zdihujemo, želeč obleči se v prebivališče svoje, ktero je iz nebes, 
[5:3] Če se bomo le tudi oblečeni, ne goli našli. 
[5:4] Kajti kteri smo v tem prebivanji, zdihujemo obteženi; ker se ne čemo sleči, nego na to obleči, da življenje pogoltne to, kar je smrtno. 
[5:5] Kteri nas je pa ravno za to ustvaril, Bog je, kteri nam je tudi dal zalog duha. 
[5:6] Dobre volje smo torej vsegdar in vemo, dokler smo v telesu doma, da potujemo na tujem, od Gospoda. 
[5:7] (Ker po veri hodimo, ne po gledanji.) 
[5:8] Ali smo dobre volje in hočemo rajši izseliti se iz telesa in naseliti se k Gospodu. 
[5:9] Za to tudi hrepenimo biti mu ugodni, bodi si da smo doma, bodi si da smo se izselili. 
[5:10] Kajti vsi se moramo pokazati pred sodišče Kristusovo, da prejme vsak po tem, kar je v telesu storil, bodi si dobro, bodi si hudo. 
[5:11] Vedoč torej za strah Gospodov ljudem svetujemo, a Bogu smo razodeti. Upam pa, da smo tudi v vaših vestih razodeti. 
[5:12] Ker vam zopet sami sebe ne hvalimo, nego vam priložnost dajemo hvaliti se z nami, da imate kaj proti tem, kteri se na lice hvalijo in ne v srcu. 
[5:13] Ker če smo predaleč stopili, Bogu smo, če smo pa zmerni, vam smo. 
[5:14] Kajti ljubezen Kristusova nas priganja, kteri smo to sodili da, če je eden za vse umrl, po tem so vsi umrli; 
[5:15] In za vse je umrl, da bi ti, kteri živé, nič več za se ne živeli, nego za tega, kteri je za nje umrl in vstal. 
[5:16] Tako mi od sedaj nikogar ne poznamo po mesu; če smo pa tudi poznali po mesu Kristusa, ali sedaj nič več ne poznamo. 
[5:17] Tako če je kdo v Kristusu, novo stvarjenje je; staro je prešlo, lej, postalo je novo vse. 
[5:18] A vse to je od Boga, kteri nas je spravil s seboj po Jezusu Kristusu in nam je dal službo sprave. 
[5:19] Kajti Bog je bil v Kristusu in je svet spravil s seboj in ni mu zaračunil njegovih pregreh in položil je v nas besedo sprave. 
[5:20] Na mesto Kristusa smo torej poslani, kakor da bi Bog opominjal po nas. Prosimo na mesto Kristusa: spravite se z Bogom. 
[5:21] Kajti tega, kteri ni vedel za greh, storil je za voljo nas greh, da bi bili mi pravica Božja v njem. 
[6:1] A kakor pomagalci opominjamo vas, da bi ne bili zastonj milosti Božje prejeli; 
[6:2] (Kajti pravi: "Prigoden čas sem te uslišal in na dan zveličanja pomogel sem ti". Lej, sedaj je čas dobro prigoden, lej, sedaj je dan zveličanja.) 
[6:3] Nikomur v ničemer ne dajemo spotike, da se ne pograja služba; 
[6:4] Nego v vsem izkazujemo se kakor Božje služabnike v potrpljenji mnogem, v stiskah, v potrebah, v težavah; 
[6:5] V udarcih, v ječah, v puntih, v trudih, v nespavanji, v postu; 
[6:6] V čistoti, v znanji, v prizanesljivosti, v dobrotljivosti, v duhu svetem, v nehinavskej ljubezni; 
[6:7] V besedi resnice, v moči Božjej, z orožjem pravice na desno in levo; 
[6:8] S slavo in nečastjo, s slabimi in dobrimi glasi, kakor potepuhi in resnični; 
[6:9] Kakor neznani in znani; kakor umirajoči in lej, živimo; kakor kaznjeni in ne umorjeni; 
[6:10] Kakor žalosteči se, a vedno se veseleči; kakor siromaki, a mnoge bogateči; kakor ničesar ne imajoči in vse imajoči. 
[6:11] Naša usta so odprta k vam, Korinčani, srce naše je razširjeno. 
[6:12] Vam ni tesno mesto v nas, ali vam je tesno v srcih vaših. 
[6:13] A da nam isto to povrnete, (kakor otrokom govorim), razširite se tudi vi. 
[6:14] Ne vprezajte se vkup z neverniki; kajti kakošno vdeležbo ima pravica z nepostavnostjo? a kakošno občinstvo svetlost s tmo? 
[6:15] Pa kakošno je vjemanje Kristusa z Belijalom? ali kakošen del ima vernik z nevernikom? 
[6:16] A kakošna je zložnost tempeljna Božjega z maliki? kajti vi ste tempelj Boga živega, kakor je rekel Bog: "Prebival bom v njih in med njimi bom hodil, in bom njih Bog, in oni bodo moje ljudstvo." 
[6:17] Za to: "Izidite iz sredi njih in odločite se, govori Gospod," "in nečistega se ne dotikujte; in jaz vas bom sprejel, 
[6:18] In bom vam oče in vi boste meni sinovi in hčere," pravi Gospod vsemogoči. 
[7:1] Imajoč torej te obljube, ljubljeni, očistimo se vsakega madeža mesa in duha dogotavljaje svetost v strahu Božjem. 
[7:2] Primite nas. Nikomur nismo krivice storili, nikogar nismo popačili, nikogar nismo ukanili. 
[7:3] Ne govorim na obsodbo, kajti poprej sem rekel, da ste tako v srcih naših, da bi mi radi z vami vkup umrli in vkup živeli. 
[7:4] Velika je moja zaupnost v govoru k vam, velika moja hvala za voljo vas; napolnjen sem tolažbe, preobilno imam radosti poleg vse stiske naše. 
[7:5] Kajti kedar smo prišli v Macedonijo, nobenega počitka ni imelo meso naše, nego v vsem smo bili stiskani: zvunaj boji, znotraj strahi. 
[7:6] Ali Bog, kteri tolaži ponižne, potolažil nas je s prihodom Titovim. 
[7:7] Toda ne samo s prihodom, nego tudi s tolažbo, s ktero se je on potolažil za vas, pripovedujoč nam vaše želenje, vaš jok, vašo vnetost za mene, tako da sem se bolje obveselil. 
[7:8] Ker če tudi sem vas razžalostil z listom, ni mi žal, če tudi mi je žal bilo, kajti vidim, da vas je oni list, če tudi za čas, razžalostil. 
[7:9] Sedaj se radujem ne da ste se razžalostili, nego da ste se razžalostili na pokoro; kajti razžalostili ste se po Bogu, da bi v ničemer kvara ne imeli od nas. 
[7:10] Ker žalost po Bogu napravlja pokoro na zveličanje, za ktero se ni kesati, a žalost sveta napravlja smrt. 
[7:11] Kajti lej, to samo, da ste se po Bogu razžalostili, kakošno vam je napravilo marljivost, pa zagovarjanje, pa nevoljo, pa strah, pa želenje, pa vnetost, pa maščevanje! V vsem ste se pokazali, da ste čisti v delu. 
[7:12] Za kaj če tudi sem vam pisal, pisal sem ne za voljo tistega, kteri je krivico storil, tudi ne za voljo tistega, kteremu se je krivica storila, nego da se pokaže marljivost naša za vas med vami pričo Boga. 
[7:13] Za to smo potolaženi s tolažbo vašo; še obilneje pa smo se obradovali nad radostjo Titovo, ker ste spokojili duh njegov vsi vi. 
[7:14] Kajti če sem se v čem njemu pohvalil z vami, nisem se osramotil; nego kakor smo vam vse v resnici govorili, tako je tudi pohvala naša k Titu resnična postala. 
[7:15] In srce njegovo vam je bolje vdano, kedar se spominja poslušnosti vseh vas, kako ste ga s strahom in trepetom sprejeli. 
[7:16] Radujem se torej, da se v vsem smem oslanjati na vas. 
[8:1] A na znanje vam, bratje, dajemo milost Božjo, ktera je dana v cerkvah Macedonskih; 
[8:2] Da se je v mnogej izkušnji stiske obilnost njih radosti in njih preveliko siromaštvo poobilšalo na bogastvo njih prostosti. 
[8:3] Kajti bili so po moči, pričam, in črez moč dobrovoljni, 
[8:4] Z mnogo prošnjo proseči nas, da blagodar in občinstvo službe k svetim prejmemo, 
[8:5] In ne, kakor smo upali, nego sebe so dali najprej Gospodu in nam po volji Božjej, 
[8:6] Da zaprosimo Tita, naj bi, kakor je započel, tako tudi dokončal med vami tudi ta blagodar. 
[8:7] Ali kakor ste v vsem obilni v veri in besedi in znanji in vsakej marljivosti in v svojej ljubezni do nas, obilni bodite tudi v tem blagodaru. 
[8:8] Ne govorim po zapovedi, nego da po marljivosti drugih resničnost vaše ljubezni izkusim. 
[8:9] Kajti poznate milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, da je, če tudi bogat, za voljo vas ubožal, da se vi z njegovim uboštvom obogatite. 
[8:10] In svet v tem dajem, kajti to je vam na prid, kteri so ne samo to storiti, nego tudi hoteti započeli od lani. 
[8:11] Sedaj pa dokončajte to tudi storiti, da bo, kakor je bila dobra volja hoteti, tako tudi dokončati od tega, kar imate. 
[8:12] Kajti če je dobra volja, prijeten je vsak po tem, kar ima, ne po tem, kar nima. 
[8:13] Ker ni, da imajo drugi očitek, a vi stisko, nego enako, da bi bila v sedanjem času vaša obilnost za njih pomanjkanje, 
[8:14] Da bi tudi onih obilnost bila za vaše pomanjkanje, da bode enakost, 
[8:15] Kakor je pisano: "Kdor je mnogo nabral, in imel preobilo, in kdor je malo, ni mu zmanjkalo." 
[8:16] Hvala pa Bogu, kteri je dal ravno tisto skrbljivost za vas v srce Titovo, 
[8:17] Ker je prošnjo sprejel, a bil je marljivejši pa je svojevoljno šel ven k vam. 
[8:18] Poslali smo pa ž njim vred brata, kterega hvala v evangelji je po vseh cerkvah. 
[8:19] Ali ne samo to, nego je tudi izvoljen od cérkev za sopotnika našega s tem milodarom, kterega oskrbljujemo za samega Gospoda slavo in vašo dobro voljo; 
[8:20] Ogibajoč se tega, da nas kdo ne pograja za to obilnost, ktero oskrbljujemo, 
[8:21] Skrbeči za dobro ne samo pričo Gospoda, nego tudi pričo ljudî. 
[8:22] Poslali smo pa ž njim vred brata svojega, kterega smo izkusili v mnogih stvareh mnogi krat, da je marljiv, sedaj pa, da je mnogo marljivejši po mnogem zaupanji na vas. 
[8:23] Kar pa Tita dotiče, on je moj drug in pomagalec med vami, kar pa dotiče naše brate, oni so aposteljni cerkveni, slava Kristusova. 
[8:24] Dokaz torej svoje ljubezni in naše hvale z vami na njih pokažite in pričo cerkev. 
[9:1] Ker za službo, ktera je za svete, ni mi treba pisati vam; 
[9:2] Kajti znana mi je vaša dobra volja, s ktero se za vas Macedoncem hvalim, da je Ahaja pripravljena od lani, in vaša vnetost jih je več pobudila. 
[9:3] A brate sem poslal, da se hvala naša z vami ne izprazni v tem delu, da boste, kakor sem govoril, gotovi; 
[9:4] Da se kako, ko pridejo z menoj Macedonci in najdejo vas negotove, ne osramotimo mi, da ne rečemo vi, v tej stanovitnosti hvale. 
[9:5] Potrebno se mi je torej zazdelo propositi brate, da bi najprej šli k vam in prej pripravili ta naprej obljubljeni blagoslov tako kakor blagoslov in ne kakor skopost. 
[9:6] To pa velim, kdor seje skopo, skopo bo tudi žel, in kdor seje v blagoslovih, v blagoslovih bo tudi žel; 
[9:7] Vsak, kakor v srcu odločuje, ne iz žalosti ali po sili; kajti veselega dajalca ljubi Bog. 
[9:8] A mogoč je Bog dati vam obilnost vsakega blagodara, da v vsem vsegdar vsako dovoljnost imajoč imate obilnost za vsako delo dobro. 
[9:9] (Kakor je pisano: "Razsul je, dal je ubogim, njegova pravica ostaje na vek." 
[9:10] A kdor daje seme sejaču, dal bo tudi kruh za jed in napolnil bo setev vašo in pomnožil sadove pravice vaše;) 
[9:11] Da se v vsem obogatite za vsako priprostost, ktera dela po nas zahvalo Bogu. 
[9:12] Ker služba tega opravila ne dopolnjuje samo pomanjkanja svetih, nego je tudi obilna po zahvalah Bogu od mnogih, 
[9:13] Kedar po tej izkušenej službi hvalijo Boga za vaše podložno pripoznanje evangelja Kristusovega in za prosto podeljevanje njim in vsem, 
[9:14] In po njih molitvi za vas, kteri hrepené za vami za voljo premnoge milosti Božje nad vami. 
[9:15] A hvala Bogu za njegov neizrečeni dar. 
[10:1] Sam pa jaz Pavel opominjam vas po krotkosti in tihosti Kristusovej, kteri sem pričo vas res da ponižen med vami, a kedar me ni pri vas, pa drzen proti vam. 
[10:2] Prosim pa, da mi ne bo treba, kedar bom pri vas zdrzniti se s to zaupnostjo, s ktero mislim zdrzniti se na nektere, kteri mislijo, kakor da po mesu hodimo. 
[10:3] Kajti če tudi po mesu hodimo, ne vojskujemo se po mesu, 
[10:4] (Ker orožje našega vojskovanja ni meseno nego močno po Bogu za razdevanje trdnih mest), 
[10:5] Naklepe razdevajoč in vsako visokost, ktera se vzdiguje proti poznanju Božjemu; in zavjemajoč vsako pamet na poslušnost Kristusu, 
[10:6] In v pripravi imajoč maščevanje za vsako neposlušnost, kedar se izpolni vaša poslušnost. 
[10:7] Gledate li na to, kar vam je pred očmi? Če kdo upa v sebi, da je Kristusov, misli naj zopet v sebi, da, kakor je on Kristusov, tako smo tudi mi Kristusovi. 
[10:8] Kajti če se tudi kaj obilneje pohvalim z oblastjo našo, ktero nam je dal Gospod za zidanje in ne za razdevanje vaše, ne bom se osramotil. 
[10:9] Da se ne bo videlo, kakor da vas strašim z listovi, 
[10:10] Ker so listovi, velí, težki in jaki, ali ko je s telesom nazoči, slab je in beseda mu nič ne velja. 
[10:11] To naj misli, kdor je tak, da, kakoršni smo v besedi po listih nenazoči, takošni smo tudi nazoči v dejanji. 
[10:12] Kajti ne drznemo se pridejati se k nekterim ali primeriti se ž njimi, kteri sami sebe povzdigujejo; nego kteri sami po sebi sami sebe merijo in primerjajo sami sebe s seboj, ne umejo. 
[10:13] A mi se ne bomo črez nemero hvalili, nego po meri vodila, kterega nam je podelil Bog mero, da dosežemo tudi noter do vas. 
[10:14] Kajti mi se ne stezamo predaleč, kakor da ne dosezamo do vas; za kaj tudi noter do vas smo prišli v evangelji Kristusovem; 
[10:15] Ne hvaleč se črez nemero s tujimi trudi, ali up imajoč, kedar se pomnoži vera vaša, da se v vas poveličamo po vodilu svojem na obilnost, 
[10:16] Da se onkraj vas evangelj oznani, ter se ne pohvalimo s tem, kar je po tujem vodilu narejeno. 
[10:17] "Kdor se pa hvali, v Gospodu naj se hvali." 
[10:18] Kajti ni ta, kteri sam sebe povzdiguje, izkušen, nego ta, kogar Gospod povzdiguje. 
[11:1] 0 da bi me trpeli malo v mojej nespameti, pa saj me tudi trpite! 
[11:2] Kajti vnet sem za vas z Božjo vnetostjo, ker sem vas zagovoril enemu možu, da devico čisto privedem Kristusu; 
[11:3] Ali se bojim, da se ne bi kako, kakor je kača Evo ukanila z zvijačo svojo, tako tudi pokvarile misli vaše od priprostosti, ktera je v Kristusu. 
[11:4] Kajti ko bi ta, kteri prihaja, drugega Jezusa oznanjeval, kterega nismo oznanili, ali bi drugega duha prejemali, kterega niste prejeli, lepo bi trpeli. 
[11:5] Ker mislim, da v ničemer nisem manjši od prevelikih aposteljnov. 
[11:6] Kajti če tudi sem neuk v govoru, vendar nisem v znanji: ali v vsem smo znani pri vseh med vami. 
[11:7] Jeli sem greh storil sam sebe ponižujoč, da se vi povišate, da sem vam zastonj Božji evangelj oznanil? 
[11:8] Druge cerkve sem slekel vzemši plačo na službo vam, in ko sem prišel k vam in bil ubog, nisem bil nikomur nadležen; 
[11:9] Kajti moje uboštvo so nadopolnili bratje, kteri so prišli od Macedonije, in v vsem brez teže vam sem se zdržal in bom se držal. 
[11:10] Je resnica Kristusova v meni, da mi se ta hvala ne bo zadelala v krajih Ahajskih. 
[11:11] Za kaj? ker vas ne ljubim? Bog ve. 
[11:12] Kar pa delam, to bom tudi delal, da odsečem priložnost tistim, kteri priložnost hočejo, da bi se, v čemer se hvalijo, našli taki, kakor tudi mi. 
[11:13] Kajti taki so krivi aposteljni, ukanljivi delalci, premenjajoči se v aposteljne Kristusove, 
[11:14] In ni čuda, kajti sam satan se premenja v angelje svetlobe. 
[11:15] Ni torej nič velikega, če se tudi služabniki njegovi premenjajo v služabnike pravice, kterih konec bo poleg njih del. 
[11:16] Zopet pravim: Nikdor naj ne misli, da sem nespameten; če pa ne, pa me sprejemite kakor nespametnega, da se nemalo tudi jaz pohvalim. 
[11:17] Kar govorim, ne govorim po Gospodu, nego kakor v nespameti, v tej stanovitnosti hvale. 
[11:18] Ko se mnogi hvalijo po mesu, hvalil se bom tudi jaz. 
[11:19] Kajti radi trpite nespametne, ko ste sami pametni; 
[11:20] Ker trpite, če vas kdo usužnjuje, če kdo pojeda, če kdo jemlje, če se kdo povzdiguje, če vas kdo v lice bije. 
[11:21] Po nečasti pravim, ker kakor da smo mi oslabeli. V čemer je pa kdo drzen, (po nespameti govorim), drzen sem tudi jaz. 
[11:22] Hebrejci so? tudi jaz sem; Izraelci so? tudi jaz sem; seme Abrahamovo so? tudi jaz sem; 
[11:23] Služabniki Kristusovi so? (ne govorim po pameti), še bolje sem jaz: v trudih obilneje, v udarcih neizmerneje, v ječah obilneje, v smrti mnogi krat. 
[11:24] Od Judov sem jih dobil pet krat štirideset brez ene, 
[11:25] Tri krat sem bil izšiban, en krat kamenovan, trikrat se je z menoj ladja razbila, noč in dan sem v globočini prebil. 
[11:26] Potoval sem mnogi krat, bil sem v nevarnostih od vod, v nevarnostih od razbojnikov, v nevarnostih od rodovine, v nevarnostih od poganov, v nevarnostih v mestu, v nevarnostih v puščavi, v nevarnostih na morji, v nevarnostih med krivimi brati; 
[11:27] V trudu in težavi, dosti krat v nespavanji, v lakoti in žeji, velikokrat v postu, v mrazu in goloti, 
[11:28] Brez tega, kar je zvun tega: prihajanje ljudi k meni vsak dan, skrb za vse cerkve. 
[11:29] Kdo oslabi, da bi tudi jaz ne oslabel? Kdo se pohujšuje, da bi tudi mene ne skelelo? 
[11:30] Če se je treba hvaliti, s svojo slabostjo se bom hvalil. 
[11:31] Bog in oče Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, kteri je blagoslovljen na veke, ve, da ne lažem. 
[11:32] V Damasku je dal namestnik kralja Areta stražiti Damaščansko mesto ter me je hotel vjeti, 
[11:33] In skozi okno v košari so me po zidu spustili in izbegnil sem iz njegovih rok. 
[12:1] Ali hvaliti se mi ne pomaga, kajti prišel bom na prikazni in razodetja Gospodova. 
[12:2] Poznam človeka v Gospodu, kteri je bil pred štirinajstimi leti, (ali v telesu, ne vem, ali v duhu zvun telesa, ne vem, Bog ve,) vzet noter v tretja nebesa; 
[12:3] In vem takega človeka, (ali v telesu, ali zvun telesa, ne vem, Bog ve), 
[12:4] Da je bil vzet v raj in je slišal neizrekljive besede, kterih ni smeti človeku pripovedati. 
[12:5] S takim se bom hvalil, sam s seboj se pa ne bom hvalil, razen s slabostmi svojimi. 
[12:6] Kajti ko bi se hotel pohvaliti, ne bil bi nespameten, ker bi resnico govoril; ali se varujem, da ne bi kdo pomislil za me več, kar vidi v meni, ali kar sliši za me. 
[12:7] In da bi se v obilnosti razodetij ne prevzdigoval, dal se mi je trn v meso, angelj satan, da me za uho bije, da se ne povzdigujem. 
[12:8] Zanj sem trikrat Gospoda molil, naj odstopi od mene, 
[12:9] In dejal mi je: "Dosti ti je moja milost, kajti moč moja se v slabosti popolnoma pokazuje." Torej se bom rajši hvalil s svojimi slabostmi, da se ušatori v mé moč Kristusova. 
[12:10] Za to sem dobre volje v slabostih, v zasrambah, v potrebah, v pregonih, v težavah za Kristusa; Kajti kedar sem slab, tedaj sem močen. 
[12:11] Postal sem nespameten hvaleč se, vi ste me prisilili. Kajti mene bi morali vi hvaliti, ker nisem bil nič manjši od prevelikih aposteljnov, če ravno sem nič. 
[12:12] Kajti znamenja aposteljna so se storila med vami v vsakem potrpljenji, v znamenjih in čudežih in močeh. 
[12:13] Ker kaj je, v čemer ste bili manjši od drugih cérkev? Le da vas jaz sam nisem nadlegoval. Odpustite mi to krivico. 
[12:14] Lej, tretjič sem pripravljen priti k vam in ne bom vas nadlegoval, kajti ne iščem, kar je vaše, nego vas, ker niso dolžni otroci roditeljem blago spravljati, nego roditelji otrokom. 
[12:15] A jaz bom prav rad trosil ter se iztrošil za duše vaše, če me tudi, s čim obilneje vas ljubim, s tem manje ljubite. 
[12:16] Ali naj bo, jaz vam nisem nadlege delal, nego zvit človek pridobil sem vas z zvijačo. 
[12:17] Jeli sem vas po kterem teh, ktere sem k vam poslal, za kaj opravil? 
[12:18] Naprosil sem Tita in ž njim poslal brata; jeli vas je Tit za kaj opravil? nismo li v enem duhu hodili? ne po enih stopinjah? 
[12:19] Zopet mislite, da vam se zagovarjamo? pričo Boga v Kristusu govorimo; a vse to je, ljubljeni, za vaše zbujevanje v pobožnosti. 
[12:20] Kajti bojim se, da vas kako, kedar k vam pridem, ne najdem kakoršne hočem, in da mene najdete, kakoršnega ne čete; da kako ne bo prepirov, zavisti, srdov, svaj, ogovarjanja, prišepetovanja, napihovanja, puntov; 
[12:21] Da me, kedar zopet pridem, ne poniža Bog moj pri vas, in da ne bom žalostil mnogih, kteri so poprej grešili in se niso pokesali za nečistost in kurbirstvo in hotljivost, ktero so počeli. 
[13:1] Lej, tretjič, grem k vam. Na to, kar povesta dve priči ali tri, stala bo vsaka beseda. 
[13:2] Naprej sem povedal in naprej pravim kakor nazoči drugič, in nenazoči sedaj pišem tem, kteri so prej grešili in drugim vsem, da, kedar pridem zopet, ne bom prizanašal, 
[13:3] Ko izkušnje iščete po meni govorečega Kristusa, kteri med vami ni slab, nego je močen med vami. 
[13:4] Kajti če je bil tudi na križ razpet po slabosti, vendar živi po moči Božjej. In tako smo tudi mi slabi v njem, ali živeli bomo ž njim po moči Božjej med vami. 
[13:5] Sami sebe izkušajte, če ste v veri, sami sebe ogledujte; ali ne poznate li sami sebe, da je Kristus v vas? razen če ste v čem neizkušeni. 
[13:6] A upam, da boste spoznali, da mi nismo neizkušeni. 
[13:7] Molim pa Boga, da ne storite nič hudega, da se mi izkušeni pokažemo, nego da vi dobro delate, a mi da bomo kakor neizkušeni. 
[13:8] Kajti ne morem kaj proti resnici, nego za resnico. 
[13:9] Ker se veselimo, kedar smo mi slabi a vi ste močni. Pa za to tudi molimo za vašo popolnost. 
[13:10] Za to pišem to nenazoči, da mi nazoči ne bo treba ostremu biti po oblasti, ktero mi je dal Gospod na zidanje in ne na razdevanje. 
[13:11] Sicer se pa, bratje, radujte, popolni bodite, tolažite se, ene misle bodite, mir imejte in Bog ljubezni in mira bo z vami. 
[13:12] Pozdravite eden drugega v svetem poljubku. Pozdravljajo vas sveti vsi. 
[13:13] Milost Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa in ljubezen Božja in občinstvo svetega Duha z vsemi vami. Amen.  Druga poslanica Korinčanom je bila napisana iz Filipov, mesta v Makedoniji, po Titu in Luku. 

### Galatians

[1:1] Pavel apostelj, ne od ljudî, tudi ne po človeku, nego po Jezusu Kristusu in Bogu očetu, kteri ga je obudil iz mrtvih,) 
[1:2] In vsi bratje, kteri so z menoj, cerkvam Galaških, 
[1:3] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta in Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[1:4] Kteri je dal sebe za grehe naše, da nas reši iz sedanjega hudega veka po volji Boga in očeta našega, 
[1:5] Kteremu slava na veke vekov. Amen. 
[1:6] Čudim se, da ste se tako hitro odvrnili od tega, kteri vas je poklical v milosti Kristusovej na drugi evangelj, 
[1:7] Kteri ni drugi, samo da so nekteri, kteri vas zmedajo in hočejo preobrniti evangelj Kristusov. 
[1:8] Ali tudi, ko bi vam mi ali angelj iz nebes oznanjeval evangelj drugač, nego smo vam mi oznanili, preklet bodi. 
[1:9] Kakor smo poprej rekli, tudi sedaj zopet pravim: če vam kdo oznanjuje evangelj drugač, nego ste ga prejeli, preklet bodi. 
[1:10] Jeli sedaj ljudî nagovarjam ali Boga? ali gledam ljudém po godu biti? Kajti ko bi še ljudém po godu bil, ne bil bi Kristusov služabnik. 
[1:11] Na znanje vam pa dajem, bratje, da evangelj, kterega sem jaz oznanil, ni po človeku; 
[1:12] Tudi ga nisem jaz po človeku prejel, niti ga se naučil, nego po razodetji Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:13] Kajti slišali ste moje vedenje nekdaj v judovstvu, da sem črez mero preganjal cerkev Božjo in jo zatiral, 
[1:14] In sem napredoval v judovstvu bolje od mnogih vrstnikov v rodu svojem in bil sem preobilo vnet za očetovska svoja sporočila. 
[1:15] A kedar se je zvidelo Bogu, kteri me je izbral iz telesa matere moje in poklical po milosti svojej, 
[1:16] Da razodene sina svojega v meni, da ga z evangeljem oznanim med pogani, precej nisem za svet poprašal mesa in krvi, 
[1:17] Tudi nisem šel gor v Jeruzalem k tistim, kteri so bili pred menoj aposteljni, nego odšel sem v Arabijo in zopet sem se povrnil v Damask. 
[1:18] Po tem črez tri leta sem prišel gor v Jeruzalem, da vidim Petra, in ostal sem pri njem petnajst dnî. 
[1:19] Ali drugega izmed aposteljnov nisem videl, razen Jakoba, brata Gospodovega. 
[1:20] A kar vam pišem, lej pričo Boga, da ne lažem. 
[1:21] Po tem sem prišel v kraje Sirske in Cilicijske. 
[1:22] A bil sem neznan po licu cerkvam Judejskim, ktere so v Kristusu bile; 
[1:23] Samo slišali so, da tisti, kteri nas je nekdaj preganjal, sedaj oznanjuje vero, ktero je nekdaj zatiral, 
[1:24] In slavili so v meni Boga. 
[2:1] Po tem črez štirinajst let sem zopet prišel gor v Jeruzalem z Barnabom, vzemši s seboj tudi Tita. 
[2:2] Prišel sem pa gor po razodetji in razložil jim evangelj, kterega oznanjam med pogani, a posebej tem, kteri so se za kaj šteli, da kako zastonj ne tečem ali sem tekel. 
[2:3] Ali tudi Tit, kteri je bil z menoj in je bil Grk, ni bil prisiljen, da se obreže, 
[2:4] In to za voljo lažnih bratov, kteri so se vmes vrinili in so zravni prišli izvedovat svobodo našo, ktero imamo v Kristusu Jezusu, da bi nas zasužnjili, 
[2:5] Kterim se le uro nismo dali v podložnost, da bi resnica evangelja ostala med vami. 
[2:6] A od tistih, kteri so se šteli, da so kaj, (kakošni so nekdaj bili, za to mi nič ni; Bog ne gleda, kdo je kdo,), kajti li, kteri so se za kaj šteli, meni niso nič pridali; 
[2:7] Nego nasprot, videvši, da je meni zaupan evangelj neobreze kakor Petru obreze, 
[2:8] (Kajti kteri je v Petru delal za aposteljstvo obreze, delal je tudi v meni za pogane), 
[2:9] In spoznavši milost, ktera se je meni dala, podali so Jakob in Kefa in Joan, kteri so se šteli za stebre, desnico meni in Barnabu na občinstvo, naj greva midva med pogane, a oni med obrezo, 
[2:10] Samo da se spominjava ubogih, za kar sem se tudi potrudil, da se tako storí. 
[2:11] Kedar je pa prišel Peter v Antijohijo, v óči sem proti njemu stopil, ker je bil graje vreden. 
[2:12] Kajti predno so prišli neki od Jakoba, jedel je s pogani; a kedar so prišli, umikal se je in odločeval, boječ se tistih, kteri so iz obreze bili. 
[2:13] In ž njim so se pohlinili tudi drugi Judje, tako da je tudi Barnaba zavedlo njih hlinjenje. 
[2:14] Ali ko sem videl, da ne hodijo prav k evangeljskej resnici, rekel sem Petru pred vsemi: Če ti, kteri si Jud, poganski živiš in ne judovski, zakaj pogane siliš, da živé judovski? 
[2:15] Mi smo po po rodu Judje in ne iz poganov grešniki, 
[2:16] Pa vedoč, da se ne opravičuje človek z deli postave, nego z vero Jezusa Kristusa, verovali smo tudi mi v Jezusa Kristusa, da bi se opravičili z vero Kristusovo in ne z deli postave, ker se ne bo opravičilo z deli postave vsako meso. 
[2:17] Če smo se pa mi, kteri se iščemo opravičiti v Kristusu, našli tudi sami grešniki, jeli je torej Kristus grehu služabnik? Bog ne daj! 
[2:18] Ker če to, kar sem podrl, zopet zidam, pokazujem se sam, da sem prestopnik. 
[2:19] Kajti jaz sem po postavi umrl postavi, da Bogu živim. 
[2:20] S Kristusom sem na križ razpet. Živim pa ne več jaz, nego živi v meni Kristus; kar pa sedaj živim v mesu, v veri živim sina Božjega, kteri me je ljubil in je dal sam sebe za me. 
[2:21] Ne zamečem milosti Božje; ker če je po postavi pravica, tedaj je Kristus zastonj umrl. 
[3:1] 0 nespametni Galati! kdo vas je obajal, da resnici ne verujete, kterim se je pred očmi Jezus Kristus opisal, med vami na križ razpet? 
[3:2] To samo hočem izvedeti od vas, jeli ste z deli postave duha prejeli ali s poslušanjem vere? 
[3:3] Tako ste nespametni? počenši z duhom sedaj z mesom dokončujete? 
[3:4] Toliko ste zastonj pretrpeli? če bi bilo le tudi zastonj. 
[3:5] Kteri vam torej daje duha in dela moči v vas, jeli to dela z deli postave ali s poslušanjem vere? 
[3:6] Kakor se veli: "Abraham je veroval Bogu in zaračunilo se mu je za pravico." 
[3:7] Znajte tedaj, da so tisti, kteri so iz vere, sinovi Abrahamovi. 
[3:8] Pismo pa naprej videvši, da z vero opravičuje pogane Bog, oznanilo je naprej Abrahamu: "V tebi se bodo blagoslovili vsi pogani." 
[3:9] Tako se tisti, kteri so iz vere, blagoslavljajo z vernim Abrahamom. 
[3:10] Kajti kterikoli so iz del postave, pod kletvijo so; kajti pisano je: Preklet vsak, kdor ne ostane v vsem, kar je pisano v knjigi postave, da naj storí. 
[3:11] Da se pa v postavi nikdor ne opravičuje pred Bogom, očitno je, zakaj: "Pravični bo iz vere živel." 
[3:12] A postava ni iz vere, nego: "Človek, kteri je to storil, živel bo v tem." 
[3:13] Kristus nas je odkupil iz kletve postave postavši za nas kletev, (kajti pisano je: "Preklet vsak, kdor visi na drevesu.") 
[3:14] Da pride med pogane blagoslov Abrahamov v Kristusu Jezusu, da prejmemo obljubo duha po veri. 
[3:15] Bratje, po človeku govorim: Nikdor človečje potrjene zaveze ne zameče ali jej kaj pridaja. 
[3:16] Abrahamu pa so se dale obljube in semenu njegovemu. Ne pravi: "In semenom," kakor za več njih, nego kakor za enega: "In semenu tvojemu," kteri je Kristus. 
[3:17] To pa pravim: zaveze, ktero je najprej potrdil Bog na Kristusa, črez štiri sto in trideset let dana postava ne preklicuje, da se odpravi obljuba. 
[3:18] Kajti če je iz postave dedščina, ni več iz obljube. Abrahamu je pa po obljubi podaril Bog. 
[3:19] Čemu torej postava? Za voljo prestopov se je pridodala, dokler ne pride seme, komur je obljuba dana, in naredili so jo angelji v roki posrednika. 
[3:20] Ali posrednik ni enega, Bog pa je eden. 
[3:21] Jeli je torej postava proti obljubam Božjim? Bog ne daj! kajti ko bi se dala postava, ktera bi bila mogoča oživiti, zares bi bila iz vere pravica. 
[3:22] Ali zaprlo je pismo vse pod greh, da bi se obljuba iz vere Jezusa Kristusa dala tem, kteri verujejo. 
[3:23] Predno je pa vera prišla, varovali smo se pod postavo zaprti za vero, ktera se je imela razodeti. 
[3:24] Tako je bila postava voditeljica naša do Kristusa, da se z vero opravičimo. 
[3:25] A ko je vera prišla, več nismo pod voditeljico. 
[3:26] Kajti vsi ste sinovi Božji po veri v Kristusu Jezusu, 
[3:27] Kajti kterikoli ste se v Kristusa pokrstili, Kristusa ste oblekli. 
[3:28] Ni tu Juda ne Grka; ni tu sužnja ne svobodnega; ni tu možkega ne ženske; kajti vi vsi ste eden v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[3:29] Če ste pa vi Kristusovi, tedaj ste Abrahamovo seme in po obljubi dediči. 
[4:1] Pravim pa: Dokler je dedič nepolnoleten, nič se ne loči od sužnja, če je tudi gospodar vsega. 
[4:2] Nego je pod oskrbniki in opravniki noter do dne postavljenega po očetu. 
[4:3] Tako smo bili tudi mi, kedar smo bili nepolnoletni, pod počeli sveta zasužnjeni, 
[4:4] A kedar se je čas dopolnil, izposlal je Bog sina svojega rojenega iz žene, podloženega pod postavo, 
[4:5] Da tiste, kteri so bili pod postavo, izkupi, da posinstvo prejmemo. 
[4:6] Ker ste pa sinovi, izposlal je Bog duha sina svojega v srca vaša, kteri vpije: abá, oče! 
[4:7] Tako nič več nisi suženj, nego sin; če si pa sin, tudi si dedič Božji po Kristusu. 
[4:8] Ali tedaj ste, se ve da ne poznavajoč Boga, služili tistim, kteri po naravi niso bogovi, 
[4:9] A sedaj spoznavši Boga, a bolje spoznani od Boga, kako se obračate zopet k slabim in ubogim počelom, kterim zopet iznovič služiti hočete? 
[4:10] Dneve obhajate in mesece in čase in leta. 
[4:11] Bojim se za vas, da bi se ne bil kako zastonj trudil med vami. 
[4:12] Bodite kakor sem jaz, ker sem tudi jaz, kakor vi, bratje, prosim vas; nobene krvice mi niste storili. 
[4:13] A veste, da sem vam v slabosti mesa najprej evangelj oznanil. 
[4:14] In izkušnjave moje na mesu mojem niste zaničili ne popljuvali, nego kakor angelja Božjega ste me sprejeli, kakor Kristusa Jezusa. 
[4:15] Kakošno torej je bilo blaženstvo vaše? kajti pričam vam, da bi bili, ko bi mogoče bilo, oči svoje izkopali in dali meni. 
[4:16] Tako sem vaš sovražnik postal govoreč vam resnico? 
[4:17] Ne vnemajo se dobro za vas, nego hočejo vas izkleniti, da bi se vi za nje vnemali. 
[4:18] Dobro pa je vnemati se v dobrem vsegdar in ne samo, kedar sem jaz pri vas. 
[4:19] Otroci moji, ktere zopet z bolečinami porajam, dokler se ne vpodobi Kristus v vas; 
[4:20] Hotel bi sedaj pri vas biti in premeniti glas svoj, ker se ne izvedam v vas. 
[4:21] Recite mi, kteri pod postavo hočete biti, jeli postave ne poslušate? 
[4:22] Kajti pisano je, da je Abraham dva sina imel, enega z deklo in enega s svobodkinjo; 
[4:23] Ali kteri je bil od dekle, narodil se je po mesu, a kteri od svobodkinje, po obljubi. 
[4:24] To je v prispodobi govorjeno, kajti to sta dve zavezi: ena z gore Sinajske, ktera poraja za sužnjost, in ta je Agar. 
[4:25] Ker Agar pomenja Sinaj goro v Arabiji in stoji v enej vrsti s sedanjim Jeruzalemom in služi z otroki svojimi, 
[4:26] A gornji Jeruzalem je svobodkinja, ktera je mati vseh nas. 
[4:27] Kajti pisano je: "Razveseli se, nerodovitnica, ktera ne porajaš. Izpregovori in zavpij, ktera z bolečinami ne porajaš, ker je mnogo več otrok té, ktera je osamljena, nego ktera ima moža. 
[4:28] Mi pa smo, bratje, po Izaku otroci obljube. 
[4:29] Ali kakor je ta krat tisti, kteri se je po mesu narodil, preganjal tega, kteri je bil po duhu, tako tudi sedaj. 
[4:30] Ali kaj pravi pismo? "Izvrzi deklo in nje sina; kajti ne bo dedoval sin deklin s sinom svobodkinjinim." 
[4:31] Tedaj, bratje, nismo otroci deklini, nego svobodkinjini. 
[5:1] V svobodi torej, s ktero nas je Kristus osvobodil, stojte in ne vprezite se zopet v jarem sužnjosti. 
[5:2] Lej, jaz Pavel pravim vam, da vam, če se obrežete, Kristus ne bo nič pomagal, 
[5:3] A pričam zopet vsakemu človeku obrezanemu, da je dolžen celo postavo izpolniti. 
[5:4] Odpravljeni ste od Kristusa, kterikoli se s postavo opravičate, iz milosti ste izpadli. 
[5:5] Kajti mi z duhom iz vere čakamo upa pravice. 
[5:6] Kajti v Kristusu Jezusu nima kaj veljave ne obreza ni neobreza, nego vera po ljubezni delajoča. 
[5:7] Tekli ste dobro, kdo vas je ustavil, da resnici niste pokorni? 
[5:8] To pregovarjanje ni od tega, kteri vas kliče. 
[5:9] Malo kvasa vse testo skisa. 
[5:10] Jaz se upam za vas v Gospodu, da nič drugega ne boste mislili. Kdor vas pa moti, nosil bo obsojenje, bodi si kdorkoli. 
[5:11] Ali, bratje, če jaz obrezo še oznanjam, zakaj me še preganjajo? Tedaj je odpravljeno pohujšanje križa. 
[5:12] O da bi bili odsečeni tudi tisti, kteri vas zavajajo! 
[5:13] Kajti vi ste na svobodo poklicani, bratje, samo naj svoboda ne bo za priložnost mesu, nego iz ljubezni služite eden drugemu. 
[5:14] Kajti vsa postava se izpolnjuje v enej besedi, v temle: "Ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor samega sebe." 
[5:15] A če eden drugega grizete in ujedate, gledite, da eden drugega ne iztrebite. 
[5:16] Pravim pa: po duhu hodite in poželenja mesa ne boste izpolnjevali; 
[5:17] Kajti meso želi proti duhu, a duh proti mesu, to se pa upira eno drugemu, da ne delate, kar hočete. 
[5:18] A če se dajete duhu voditi, niste pod postavo. 
[5:19] Očitna so pa dela mesena, kakor je prešestvo, kurbarstvo, nečistost, hotljivost, 
[5:20] Malikovalstvo, zavdajalstvo, sovraštva, prepiri, zavisti, maščevanja, svaje, razprtja, razkolništva, 
[5:21] Nevoščljivosti, ubojstva, pijanstva, pojedinje in kar je temu podobnega; za kar vam naprej pravim, kakor sem tudi naprej povedal, da tisti, kteri to delajo, kraljestva Božjega ne bodo podedovali. 
[5:22] Sad duhovni je pa ljubezen, radost, mir, potrpljivost, dobrota, dobrotljivost, vera, krotkost, zdržljivost. 
[5:23] Proti takemu ni postave. 
[5:24] Kteri so pa Kristusovi, meso so na križ razpeli sè sljami in željami. 
[5:25] Če živimo po duhu, po duhu tudi hodimo. 
[5:26] Ne iščimo prazne slave, da eden drugega šuntamo, da smo eden drugemu nevoščljivi. 
[6:1] Bratje, če tudi vjame človeka kaka pregreha, vi, kteri ste duhovni, ravnajte takega v duhu krotkosti, gledeč na se, da tudi ti ne boš izkušan. 
[6:2] Eden drugega bremena nosite, in tako ste izpolnili postavo Kristusovo. 
[6:3] Kajti če kdo misli, da je kaj, a nič ni, nori sam sebe. 
[6:4] A svoje delo naj vsakdo izkuša, in tedaj bo v samem sebi imel hvalo in ne v drugem. 
[6:5] Kajti vsak bo svoje lastno breme nosil. 
[6:6] A kdor se uči besede, naj deli vsako dobro s tem, kteri uči. 
[6:7] Ne motite se, Bog se ne daje zasmehovati; kajti kar seje človek, to bo tudi žel. 
[6:8] Ker kdor seje v meso svoje, od mesa bo žel pogubo, a kdor seje v duha, od duha bo žel življenje večno. 
[6:9] A dobro delati ne opešajmo, kajti ob svojem času bomo želi, če ne obnemagamo. 
[6:10] Kakor imamo torej prigoden čas, delajmo dobro vsem a najbolje tem, kteri so naše vere. 
[6:11] Vidite, koliko sem vam napisal s svojo roko. 
[6:12] Kteri hočejo ugodni biti po mesu, silijo vas, da se obrezujete, samo da ne bodo za voljo križa Kristusovega preganjani. 
[6:13] Ker tudi, kteri se obrezujejo, sami postave ne držé, nego hočejo, da se vi obrezujete, da se z vašim mesom hvalijo. 
[6:14] A jaz Bog ne daj da bi se hvalil, razen s križem Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, po kterem je meni svet na križ razpet in jaz svetu. 
[6:15] Kajti v Kristusu Jezusu nima kaj veljave ne obreza niti neobreza, nego novo stvarjenje. 
[6:16] In kolikor jih po tem vodilu hodi, mir na nje in usmiljenje in na Izrael Božji. 
[6:17] A na dalje; nadleg naj mi nikdor ne dela, kajti jaz rane Gospoda Jezusa na telesu svojem nosim. 
[6:18] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z duhom vašim, bratje! Amen.  Galatom je napisan iz Rima. 

### Ephesians

[1:1] Pavel, apostelj Jezusa Kristusa po volji Božji, svetim bivajočim v Efezu in vernim v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[1:2] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa! 
[1:3] Blagoslovljen Bog in oče Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, kateri nas je blagoslovil z vsakim blagoslovom duhovnim v nebesih v Kristusu; 
[1:4] Kakor nas je izbral v njem pred ustanovljenjem svetá, da bodimo sveti in brezmadežni pred njim v ljubezni, 
[1:5] Odmenivši nas naprej v otroštvo po Jezusu Kristusu záse, po ugodnosti volje svoje, 
[1:6] V hvalo slavne milosti svoje, v kateri nas je pomilostil v ljubljencu; 
[1:7] V katerem imamo rešenje po krvi njegovi, odpuščenje grehov, po bogastvu milosti njegove; 
[1:8] Katere nam je preobilo podelil v vsej modrosti in razumnosti, 
[1:9] Razodevši nam skrivnost volje svoje po ugodnosti svoji, katero je sklenil v sebi, 
[1:10] V naredbo izpolnitve časov, da vse zedini v Kristusu, kar je v nebesih in kar je na zemlji, v njem, 
[1:11] V katerem smo bili tudi izvoljeni, naprej odmenjeni po sklepu njega, ki vse deluje po sovetu volje svoje. 
[1:12] Da bodimo v hvalo slave njegove, kateri smo naprej upali v Kristusu, 
[1:13] V katerem ste tudi vi, slišavši besedo resnice, evangelj blaginje vaše, v katerem ste tudi sprejemši véro, zapečateni bili sè svetim duhom obljube, 
[1:14] Kateri je zastava dedščine naše, v rešenje lastnine, v hvalo slave njegove. 
[1:15] Zatorej tudi jaz, ko sem zvedel za vero pri vas v Kristusu Jezusu, in ljubezen do vseh svetih, 
[1:16] Zahvaljujem se neprestano za vas, spominjajoč se vas v molitvah svojih, 
[1:17] Da vam Bog Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, slave oče, dá duhá modrosti in razodenja v spoznanji njegovem, 
[1:18] Razsvetljene oči srca vašega, da veste, katero je upanje poklica njegovega, in katero bogastvo slave dedščine njegove med svetimi, 
[1:19] In katera presilna velikost moči njegove do nas verujočih po kreposti silne moči njegove, 
[1:20] Katero je pokazal v Kristusu, zbudivši ga izmed mrtvih in posadivši na desnico svojo v nebesih, 
[1:21] Nad vsako poglavarstvo in oblast in moč in gospostvo, in vsako ime, ki se imenuje ne samo na tem svetu, nego tudi na prihodnjem; 
[1:22] In vse je podredil pod noge njegove, in njega je dal za glavo nad vse občini, 
[1:23] Katera je telo njegovo, izpolnjenje njega, ki vse v vsem izpolnjuje. 
[2:1] In vas, ki ste bili mrtvi po prestopkih in grehih, 
[2:2] V katerih ste nekdaj hodili po duhu tega sveta, po knezu oblasti v zraku, duha delujočega zdaj v nevere sinovih, 
[2:3] Med katerimi smo tudi mi vsi nekdaj živeli v poželjivostih mesa svojega ter delali želje mesa in misli, in bili smo po naravi otroci jeze, kakor tudi drugi; 
[2:4] Bog pa, bogat v usmiljenjih, po veliki ljubezni svoji, s katero nas je ljubil, 
[2:5] In ko smo bili mrtvi po grehih, oživil nas je s Kristusom; po milosti ste rešeni; 
[2:6] In vred obudil in posadil med nebeščane v Kristusu Jezusu; 
[2:7] Da pokaže v vékih prihodnjih presilno bogastvo milosti svoje v blagodušnosti do nas v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[2:8] Kajti z milostjo ste rešeni po veri; in to ne iz vas, dar je Božji; 
[2:9] Ne iz dél, da se ne hvali kdo. 
[2:10] Kajti stvar smo njegova, stvarjeni v Kristusu Jezusu za dobra dela, katera je Bog naprej pripravil, da hodimo v njih; 
[2:11] Zatorej pómnite, da ste vi, nekdaj pogani v mesu, katere imenujejo neobrezo oni, ki se imenujejo obrezo v mesu z roko storjeno. 
[2:12] Da ste bili v tistem času brez Kristusa odtujeni meščanstvu Izraelovemu, in tujci zavezam obljube, ne imajoč upanja in brezbožni v svetu; 
[2:13] Sedaj pa ste se v Jezusu Kristusu vi, ki ste bili nekdaj daleč, približali v krvi Kristusovi. 
[2:14] Kajti on je mir naš, kateri je naredil iz obojega eno in podrl medstenje ograje, 
[2:15] Sovraštvo v mesu svojem, postavo zapovedi v naukih odpravil, da bi ta dva v sebi vstvaril v enega novega človeka storivši mir, 
[2:16] In oba v enem telesu z Bogom spravil s križem, umorivši sovraštvo na njem. 
[2:17] In prišel je ter oznanjal mir vam dalnjim in bližnjim; 
[2:18] Ker po njem imamo oboji pristop v enem Duhu k očetu. 
[2:19] Zatorej niste več tujci in priseljenci, nego someščani svetih in domačini Božji, 
[2:20] Sezidani na podlogi aposteljnov in prerokov, vogelni kamen pa je Jezus Kristus sam, 
[2:21] V katerem vse poslopje zgrajeno raste v hram sveti v Gospodu, 
[2:22] V katerem se tudi vi vzidavate v stanovanje Božje v Duhu. 
[3:1] Zategavoljo jaz, Pavel, jetnik Kristusa Jezusa za vas pogane 
[3:2] Ako ste torej čuli naredbo milosti Božje, dane mi za vas, 
[3:3] Da je po razodetji naznanil mi skrivnost (kakor sem prej pisal o kratkem, 
[3:4] Iz česar morete beróč spoznati razumljenje moje v skrivnosti Kristusovi,) 
[3:5] Katera se v druzih rodovih ni naznanila sinom človeškim, kakor se je zdaj razodela svetim aposteljnom njegovim in prerokom v Duhu; 
[3:6] Da so pogani sodedniki in sotelesniki in sodeležniki obljube njegove v Kristusu po evangelji, 
[3:7] Katerega služabnik sem postal po daru milosti Božje, podeljene mi po kreposti moči njegove; 
[3:8] Meni najmanjšemu izmed vseh svetih dana je milost tá, oznanjati med pogani neizsledno bogastvo Kristusovo, 
[3:9] In razsvetliti vse, katero je deleštvo skrivnosti od vekomaj skrite v Bogu, kateri je vse vstvaril po Jezusu Kristusu, 
[3:10] Da se naznani zdaj poglavarstvom in oblastim v nebesih po občini mnogotera modrost Božja, 
[3:11] Po sklepu od vekomaj, katerega je storil v Kristusu Jezusu, Gospodu našem, 
[3:12] V katerem imamo svobodnost in pristop v zaupanji po veri njegovi. 
[3:13] Zato prosim, da ne opešajte v stiskah mojih za vas, kar je slava vaša. 
[3:14] Zategadelj pripogibljem kolena svoja pred očetom Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[3:15] Po katerem se imenuje sleherna rodovina v nebesih in na zemlji, 
[3:16] Da vam dá po bogastvu slave svoje, okrepčati se v moči po Duhu svojem v notranjega človeka, 
[3:17] Da se Kristus po veri vseli v srca vaša, ki ste ukoreninjeni in utrjeni v ljubezni, 
[3:18] Da zmorete doumeti z vsemi svetimi, kaj je širjava in dolžava, in globočina in visočina, 
[3:19] In spoznate spoznanje presezajočo ljubezen Kristusovo, da se napolnite do vse polnosti Božje. 
[3:20] Njemu pa, ki more nad vse storiti preobilo več nego prosimo ali mislimo, po moči, ki deluje v nas, 
[3:21] Njemu slava v občini v Kristusu Jezusu na vse rodove, na vekov veke! Amen. 
[4:1] Opominjam vas torej jaz, jetnik v Gospodu, da se vedete spodobno poklicu, v katerega ste poklicani, 
[4:2] Z vso ponižnostjo in krotkostjo, s potrpežljivostjo prenašajoč se med seboj v ljubezni, 
[4:3] Skrbno prizadevajoč si ohraniti edinost Duha v vezí mirú. 
[4:4] Eno telo in en Duh, kakor ste tudi poklicani v enem upanji poklica svojega; 
[4:5] En Gospod, ena vera, en krst; 
[4:6] En Bog in oče vseh, ki je nad vsemi in po vseh in v vseh vas. 
[4:7] Vsakemu pa izmed nas dala se je milost po meri darú Kristusovega. 
[4:8] Zato pravi: "Šel je kvišku ter pripeljal vjetnike, in dal je dar ljudém." 
[4:9] (Tisto pa: "šel je kvišku", kaj je druzega, nego da je tudi šel prej dol v spodnje dele zemlje? 
[4:10] On, ki je šel dol, je tisti, ki je šel tudi gor nad vsa nebesa, da bi vse izpolnil.) 
[4:11] In on je dal ene za aposteljne, ene za preroke, ene za evangeliste, ene za pastirje in učenike, 
[4:12] V pripravo svetih, za delo službe, za zdelovanje telesa Kristusovega; 
[4:13] Dokler dospemo vsi do edinosti vere in spoznanja sinú Božjega, do moža doraslega, do mere starosti polnosti Kristusove; 
[4:14] Da ne bodemo več deca, in nas ne bode sem ter tja metala in gonila vsaka sapa nauka v zvijačnosti človeški, v prekanjenosti do zvitosti zmote; 
[4:15] Nego da po resničnosti v ljubezni rastemo v vsem do njega, ki je glava, Kristus, 
[4:16] Iz katerega vse telo združeno in zedinjeno po slehernem členovji podajanja, po kreposti v meri vsakega dela rast telesa vrši v izpodbujo svojo v ljubezni. 
[4:17] To torej pravim in pričam v Gospodu, da ne hodite dalje, kakor tudi drugi pogani hodijo v ničemurnosti srca svojega, 
[4:18] Otemnjeni v razumu, odtujeni življenju Božjemu, zaradi nevednosti bivajoče v njih, zaradi otrpnenosti srca svojega; 
[4:19] Kateri so otrpneni vdali se razuzdanosti v doprinašanje sleherne nečistosti v lakomnosti. 
[4:20] Vi pa se niste tako učil Kristusa, 
[4:21] Ako ste ga slišali in ste bili poučeni v njem, kakor je resnica v Jezusu; 
[4:22] Da slečete, po prejnšjem življenji, starega človeka, ki se kvari po sljah prevare; 
[4:23] In se ponovite po duhu srca svojega, 
[4:24] In oblečete novega človeka, vstvarjenega po Bogu, v pravičnosti in svetosti resnice. 
[4:25] Zato iznebivši se laži govorite resnico vsak z bližnjim svojim, ker smo udje med seboj; 
[4:26] "Jezite se, in ne grešite!" Solnce naj ne zaide nad jezo vašo, 
[4:27] In ne dajajte prostora hudiču. 
[4:28] Kdor krade, ne kradi več, temuč trúdi se, delajoč dobro z rokami, da ima kaj podeliti potrebnemu. 
[4:29] Nobena gnjila beseda ne izidi iz vaših ust, nego če je katera dobra za izpodbujo po potrebi, da dá milost poslušajočim. 
[4:30] In ne žalite svetega Duha Božjega, v katerem ste zapečateni za rešenja dan. 
[4:31] Vsaka bridkost in srd in jeza in vpitje in preklinjanje izgini od vas z vso hudobijo; 
[4:32] Bodite pa med seboj blagi, usmiljeni, odpuščajoč si, kakor je tudi Bog v Kristusu vam odpustil. 
[5:1] Bodite torej posnemalci Bogá, kakor otroci ljubljeni, 
[5:2] In živite v ljubezni, kakor je tudi Kristus ljubil nas, in se je dal za nas kakor daritev in žrtev Bogu v prijetno dišavo. 
[5:3] Kurbarija pa in sleherna nečistost ali lakomnost naj se še imenuje ne med vami, kakor se spodobi svetim; 
[5:4] In nesramnost in blebetanje ali norčevanje, kar je nespodobno, temveč zahvaljevanje. 
[5:5] To namreč veste, da nobeden kurbir, ali nečistnik, ali lakomnik, kateri je malikovalec, nima dedščine v kraljestvu Kristusovem in Božjem; 
[5:6] Nihče vas ne varaj s praznimi besedami; kajti za to prihaja jeza Božja na nepokorščine sinove. 
[5:7] Ne bodite torej deležniki njih! 
[5:8] Bili ste namreč nekdaj temà, zdaj pa svetloba Gospodu: kakor svetlobe otroci živite; 
[5:9] (Kajti sad Duha je v sleherni dobroti in pravičnosti in resnici); 
[5:10] In presojajte, kaj je po volji Gospodu. 
[5:11] In ne udeležujte se nerodovitnih del temé; temveč še grajajte jih; 
[5:12] Kar namreč skrivàj počenjajo, grdó je praviti samo. 
[5:13] Vse to pa, kar graja svetloba, razodene se; kajti vse razodeto je svetloba; 
[5:14] Za to pravi: "Zbúdi se, ki spiš, in vstani izmed mrtvih, in prisvetil ti bode Kristus." 
[5:15] Glejte torej, da živite skrbno, ne kakor ne modri, nego kakor modri; 
[5:16] In skrbno rabite čas, ker dnevi so hudi. 
[5:17] Zatorej ne bodite nespametni, nego umeči, kaj je volja Gospodova. 
[5:18] In ne upijanjajte se z vinom, v katerem je zapravljivost, temuč napolnjujte se v Duhu, 
[5:19] Govoreč med seboj v psalmih, slavospevih in pesmah duhovnih, pojóč in prepevajoč v srcu svojem Gospodu, 
[5:20] Zahvaljujoč se vedno za vse v imenu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa Bogu in očetu, 
[5:21] Pokorni si med seboj v strahu Božjem. 
[5:22] Žene, svojim možém bodite pokorne, kakor Gospodu; 
[5:23] Kajti mož je glava ženi, kakor tudi Kristus glava občini, in on je rešenik telesa. 
[5:24] Ali kakor je občina pokorna Kristusu, tako tudi žene svojim možém v vsem. 
[5:25] Možje, ljubite žene svoje, kakor je tudi Kristus ljubil občino, in je sebe dal zanjo, 
[5:26] Da jo posveti, očistivši v kopelji vode v besedi, 
[5:27] Da si jo pripravi slavno občino, brez madeža ali gube ali kaj enakega, nego da bode sveta in brezmadežna. 
[5:28] Tako so možjé dolžni ljubiti žene, kakor telesa svoja. Kdor ljubi ženo svojo, ljubi sebe; 
[5:29] Kajti nihče ni nikoli sovražil svojega mesa, nego hrani in goji ga, kakor tudi Gospod občino; 
[5:30] Ker udje smo telesa njegovega, iz mesa njegovega in iz kosti njegovih. 
[5:31] "Za to bode človek zapustil očeta svojega in mater in držal se žene svoje, in oba bodeta v eno meso." 
[5:32] Ta skrivnost je velika; jaz pa pravim za Kristusa in za občino. 
[5:33] Ali tudi vi posamezni, vsak naj ljubi ženo svojo tako kakor sebe; žena pa bój se moža. 
[6:1] Otroci, bodite poslušni roditeljem svojim v Gospodu, ker to je pravično. 
[6:2] "Spoštuj očeta svojega in mater," ta je zapoved prva z obljubo: 
[6:3] "Da se ti bode dobro godilo in bodeš dolgo živel na zemlji." 
[6:4] In očetje, ne dražite svojih otrók, nego vzrejajte jih v nauku in strahu Gospodovem. 
[6:5] Hlapci, bodite poslušni gospodom po mesu, sè strahom in trepetom, v preprostoti srca svojega, kakor Kristusu; 
[6:6] Ne po okoslužnosti kakor ljudém ugajajoč, nego kakor hlapci Kristusovi, delajoč voljo Božjo iz duše, 
[6:7] Z dobrovoljnostjo, služeč Gospodu, in ne ljudém, 
[6:8] Vedoč, da kar kdo storí dobrega, to bode dobil od Gospoda, bodi si hlapec, ali svobodnjak. 
[6:9] In gospodje, delajte isto z njimi, odjenjajoč s pretenjem, vedóč, da tudi vaš gospod je v nebesih, in da licegledja ni pri njem. 
[6:10] V ostalem, bratje moji, ojačite se v Gospodu, in v kreposti moči njegove. 
[6:11] Odenite se z orožjem Božjim, da bodete mogli stati zoper zvijače hudičeve. 
[6:12] Ker boj nam ni zoper kri in meso, nego zoper poglavarstva, zoper oblasti, zoper svétovne mogočnike temé tega svetá, zoper duhove hudobe v nebesih. 
[6:13] Za to primite orožje Božje, da bodete mogli ustavljati se o hudem dnevi in stati vse premagavši. 
[6:14] Stojte torej, bedro svoje opasavši si z resnico, in oblečeni s pravice oklepom, 
[6:15] In noge obute s pripravljenostjo evangelja mirú; 
[6:16] Razen tega zgrabivši ščit vere, s katerim bodete mogli ugasiti vse goreče strele hudobnega. 
[6:17] In vzemite šlem blaginje, in meč Duhá, kateri je beseda Božja; 
[6:18] In sè sleherno molitvijo in prošnjo molite vsak čas v Duhu, in prav za to čujte v vsej stanovitnosti in prošnji za vse svete, 
[6:19] In zame, da se mi dá beseda v odpiranji ust mojih, da s prostodušnostjo oznanjam skrivnost evangelja, 
[6:20] Za katero sem poslanec v sponah, da v njem prostodušno govorim, kakor mi je besedovati. 
[6:21] Da pa veste tudi vi, kar mene zadeva, kako se mi zdi, naznanil vam bode vse Tihik, brat ljubljeni in zvesti služabnik v Gospodu, 
[6:22] Katerega sem poslal k vam prav za to, da veste, kako je z nami, in da potolaži srca vaša. 
[6:23] Mir bratom in ljubezen z vero od Boga očeta in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[6:24] Milost z vsemi, ki ljubijo Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa v nepopačenosti. Amen.  Efežanom pisal z Rima po Tihiku. 

### Philippians

[1:1] Pavel in Timotej, hlapca Jezusa Kristusa, vsem svetim v Kristusu Jezusu bivajočim v Filipih, z vladikami in pomočniki. 
[1:2] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa! 
[1:3] Zahvaljujem se Bogu svojemu, kader se vas spominjam. 
[1:4] (Ko vedno v sleherni molitvi svoji molim za vas vse z veseljem), 
[1:5] Da ste se udeleževali evangelja od prvega do današnjega dne; 
[1:6] Prepričan prav tega, da bode on, ki je začel v vas dobro delo, dokončal ga do dné Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:7] Kakor je meni spodobno misliti za vas vse, ker vas imam v srci, v sponah svojih in zagovarjanji in utrjevanji evangelja, ki ste vsi sodeležniki mi milosti. 
[1:8] Kajti priča mi je Bog, kako hrepenim po vas vseh z osrčjem Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:9] In tudi to molim, da naj ljubezen vaša še bolj in bolj raste v spoznanji in slehernem razumu; 
[1:10] Da presojate, kar je imenitno, da bodete čisti in neizpotakljivi za dan Kristusov, 
[1:11] Napolnjeni sè sadom pravice po Jezusu Kristusu v slavo in hvalo Božjo. 
[1:12] Želim pa, da spoznate, bratje, da je stanje moje postalo bolj v uspeh evangelju, 
[1:13] Tako da so spone moje očitne postale, da so v Kristusu v vsem šatorišči telesne straže in vsem drugim, 
[1:14] In da večina bratov v Gospodu zaupajoč mojim sponam upa se bolj brez strahu govoriti besedo. 
[1:15] Nekateri tudi iz nevoščljivosti in prepirljivosti, nekateri pa tudi iz dobre volje oznanjajo Kristusa. 
[1:16] Oni, ki iz prepirljivosti, ne oznanjajo Kristusa iz čistega namena, češ da prinesó stisko sponam mojim; 
[1:17] Kateri pa iz ljubezni, vedóč, da sem pripravljen v zagovarjanje evangelja. 
[1:18] Kaj pač? Vendar tako ali tako, bodi si s pretvezo, bodi si v resnici, oznanja se Kristus; in tega se veselim, dà, bodem se tudi veselil. 
[1:19] Vem namreč, da mi bode to v blaginjo po prošnji vaši in pomoči duha Jezusa Kristusa, 
[1:20] Po pričakovanji in upanji mojem, da se v ničemur ne osramotim, temuč v vsej prostodušnosti, kakor vedno, bode se tudi sedaj Kristus poveličeval v mojem telesu, bodi si z življenjem, bodi si sè smrtjo. 
[1:21] Kajti meni je življenje Kristus, in smrt dobiček. 
[1:22] Ako pa življenje v mesu, to mi je dela sad, in kaj bodem izvolil, ne vem; 
[1:23] Kajti pritiska me oboje, želja me je ločiti se in biti s Kristusom, mnogo je namreč bolje; 
[1:24] Ostati pa v mesu potrebnejše za voljo vas. 
[1:25] In v tem zaupanji vem, da bodem ostal in z vami vsemi skupaj ostal v pospeh vaš in veselje v veri, 
[1:26] Da bode slava vaša preobila v Kristusu Jezusu v meni, zaradi povrnitve moje k vam. 
[1:27] Samo védite se spodobno evangelju Kristusovemu, da bodem, bodi si, da pridem in vidim, bodi si v daljavi, slišal, kako je pri vas, da stojite trdno v enem duhu, eni duši, vkup boreč se za vero evangelja, 
[1:28] In da vas nikakor ne strašijo nasprotniki; kar je njim znamenje pogube, vam pa blaginje, in to od Boga; 
[1:29] Ker vam je bilo podeljeno za Kristusa, ne samo verovati vanj, nego tudi zanj trpeti; 
[1:30] Ko imate isti boj, katerega ste videli v meni, in zdaj slišite v meni. 
[2:1] A ko je torej kako opominjanje v Kristusu, ako kaka tolažba ljubezni, ako kaka sodeležnost Duha, ako kako usmiljenje in milovanje; 
[2:2] Napolnite mi veselje, da ste zložni, imajoč isto ljubezen, ene duše, enih misli; 
[2:3] Nič iz prepirljivosti ali ničemurnosti, nego po ponižnosti drug druzega više stavite od sebe. 
[2:4] Ne glejte vsak na svoje, nego vsak tudi na to, kar je druzega. 
[2:5] To mišljenje namreč bodi v vas, katero tudi v Kristusu Jezusu, 
[2:6] Kateri, dasì v podobi Božji, vendar ni smatral za rop biti Bogu enak; 
[2:7] Nego samega sebe je izpraznil, vzel je nase podobo hlapčevo, postal človeku enak; in po obličji je bil najden za človeka; 
[2:8] Ponižal se je postavši pokoren do smrti, smrti pa na križi. 
[2:9] Za to je tudi Bog povišal ga in podelil mu ime nad vsa imena; 
[2:10] Da se naj v imenu Jezusovem pripogiblje vsako koleno nebeščanov in Zemljanov in podzemljanov, 
[2:11] In vsak jezik spoznava, da je Jezus Kristus Gospod v slavo Boga očeta. 
[2:12] Za to, ljubljeni moji, kakor ste bili vsegdar poslušni, ne samo v pričujočnosti moji, nego sedaj mnogo bolj v nepričujočnosti moji, v strahu in trepetu vršite zveličanje svoje. 
[2:13] Kajti Bog je, ki deluje v vas voljo in delovanje, kakor ga volja. 
[2:14] Vse delajte brez godrnjanja in pomišljanja, 
[2:15] Da bodete brez pogreška in čisti, otroci Božji brez madeža, sredi rodú sključenega in spačenega, med katerimi se svetite kakor nebeške luči na svetu, 
[2:16] Držeč se besede življenja, na slavo meni za dan Kristusov, da nisem zastonj tekal in trudil se zastonj. 
[2:17] Ali če se tudi darujem nad daritvijo in službo vere vaše, veselim se in vkup veselim z vami vsemi; 
[2:18] Enako pa veselite se tudi vi in vkup veselite z menoj. 
[2:19] Upam pa v Gospodu Jezusu, da vam skoraj pošljem Timoteja, da bodem tudi jaz mirnega srca, ko zvem, kako je pri vas. 
[2:20] Nikogar namreč nimam enakodušnega, kateri bode pošteno skrbel, kako je pri vas; 
[2:21] Kajti vsi iščejo svojega, ne kar je Kristusa Jezusa; 
[2:22] Preskušenost pa poznate njegovo, da je, kakor otrok z očetom, z menoj služil za evangelj. 
[2:23] Tega torej upam poslati, ko izprevidim, kako je z menoj, precej. 
[2:24] Upam pa v Gospodu, da tudi sam skoraj pridem. 
[2:25] Potrebno se mi je pa zdelo poslati k vam Epafrodita, brata in sodelalca in sovojaka mojega, ter poslanca vašega in služabnika potrebe moje; 
[2:26] Kajti hrepenel je po vas vseh in trepetal, ker ste slišali, da je zbolel. 
[2:27] Kajti zbolel je bil blizu smrti; ali Bog se ga je usmilil, a ne njega samo, nego tudi mene, da bi ne imel težave čez težavo. 
[2:28] Hitreje torej sem ga poslal, da ga vidite zopet ter se veselite, in jaz bodem menj žalosten. 
[2:29] Sprejmite ga torej v Gospodu z vsem veseljem, in take imejte v čisli; 
[2:30] Kajti zaradi dela Kristusovega se je bil približal smrti, v nemar pustivši življenje, da bi dopolnil pogrešek službovanja vašega proti meni. 
[3:1] V ostalem, bratje moji, veselite se v Gospodu. Isto pisati vam ni sitno meni, vam pa v potrjenje. 
[3:2] Pazite se psov, pazite se slabih delalcev, pazite se razkolja! 
[3:3] Kajti mi smo obreza, ki v duhu služimo Bogu in se hvalimo v Kristusu Jezusu, in ne zaupamo v meso; 
[3:4] Dasì bi imel jaz tudi v meso zaupanje. Če méni kdo drug zaupati v meso, jaz bolj; 
[3:5] Obrezan osmi dan, iz rodú Izraelovega, rodovine Benjaminove, Hebrejec iz Hebrejcev, po postavi Farizej, 
[3:6] Po gorečnosti preganjalec občine, po pravičnosti v postavi bréz pogreška. 
[3:7] Ali kar mi je bilo dobiček, to sem imel zaradi Kristusa za izgubo; 
[3:8] Ali zares tudi zdaj imam vse za izgubo zavoljo preobilosti spoznanja Kristusa Jezusa, Gospoda svojega, za katerega voljo sem vse izgubil, in za smeti imam, da pridobim Kristusa, 
[3:9] In se najdem v njem, ne da imam svojo pravico iz postave, nego po veri Kristusovi, iz Boga pravico v veri; 
[3:10] Da spoznam njega in vstajenja njegovega moč, in sodeleštvo njegovega trpljenja, storivši se podobnega smrti njegovi, 
[3:11] Če pač pridem do vstajenja mrtvih; 
[3:12] Ne da sem že dosegel ali sem že popoln; a lovim, če pač dosežem, za kar sem tudi vjet bil od Kristusa Jezusa. 
[3:13] Bratje, jaz ne sodim, da sem dosegel; 
[3:14] Eno pa: pozabivši kar je zadaj, a spenjajoč se po tém, kar je spredaj, proti smotru hitim za darilom nebeškega poklica Božjega v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[3:15] Kolikor nas je torej popolnih, bodimo teh misli; in če ste v čem drugih misli, bode vam tudi to Bog razodel. 
[3:16] Todà do česar smo dospeli, isto bodi nam pravilo v dejanji, isto v mišljenji. 
[3:17] Posnemalci moji bodite vsi, bratje, in glejte one, kateri tako živé, kakor imate nas za zgled. 
[3:18] Kajti mnogo jih živi, katere sem vam mnogokrat imenoval, zdaj pa jih tudi jokajoč imenujem, sovražnike križa Kristusovega, 
[3:19] Katerih konec poguba, katerih Bog trebuh, in slava v njih sramoti, ki jim je zemeljsko v mislih. 
[3:20] Kajti naše dejanje je v nebesih, od koder tudi zveličarja pričakujemo Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, 
[3:21] Kateri bode telo ponižanja našega preizobrazil, da bode podobno telesu slave njegove, po kreposti, s katero si more tudi vse podvreči. 
[4:1] Torej, bratje moji ljubljeni in zaželeni, veselje in venec moj, tako stójte trdno v Gospodu, ljubljeni! 
[4:2] Evodijo opominjam in Sintiho opominjam, da hoditi enih misli v Gospodu; 
[4:3] In prosim tudi tebe, tovariš blagi, pomozi jima, ki ste z menoj se borili v evangelji, in s Klementom in druzimi sodelalci mojimi, katerih imena so v knjigi življenja. 
[4:4] Veselite se vedno v Gospodu, še enkrat pravim: Veselite se! 
[4:5] Miloba vaša bodi znana vsem ljudém. Gospod je blizu. 
[4:6] Nič ne skrbite, nego v vsem naj se Bogu naznanjajo v molitvi in prošnji sè zahvaljevanjem želje vaše. 
[4:7] In mir Božji, ki preseza vse razumljenje, bode hranil srca vaša, in misli vaše v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[4:8] V ostalem, bratje, kar je resnično, kar čestito, kar pravično, kar čisto, kar ljubeznjivo, kar sloveče, če kaka čednost in če kaka hvala, to premišljajte. 
[4:9] Kar ste se tudi učili in prejeli in slišali in videli na meni, to delajte, in Bog mirú bode z vami. 
[4:10] Veselil sem se pa v Gospodu močno, da ste že kdaj krepko ponovili zame skrb; na kar ste tudi mislili, a prilike niste imeli. 
[4:11] Ne da bi dejal to zaradi pomanjkljivosti; jaz sem se namreč učil, v čemer sem, zadovoljen biti z malim. 
[4:12] Znam pa ponižati se, znam tudi živeti v obilosti; sleherne in vsake stvari sem vajen, sit biti in lačen, v obilosti živeti in v pomanjkanji; 
[4:13] Vse morem v njem, ki me krepčá, Kristusu. 
[4:14] Vendar ste prav storili, da ste imeli sočutje z mojo stisko. 
[4:15] Veste pa tudi vi, Filipljani, da v začetku evangelja, ko sem odšel iz Macedonije, nobena občina ni udeležila se z menoj za račun dajanja in prejemanja, razen vi sami; 
[4:16] Ker tudi v Solunu ste mi poslali enkrat in dvakrat za potrebo. 
[4:17] Ne da bi iskal darú, ali sadú iščem, rastočega vam na korist. 
[4:18] Imam pa vsega dovolj in preobilo; napolnjen sem dobivši od Epafrodita vaše darí, sladko dišavo, prijetno daritev, Bogu po volji. 
[4:19] Bog moj pa bode izpolnil vsako potrebo vašo po bogastvu svojem v slavi, v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[4:20] Bogu pa in očetu našemu slava na vekov veke! Amen. 
[4:21] Pozdravite vsakega svetega v Kristusu Jezusu. Pozdravljajo vas bratje z menoj. 
[4:22] Pozdravljajo vas vsi sveti, posebno pa oni iz Cesarjeve hiše. 
[4:23] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vami vsemi! Amen.  Filipljanom pisal z Rima po Epafroditu. 

### Colossians

[1:1] Pavel apostelj Jezusa Kristusa po volji Božji, in Timotej brat, 
[1:2] Svetim v Kolosah in vernim bratom v Kristusu. Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa! 
[1:3] Zahvaljujemo se Bogu in očetu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, in molimo vedno za vas, ker smo slišali za vero vašo v Kristusu Jezusu; 
[1:4] In za ljubezen do vseh svetih, 
[1:5] Po upanji hranjenem vam v nebesih, za katero ste že slišali v besedi resnice evangela, 
[1:6] Ki biva med vami, kakor tudi po vsem svetu, in je sadonosen, kakor tudi med vami, od dné, ko ste čuli in spoznali milost Božjo v resnici: 
[1:7] Kakor ste se tudi učili od Epafra, ljubljenega sohlapca našega, ki je zvest služabnik Kristusov za vas; 
[1:8] On ki nam je tudi naznanil ljubezen vašo v Duhu. 
[1:9] Zato tudi mi, od dné, ko smo slišali, neprestano molimo za vas in prosimo, da se napolnite sè spoznanjem volje njegove v vsej modrosti in razumnosti duhovni, 
[1:10] Da živite pristojno Gospodu v vsem njemu po volji; in sad rodite v vsakem dobrem delu ter se množite v spoznanji Božjem; 
[1:11] V vsej moči krepčani po kreposti slave njegove v vsej stanovitnosti in potrpežljivosti z radostjo; 
[1:12] Zahvaljujoč se očetu, ki nas je storil sposobne za delež dedščine svetih v luči, 
[1:13] Kateri nas je rešil iz temé oblasti, in prestavil v kraljestvo sina ljubezni svoje, 
[1:14] V katerem imamo rešenje po krvi njegovi, odpuščenje grehov; 
[1:15] Kateri je podoba Boga nevidnega, prvorojenec vse stvaritve; 
[1:16] Ker v njem je bilo vstvarjeno vse, kar je v nebesih in na zemlji, vidno in nevidno, ali prestoli, ali gospostva, ali poglavarstva, ali oblasti: vse je vstvarjeno po njem in zanj; 
[1:17] In on je pred vsem, in vse biva v njem; 
[1:18] In on je glava telesa, občine; kateri je začetek, prvorojenec izmed mrtvih, da bode on med vsemi prvak. 
[1:19] Ker vzvidelo se mu je, vanj vseliti vso polnost, 
[1:20] In po njem spraviti vse zanj, pomirivši po krvi križa njegovega, po njem, bodi si kar je na zemlji, bodi si kar je v nebesih. 
[1:21] Tudi vas, ki ste bili nekdaj otujeni in sovražni po mišljenji v delih hudobnih, spravil je sedaj; 
[1:22] V telesu mesa svojega sè smrtjo, da vas naredi svete in brezmadežne in brezgrajne pred seboj; 
[1:23] Ako samo ostanete v veri utrjeni in stanovitni, in se ne ganete od upanja evangelja, katerega ste slišali, oznanovanega po vsej stvaritvi pod nebom, katerega sem jaz Pavel postal služabnik. 
[1:24] Sedaj se veselim v trpljenji svojem za vas, in napolnjujem pogreške stisek Kristusovih v mesu svojem za telo njegovo, katero je občina; 
[1:25] Katere sem jaz postal služabnik po naredbi Božji, dani mi čez vas, da izpolnim besedo Božjo, 
[1:26] Skrivnost skrito od vekov in od rodov; zdaj pa se je razodela svetim njegovim; 
[1:27] Katerim je hotel Bog naznaniti, katero je bogastvo slave té skrivnosti med pogani, ki je Kristus v vas, upanje slave, 
[1:28] Katerega mi oznanjamo, opominjajoč vsakega človeka, in učeč vsakega človeka v vsej modrosti, da napravimo vsakega človeka popolnega v Kristusu Jezusu; 
[1:29] Za kar se tudi trudim boreč so po kreposti njegovi, delujoči z močjo v meni. 
[2:1] Hočem namreč, da veste, kako hud boj imam zaradi vas, in njih, ki so v Laodiceji, in vse, kateri niso videli obličja mojegu v mesu, 
[2:2] Da se potolažijo njih srca, združenih v ljubezni, in za vso bogastvo polnosti razuma, za spoznanje skrivnosti Boga in očeta in Kristusa, 
[2:3] V katerem so vsi zakladi modrosti in spoznanja skriti. 
[2:4] To pa pravim, da vas kdo ne prevara sè sladko besedo; 
[2:5] Kajti če sem tudi po mesu daleč, v duhu sem vendar z vami, radujoč se in gledajoč vašo rednost in trdnost vere vaše v Kristusa. 
[2:6] Kakor ste torej prejeli Kristusa Jezusa Gospoda, živite v njem; 
[2:7] Ukoreninjeni in sezidani v njem in utrjeni v veri, kakor ste se učili, rastoč v njej v zahvaljevanji. 
[2:8] Glejte, da vas kdo ne zapleni z modrijanstvom in prazno prevaro, po izročilu človeškem, po prvinah sveta in ne po Kristusu; 
[2:9] Ker v njem biva vsa polnost božanstva telesno, 
[2:10] In v njem ste napolnjeni, kateri je glava vsakega gospostva in oblasti; 
[2:11] V katerem ste bili tudi obrezani z obrezo ne storjeno z rokami, ko ste slekli telo mesnih grehov v obrezi Kristusovi; 
[2:12] Vred pokopani z njim v krstu, v katerem ste bili tudi vred zbujeni po veri kreposti Boga, kateri ga je zbudil izmed mrtvih. 
[2:13] In vas, ki ste bili mrtvi v grehih in neobrezi mesa svojega, oživil je z njim vred, odpustivši vam vse grehe; 
[2:14] Izbrisavši rokopis, zoper nas, po postavah, ki je bil nam nasproten, in tega je odpravil, pribivši ga sè žeblji na križ; 
[2:15] Ter slekel je poglavarstva in oblasti, in postavil očitno na ogled slavno zmagavši jih v njem. 
[2:16] Naj vas torej ne sodi kdo v jedi ali pijači, ali gledé praznika ali mlaja ali sobote, 
[2:17] Kar je prihodnjega senca, telo pa Kristusovo. 
[2:18] Nihče naj vas ne prekani hoteč v ponižnosti in čaščenji angelov, ko se peča s tem, česar ni videl, ker ga za nič napihuje mesno čustvo njegovo, 
[2:19] In ker se ne drži glave, iz česar vse telo po členovji in vezéh podpirano in zvezano raste v rasti Božji. 
[2:20] Če ste torej umrli s Kristusom prvinam sveta, kaj se vam, kakor da bi v svetu živeli, dajó postave: 
[2:21] ("Ne dotakni se, in ne pokusi, in ne potipaj!" 
[2:22] Kar je vse v pogubo po zlorabi), poleg zapovedi in ukov človeških, 
[2:23] Kar je sicer na videz modrost v samovoljni službi Božji in ponižnosti in neprizanesljivosti proti telesu, v nobenem čislu za napolnjenje mesa." 
[3:1] Če ste bili torej vred zbujeni s Kristusom, iščite, kar je gori, kjer sedí Kristus na desnici Božji. 
[3:2] V mislih imejte, kar je gori, ne kar je na zemlji; 
[3:3] Kajti umrli ste, in življenje vaše je skrito s Kristusom v Bogu; 
[3:4] Kader se prikaže Kristus, življenje naše, tedaj se prikažete tudi vi v slavi z njim. 
[3:5] Morite torej ude svoje zemeljske, kurbarijo, nečistost, strast, hudo poželenje in lakomnost, katera je malikovanje; 
[3:6] Po čemer prihaja jeza Božja nad nepokorščine sinove, 
[3:7] Med katerimi ste tudi vi živeli nekdaj, ko ste bivali med njimi; 
[3:8] Sedaj pa odložite tudi vi vse, jezo, srd, hudobnost, obrekovanje, nesramno besedovanje iz svojih ust. 
[3:9] Ne lagajte med seboj, slecite starega človeka z dejanji njegovimi, 
[3:10] In oblecite novega, ponovljenega v spoznanje po podobi njega, ki ga je vstvaril; 
[3:11] Kjer ni Grka in Juda, obreze in neobreze, tujca, Scita, hlapca, svobodnjaka; nego vse in v vseh Kristus. 
[3:12] Oblecite torej, ker ste izvoljeni in ljubljeni sveti Božji, milosrčnost, blagovoljnost, ponižnost, krotkost, potrpežljivost; 
[3:13] Da se prenašate med seboj, in si odpuščate, če ima kdo tožbo do koga, kakor je tudi Kristus odpustil vam, tako tudi vi; 
[3:14] Poleg vsega tega pa ljubezen, katera je popolnosti vez. 
[3:15] In mir Božji naj vlada v srcih vaših, v katerega ste bili tudi poklicani v enem telesu; in hvaležni bodite! 
[3:16] Beseda Kristusova prebivaj v vas obilo, v vsej modrosti; učite in opominjajte se med seboj s psalmi in hvalospevi in pesmami duhovnimi, v milosti pójte v srci svojem Gospodu. 
[3:17] In vse, kar počenjate v besedi in dejanji, vse v imenu Gospoda Jezusa, zahvaljujoč se Bogu in očetu po njem. 
[3:18] Žene, bodite pokorne svojim možem, kakor se spobodi v Gospodu. 
[3:19] Možje, ljubite žene svoje in ne hudujte se nad njimi. 
[3:20] Otroci, bodite poslušni roditeljem v vsem, kajti to je po volji Gospodu. 
[3:21] Očetje, ne dražite otrók svojih, da ne bodo malosrčni. 
[3:22] Hlapci, bodite poslušni v vsem gospodom po mesu, ne po okoslužnosti kakor ljudem ugajajoč, nego v preprostosti srca, boječ se Boga. 
[3:23] In vse kar storite, delajte iz duše, kakor Gospodu, in ne ljudém; 
[3:24] Vedóč, da od Kristusa dobóte zato povračilo dedščine; kajti Gospodu Kristusu hlapčujete; 
[3:25] Krivični pa bode prejel, kar je krivičnega storil; in ni ga licegledja. 
[4:1] Gospodje, pravičnost in blagodušnost izkazujte hlapcem, vedóč, da tudi vi imate gospoda v nebesih. 
[4:2] V molitvi bodite stanovitni in čujte v njej v zahvaljevanji; 
[4:3] Molite zraven tudi za nas, da nam Bog odpre vrata besede, da govorimo skrivnost Kristusovo, za katero sem tudi zvezan, 
[4:4] Da jo razodevam, kakor mi je treba govoriti. 
[4:5] V modrosti živite z njimi, ki so zunaj, in na pravo priliko pazite. 
[4:6] Beseda vaša bodi vedno v milosti, sè soljo zabeljena, da veste, kako vam je vsakemu odgovarjati. 
[4:7] Kako je pri meni, naznanil vam bode vse Tihik, ljubljeni brat in zvesti služabnik in sohlapec v Gospodu, 
[4:8] Katerega sem prav za to k vam poslal, da zvé, kako pri vas, in izpodbudi srca vaša, 
[4:9] Z Onezimom, zvestim in ljubljenim bratom, kateri je izmed vas; vse vam naznanita, kako je tukaj. 
[4:10] Pozdravlja vas Aristarh, sojetnik moj in Marko, nečak Barnabov, (za katerega ste dobili ukaze; če pride k vam, sprejmite ga); 
[4:11] In Jezus, imenovan Just, ki sta iz obreze; ta dva sama sodelalca za kraljestvo Božje, ki sta mi postala tolažba. 
[4:12] Pozdravlja vas Epafra, ki je od vas, hlapec Kristusov, ki se vedno za vas bojuje v molitvah, da stojite dovršeni in dopolnjeni v vsej volji Božji. 
[4:13] Pričam mu namreč, da ima mnogo gorečnosti za vas in za nje, ki so v Laodiceji, in za nje, ki so v Hierapolji. 
[4:14] Pozdravlja vas Luka, zdravnik ljubljeni, in Dema. 
[4:15] Pozdravite brate v Laodiceji, in Nimfa in občino v hiši njegovi. 
[4:16] In ko se pri vas list prebere, dejte, da se bere tudi v občini Laodicejski, in list iz Laodiceje, da tudi vi berete. 
[4:17] In recite Arhipu: Glej na službo, katero si prejel v Gospodu, da jo izpolnjuješ. 
[4:18] Pozdrav z roko mojo Pavlovo. Spominjajte se vezí mojih! Milost z vami! Amen.  Kološanom pisano z Rima po Tihiku in Onezimu. 

### I Thessalonians

[1:1] Pavel in Silvan in Timotej občini Tesaloničanov v Bogu očetu in Gospodu Jezusu Kristusu; milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa! 
[1:2] Zahvaljujemo se Bogu vedno za vas vse, spominjajoč se vas v molitvah svojih, 
[1:3] Neprestano spominjajoč se dela vašega v veri in truda v ljubezni, in stanovitnosti v tipanji Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, pred Bogom in očetom našim; 
[1:4] Vedóč, bratje ljubljeni od Boga, za izvoljenje vaše; 
[1:5] Da evangelj naš ni prišel samo v besedi do vas, nego tudi v moči in v Duhu svetem, in v mnogem prepričanji, kakor veste, kakošni smo med vami postali za vas. 
[1:6] In vi ste postali posnemalci naši in Gospodovi, sprejemši besedo, v mnogi stiski z veseljem Duha svetega, 
[1:7] Tako da ste postali zgled vsem verujočim v Macedoniji in Ahaji. 
[1:8] Kajti od vas je zadonela beseda Gospodova ne samo po Macedoniji in Ahaji, nego tudi v vsakem kraji razširila se je vaša vera v Boga, tako da nam ni treba kaj govoriti. 
[1:9] Kajti sami oznanjajo za nas, kak smo imeli prihod k vam, in kako ste se obrnili k Bogu od malikov, služit Bogu živemu in resničnemu, 
[1:10] In čakat sina njegovega iz nebés, katerega je zbudil izmed mrtvih, Jezusa, ki nas rešuje jeze prihodnje. 
[2:1] Kajti sami veste, bratje, naš prihod k vam, da ni bil prazen; 
[2:2] Nego, dasì smo trpeli prej in zasramovani bili, kakor veste v Filipih, govorili smo prostodušno v Bogu našem proti vam evangelj Božji v mnogem boji. 
[2:3] Kajti opomin naš ni iz zmotnjave, ne iz nečistosti, ne v zvijači; 
[2:4] Nego kakor nas je Bog za vredne spoznal izročiti nam evangelj, tako govorimo, ne da bi bili ljudém po volji, nego Bogu, ki presoja srca naša. 
[2:5] Kajti ne s prilizovanja besedo nismo se pečali nikdar, kakor veste, ne s pretvezo lakomnosti; Bog priča! 
[2:6] In od ljudî nismo slave iskali, ne od vas, ne od drugih, ko smo bili lahko imenitni, kakor aposteljni Kristusovi; 
[2:7] Nego bili smo rahli sredi vas, kakor pač dójka goji otroke svoje. 
[2:8] Tako hrepeneč po vas, bila nas je volja ne samo podati vam evangelj Božji, nego tudi duše svoje, ker ste nam postali ljubljeni. 
[2:9] Kajti spominjate se, bratje, truda našega in težave; ker noč in dan smo delali, da bi ne bili nadležni komu izmed vas, in oznanjali vam evangelj Božji; 
[2:10] Vi priče in Gospod Bog, kako sveti in pravični in brez krivice smo bili z vami verujočimi; 
[2:11] Kakor veste, kako smo slehernega izmed vas kakor oče otroke svoje opominjali, izpodbujali, 
[2:12] In rotili, da živite pristojno Bogu, ki vas kliče v svoje kraljestvo in slavo. 
[2:13] Zato se tudi mi zahvaljujemo Bogu neprestano, da ste prejemši od nas besedo Božjo oznanovano, sprejeli ne besede človeške, nego (kakor je resnično) besedo Božjo, katera tudi deluje v vas verujočih. 
[2:14] Kajti vi ste postali posnemalci, bratje, občin Božjih v Judeji v Kristusu Jezusu, ker ste tudi vi isto trpeli od lastnih rojakov, kakor tudi oni od Judov, 
[2:15] Kateri so tudi Gospoda Jezusa umorili, in lastne preroke, in nas pregnali, in kateri niso Bogu po volji in so vsem ljudém zoprni; 
[2:16] Kateri nam branijo govoriti poganom, da se rešijo, da vedno napolnijo grehe svoje. Prišla pa je nad nje jeza v njih konec. 
[2:17] Mi pa, bratje, osiroteni za vami za nekaj časa, po obličji ne po srci, prizadevali smo si tolikanj bolj videti obličje vaše v mnogem poželenji. 
[2:18] Zato smo hoteli priti k vam, jaz Pavel, enkrat in dvakrat, a branil nam je satan. 
[2:19] Kajti kdo je upanje naše, ali veselje, ali slave venec? Ali ne tudi vi, pred Gospodom našim Jezusom Kristusom o prihodu njegovem? 
[2:20] Kajti vi ste slava naša in veselje. 
[3:1] Zato, ker več ne strpimo, sklenili smo raji sami ostati v Atenah, 
[3:2] In poslali smo Timoteja, brata našega in služabnika Božjega in sodelalca našega v evangelji Kristusovem, utrdit vas in opominjat vas o veri vaši; 
[3:3] Da nihče ne omahuje v teh stiskah; sami namreč veste, da smo namenjeni za to. 
[3:4] Saj smo tudi, ko smo bili pri vas, naprej povedali vam, da pridemo v stiske, kakor se je tudi zgodilo in veste. 
[3:5] Zato sem tudi jaz, ker nisem mogel več strpeti, poslal pozvedet za vero vašo, da bi vas ne bil morda izkušal izkušnjavec, in bi bil zastonj naš trud. 
[3:6] Ko je pa ravnokar Timotej k nam prišel od vas, in prinesel nam blago vest o veri in ljubezni vaši, in da nas imate vedno v dobrem spominu, hrepeneč videti nas, kakor tudi mi vas; 
[3:7] Zato smo bili, bratje, za vas potolaženi v vsej stiski in sili svoji po veri vaši; 
[3:8] Ker zdaj živimo, če vi stojite trdno v Gospodu. 
[3:9] Kajti káko zahvalo moremo Bogu vrniti za vas, za vse veselje, s katerim se radujemo za vas pred Bogom svojim, 
[3:10] Noč in dan presilno proseč, da bi videli obličje vaše in dopolnili pogreške vere vaše. 
[3:11] On pa Bog in oče naš, in Gospod naš Jezus Kristus naj vodi pot našo k vam; 
[3:12] Vas pa naj Gospod napolni in obogati z ljubeznijo med seboj in do vseh, kakor smo tudi mi do vas; 
[3:13] Da utrdi srca vaša brez madeža v svetosti pred Bogom in očetom našim, o prihodu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vsemi njegovimi svetimi. 
[4:1] V ostalem pa, bratje, prosimo vas in opominjamo v Gospodu Jezusu, da, kakor ste prejeli od nas, kako vam je živeti in Bogu ugajati, če dalje bolj rastete v tem; 
[4:2] Kajti veste, kake nauke smo vam dali po Gospodu Jezusu. 
[4:3] To namreč je volja Božja, posvečenje vaše, da se zdržujete kurbarije; 
[4:4] Da vé vsak izmed vas posodo svojo pridobiti si v posvečenji in časti; 
[4:5] Ne v poželenja strasti, kakor tudi pogani ne poznajoči Boga; 
[4:6] Da ne prestopate in ne prekanjate brata svojega v stvari; ker Gospod je kaznovatelj vsega tega, kakor smo vam tudi naprej povedali in pričali. 
[4:7] Kajti Bog nas ni poklical za nečistost, nego v posvečenje. 
[4:8] Zatorej kdor zameta, ne zameta človeka, nego Boga, njega, ki je tudi dal Duha svojega svetega med nas. 
[4:9] Za bratoljubje pa ni treba vam pisati; kajti sami ste od Boga učeni, ljubiti se med seboj; 
[4:10] Saj tudi ravnate tako z vsemi brati po vsej Macedoniji. Opominjamo pa vas, bratje, da vedno bolj rastete, 
[4:11] In da si prizadevate mirno živeti, in opravljate svoje, in delate sè svojimi rokami, kakor smo vam naročili; 
[4:12] Da živite spodobno pred njimi, ki so zunaj, in ne potrebujete nikogar. 
[4:13] Nočem pa, da bi ne vedeli, bratje, za pokojne, da se ne žalite, kakor tudi drugi, ki nimajo upanja. 
[4:14] Kajti če verujemo, da je Jezus umrl in vstal, tako bode tudi Bog pokojne po Kristusu peljal z njim. 
[4:15] To namreč vam pravimo v besedi Gospodovi, da mi živeči, ostali za prihod Gospodov, ne bodemo prehiteli pokojnih; 
[4:16] Ker Gospod sam bode v zapovedi, v glasu nadangelovem in v trombi Božji stopil dol z nebes, in mrtvi v Kristusu bodo vstali najprej. 
[4:17] Potem bodemo mi živeči, ostali, z njimi vred zgrabljeni v oblakih Gospodu naproti kvišku, in tako bodemo vedno z Gospodom. 
[4:18] Zato se opominjajte s temi besedami med seboj. 
[5:1] O časih pa in prilikah, bratje, ni treba da se vam piše; 
[5:2] Kajti sami veste na tanko, da dan Gospodov, kakor tat ponoči, tako pride; 
[5:3] Ko namreč pravijo: Mir in varnost, tedaj jih mahoma doleti poguba, kakor porodne bolečine nosečo, in ušli ne bodo. 
[5:4] Vi pa, bratje, niste v temi, da vas dan zagrabi kakor tat; 
[5:5] Vi vsi ste luči sinovi in sinovi dneva; nismo od noči ali temé. 
[5:6] Torej ne spimo kakor tudi drugi, nego čujmo in trezni bodimo. 
[5:7] Kajti speči spé ponoči, in upijanjajoči se upijanjajo se ponoči; 
[5:8] Mi pa, ki smo od dneva, bodimo trezni, ter oblecimo oklep vere in ljubezni, in za šlem upanje blaginje; 
[5:9] Kajti ni nas Bog pripravil za jezo, nego za zadobljenje blaginje po Gospodu našem Jezusu Kristusu, 
[5:10] Kateri je umrl za nas, da, naj čujemo ali spimo, z njem vred živimo. 
[5:11] Zato opominjajte se med seboj in izpodbujajte drug druzega, kakor tudi delate. 
[5:12] Prosimo pa vas, bratje, da znate nje, ki se trudijo med vami, in so vam predpostavljeni v Gospodu in vas svaré, 
[5:13] In da jih visoko čislate v ljubezni za njih delo. Mirujte med seboj. 
[5:14] Opominjamo pa vas, bratje, svarite neredne, prigovarjajte malodušnim, skrbite za slabotne, potrpežljivi boditi z vsemi. 
[5:15] Glejte, da ne vrne kdo komu hudega za hudo, nego vedno za dobrim hodite med seboj in proti vsem. 
[5:16] Radujte se vedno! 
[5:17] Molite neprestano! 
[5:18] Hvaležni bodite v vsem; kajti to je volja Božja v Kristusu Jezusu za vas. 
[5:19] Duha ne gasite. 
[5:20] Prerokovanj ne zaničujte. 
[5:21] Poskusite vse, dobro ohranite. 
[5:22] Vsakoršnega hudega se zdržujte. 
[5:23] On pa, Bog mirú, posvéti vas cele, in duh vaš popoln, in duša in telo naj se ohrani brez krivice o prihodu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[5:24] Zvest je, ki vaš kliče, kateri bode tudi storil. 
[5:25] Bratje, molite za nas. 
[5:26] Pozdravite brate vse v svetem poljubu. 
[5:27] Rotim vas pri Gospodu, da se naj list bere vsem svetim bratom. 
[5:28] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vami! Amen.  Tesaloničanom list prvi pisan iz Atén. 

### II Thessalonians

[1:1] Pavel in Silvan in Timotej občini Tesaloničanov v Bogu očetu našem in Gospodu Jezusu Kristusu: 
[1:2] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:3] Zahvaljevati se dolžni smo Bogu vedno za vas, bratje, kakor je spodobno, ker se močno množi vera vaša, in raste ljubezen vsakega izmed vas vseh med seboj; 
[1:4] Tako da se mi sami hvalimo za vas v občinah Božjih, zaradi stanovitnosti vaše in vere v vseh preganjanjih vaših in stiskah, katere prebivate; 
[1:5] Znamenje pravične sodbe Božje, da se za vredne spoznate kraljestva Božjega, za katero tudi trpite: 
[1:6] Če je res pravično pri Bogu vračati stisko njim, ki vas stiskajo, 
[1:7] In vam stiskanim počitek z nami, v razodenji Gospoda Jezusa z neba z angeli moči njegove, 
[1:8] V ognji plamena, kaznujočega njé, ki ne poznajo Boga, in ne slušajo evangelja Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[1:9] Kateri bodo za kazen trpeli večno pogubo izpred obličja Gospodovega in izpred slave moči negove, 
[1:10] Kader bode prišel, da se oslavi v svetih svojih, in da se mu čudijo vsi verujoči (ker se je verovalo pričanje naše pri vas) tisti dan. 
[1:11] Za kar tudi vedno molimo za vas, da vas vredne spozna poklica naš Bog, in napolni vse dopadajenje dobrote in delo vere v moči, 
[1:12] Da se oslavi ime Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa v vas, in vi v njem, po milosti Boga našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa. 
[2:1] Prosimo pa vas, bratje, za prihod Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa in shod naš z njim, 
[2:2] Da se ne daste hitro oplašiti umu, in se ne ustrašite, ne po duhu ne po besedi, ne po pismu, kakor da je od nas, da je blizu dan Kristusov. 
[2:3] Naj vas nihče ne preslepi nikakor; ker če ne pride prej odpad, in se razodene človek greha, pogube sin, 
[2:4] Kateri se upira in spenja zoper vse, kar se kliče Bog ali čestitost, tako da se samega posadi v svetišče Božje kakor Boga in se kaže da je Bog. 
[2:5] Ali se ne spominjate, da sem, bivajoč še pri vas, rekel vam to? 
[2:6] In sedaj, kaj zadržuje, veste, da se ne razodene o svojem času. 
[2:7] Kajti že deluje skrivnost krivice, samo da se on, ki zadržuje, odpravi skoraj; 
[2:8] In tedaj se bode razodel krivični, katerega bode Gospod uničil z dihom svojih ust in pokončal s prikaznijo svojega prihoda: 
[2:9] Katerega prihod je po kreposti satanovi v vsej moči in znamenjih in čudežih laži, 
[2:10] In v sleherni prevari krivice v pogubljenih, za to ker niso sprejeli ljubezni resnice, da bi se rešili; 
[2:11] In zato jim bode Bog poslal krepost zmotnjave, da verujejo láži: 
[2:12] Da bodejo sojeni vsi, kateri niso verovali resnici, nego jim je ugajala krivica. 
[2:13] Mi pa smo dolžni zahvaljevati se Bogu vedno za vas, bratje ljubljeni od Gospoda, ker vas je Bog izvolil od začetka v blaginjo v posvečevanji Duha in veri resnice, 
[2:14] Za kar vas je poklical po evangelji našem, v zadobljenje slave Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[2:15] Zatorej stójte trdno, bratje, in hranite izročila, katerih ste se učili, bodi si po besedi, bodi si po listu našem. 
[2:16] Sam pa Gospod naš Jezus Kristus in Bog in oče naš, ki nas je ljubil in dal nam večno tolažbo in dobro upanje v milosti, 
[2:17] Potolaži naj srca vaša in potrdi vas v sleherni dobri besedi in delu. 
[3:1] V ostalem, molite, bratje, za nas, da se širi beseda Gospodova in slaví, kakor tudi pri vas, 
[3:2] In da se rešimo nespametnih in hudobnih ljudî; kajti vera ni vseh. 
[3:3] Zvest pa je Gospod, kateri vas bode utrdil in branil zlega, 
[3:4] Zaupamo pa v Gospodu vam, da kar vam naročamo, tudi delate in bodete delali. 
[3:5] Gospod pa naj vodi srca vaša v ljubezen Božjo, in v stanovitnost Kristusovo. 
[3:6] Naročamo pa vam, bratje, v imenu Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, da se ogibljete vsakega brata, kateri živi neredno in ne po sporočilu, katero je prejel od nas. 
[3:7] Kajti sami veste, kako je nas posnemati treba; 
[3:8] Ker nismo bili neredni med vami, in ne zastonj kruha jedli od koga, nego s trudom in težavo smo delali noč in dan, da bi ne nadlegovali koga izmed vas; 
[3:9] Ne da bi ne imeli oblasti, nego da se vam damo v zgled, da nas posnemate. 
[3:10] Saj smo tudi, ko smo bili pri vas, to naročali vam, da če kdo noče delati, naj tudi ne jé. 
[3:11] Čujemo namreč, da nekateri med vami neredno živé, in ne delajo nič, nego pečajo se z nepotrebnim. 
[3:12] Takim pa naročamo in jih opominjamo po Gospodu našem Jezusu Kristusu, da naj v miru delajoč svoj kruh jedó. 
[3:13] Vi pa, bratje, ne opešajte v dobrem dejanji. 
[3:14] Če pa kdo ne sluša besede naše po listu, njega zaznamovajte, in ne pečajte se z njim, da ga bode sram; 
[3:15] In ne imejte ga za sovražnika, nego svarite kakor brata. 
[3:16] On pa, Gospod mirú, daj vam mir vedno, vsakoršen. Gospod z vami vsemi! 
[3:17] Pozdrav z mojo roko Pavlovo, kar je znamenje v vsakem listu; tako pišem. 
[3:18] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vsemi vami! Amen.  Tesaloničanom list drugi pisan iz Atén. 

### I Timothy

[1:1] Pavel apostelj Jezusa Kristusa, po povelji Boga rešitelja in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, upanja našega, 
[1:2] Timoteju, pravemu otroku v veri: milost, usmiljenje, mir od Boga očeta našega in Kristusa Jezusa, našega Gospoda! 
[1:3] Kakor sem te prosil, da ostani v Efezu, potujoč v Macedonijo, da zapoveš nekim, naj ne učé drugače, 
[1:4] In naj se ne ubijajo z basnimi in rodopisi brez konca, kateri napravljajo bolj prepire nego izpodbujevanje Božje v veri. 
[1:5] Namen pa zapovedi je ljubezen iz srca čistega in dobre vesti in vere nehinavske; 
[1:6] Kar so nekateri izgrešivši obrnili se v prazno besedovanje, 
[1:7] Hoteč biti postavouki, dasi ne umejo, ne kaj govoré, ne kaj trdijo. 
[1:8] Vemo pa, da je postava dobra, če jo kdo postavno rabi, 
[1:9] Vedóč to, da za pravičnega ni postavljena postava, nego za nepostavne in uporne, brezbožne in grešnike, nesvete in posvetne, očeta in matere ubijalce, ljudomorce, 
[1:10] Kurbirje, moželežnike, ljudokradeže, lažnike, krivoprisežnike, in kar druzega nasprotuje zdravemu uku, 
[1:11] Po evangelji slave Boga blaženega, kateri se je meni izročil. 
[1:12] In hvaležen sem njemu, ki me krepčá, Kristusu Jezusu Gospodu našemu, da me je za zvestega imel in postavil me v službo, 
[1:13] Ki sem bil prej preklinjalec in preganjalec in silovitnik; ali usmiljenje sem zadobil, ker sem neveden delal v neveri; 
[1:14] Preobila pa je bila milost Gospoda našega z vero in ljubeznijo v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[1:15] Resnična beseda in vsega sprejema vredna, da je Kristus Jezus prišel na svet, grešnike rešit, katerih prvi sem jaz. 
[1:16] Ali za to sem usmiljenje zadobil, da bi v meni prvem Kristus pokazal vso svojo potrpežljivost za zgled njim, ki bodo verovali vanj za večno življenje. 
[1:17] Kralju pa svetov, neminljivemu, nevidnemu, samemu modremu Bogu, čast in slava na vekov veke! Amen. 
[1:18] To zapoved ti naročam, Timotej otrok, po predhodnjih prerokovanjih o tebi, da biješ v njih lepi boj, 
[1:19] Imajoč vero in dobro vest, katero so nekateri od sebe pahnili ter ponesrečili se v veri; 
[1:20] Med katerimi je Himenej in Aleksander, katera sem izročil satanu, da se učita ne preklinjati. 
[2:1] Opominjam torej pred vsem, naj se napravljajo prošnje, molitve, klicanja, zahvaljevanja za vse ljudî, 
[2:2] Za kralje in vse prvake, da živimo mirno in tiho življenje v vsej pobožnosti in poštenosti. 
[2:3] Kajti to je dobro in prijetno pred Bogom rešiteljem našim, 
[2:4] Kateri hoče, da se rešijo vsi ljudje in pridejo do spoznanja resnice. 
[2:5] Kajti eden je Bog, eden tudi srednik med Bogom in ljudmi, človek Kristus Jezus, 
[2:6] Kateri se je dal v odkupnino za vse, pričanje o svojem času, 
[2:7] Za kar sem bil jaz postavljen glasnik in apostelj (resnico govorim v Kristusu, ne lažem), učenik poganov v veri in resnici. 
[2:8] Hočem torej, da možjé molijo v vsakem kraji, roke svete dvigajoč brez jeze in pregovarjanja. 
[2:9] Isto tako tudi žene v spodobni opravi, da se naj dičijo sè sramežljivostjo in poštenostjo, ne v kitah ali zlatu ali biserih, ali dragi obleki, 
[2:10] Nego (kar se spodobi ženskim, katere so bogoslužnost obljubile,) z dobrimi deli. 
[2:11] Ženska naj se mirno uči v vsej podložnosti. 
[2:12] Ženski pa učiti ne dovolim, ne gospodovati možu, nego v miru biti; 
[2:13] Kajti Adam je bil prvi vstvarjen, potem Eva; 
[2:14] In Adam ni bil prevaran, žena pa je prevarana prišla v pregreho; 
[2:15] Rešila pa se bode z detorodstvom, ako ostanejo v veri in ljubezni in posvečevanji s poštenostjo. 
[3:1] Resnična beseda: Če kdo išče predstojništva, želi lepega dela. 
[3:2] Predstojnik torej treba da je brez napake, ene žene mož, trezen, zméren, spodoben, gostoljuben, dober učitelj; 
[3:3] Ne pijanec, ne pretepalec, ne grdega zaslužka; nego odjenljiv, ne prepirčen, ne denarja lakomen; 
[3:4] Svoji hiši dober gospodar, otroke strahujoč z vso spodobnostjo; 
[3:5] (Če pa kdo svoji hiši gospodariti ne zná, kako bode skrbel za občino Božjo?) 
[3:6] Ne novinec, da napihnen ne pade v sodbo hudičevo. 
[3:7] Treba pa tudi, da ima dobro pričanje od vnanjih, da ne pade v očitanje in past hudičevo. 
[3:8] Pomočniki isto tako spodobni, ne dvojezični, ne mnogemu vinu vdani, ne grdega zaslužka; 
[3:9] Imajoč vere skrivnost v čisti vesti. 
[3:10] A tudi ti naj se najprej presodijo, potem naj bodejo pomočniki, ko so neoponosni. 
[3:11] Ženske isto tako spodobne, ne obrekljive; trezne, zveste v vsem. 
[3:12] Pomočniki naj bodejo ene žene možjé, otrokom dobri gospodarji in svojim hišam. 
[3:13] Kateri so bili namreč dobri pomočniki, pridobé si lepo stópinjo, in veliko zaupanje v veri, ki je v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[3:14] To ti pišem, upajoč, da pridem prej k tebi; 
[3:15] Če se pa mudim, da veš, kako se je treba vesti v hiši Gospodovi, ki je občina Boga živega, stolp in podzidje resnice. 
[3:16] In po vseh mnenji velika je pobožnosti skrivnost; Bog se je razodel v mesu, opravičil v Duhu, prikazal se angelom, oznanjal poganom, verovan bil na svetu, kvišku vzet v slavi. 
[4:1] Duh pa izrečno govori, da bodejo v poslednjih časih nekateri odpadli od vere, držeč se lažnjivih klatiduhov in naukov hudičevih, 
[4:2] V licemérstvu lažigovórnikov, zaznamovanih v lastni vesti, 
[4:3] Ki branijo ženiti se in možiti, in zapovedujejo zdrževati se jedil, katera je Bog vstvaril za uživanje sè zahvaljevanjem vernim in njim, ki so spoznali resnico. 
[4:4] Kajti vsaka stvar Božja je dobra in nič ni da bi se zamotalo, ako se prejemlje sè zahvaljevanjem; 
[4:5] Kajti posvečuje se po besedi Božji in molitvi. 
[4:6] To naročajoč bratom, bodeš dober pomočnik Jezusa Kristusa, vzrejen v besedah vere, in dobrega nauka, po katerem hodiš. 
[4:7] Posvetne pa in starobabje basni zavračaj; vadi se pa v pobožnosti. 
[4:8] Kajti telesna vaja je za malo koristna; pobožnost pa je za vse koristna, ker ima obljubo življenja sedanjega in prihodnjega. 
[4:9] Resnična beseda in vsega sprejema vredna; 
[4:10] Kajti za to se tudi trudimo in sramotimo, ker smo upanje svoje postavili v Boga živega, kateri je rešitelj vseh ljudî, sosebno vérnih. 
[4:11] Zapovedúj to in úči! 
[4:12] Nihče naj ne zaničuje mladosti tvoje, nego zgled bodi vérnim v besedi, v vedenji, v ljubezni, v duhu, v veri, v čistosti. 
[4:13] Dokler pridem, skrbi za branje, opominjanje, podučevanje. 
[4:14] Ne zanemarjaj darú v sebi, kateri ti je bil dan po preroštvu s pokladanjem rok starejšinstva. 
[4:15] To premišljaj, v tem bivaj, da bode napredek tvoj očiten v vsem. 
[4:16] Pazi nase in na úk; stanoviten bodi v tem; kajti to delajoč rešil bodeš sebe in njé, ki te poslušajo. 
[5:1] Nad starejšim se ne hudúj, nego opominjaj ga kakor očeta; mlajše, kakor brate; 
[5:2] Žene starejše, kakor matere; mlajše, kakor sestre, v vsej čistosti. 
[5:3] Vdove spoštuj, prave vdove. 
[5:4] Ako pa ima kaka vdova otroke ali vnuke, učé se naj najprej pobožnosti do svoje hiše in povračevati roditeljem. Kajti to je dobro in prijetno pred Bogom. 
[5:5] Prava vdova pa in samica ima upanje v Boga in je stanovitna v prošnjah in molitvah noč in dan; 
[5:6] Razuzdana pa je živa mrtva. 
[5:7] In to zapoveduj, da bodejo brez napake. 
[5:8] Ako pa kdo ne skrbi za svoje, zlasti pa za domače, zatajil je véro, in hujši je od nevernega. 
[5:9] Vdova naj se izvoli ne pod šestdesétimi leti, bivša enega moža žena; 
[5:10] V dobrih delih izpričana, če je otroke izredila, če je tujce sprejemala, če je svetim noge umivala, če je stiskanim pomagala, če je za slehernim dobrim delom hodila. 
[5:11] Mlajše vdove pa zavračaj; ko so namreč pohotne postale po Kristusu, hočejo se možiti; 
[5:12] Imajoč očitanje, da so se izneverile prvi veri. 
[5:13] Zraven pa se tudi učé brez dela pohajkovati po hišah; in ne samo brez dela, nego tudi jezične in védečne, govoreč česar ni potreba. 
[5:14] Hočem torej, da naj se mlajše možé, otroke rodévajo, gospodinjijo, nobenega povoda ne dajó nasprotniku za obrekovanje. 
[5:15] Kajti že se jih je nekaj nazaj obrnilo za satanom. 
[5:16] Če ima kak veren, ali verna vdove, pomaga jim naj, in občina ne imej težave, da pomaga pravim vdovam. 
[5:17] Starejšine, kateri so dobri glavarji, naj se imajo za dvojne česti vredne, zlasti kateri se trudijo v besedi in uku. 
[5:18] Govori namreč pismo: "Volu mlatečemu ne zavezuj gobca;" in pa: "Vreden je delalec svojega plačila." 
[5:19] Zoper starejšino ne sprejemaj tožbe, razen na dve priči ali tri. 
[5:20] Grešeče svári vpričo vseh, da bodejo imeli tudi drugi strah. 
[5:21] Rotim pred Bogom in Gospodom Jezusom Kristusom in angeli izvoljenimi, da hraniš to brez predsodka in ne storiš ničesar po posebnem nagnenji. 
[5:22] Rók nikomur prenaglo ne pokladaj in ne udeležuj se tujih gréhov. Ohrani samega sebe čistega. 
[5:23] Ne bodi več vodopivec, nego uživaj po malo vina, zaradi želodca svojega in pogostih slabosti svojih. 
[5:24] Nekaterih ljudî grehi so očitni, gredó naprej v obsojo; nekaterim pa tudi za njimi gredó. 
[5:25] Tako so tudi dobra dela očitna, in ona, ki niso tako, ne dado se skriti. 
[6:1] Kateri so hlapci pod jarmom, naj imajo svoje gospode za vse česti vredne, da se ne govori pregrešno o Bogu in nauku. 
[6:2] Kateri pa imajo verne gospode, naj jih ne zaničujejo, ker so bratje; nego tem bolj naj služijo, ker so verni in ljubljeni, kateri sprejemajo dobroto. Tako úči in opominjaj. 
[6:3] Ako kdo drugače uči in ne pristopi zdravim besedam Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa in nauku k pobožnosti, 
[6:4] Oslepljen je in nič ne umé, nego boleha za pregovarjanji in besednimi prepiri, iz česar postane zavist, prepir, preklinjanje, natolcevanje; 
[6:5] Nepotrebni opravki ljudî popačenih v duhu in brez resnice, ki mislijo, da je pobožnost pridobivanje. Ogiblji se takih. 
[6:6] Je pa pridobivanje veliko pobožnost sè zadovoljnostjo. 
[6:7] Kajti ničesar nismo prinesli na svet, jasno, da tudi odnesti ne moremo ničesar; 
[6:8] Če pa imamo hrane in odeje, bodimo s tem zadovoljni. 
[6:9] Kateri pa hočejo biti bogati, padejo v izkušnjavo in past in mnoga poželenja nespametna in škodljiva, katera pogrezajo ljudî v pogubljenje in pogin. 
[6:10] Kajti vsega zlega korenina je lakomnost; njej vdani so nekateri zabredli od vere in prebodli se z mnogimi bolečinami. 
[6:11] Ti pa, o človek Božji, ogiblji se tega; hodi pa za pravico, pobožnostjo, vero, ljubeznijo, stanovitnostjo, krotkostjo. 
[6:12] Bij lepi boj vere; poprimi se večnega življenja, za katero si bil tudi poklican in si spoznal lepo spoznanje pred mnogimi pričami. 
[6:13] Naročam ti pred Bogom, ki vse oživlja, in Kristusom Jezusom, kateri je pričal pred Poncijem Pilatom lepo spoznanje, 
[6:14] Da hraniš zapoved brez madeža, brez napake, do prihoda Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[6:15] Katerega bode o svojem času prikazal blaženi in edini vladar, kralj kraljujočih in gospodujočih gospod, 
[6:16] Kateri ima sam neumrjočnost, v svetlobi bivajoč ne dohodni; katerega ni videl ljudî nobeden, in tudi videti ne more; njemu čast in moč večna! Amen. 
[6:17] Bogatinom na tem svetu naročaj, naj se ne prevzemajo; in naj ne zaupajo v bogastva negotovost, nego v Boga živega, kateri nam delí vsega obilo v uživanje; 
[6:18] Naj dobro delajo, bogati v dobrih delih, radodarni, podeljivi: 
[6:19] Naj si nabirajo zaklade v dobro podstavo za prihodnjost, da se poprimejo večnega življenja. 
[6:20] O Timotej, brani zalogo ogibajoč se posvetnega govoričenja in nasprotij krivo imenovane znanosti, 
[6:21] Katero spoznavajoč so nekateri izgrešili vero. [vrstica 22:] Milost s teboj! Amen.  Timoteju list prvi pisan iz Laodiceje, katera jo glavno mesto Frigije Pakacijane. 

### II Timothy

[1:1] Pavel apostelj Jezusa Kristusa po volji Božji za obljubo življenja v Kristusu Jezusu, 
[1:2] Timoteju otroku ljubljenemu: milost, usmiljenje, mir od Boga očeta in Kristusa Jezusa Gospoda našega. 
[1:3] Hvaležen sem Bogu, kateremu služim od pradedov v čisti vesti, ker te imam neprestano v spominu v molitvah svojih ponoči in podnevi, 
[1:4] Hrepeneč videti te, spominjajoč se solz tvojih, da se napolnim veselja; 
[1:5] Ker imam v mislih nelicemersko vero tvojo, katera je bivala najprej v babici tvoji Lojidi in materi tvoji Evniki, preverjen sem pa, da tudi v tebi. 
[1:6] Zaradi tega opominjam te, da upihaš blagodar Božji, kateri je v tebi po rók mojih pokladanji. 
[1:7] Kajti Bog nam ni dal duha boječnosti, nego moči in ljubezni in strahovanja. 
[1:8] Ne sramuj se torej pričanja Gospoda našega, ne mene, jetnika njegovega; nego z evangeljem vred trpi po moči Boga, 
[1:9] Kateri je nas rešil in poklical sè svetim poklicem: ne po delih naših, nego po svojem sklepu in milosti, dani nam v Kristusu Jezusu pred večnimi časi; 
[1:10] A razodeti sedaj po prihodu rešitelja našega Jezusa Kristusa, kateri je uničil smrt in obelodanil življenje in neminljivost po evangelji, 
[1:11] Za katerega sem bil jaz postavljen za glásnika in aposteljna in učitelja poganov; 
[1:12] Za tega delj tudi to trpim; toda ni me sram; vem namreč, v koga imam zaupanje, in preverjen sem, da je zmožen hraniti zalogo mojo za tisti dan. 
[1:13] Zgled imej zdravih beséd, katere si slišal od mene, v veri in ljubezni, ki je v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[1:14] Dobro zalogo hrani po Duhu svetem, bivajočem v nas. 
[1:15] To veš, da so se odvrnili od mene vsi v Aziji, med katerimi je Figél in Hermogén. 
[1:16] Usmiljenje daj Gospod hiši Oneziforovi, ker me je mnogokrat oživil in se ni sramoval spon mojih, 
[1:17] Nego, ko je bil v Rimu, iskal me je z večjo gorečnostjo in našel. 
[1:18] Gospod mu daj usmiljenje najti od Gospoda tisti dan. In koliko je služboval v Efezu, sam bolje veš. 
[2:1] Ti torej, dete moje, ojači se v milosti, ki je v Kristusu Jezusu; 
[2:2] In kar si slišal od mene pred mnogimi pričami, tisto izročí vernim ljudém, kateri bodo zmožni tudi druge učiti. 
[2:3] Ti torej trpi, kakor dober vojak Jezusa Kristusa. 
[2:4] Nobeden vojskovalec se ne zapleta v opravila življenja, da je po volji vojskovodji. 
[2:5] Ako se pa kdo tudi bojuje, ne venča se, ako se ne bojuje postavno. 
[2:6] Ratár, ki se trudi, treba da najprej dobi od pridelkov. 
[2:7] Umej, kar pravim; Gospod ti namreč daj razum v vsem. 
[2:8] Spominjaj se, da je Jezus Kristus zbudil se od mrtvih, iz semena Davidovega, po evangelji mojem, 
[2:9] V katerem trpim do spón, kakor hudodelnik; ali beseda Božja ni vezana. 
[2:10] Zato vse pretrpim zaradi izvoljenih, da tudi oni zveličanje zadobé v Kristusu Jezusu z večno slavo. 
[2:11] Resnična je beseda, če smo namreč vred umrli, bodemo tudi vred živeli; 
[2:12] Če pretrpimo, bodemo tudi vred kraljevali; če ga zatajimo, bode tudi on nas zatajil; 
[2:13] Če smo nezvesti, on ostane zvest; zatajiti se ne more. 
[2:14] Tako opominjaj, roteč pred Gospodom, ne boriti se z besedami za nič prida, v pogubo poslušajočim. 
[2:15] Prizadevaj si izkušenega se storiti Bogu, delalca, ki ga ne bodi sram, ki prav ravná z besedo resnice. 
[2:16] Posvetnega pa govoričenja ogiblji se; kajti vedno bolj bodo napredovali v brezbožnosti, 
[2:17] In beseda njih bode razjedala kakor rak, 
[2:18] Izmed katerih je Himenej in Filet, katera sta izgrešila resnico, rekóč, da je že bilo vstajenje, in nekim vero motijo. 
[2:19] Trdna tla pa Božja stojé, imajoč ta pečat: "Gospod pozna svoje," in "Odstopi naj od krivice vsak, kdor imenuje ime Kristusovo." 
[2:20] V veliki hiši pa niso samo zlate in srebrne posode, nego tudi lesene in lončene in ene v čast, ene v nečast. 
[2:21] Ako se torej kdo oznaži téh, bode posoda v čast, posvečena in koristna Gospodu, pripravljena za sleherno dobro delo. 
[2:22] Mladostnih pa poželénj ogiblji se, nego hodi za pravico, vero, ljubeznijo, mirom z njimi, kateri Gospoda kličejo iz čistega srca. 
[2:23] Abotnih pa in neslanih prepirov iznebi se, vedóč, da rodévajo boje; 
[2:24] Hlapec pa Gospodov naj se ne bojuje, nego kroták bodi proti vsem, dober učitelj, potrpežljiv, 
[2:25] V krotkosti naj zavrača nasprotnike, ali jim morebiti Bog ne dá kdaj kesanja v spoznanje resnice, 
[2:26] In se iztreznijo iz pasti hudičeve, ko jih je vjel v voljo svojo. 
[3:1] To pa védi, da v zadnjih dnevih nastanejo težki časi. 
[3:2] Kajti ljudje bodejo samoljubni, lakomni, širokoustni, prevzetni, opravljivi, roditeljem nepokorni, nehvaležni, brezbožni, 
[3:3] Brezsrčni, nespravljivi, obrekljivi, nezmerni, grozoviti, nedobroljubni, 
[3:4] Izdajalci, vrtoglavi, napihneni; veselje bolj ljubeči nego Boga, 
[3:5] Ki imajo podobo pobožnosti, moč pa njeno tajé; in teh se ogiblji! 
[3:6] Izmed teh namreč so oni, ki se plazijo v hiše in v pest dobivajo obložene z grehi ženščine, katere goni mnogotero poželenje, 
[3:7] Katere se vedno učé, in nikdar ne morejo priti do spoznanja resnice. 
[3:8] Enako pa, kakor sta Janez in Jambrez ustavljala se Mojzesu, tako se tudi tí ustavljajo resnici, ljudjé popačeni na umu, malopridni za vero. 
[3:9] Ali napredovali ne bodo; kajti nespamet njihova bode vsem očita, kakor je bila tudi onih. 
[3:10] Ti pa si hodil za menoj v uku, vedenji, nameri, veri, prizanesljivosti, ljubezni, stanovitnosti; 
[3:11] Preganjanjih, trpljenjih, kakošna so me zadela v Antijohiji, v Ikoniji, v Listrih; kakošna preganjanja sem prestal; in iz vsega me je otél Gospod. 
[3:12] Vsi pa tudi, kateri hoté pobožno živeti v Kristusu Jezusu, bodo preganjani. 
[3:13] Hudobni pa in sleparski ljudje bodo napredovali v slabem, varali bodo in varani. 
[3:14] Ti pa ostani v tem, česar si se učil in se preveril, vedóč, od koga si se učil; 
[3:15] In da od mladih nóg póznaš sveta pisma, zmožna modriti te v zveličanje po veri, ki je v Kristusu Jezusu. 
[3:16] Vsako pismo je od Boga navdihneno in koristno za uk, za svarjenje, za opominjanje, za vzrejo v pravici; 
[3:17] Da bode popoln človek Božji, pripraven za vsako dobro delo. 
[4:1] Rotim torej jaz pred Bogom in Gospodom Jezusom Kristusom, kateri bode kdaj sodil žive in mrtve po prihodu svojem in po kraljestvu svojem, 
[4:2] Razglašaj besedo, ne odjenjaj o priliki, nepriliki; svári, kaznuj, opominjaj v vsej potrpežljivosti in uku. 
[4:3] Kajti bode čas, ko ne bodo prenašali zdravega uka, nego po lastnem poželenji kopičili si učitelje, ker jih ušesa srbé. 
[4:4] In od resnice bodo odvračali ušesa in obračali se k basnim. 
[4:5] Ti pa bodi trezen v vsem, trpi, delo opravljaj evangelista, izpolnjuj službo svojo. 
[4:6] Kajti jaz bodem skoraj žrtvovan, in ločitve moje čas je blizu. 
[4:7] Bojeval sem lepi boj, dopolnil ték, ohranil vero; 
[4:8] Že mi je pripravljen venec pravice, katerega mi podelí Gospod tisti dan, pravični sodnik; ne pa meni samo, nego tudi vsem, kateri so ljubili prihod njegov. 
[4:9] Prizadeni si, da prideš skoraj k meni. 
[4:10] Kajti Dema me je zapustil iz ljubezni do tega sveta, in potoval je v Tesaloniko; Krescent v Galacijo, Tit v Dalmacijo; 
[4:11] Luka je sam pri meni. Marka vzemi in pripelji sè seboj, kajti koristen mi je za pomočnika. 
[4:12] Tihika pa sem poslal v Efez. 
[4:13] Plašč, ki sem ga pustil v Troadi pri Karpu, prinesi gredé, in knjige, zlasti pergamene. 
[4:14] Aleksander kovač mi je storil mnogo hudega; povrni mu Gospod po delih njegovih! 
[4:15] Njega se tudi tí pazi, ker silno nasprotuje besedam našim. 
[4:16] O prvem zagovarjanji mojem ni mi bilo nikogar na strani, nego vsi so me bili zapustili; naj se jim ne všteva! 
[4:17] Gospod pa mi je bil na pómoč in ojačil me, da se po meni zvrši oznanilo, in ga čujejo vsi pogani; in otét sem bil levu iz žrela. 
[4:18] In otél me bode Gospod vsakega hudega dela in rešil v kraljestvo svoje nebeško; njemu slava na vekov veke! Amen. 
[4:19] Pozdravi Prisko in Akvilo, in Onezifora hišo. 
[4:20] Erast je ostal v Korintu; Trofima pa sem pustil bolnega v Miletu. 
[4:21] Prizadeni si, da prideš pred zimo. Pozdravlja te Evbúl in Pudent in Lin in Klavdija in bratje vsi. 
[4:22] Gospod Jezus Kristus z duhom tvojim! Milost z vami! Amen.  Timoteju list drugi, prvemu glavarju izvoljenemu občine Efežanske, pisan iz Rima, ko je bil Pavel v drugič pred cesarjem Neronom. 

### Titus

[1:1] Pavel hlapec Božji in apostelj Jezusa Kristusa, po veri izvoljenih Božjih in spoznanji resnice po pobožnosti; 
[1:2] Na zaupanje večnega življenja, katero je obljubil Bog resnični pred večnimi časi; 
[1:3] A o svojem času je razodel besedo svojo v naznanilu, katero je bilo meni izročeno po povelji rešitelja našega, Boga: 
[1:4] Titu, pravemu detetu po družni veri, milost, usmiljenje, mir od Boga očeta in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa rešitelja našega! 
[1:5] Za to sem te pustil v Kreti, da popraviš pomanjkljivo, in nastaviš po mestu starejšine, kakor sem ti jaz ukazal; 
[1:6] Če je kdo neoponosen, ene žene mož, otroke imajoč verne, ki niso na glasu razuzdanosti, ali nepokorni. 
[1:7] Vladika namreč bodi neoponosen, kakor oskrbnik Božji, ne samovšečen, ne nagle jeze, ne pijanec, ne pretepalec, ne grdega zaslužka; 
[1:8] Nego gostoljuben, dobrega prijatelj, zmeren, pravičen, svet, zdržen, 
[1:9] Držeč se verne besede po uku, da bode zmožen tudi opominjati v zdravem uku, in izpodbijati nasproti govoreče. 
[1:10] Kajii mnogo je trdovratnih blebetačev in sleparjev, zlasti iz obreze, katerim je treba usta zamašiti; kateri cele hiše narobe obračajo, učeč, česar bi ne smeli, za grd dobiček. 
[1:11] Rekel je nekdo izmed njih, lasten njih prorok: "Kréčani vedno lažniki, grde zveri, leni trebuhi." 
[1:12] To pričalo je resnično; zatorej jih svári osorno, da bodejo zdravi v veri, 
[1:13] Ne poslušajoč basni judovskih in ukazov ljudî, ki se obračajo od resnice. 
[1:14] Vse je čisto čistim; oskrunjenim pa in nevernim ni nič čisto; nego oskrunila sta se jim um in vest. 
[1:15] Boga pravijo da poznajo, v delih pa ga zatajujejo, ker so ljudje ostudni in nepokorni in za vsako dobro delo malo pridni. 
[1:16] 
[2:1] Ti pa govórí, kar se spodobi zdravemu uku: 
[2:2] Da starci bodijo trezni, spodobni, zmerni, zdravi v veri, ljubezni, stanovitnosti; 
[2:3] Starke enako v vedenji, kakor se svetim spodobi, ne obrekljive, ne mnogemu vinu vdane, dobrega učiteljice, 
[2:4] Da svaré mlajše ženske, naj ljubijo može in otroke, 
[2:5] Spodobne bodo, čiste, dobre gospodinje, blagovoljne, pokorne svojim možém, da se ne preklinja Božja beseda. 
[2:6] Mlajše moške isto tako opominjaj, da naj bodo zmerni; 
[2:7] Stavi se vsem za zgled dobrih dél, v uku nopopačenost, dostojnost, zdravo besedo, neoporečno, 
[2:8] Da se nasprotnik osramoti, ker nima kaj slabega reči o vas. 
[2:9] Hlapci naj bodo pokorni svojim gospodom, v vsem ugodni, naj ne odgovarjajo, 
[2:10] Ne izmikajo, nego kažejo sleherno dobro zvestobo, da uk rešitelja našega Boga lepšajo v vsem. 
[2:11] Kajti prikazala se je milost Božja rešilna vsem ljudém, 
[2:12] Opominjajoč nas, da zatajivši brezbožnost in posvetno poželenje zmerno in pravično in pobožno živimo na tem svetu, 
[2:13] Čakajoč blaženega upanja in prikazni slave velikega Boga in zveličarja našega Jezusa Kristusa, 
[2:14] Kateri se je dal za nas, da bi nas rešil sleherne nepostavnosti in posvétil sebi za izbrano ljudstvo, goreče za vsa dobra dela. 
[2:15] Tako govóri in opominjaj in svári z vsem poudarkom! Nihče naj te ne zaničuje! 
[3:1] Opominjaj jih, da hodijo pokorni poglavarstvom in oblastim, poslušni, pripravljeni na vsako dobro delo; 
[3:2] Nikogar naj ne preklinjajo, naj ne bodo prepirčni, nego odjenljivi, kažejo naj sleherno krotkost proti vsem ljudém. 
[3:3] Bili smo namreč tudi mi nekdaj nespametni, neposlušni, tavajoči, služeči mnogoteremu poželenju in razveseljevanju, živeči v hudobnosti in nevoščljivosti, sovraštva vredni, sovražeč se med seboj; 
[3:4] Ko se je pa prikazala dobrota in ljudoljubnost rešitelja našega, Boga, 
[3:5] Rešil je nas, ne iz del v pravičnosti, katera smo mi storili, nego po usmiljenji svojem, po kopelji prerodbe in ponovljenja Duha svetega, 
[3:6] Katerega je obilo razlil nad nas po Jezusu Kristusu, rešitelji našem, 
[3:7] Da bi, opravičeni po milosti njegovi, dediči postali poleg upanja večnega življenja. 
[3:8] Resnična je beseda, in to hočem da potrdiš, da bode verujočim v Boga skrb dobra dela doprinašati; to je dobro in koristno ljudém. 
[3:9] Abotnih pa pregovarjanj in rodopisov in prepirov in bojev o postavi ogiblji se; brez koristi so namreč in veljave. 
[3:10] Strankarskega človeka odvrni, posvarivši ga enkrat in dvakrat, 
[3:11] Vedóč, da je ták popačen, in greši, so kam sebe obsoja. 
[3:12] Kader pošljem Artema k tebi ali Tihika, prizadeni si, da prideš k meni v Nikopolj; tam namreč sem prezimiti sklenil. 
[3:13] Zena postavouka in Apola pridno spremi, da ničesar ne pogrešata. 
[3:14] Učé se naj pa tudi naši dobra dela doprinašati za silne potrebe, da ne bodo brez sadú. 
[3:15] Pozdravljajo te vsi pri meni. Pozdravi njé, ki nas ljubijo v veri. Milost z vami vsemi! Amen.  Titu, občine krečanske prvemu izvoljenemu glavarju, pisano iz Nikopolja v Macedoniji. 

### Philemon

[1:1] Pavel jetnik Kristusa Jezusa in Timotej brat, Filemonu ljubljenemu in sodelalcu našemu, 
[1:2] In Afiji ljubljeni in Arhipu sovojaku našemu in občini v hiši tvoji: 
[1:3] Milost vam in mir od Boga očeta našega in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa! 
[1:4] Zahvaljujem se Bogu svojemu, vedno spominjajoč se tebe v molitvah svojih, 
[1:5] Ker slišim o ljubezni tvoji in veri, katero imaš do Gospoda Jezusa in do vseh svetih, 
[1:6] Da vkupnost vere tvoje krepka postane v spoznanji vsega dobrega, katero je v vas za Kristusa Jezusa. 
[1:7] Kajti veliko radost imamo in tolažbo zaradi ljubezni tvoje, ker so osrčja svetih poživila se po tebi, brat. 
[1:8] Zato, dasí imam veliko zaupanje v Kristusu ukazati ti, kar je spodobno, 
[1:9] Prosim te raji zaradi ljubezni, tak, kakoršen Pavel stari, sedaj pa tudi jetnik Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:10] Prosim te za dete svoje, katéro sem rodil v sponah svojih, Onezima, 
[1:11] Tebi nekdaj nekoristnega, sedaj pa tebi in meni koristnega, katerega sem nazaj poslal; 
[1:12] Ti pa ga, to je osrčje moje, sprejmi! 
[1:13] Jaz bi ga bil rad ohranil pri sebi, da bi mi na mesti tebe služil v sponah evangelja; 
[1:14] A brez mnenja tvojega nisem hotel nič storiti, da dobrota tvoja ne bode kakor po sili, nego prostovoljna. 
[1:15] Kajti lahko da je bil zato nekaj časa ločen od tebe, da bi ga imel vekomaj; 
[1:16] Ne več za hlapca, nego nad hlapca, brata ljubljenega, sosebno meni, kolikanj bolj pa tebi, v mesu in v Gospodu. 
[1:17] Ako imaš torej mene za tovariša, sprejmi ga kakor mene. 
[1:18] Če ti je pa kaj žalega storil ali je dolžan, tisto meni vštej; 
[1:19] Jaz Pavel pišem sè svojo roko, jaz bodem plačal; da ti ne rečem, da si mi tudi še samega sebe dolžán. 
[1:20] Dà, brat, da bi jaz imel korist od tebe v Gospodu! Poživi osrčje moje v Gospodu! 
[1:21] Zaupajoč v pokorščino tvojo pišem ti, vedoč, da bodeš še več storil nego pravim. 
[1:22] Zraven pa pripravi mi tudi prenočišče. Kajti upam, da vam bodem podarjen po molitvah vaših. 
[1:23] Pozdravljajo vas Epafra, sojetnik moj v Kristusu Jezusu, Mark, Aristarh, Dema, Luka, sodelalci moji. 
[1:24] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z duhom vašim! Amen.   Filomenu pisano iz Rima po Onezimu hišniku. 
[1:25] 

### Hebrews

[1:1] Potem ko je Bog nekdaj mnogokratno in mnogolično očetom govoril v prerokih, govoril nam je o teh zadnjih dnevih v sinu, 
[1:2] Katerega je postavil za dediča vseh stvari, po katerem je tudi svetove naredil, 
[1:3] Kateri, odsvit slave in značaj bitja njegovega, in vse noseč z besedo moči svoje, po sebi storivši očiščenje grehov naših, sédel je na desnico veličastva v višavah, 
[1:4] In je tolikanj boljši postal od angelov, kolikor odličneje ime je dobil mimo njih. 
[1:5] Kajti kateremu je rekel izmed angelov: "Sin moj si ti, jaz sem te danes rodil?" In zopet: "Jaz mu bodem za očeta, in on mi bode za sina?" 
[1:6] In ko bode zopet prvorojenca vpeljal v svet, pravi: "In molijo ga naj vsi angeli Božji." 
[1:7] In angelom pravi: "On, ki dela angele svoje za vetrove in služabnike svoje za ognja plamen." 
[1:8] In sinu: "Prestol tvoj, o Bog, na veka vek. Pravičnosti žezlo je kraljestva tvojega žezlo. 
[1:9] Ljubil si pravico in sovražil nepostavnost. Zato te je pomazilil Bog, Bog tvoj, z radosti oljem pred tovariši tvojimi." 
[1:10] In: "Ti si s konca, Gospod, ustanovil zemljo, in rok tvojih dela so nebesa; 
[1:11] Njih bode konec, ti pa ostaneš; in vsa se bodo postarala kakor obleka, 
[1:12] In kakor plašč jih bodeš zvil, in izpremenila se bodo; ti pa si isti, in let tvojih ne bode konec." 
[1:13] Kateremu pa izmed angelov je rekel kdaj: "Sédi na desno meni, dokler ne položim sovražnikov tvojih za podnožje nogam tvojim?" 
[1:14] Niso li vsi služabni duhovi, v službo pošiljani za nje, ki imajo podedovati zveličanje? 
[2:1] Zato nam je treba tolikanj bolj paziti na to, kar smo slišali, da nam ne uide. 
[2:2] Če je namreč beseda po angelih govorjena postala gotova, in je vsak prestopek in neposluh dobil zasluženo plačilo, 
[2:3] Kako uidemo mi, v nemar pustivši toliko blaginjo, katero je s konca oznanil Gospod, a oni, ki so jo čuli, potrdili so jo do nas; 
[2:4] Zraven pa je Bog pričal sè znamenji in čudeži, in mnogoterimi močmi, in svetega Duha podeljevanjih, po volji svoji. 
[2:5] Kajti ni angelom podložil sveta prihodnjega, o katerem govorimo; 
[2:6] Pričal pa je nekdo nekjé, govoreč: "Kaj je človek, da se ga spominjaš, ali sin človekov, da ga obiskuješ? 
[2:7] Za malo časa si ga ponižal pod angele: sè slavo in častjo si ga venčal, in postavil si ga nad dela rok svojih; 
[2:8] Vse si podložil pod noge njegove." Kajti podloživši mu vse, ni pustil ničesar ne podloženega mu; sedaj pa ne vidimo še, da bi mu bilo vse podloženo. 
[2:9] Njega pa, ki je za malo časa ponižan pod angele, gledamo Jezusa, po trpljenji smrtnem, sè slavo in častjo venčanega, da po milosti Božji okusi smrt za vse. 
[2:10] Kajti spodobilo se mu je, za katerega je vse in po katerem je vse, ko je mnogo sinov v slavo peljal, početnika njih zveličanja popolniti s trpljenjem. 
[2:11] Kajti posvečujoči in posvečeni so iz enega vsi; za to se ne sramuje imenovati jih brate, govoreč: 
[2:12] Oznanjal bodem ime tvoje bratom svojim, sredi občine bodem ti prepeval." 
[2:13] In zopet: "Jaz mu bodem zaupal." in zopet: "Glej, jaz in otročiči, katere mi je Bog dal." 
[2:14] Ker so torej otročiči udeležili se mesa in krvi, je tudi enako udeležil se njih, da bi sè smrtjo uničil njega, ki je imel smrti moč, to je: hudiča, 
[2:15] In rešil tiste, kateri so v strahu smrti v vsem življenji bili v sužnjosti sponah. 
[2:16] Saj se pač ne poteza za angele, nego za seme Abramovo se poteza. 
[2:17] Zato se je moral v vsem enacega storiti bratom, da postane usmiljen in zvest višji duhovnik pred Bogom, da poravná ljudstva grehe. 
[2:18] Kajti v kolikor je sam trpel in izkušen bil, more pomagati izkušanim. 
[3:1] Zatorej, bratje sveti, poklica nebeškega deležni, ozirajte se v poslanca in višjega duhovnika spoznanja našega, Kristusa Jezusa; 
[3:2] Kateri je zvest njemu, ki ga je naredil, kakor tudi Mojzes v vsej hiši njegovi. 
[3:3] Večje slave namreč je bil ta za vrednega spoznan mimo Mojzesa, potem kakor ima večjo čast od hiše on, ki jo je napravil; 
[3:4] Kajti vsako hišo napravi kdo; on pa, ki je vse naredil, je Bog. 
[3:5] In Mojzes je bil zvest v vsej hiši njegovi, kakor služabnik v pričanje tistega, kar se je imelo oznanjati; 
[3:6] Kristus pa, kakor sin čez hišo svojo; katerega hiša smo mi, ako zaupanje in slavo upanja ohranimo trdno do konca. 
[3:7] Zatorej (kakor govori Duh sveti: "Danes, ko začujete glas njegov, 
[3:8] Ne odrevenite src svojih, kakor o razdražbi, o dnevi izkušnjave v puščavi, 
[3:9] Kjer so me izkušali očetje vaši, presojali me in videli dela moja štirideset let; 
[3:10] Zato sem se razsrdil nad onim rodom in rekel: "Vedno tavajo v srci, oni pa niso spoznali potov mojih; 
[3:11] Tako da sem prisegel v jezi svoji: Ne vnidejo v pokoj moj.") 
[3:12] Glejte, bratje, da ne bode v kom izmed vas hudobnega srca nevere, da odpade od Boga živega; 
[3:13] Nego opominjajte se vsak dan, dokler se še kliče "danes", da se ne odreveni kdo izmed vas v zmoti greha; 
[3:14] Kajti deležni smo postali Kristusa, ako le začetek zaupanja trdno ohranimo do konca; 
[3:15] V tem, ko pravi: "Danes, ko začujete glas njegov, ne odrevenite src svojih, kakor o razdražbi." 
[3:16] Kajti nekateri so slišali in razdražili se, a ne vsi, kateri so bili izšli iz Egipta po Mojzesu. 
[3:17] Nad katerimi pa se je srdil štirideset let? Ne nad njimi, ki so bili grešili, katerim so udje pali v puščavi? 
[3:18] Katerim pa je prisegel, da ne vnidejo v pokoj njegov, če ne njim, kateri so bili nepokorni? 
[3:19] In vidimo, da niso mogli vniti zaradi nevere. 
[4:1] Bojmo se torej, da se, ko je še ostala obljuba vniti v pokoj njegov, ne vidi, da je kdo izmed vas zaostal. 
[4:2] Kajti obljubo smo prejeli, kakor tudi oni; ali onim ni pomagala slišana beseda, ker ni bila pridružena veri njim, ki so slišali. 
[4:3] Kajti v pokoj vnidemo kateri smo verovali, kakor je rekel: "Da sem prisegel v jezi svoji: Ne vnidejo v pokoj moj," dasì so dela zvršena bila od ustanove svetá. 
[4:4] Kajti rekel je nekje o sedmem dnevi tako: "In počival je Bog sedmi dan od vseh dél svojih." 
[4:5] In v tem zopet: "Ne vnidejo v pokoj moj." 
[4:6] Ker je torej še pričakovati, da vnidejo nekateri vanj, in oni, kateri so prej obljubo prejeli, niso prišli noter zaradi nepokorščine, 
[4:7] Stavi zopet, neki dan: "Danes" v Davidu govoreč, čez toliko časa, kakor jo rečeno: "Danes, ko začujete glas njegov, ne odrevenite src svojih." 
[4:8] Kajti ako bi jih bil Jezus upokojil, ne bi potem govoril o drugem dnevi; 
[4:9] Torej čaka sobotni počitek ljudstva Božjega. 
[4:10] Kajti on, ki je prišel v pokoj njegov, počiva tudi sam od svojih dél, kakor od lastnih Bog. 
[4:11] Glejmo torej, da vnidemo v ón pokoj, da ne pade kdo v enakem zgledu nepokorščine. 
[4:12] Živa je namreč beseda Božja, in krepka in ostrejša nego vsak dvorezen meč in pridere noter do ločitve duše in duha, členovja in mozga, in je sodnik naklepov in misli srčnih; 
[4:13] In stvari ni skrite pred njim; vse pa je golo in razodeto očem njega, s katerim imamo opravek. 
[4:14] Ker imamo torej višjega duhovnika velikega, ki je prehodil nebesa, Jezusa sina Božjega, držímo se spoznanja. 
[4:15] Kajti nimamo višjega duhovnika, kateri bi ne mogel z nami trpeti slabosti naših, nego izkušanega v vsem enako razen greha. 
[4:16] Bližajmo se torej zaupno prestolu milosti, da zadobimo usmiljenje in najdemo milost za pravočasno pomoč. 
[5:1] Kajti vsak višji duhovnik, kateri se jemlje izmed ljudî, postavlja se za ljudî, kar se tiče Boga, da prinaša darila in žrtve za grehe; 
[5:2] Kateri more potrpljenje imeti z nevednimi in tavajočimi, ker tudi njega se drži slabost; 
[5:3] In zaradi té mora, kakor za ljudstvo, tako tudi zase darovati za grehe. 
[5:4] In zase ne jemlje nihče časti, nego kogar Bog pokliče, kakor tudi Aron. 
[5:5] Tako tudi Kristus ni sebe poslavil, da je postal višji duhovnik, nego on, ki mu je govoril: "Sin moj si ti, jaz sem te danes rodil." 
[5:6] Kakor tudi drugjé pravi: "Ti, si duhovnik na vek po redu Melhizedekovem." 
[5:7] On je o dnevih mesa svojega prošnje in molitve z vpitjem silnim in solzami prinašal do njega, ki ga je mogel oteti smrti, in je uslišan in rešen bil iz groze, 
[5:8] In je, dasì sin, učil se po trpljenji pokorščine; 
[5:9] In popolnjen je postal njim vsem, ki so mu poslušni, večnega zveličanja začetnik; 
[5:10] Katerega je Bog imenoval višjega duhovnika po redu Melhizedekovem. 
[5:11] O tem nam je mnogo govoriti in kar je težko pojasniti, ker ste počasni postali na sluhu. 
[5:12] Kajti ko bi morali učitelji biti s časom, vas je zopet treba učiti, katere so začetne prvine izrekov Božjih, in postali ste mleka potrebni, in ne trde hrane. 
[5:13] Kajti vsak, kdor mleka dobiva, nevešč je besede pravice; kajti dete je; 
[5:14] Popolnih pa je trda hrana, njih, ki imajo po izkušnji počutke vajene za razločitev dobrega in hudega. 
[6:1] Zato pustivši začetno besedo Kristusovo obrnimo se k popolnosti, da ne polagamo zopet podstave kesanja od mrtvih dél in vere v Boga, 
[6:2] Učnih krstov in pokladanj rók in vstajanja mrtvih in večne sodbe. 
[6:3] In to bodemo storili, ako le Bog privoli. 
[6:4] Kajti nemogoče je one, kateri so bili enkrat razsvetljeni in so okusili dar nebeški in deležni postali Duha svetega, 
[6:5] In okusili lepo besedo Božjo, in prihodnjega življenja moči, 
[6:6] In so odpadli, zopet ponoviti v kesanje, ker zase zopet križajo sina Božjega in zasramujejo. 
[6:7] Kajti zemlja, katera je pila dež, ki često nanjo pada, in rodeva koristno zélišče njim, za katere se tudi obdeljuje, dobiva blagoslov od Boga. 
[6:8] Ako pa rodeva trnje in osat, malopridna je in prokletju blizu, katere konec je sežganje. 
[6:9] Prepričani pa smo za vas, ljubljeni, boljšega in k zveličanju vodéčega, če tudi tako govorimo. 
[6:10] Kajti Bog ni krivičen, da bi pozabil dela vašega, in truda ljubezni, katero ste izkazali v imé njegovo, ker ste stregli svetim in še strežete. 
[6:11] Želimo pa, da naj vsak izmed vas kaže isto gorečnost v izpolnitev upanja noter do konca, 
[6:12] Da ne postanete leni, nego posnemalci njih, ki z vero in stanovitnostjo zadobivajo obljube. 
[6:13] Kajti ko je bil Bog Abrahamu obljubil, prisegel je, ker ni imel pri kom večjem priseči, pri sebi samem, govoreč: 
[6:14] "Resnično, blagosloveč te bodem blagoslovil in množeč te bodem množil." 
[6:15] In tako je po stanovitnosti zadobil obljubo. 
[6:16] Ljudje namreč prisezajo pri večjem, in vse oporeke konec jim je v potrjenje prisega; 
[6:17] Zato je Bog, hoteč tolikanj bolj dedičem obljube pokazati neizpremenljivost sklepa svojega, posredoval s prisego, 
[6:18] Da bi po dveh nespremenljivih rečéh, v katerih ni mogoče, da bi bil Bog lagal, imeli krepko tolažilo kateri pribegamo poprijet se ponujanega tipanja, 
[6:19] Katero imamo kakor gotovo in trdno sidro duše, in katero prodira do znotraj pregrinjala, 
[6:20] Kamor je predhodnik za nas vstopil Jezus, postavši po redu Melhizedekovem višji duhovnik na vekomaj. 
[7:1] Kajti ta Melhizedek, kralj Salemski, duhovnik Boga najvišjega, kateri je bil naproti prišel Abrahamu vračajočemu se z boja kraljev, in blagoslovil ga, 
[7:2] Kateremu je tudi Abraham desetino podelil od vsega, (najprej tolmačen kralj pravice, potem pa tudi kralj Salemski, to je kralj mirú), 
[7:3] Brez očeta, brez matere, brez rodopisa, ne imajoč ne začetka življenja ne konca, nego prispodobljen sinu Božjemu ostane duhovnik za vedno. 
[7:4] Vidite pa, kolik je tá, kateremu je tudi desetíno dal od prvotnega plena Abraham očák. 
[7:5] In oni izmed sinov Levijevih, kateri prejemajo duhovništvo, imajo povelje odesetiniti ljudstvo po postavi; to je, brate svoje, dasì so izšli iz Abrahamovega ledja; 
[7:6] On pa, ki ne izhaja iz njih rodú, odesetinil je Abrahama, in blagoslovil je njega, ki je imel obljube; 
[7:7] A brez vsakega ugovora močnejše blagoslavlja slabše. 
[7:8] In tukaj jemljejo umrjoči ljudje desetine, tam pa on, za katerega se priča, da živi. 
[7:9] In, tako rekoč, po Abrahamu je bil tudi Levi, ki desetine prejema, odesetinjen; 
[7:10] Kajti še je bil v očetovih ledjah, ko mu je naproti prišel Melhizedek. 
[7:11] Če je bilo torej popolnjenje po Levijevem duhovništvu (ljudstvo namreč je na njegovi podlogi postavo prejelo), kaj še treba, da, "po redu Melhizedekovem" vstane drug duhovnik in se ne imenuje po redu Aronovem? 
[7:12] Kajti če se premení duhovništvo, treba da nastane tudi postave premena. 
[7:13] Za katerega se namreč to pravi, družnik je druzega rodú, iz katerega ni nobeden opravka imel z oltarjem. 
[7:14] Kajti znano je, da je iz Jude rodil se Gospod naš, za kateri rod ni Mojzes ničesar govoril o duhovništvu. 
[7:15] In še bolj znano je, če vstane po podobi Melhizedekovi drug duhovnik, 
[7:16] Kateri ni postal po postavi mesne zapovedi, nego po moči neminljivega življenja: 
[7:17] Priča namreč: "Ti si duhovnik na vek po redu Melhizedekovem. 
[7:18] Zgodí se namreč prejšnje zapovedi odprava, ker je bila nejaka in nekoristna; 
[7:19] Kajti ničesar ni popolnila postava, vpeljava pa boljšega upanja, po katerem se bližamo Bogu. 
[7:20] In v kolikor ne brez prisege, 
[7:21] (Oni namreč so duhovniki postali brez prisege; ta pa s prisego po njem, ki mu govori: "Prisegel je Gospod in ne bode se kesal, ti si duhovnik na vek po redu Melhizedekovem"), 
[7:22] Tolikanj boljše zaveze porok je postal Jezus. 
[7:23] In onih je več postalo duhovnikov, ker jim je smrt branila ostati; 
[7:24] Ta pa, ker ostane na vek, ima duhovništvo nepremenljivo; 
[7:25] Zato more tudi popolnem rešiti nje, kateri se po njem bližajo Bogu, ker vedno živi, da se potegne zanje. 
[7:26] Kajti tak višji duhovnik se nam je spodobil, svet, nedolžen, neoskrunjen, izločen od grešnikov in vzvišen nad nebesa, 
[7:27] Kateremu ni vsak dan potreba, kakor višjim duhovnikom, darí darovati najprej za svoje, potem za ljudstva grehe. Kajti to je storil enkrat za vselej, ko je sebe daroval. 
[7:28] Postava namreč stavi ljudî za višje duhovnike, imajoče slabost; beseda prisege pa poleg postave sina popolnjenega vekomaj. 
[8:1] Poglavitno pa pri tem, kar pravimo: višjega duhovnika imamo takega, kateri sedí na desnici prestola veličastva v nebesih; 
[8:2] Oskrbnik svetišča in šatora pravega, katerega je postavil Gospod in ne človek. 
[8:3] Kajti vsak višji duhovnik se postavlja, da prinaša darí in žrtve, zato je potreba, da ima tudi tá kaj, kar bi prinašal. 
[8:4] Ako bi namreč bil na zemlji, še duhovnik bi ne bil, ker so duhovniki, da dari darujejo po postavi, 
[8:5] Kateri služijo po podobi in senci stvarî nebeških, kakor je Mojzes ukaz prejel, ko je napravljal šator: "Glej", pravi namreč, "da narediš vse po zgledu pokazanem ti na gori.. 
[8:6] Sedaj pa je dobil odličnejšo službo, za kolikor je tudi boljše zaveze srednik, katera je ustanovljena na boljših obljubah. 
[8:7] Ako bi bila namreč ona prva bila brez pogreška, ne bi se iskalo drugi mesto. 
[8:8] Kajti grajajoč jim pravi: "Glej, dnevi pridejo, govori Gospod, in s hišo Izraelovo in s hišo Judovo sklenem novo zavezo; 
[8:9] Ne po zavezi, katero sem storil z njih očeti, tisti dan, ko sem zgrabil njih roko, da bi jih izpeljal iz zemlje Egiptovske; ker oni niso ostali v zavezi moji, in jaz sem jih v nemar pustil, govori Gospod; 
[8:10] Ker to je zaveza, katero bodem sklenil s hišo Izraelovo, po tistih dnevih, govori Gospod: Postave svoje dam v njih misli, in v srca njih jih zapišem; in bodem jim za Boga, in oni mi bodejo za ljudstvo. 
[8:11] In ne učé naj vsak svojega bližnjega, in vsak svojega brata, rekoč: Spoznavaj Gospoda; ker poznali me bodo vsi, od njih malega do njih velikega; 
[8:12] Ker milosten bodem njih krivicam, in njih grehov in pregreškov njih ne bodem se več spominjal." 
[8:13] Ker pravi: "Novo," ostaral je prvo; kar pa je ostarano in se stara, je skoraj minilo. 
[9:1] Imel je pač tudi prvi šator pravice službe Božje in posvetno svetišče. 
[9:2] Šator namreč je bil napravljen prvi, v katerem je bil svečnik in miza in razpostava kruhov; kateri se imenuje Sveti. 
[9:3] Za drugim pa zagrinjalom šator imenovani: Najsvetejši, 
[9:4] Imajoč zlato kadilnico in skrinjo zaveze, od vseh strani zlatom okovano, v kateri zlati vrč z mano, in palica Aronova zeleneča, in ploče zaveze; 
[9:5] Nad njo pa Kerubi slave, obsenčujoči pokrov sprave, o čemur ni sedaj govoriti na drobno. 
[9:6] Ker je torej to tako napravljeno, vhajajo v prvi šator vedno duhovniki službo opravljat; 
[9:7] V druzega pa enkrat na leto sam višji duhovnik, ne brez krvi, katero daruje záse in za ljudstva pregreške; 
[9:8] Ker Duh sveti kaže to, da pot do svetišča ni še razodeta, dokler ima še stanje prvi šator; 
[9:9] Kateri je prilika za čas sedanji, v katerem se darujejo darovi in žrtve, ki ne morejo po zavesti popolniti službujočega, 
[9:10] Ker so samo z jedili vred in pijačami in različnim omivanjem in mesnimi navedbami do časa poprave naložene. 
[9:11] Kristus pa je prišel, višji duhovnik prihodnjih dobrót, in je šel skozi večji in popolnejši šator, ne z roko narejen, to je, ne tega stvarjenja, 
[9:12] Tudi ne po krvi kozlov in telét, nego po svoji krvi, enkrat za vselej v svetišče in je našel večno rešitev. 
[9:13] Kajti če bikov in kozlov in junice pepel, ki pokropi onečiščene, osvečuje za mesno čistost, 
[9:14] Kolikanj bolj bode kri Kristusa, kateri se je po Duhu večnem daroval brez madeža Bogu, očistila vest vašo mrtvih dél, da služite Bogu živemu? 
[9:15] In zato je nove zaveze srednik, da, ko se je zgodila smrt za rešenje grehov po prvi zavezi, poklicani obljubo zadobé večne dedščine. 
[9:16] Kajti kjer je oporoka, treba da se naznani smrt oporočnika; 
[9:17] Kajti oporoka je pri mrtvih veljavna, ker nikdar nima moči, kader živi oporočnik. 
[9:18] Zato se tudi prva ni ponovila brez krvi. 
[9:19] Ko je bil namreč Mojzes vsako zapoved po postavi oznanil vsemu ljudstvu, vzel je kri telét in kozlov z vodo in volno škarlatno in isopom, ter pokropil knjigo sámo in vse ljudstvo, govoreč: 
[9:20] "To je kri zaveze, katero je Bog vam zapovedal." 
[9:21] In tudi šator in vse orodje službe Božje pokropil je enako s krvjo. 
[9:22] In skoraj se vse očisti v krvi po postavi, in brez prelivanja krvi ne zgodí se odpuščenje. 
[9:23] Potrebno je torej, da se podobe nebeških stvarî s tem očiščajo, nebeške stvari same pa z boljšimi žrtvami mimo téh. 
[9:24] Kajti Kristus ni šel v svetišče z roko narejeno, podobo pravega, nego v samo nebo, prikazat se sedaj obličju Božjemu za nas; 
[9:25] Tudi ne, samega sebe večkrat darovat, kakor višji duhovnik vhaja v svetišče vsako leto s tujo krvjo; 
[9:26] (Kajti večkrat bi bil moral trpeti od ustanove sveta), sedaj pa se je enkrat prikazal po žrtvi svoji na konci sveta v izbrisanje greha. 
[9:27] In v kolikor je človeku namenjeno enkrat umreti, po tem pa sodba, 
[9:28] Tako se bode tudi Kristus, ko se je enkrat daroval, da bi nosil mnogih grehe, vdrugič brez greha prikazal njim v zveličanje, kateri ga pričakujejo. 
[10:1] Kajti ker ima postava senco prihodnjih dobrot, ne prave podobe stvarî, ne more z vsako leto istimi žrtvami, katere vedno darujejo, nikdar popolniti prihajajočih. 
[10:2] Kajti konec bi bilo njih darovanja, ker bi službo opravljajoči, enkrat očiščeni, več ne imeli zavesti grehov; 
[10:3] Nego v njih je spomin grehov vsako leto; 
[10:4] Nemogoče je namreč, da bi kri bikov in kozlov odvzemala grehe. 
[10:5] Zato prihajajoč na svet govori: "Žrtve in darú nisi hotel, telo pa si mi pripravil; 
[10:6] Žgalne daritve in za grehe niso ti bile po volji. 
[10:7] Tedaj sem rekel: Glej, prišel sem (na čelu knjige je pisano zame), da storim, Bog, voljo tvojo. 
[10:8] Zgoraj govoreč: Žrtve in darú in žgalnih daritev in za grehe nisi hotel, in niso ti bile po volji", katere se darujejo po postavi, 
[10:9] Tedaj je rekel: Glej, prišel sem, da storim, o Bog, voljo tvojo." Prvo odpravlja, da postavi drugo, 
[10:10] V kateri volji smo osvečeni po daritvi telesa Jezusa Kristusa enkrat za vselej. 
[10:11] In vsak duhovnik stoji vsak dan službujóč in iste žrtve večkrat darujoč, katere nikdar ne morejo odvzeti grehov; 
[10:12] On pa, darovavši eno žrtev za grehe, sédel je za večno na desnico Božjo, 
[10:13] In čaka za naprej, da se položé sovražniki njegovi za podnožje nog njegovih. 
[10:14] Kajti z eno daritvijo je za vedno popolnil nje, ki se posvečujejo. 
[10:15] Priča nam pa tudi Duh sveti; ko je namreč prej rekel: 
[10:16] "To je zaveza, katero bodem sklenil z njimi po tistih dnevih," govori Gospod: "Postave svoje dam v njih srca, in v njih misli jih zapišem;" 
[10:17] "In njih grehov in pregreškov ne bodem se več spominjal." 
[10:18] Kjer je pa odpuščenje teh, ni več daritve za grehe. 
[10:19] Ker imamo torej, bratje, trdno zaupanje na vhod v svetišče v krvi Jezusovi, 
[10:20] Katerega nam je ponovil kakor novo in živo pot skozi zagrinjalo, to je: meso svoje, 
[10:21] In duhovnega velikega čez hišo Božjo: 
[10:22] Pristopimo z resničnim srcem v popolnosti vere, v srcih pokropljeni in očiščeni od slabe vesti; 
[10:23] In na telesu omiti s čisto vodo, hranimo stanovitno spoznanje upanja, (zvest namreč je on, ki je obljubil), 
[10:24] In opazujmo se med seboj v izpodbujo ljubezni in dobrih del, 
[10:25] Ne zapuščajoč zbora svojega, kakor je enim navada, nego opominjajoč; in tolikanj bolj, ker vidite, da se bliža dan. 
[10:26] Ako namreč prostovoljno grešimo, potem ko smo prejeli spoznanje resnice, ni več čakati žrtve za grehe; 
[10:27] Ampak neko strašno pričakovanje sodbe in gorečnost ognja, kateri bode razjedal nasprotujoče. 
[10:28] Kdor je prelomil postavo Mojzesovo, umre brez usmiljenja na dve ali tri priče: 
[10:29] Koliko hujšo, menite, kazen bode zaslužil, kdor je sina Božjega teptal in kri zaveze, v kateri je posvečen bil, za nesveto imel in grešil zoper Duha milosti? 
[10:30] Poznamo namreč njega, ki je rekel: "Meni maščevanje, jaz bodem povračeval, govori Gospod;" in zopet: "Gospod bode sodil ljudstvo svoje." 
[10:31] Strašno je pasti v roke Boga živega! 
[10:32] Spomnite se pa prejšnjih dnî, v katerih ste razsvetljeni mnogi boj trpljenj prebili; 
[10:33] Nekaj v sramoti in stiski na ogled postavljeni, nekaj ker ste tako živečim tovariši postali; 
[10:34] Kajti tudi sè sponami mojimi ste usmiljenje imeli in rop blaga svojega z veseljem trpeli, spoznajoč, da imate v sebi boljše blago v nebesih in stanovitno. 
[10:35] Ne metajte torej od sebe trdnega zaupanja svojega, katero ima plačilo veliko. 
[10:36] Kajti stanovitnosti vam je potreba, da storivši voljo Božjo zadobite obljubo. 
[10:37] "Kajti nekaj malege še, in pride on, ki ima priti, in ne bode se mudil." 
[10:38] "Pravični pa iz vere bode živel", in: "Ako odjenja, duši moji ne bode po volji." 
[10:39] Mi pa nismo izmed njih, ki se umikajo v pogubo, nego ki verujejo v zadobljenje življenja. 
[11:1] Vera pa je trdno pričakovanje tistega, kar se upa, dokaz stvarî, katere se ne vidijo. 
[11:2] V tej namreč so starejši pričanje prejeli. 
[11:3] Po veri umemo, da so svetovi osnovani bili po besedi Božji, tako da ni iz prikazujočega se postalo, kar je vidno. 
[11:4] Po veri je daroval Abelj Bogu boljšo žrtev mimo Kajna, po kateri je bil izpričan za pravičnega, ker je Bog sam pričal po darovih, in po njej se še o mrtvem govori. 
[11:5] Po veri je bil Enoh umaknen, da ni videl smrti "in ni ga bilo najti, ker ga je bil Bog umaknil." Kajti pred umaknenjem svojim dobil je pričanje, "da je Bogu po volji." 
[11:6] Brez vere pa je nemogoče biti po volji; kajti verovati je treba njemu, kateri se bliža Bogu, da je in da postane plačevalec njim, ki ga iščejo. 
[11:7] Po veri je napravil Noe, na povelje, za to, kar se ni še videlo, v strahu Božjem skrinjo v rešenje hiše svoje; po njej je obsodil svet, in je postal dedič pravice po veri. 
[11:8] Po veri je slušal Abraham poklican, naj izide v kraj, katerega je imel dobiti v dedščino, in izšel je ne vedoč, kam ide. 
[11:9] Po veri je bival v deželi obljube kakor tuji, stanujoč v šatorih z Izakom in Jakobom sodedičema iste obljube. 
[11:10] Kajti čakal je mesta imajočega podstave, katerega zidar in stvarnik je Bog. 
[11:11] Po veri je tudi sama Sara zadobila moč ustanoviti seme in rodila je, zunaj pravega časa starosti, ker je za zvestega imela njega, ki je bil obljubil. 
[11:12] Zato jih je tudi od enega, in to umrlega, rodilo se kakor zvezd na nebu po številu, in kakor peska ob bregu morja bez števila. 
[11:13] Poleg vere so umrli ti vsi, ko niso prejeli obljub; temuč videli so jih od daleč, in prepričani bili in pozdravili jih in spoznali, da so tujci in priseljenci na zemlji. 
[11:14] Kateri namreč tako govoré, naznanjajo, da iščejo domovine. 
[11:15] In ko bi se bili spominjali one, iz katere so bili izšli, imeli bi bili čas obrniti se; 
[11:16] Sedaj pa hrepené po boljši, to je, nebeški; zato se jih Bog ne sramuje imenovati se njih Boga; pripravil jim je namreč mesto. 
[11:17] Po veri je daroval Abraham Izaka izkušan, in edinorojenca je daroval on, ki je bil prejel obljube, kateremu se je govorilo: 
[11:18] "V Izaku se ti bode imenovalo seme;" 
[11:19] Ker je pomislil, da more Bog tudi od mrtvih zbujati, od koder ga je tudi po priliki odnesel. 
[11:20] Po veri o prihodnjosti je Izak blagoslovil Jakoba in Ezava. 
[11:21] Po veri je Jakob umirajoč blagoslovil slehernega izmed sinov Jožefovih in: "molil je na konci palice njegove." 
[11:22] Po veri je Jožef umirajoč spominjal se izhoda sinov Izraelovih in naročal za kosti svoje. 
[11:23] Po veri so Mojzesa rojenega roditelji skrivali tri mesece, ker so videli, da je dete zalo; in niso se bali ukaza kraljevega. 
[11:24] Po veri je Mojzes, ko je bil velik postal, branil se imenovan biti sin hčere Faraonove, 
[11:25] Ker je raji hotel zlo trpeti z ljudstvom Božjim, nego imeti začasen užitek od greha; 
[11:26] Ker je imel sramoto Kristusovo za večje bogastvo nad zaklade v Egiptu; kajti oziral se je v povračilo. 
[11:27] Po veri je zapustil Egipt, ne boječ se jeze kraljeve; stanoviten namreč je bil, kakor da bi videl nevidnega. 
[11:28] Po veri je napravil pasho in polivanje s krvjo, da bi moritelj ne dotaknil se njih prvorojencev. 
[11:29] Po veri so pregazili rudeče morje kakor po suhem; Egipčani pa poskusivši to bili so pogoltneni. 
[11:30] Po veri je palo zidovje Jerihovo, okroženo sedem dnî. 
[11:31] Po veri Rahab kurba ni poginila z nevernimi, sprejemši oglednike v miru. 
[11:32] In kaj še govorim? Časa namreč mi bode primanjkovalo, ko bi pripovedoval o Gedeonu, Baraku in Samsonu in Jeftaji, Davidu in Samuelu in prerokih; 
[11:33] Kateri so po veri zmagovali kraljestva, delali pravico, dobivali obljube, levom žrela našili; 
[11:34] Ognja moč gasili, meča osti ubežavali, od bolezni ozdravevali, junaki v vojski postajali, napade odbijali tujcev. 
[11:35] Žene so dobivale po vstajenji mrtve svoje; drugi pa so bili mučeni, in niso sprejemali oproščenja, da zadobé boljše vstajenje; 
[11:36] Drugi pa so poskusili zasramovanje in bičanje, in pa vezî in ječe; 
[11:37] Bili so kamenjani, razrezani, izkušani, umrli so v smrti z mečem; hodili so v ovčjih, v kozjih kožah, v potrebi, v stiskah in težavah; 
[11:38] (Njih ni bil vreden svet), po puščavah tavajoč in gorah in brlogih in podzemeljskih jamah. 
[11:39] In vsi ti, pričanje prejemši po veri, niso dobili obljube, 
[11:40] Ker je bil Bog nekaj boljšega pred videl za nas, da bi se ne popolnili brez nas. 
[12:1] Zato tudi mi torej, ker imamo tako silo prič okrog sebe, vrzimo raz sebe vsako breme in greh, ki nas lahko obdá, ter prebimo v stanovitnosti naloženi nam boj; 
[12:2] Ozirajoč se v začetnika in izpolnjevalca vere Jezusa, kateri je za namenjeno mu veselje križ pretrpel, ne meneč se za sramoto in sedel na desnico Božjega prestola. 
[12:3] Pomislite namreč njega, ki je toliko prestal od grešnikov nasprotovanja proti sebi, da ne omagata pešajoč v dušah svojih. 
[12:4] Še niste do krvi ustavljali se v boji z grehom, 
[12:5] In pozabili ste tolažbe, katera z vami kakor sè sinovi govori: "Sin moj, ne puščaj v nemar pokore Gospodove, in ne omaguj, ko te kara. 
[12:6] Kogar namreč ljubi, pokori Gospod, in šiba vsakega sina, kateri mu je po volji." 
[12:7] Ako trpite pokoro, kaže se vam Bog kakor otrokom; kajti kje je sin, katerega ne pokori oče? 
[12:8] Ako ste pa brez pokore, katere so deležni postali vsi, torej ste nezakonski otroci in ne sinovi. 
[12:9] Dalje: mesa svojega očete smo imeli za pokoritelje in bali smo se jih, ali ne bodemo mnogo bolj podložni očetu duhov ter živeli? 
[12:10] Kajti oni so nas pokorili za malo dnî, kakor se jim je ljubilo, tá pa v korist, da bodemo deležni svetosti njegove. 
[12:11] Vsaka pokora pa se za sedaj ne zdí prijetna, nego da boli, pozneje pa daje njim, ki jih je vadila, miropolni sad pravice. 
[12:12] Zato dvignite omahujoče roke in šibeča se kolena," 
[12:13] In "ravne tire delajte sè svojimi nogami," da se hromo ne izključi, nego ozdravi. 
[12:14] Iščite mirú z vsemi, in posvečevanja, brez katerega nihče ne bode videl Gospoda; 
[12:15] Pazite, da kdo ne zaostane za milostjo Božjo, da ne požene kaka bridkosti korenina in ne dela napotja, in jih mnogo ne oskruni; 
[12:16] Da ne bode kdo kurbir ali posvetnjak kakor Ezav, kateri je za eno jed prodal prvorojenstvo svoje; 
[12:17] Kajti veste, da je tudi, ko je pozneje hotel zadobiti blagoslov, zavržen bil; kajti kosanju ni našel mesta, da si ga je sè solzami iskal. 
[12:18] Kajti pristopili niste k dotakljivi gori in z ognjem goreči in oblačju in temi in nevihti, 
[12:19] In trombe donenju in glasu beséd, katerega poslušalci so se branili, da se jim pridene beseda; 
[12:20] (Niso namreč prenašali ukaza. "Če se tudi žival dotakne gore, bode kamenjena ali sè strelo pobita". 
[12:21] In, tako strašna je bila prikazen, Mojzes je rekel: V strahu sem in trepetu;) 
[12:22] Temuč pristopili ste h gori Sijonski in mestu Boga živega, Jeruzalemu nebeškemu, in mirijadam angelov, 
[12:23] Zboru in občini prvorojencev v nebesih zapisanih, in Bogu vseh sodniku, in duhovom pravičnih zveličanih, 
[12:24] In nove zaveze sredniku Jezusu, in krvi pokropljenja, boljše govoreči mimo Abelna. 
[12:25] Glejte, da se ne branite govorečega; če namreč oni niso ubežali, kateri so branili se ukazujočega na zemlji, veliko menj mi, ki se obračamo od njega, kateri je z nebes. 
[12:26] Glas njegov je zemljo potresel tedaj, sedaj pa je obljubil govoreč: "Še enkrat stresam jaz ne samo zemlje, nego tudi nebo". 
[12:27] Tisto: "še enkrat" pomeni premembo tistega, kar je bilo potreseno, kakor kaj narejenega; da ostane kar je nepotreseno. 
[12:28] Zato, prejemši kraljestvo nepotresno, imejmo hvaležnost, po kateri služimo po volji Bogu sè svetim strahom in grozo; 
[12:29] Kajti tudi "Bog naš je ogenj, ki pali". 
[13:1] Bratoljubje ostani. 
[13:2] Gostoljubnosti ne zabite! Z njo so namreč nevedoma nekateri sprejeli angele. 
[13:3] Spominjajte se jetnikov, kakor sojetniki; mučenih, kakor ste sami tudi v telesu. 
[13:4] Čestit bodi zakon pri vseh, in postelja neoskrunjena; kurbirje pa in prešestnike bode sodil Bog. 
[13:5] Srce nelakomno; zadovoljni s tem, kar je; kajti sam je rekel: "Ne odtegnem se ti in ne zapustim te." 
[13:6] Tako da zaupno govorimo: "Gospod mi je pomočnik, in ne bodem se bal, kaj mi bode storil človek." 
[13:7] Spominjajte se vodnikov svojih, kateri so vam oznanjali besedo Božjo; ozirajoč se v izhod njih življenja posnemajte vero. 
[13:8] Jezus Kristus je včeraj in danes isti in na veke. 
[13:9] Naukom mnogoterim in tujim ne dajte se motiti; kajti dobro je, da se srce pokrepča z milostjo, ne z jedmi, od katerih niso imeli prida, kateri so se z njimi pečali. 
[13:10] Imamo oltar, s katerega jesti ne smejo, kateri služijo šatoru; 
[13:11] Kajti katerih živali kri nosi višji duhovnik za grehe v svetišče, tistih trupla se sežigajo zunaj šatorišča; 
[13:12] Zato je tudi Jezus, da bi z lastno krvjo osvetil ljudstvo, trpel zunaj vrât. 
[13:13] Zatorej izidimo k njemu zunaj Šatorišča, noseč sramoto njegovo! 
[13:14] Nimamo namreč mesta tu stalnega, nego iščemo prihodnjega. 
[13:15] Po njem torej prinašajmo vedno hvalno daritev Bogu, to je "sad ustnic" pričajočih imenu njegovemu. 
[13:16] Dobrodelnosti pa in podeljevanja ne zabite; take namreč daritve so Bogu po volji. 
[13:17] Slušajte vodnike svoje in hodite za njimi, oni namreč čujejo za duše vaše, ker bodo odgovor dajali, da to veseli storé in ne zdihujoč; kajti nekoristno vam je to. 
[13:18] Molite za nas; kajti prepričani smo, da imamo dobro vest, ker hočemo lepo živeti v vsem. 
[13:19] Tolikanj bolj pa vas prosim delati to, da vam bodem hitreje vrnen. 
[13:20] Bog pa mirú, on, ki je od mrtvih nazaj pripeljal ovác pastirja vélikega v krvi večne zaveze, 
[13:21] Gospoda našega Jezusa, pripravi vas v slehernem dobrem delu, da delate voljo njegovo, in delaj v vas, kar je njemu po volji, po Jezusu Kristusu, kateremu slava na vekov veke! Amen. 
[13:22] Prosim pa vas, bratje, poslušajte besedo tolažbe; kajti v kratkem sem vam pisal. 
[13:23] Vedite, da je Timotej brat oproščen, s katerim, ako skoraj pride, vas bodem videl. 
[13:24] Pozdravite vse vodnike svoje in vse svete. Pozdravljajo vas oni iz Italije. 
[13:25] Milost z vami vsemi! Amen.  Hebrejcem pisano iz Italije po Timoteji. 

### James

[1:1] Jakob Boga in Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa hlapec, dvanajsterim rodom v raztrosu: zdravi! 
[1:2] Za vso radost vam bodi, bratje moji, ako ste padli v mnogotere izkušnjave, 
[1:3] Spoznavajoč, da izkušnja vere vaše nareja stanovitnost; 
[1:4] Stanovitnost pa imej delo popolno, da bodete popolni in dovršeni, v ničemur pogrešni. 
[1:5] Če pa ima kdo izmed vas premalo modrosti, prosi je naj od Boga, kateri vsem daje obilo, in nikomur ne oponaša; in dala se mu bode. 
[1:6] Prosi pa naj v veri, brez dvomljenja; kdor namreč dvomi, podoben je valu morskemu, ki ga veter goni in premetava. 
[1:7] Naj namreč ne misli tisti človek, da bode kaj dobil od Gospoda; 
[1:8] Mož omahljiv je nestanoviten na vseh potih svojih. 
[1:9] Ponaša pa naj se brat nizki v visokosti svoji; 
[1:10] Bogati pa v ponižnosti svoji, kajti minil bode kakor trave cvet. 
[1:11] Kajti vzšlo je solnce z vročino in posušilo je travo, in cvet njen je odpadel, in lepota lica njenega je izginila. Tako bode tudi bogatin zvenil na potih svojih. 
[1:12] Blagor možu, kateri prebije izkušnjavo; ker izkušen zadobode venec življenja, katerega je obljubil Gospod njim, ki ga ljubijo. 
[1:13] Nihče naj, izkušan, ne reče: Od Boga sem izkušan; kajti Bog je neizkušljiv v hudo, in sam ne izkuša nikogar. 
[1:14] Sleherni pa je izkušan, kogar lastna sla vleče in vabi; 
[1:15] Potem ko je sla izpočela, rodi pregreho, pregreha pa, ko je dovršena, rodí smrt. 
[1:16] Ne tavajte, bratje moji ljubljeni; 
[1:17] Vsak dober dar in vsako darilo popolno prihaja dol od očeta luči, pri katerem ni izpremembe ali osenčanja obrnitve. 
[1:18] Po volji svoji nas je rodil po besedi resnice, da bodimo neka prvina stvarî njegovih. 
[1:19] Zatorej, bratje moji ljubljeni, bodi vsak človek nagel v poslušanje, počasen v govorjenje, počasen v jezo; 
[1:20] Kajti jeza človekova ne dela pravice Božje. 
[1:21] Zato odloživši sleherno nesnago in obilost hudobije sprejmite v krotkosti vsajeno besedo, ki more rešiti duše vaše. 
[1:22] Bodite pa delalci besede in ne samo poslušalci, ki se sami slepé. 
[1:23] Ker če je kdo poslušalec besede, ne pa delalec, on je podoben možu, ki ogleduje v ogledalu rojstva svojega obličje; 
[1:24] Pogledal se je namreč in odšel, in hitro je pozabil, kakošen je bil. 
[1:25] Kdor pa je pogledal v popolno postavo svobode in v njej ostal on, ki ni postal pozabljiv poslušalec nego delalec dela, on bode srečen v dejanji svojem. 
[1:26] Če meni kdo med vami, da je bogaboječ, pa ne brzda jezika svojega, nego vara svoje srce, njegova bogaboječnost je ničeva. 
[1:27] Bogaboječnost čista in neoskrunjena pred Bogom in očetom je ta, skrbeti za sirote in vdove v njih stiski, neomadeževanega se braniti od sveta. 
[2:1] Bratje moji, ne imejte v licegledji vere našega Gospoda slave, Jezusa Kristusa. 
[2:2] Če namreč v zbor vaš vnide mož sè zlatimi prstani, v sijajni obleki, vnide pa tudi berač v umazani obleki, 
[2:3] In pogledate njega, ki ima sijajno obleko, in mu rečete: Ti sédí sem lepo, in beraču rečete: Ti stoj tam, ali pa sedí sem pod podnožje moje; 
[2:4] Ali niste dvomili v sebi in ste postali sodniki slabih misli? 
[2:5] Čujte, bratje moji ljubljeni: ni li Bog izbral beračev tega sveta bogatih v veri in dedičev kraljestva, katerega je obljubil njim, ki ga ljubijo. 
[2:6] Vi pa ste zaničevali berača. Ali vas ne zatirajo bogatini, in oni vas vlačijo pred sodbe? 
[2:7] Ali ne preklinjajo oni lepega imena, katero se vam prideva? 
[2:8] Če pa izpolnjujete kraljevo postavo, po pismu: "Ljubi bližnjega svojega kakor sebe," prav delate; 
[2:9] Če pa gledate na lice, greh delate, in postava vas dopričuje za prestopnike. 
[2:10] Kajti kdor bi izpolnjeval celo postavo, pregrešil pa se zoper eno, postal je vseh dolžan. 
[2:11] Kajti on, ki je rekel: "Ne prešestvuj," rekel je tudi: "Ne ubijaj"; če pa ne bodeš prešestvoval, ubijal pa, postal si prestopnik postave. 
[2:12] Tako govorite in tako ravnajte, kakor kateri bodete sojeni po svobode postavi; 
[2:13] Kajti sodba je neusmiljena njemu, ki ni delal usmiljenja, in usmiljenje se ne méni za sodbo. 
[2:14] Kaj pomaga, bratje moji, če kdo pravi, da ima vero, dél pa nima? Vera ga vendar rešiti ne more! 
[2:15] Če pa je brat nag ali sestra, in pogrešata vsakdanje hrane, 
[2:16] Pa bi jima kdo izmed vas rekel: "Hodita v miru, grejta se in sitita", a jima ne bi dali, kar je telesu potrebno, kaj pomaga? 
[2:17] Tako tudi vera, ako nima dél, mrtva je ob sebi. 
[2:18] Ali poreče kdo: Ti imaš vero, in jaz imam dela; pokaži mi vero svojo iz svojih dél, in jaz ti pokažem iz svojih dél vero svojo. 
[2:19] Ti veruješ, da je Bog eden; prav delaš; tudi hudi duhovi verujejo in groza jih je; 
[2:20] Hočeš pa vedeti, človek prazni, da je vera brez del mrtva? 
[2:21] Ali Abraham, oče naš, ni bil po delih opravičen, ko je nesel Izaka sina svojega na oltar? 
[2:22] Vidiš, da je vera sodelovala z deli njegovimi, in iz del se je vera popolnila? 
[2:23] In izpolnilo se je pismo, ki pravi: "Abraham pa je veroval Bogu, in vštevalo se mu je v pravico" in "prijatelj Božji" se je imenoval. 
[2:24] Vidite torej, da se iz dél opravičuje človek, in ne iz vere samo? 
[2:25] Enako pa se ni tudi Rahab kurba opravičila iz dél, ko je sprejela poslance in odpravila po drugi poti? 
[2:26] Kakor je namreč telo brez duha mrtvo, tako je tudi vera brez del mrtva. 
[3:1] Ne bodite mnogi učitelji, bratje moji, vedóč da dobimo večjo sodbo; 
[3:2] Kajti mnogo grešimo vsi. Če kdo v besedi ne greši, ta je popoln mož, zmožen brzdati tudi celo telo. 
[3:3] Glej, konjem devamo brzde v gobce, da so nam poslušni, in vladamo cel njih život. 
[3:4] Glej, tudi ladije, ki so tako velike, in ki jih silni vetrovi gonijo, vlada najmanjše krmilo, kamorkoli hoče vodnikov naklep. 
[3:5] Tako je tudi jezik majhen ud in se ponaša. Glej, majhen ogenj, kolikošen gozd zažge! 
[3:6] Tudi jezik je ogenj, svet krivice. Tako se kaže jezik med udi našimi, ki oskrunja cel život in zažiga rojstva kolo, njega pa zažiga pekel; 
[3:7] Kajti sleherno naravo zverî in tičev, laznine in morske živali kroti in je ukrotila narava človeška; 
[3:8] Jezika pa ne more krotiti nobeden človek; zlo neukrotno, poln smrtnega strupa! 
[3:9] Z njim blagoslavljamo Boga in očeta, in z njim preklinjamo ljudí, vstvarjene po podobi Božji; 
[3:10] Iz istih ust izhaja blagoslov in kletev. To, bratje, ne sme se tako goditi! 
[3:11] Saj pač studenec iz iste votline ne bruha sladko in grenko! 
[3:12] Saj, bratje moji, smokva ne more roditi oliv ali trta smokev; tako noben studenec delati vode solne in sladke. 
[3:13] Kdo je moder in razumen med vami? Kaže naj iz lepega vedenja dela svoja v krotkosti modri. 
[3:14] Če pa imate bridko gorečnost in prepirljivost v srci svojem, ne ponašajte se in lagajte zoper resnico. 
[3:15] To ni modrost, ki prihaja od zgoraj, nego zemeljska, počutna, vražja. 
[3:16] Kjer je namreč gorečnost in prepirljivost, tam nerednost in vse zlo delo. 
[3:17] Modrost pa od zgoraj je prvič čista, potem mirna, rahla, poslušna, polna usmiljenja in dobrega sadú, nedvomna in odkritosrčna. 
[3:18] Sad pa pravice se seje v miru njim, ki hranijo mir. 
[4:1] Odkod vojske in bitve med vami? Ne odtod, od želj vaših, vojskujočih se v vaših udih? 
[4:2] Poželite, a nimate; morite in želite iskreno, in ne morete doseči; borite se in vojskujete, a nimate, ker ne prosite; 
[4:3] Prósite, a ne dobite, ker slabo prosite, da zapravljate v slah svojih. 
[4:4] Prešestniki in prešestnice, ali ne veste, da je prijateljstvo sveta sovraštvo Božje? Kdor torej hoče biti svetu prijatelj, postane Bogu sovražnik. 
[4:5] Ali menite, da pismo prazno govori: Zavistno želi duh, ki se je vselil v nas? 
[4:6] Daje pa večjo milost; zato pravi: "Bog se upira prevzetnim, ponižnim pa daje milost." 
[4:7] Podložni torej bodite Bogu. Ustavljajte se hudiču, in bežal bode od vas; 
[4:8] Bližajte se Bogu, in bližal se vam bode. Očedite roke, grešniki, in očistite srca, omahljivci! 
[4:9] Čutite svoje gorjé in žalujte in jokajte; smeh vaš naj se izpreobrne v žalovanje, in radost v pobitost. 
[4:10] Ponižajte se pred Gospodom in povišal vas bode. 
[4:11] Ne obrekujte se med seboj, bratje; kdor obrekuje brata, in sodi brata svojega, obrekuje postavo in sodi postavo; če pa sodiš postavo, nisi delalec postave, nego sodnik. 
[4:12] Eden je postavodaj, ki more rešiti in pogubiti; ti kdo si, ki sodiš druzega? 
[4:13] Dejte torej vi, ki pravite: Danes ali jutri bodemo potovali v to mesto, in bivali ondi eno leto in tržili in pridobivali; 
[4:14] Ki ne veste, kaj bode jutri; kakošno namreč je življenje vaše? Kajti hlap je, ki se malo časa prikaže, potem pa izgine; 
[4:15] Mesto da govorite: Ako Bog hoče in bodemo živeli, bodemo tudi storili to ali ono. 
[4:16] Sedaj pa se ponašate v širokoustji svojem; vsako ponašanje táko je hudobno. 
[4:17] Kdor torej zna dobro delati in ne dela, njemu je greh. 
[5:1] Dejte torej, bogatini, jokajte javkajoč o bedah, katere vam pridejo; 
[5:2] Bogastvo vaše je iztrohnelo, in oblačila vaša so moli snedli; 
[5:3] Zlato vaše in srebro je zrujavelo, in njih ruja bode v pričanje vam, in žrla meso vaše kakor ogenj; zaklade ste zbirali v zadnjih dnevih. 
[5:4] Glej, plačilo delalcev, kateri so kosili polja vaša, ki ste ga jim utrgali, kriči; in vpitje ženjic prišlo je do ušes Gospoda Sabaot. 
[5:5] V požréšnosti ste na zemlji živeli in razkošnosti; srca svoja ste redili kakor o dnevi klanja. 
[5:6] Obsodili, ubili ste pravičnega; ne ustavlja se vam! 
[5:7] Bodite torej potrpežljivi, bratje, do prihoda Gospodovega. Glej, ratar pričakuje drazega sadú zemljé, potrpežljiv zanj, da dobi dež zgodnji in kasni; 
[5:8] Bodite potrpežljivi tudi vi, pokrepčajte srca svoja, ker prihod Gospodov se je približal. 
[5:9] Ne zdihujte drug zoper druzega, bratje, da ne bodete obsojeni; glej, sodnik stoji pred vrati! 
[5:10] Za zgled vzemite trpljenja in potrpežljivosti, bratje, preroke, kateri so govorili v imenu Gospodovem. 
[5:11] Glej, blagrujemo stanovitne; o stanovitnosti Jobovi ste čuli, in konec Gospodov ste videli; ker usmiljen je Gospod in milosrčen. 
[5:12] Pred vsem pa, bratje moji, ne prisezajte; ne pri nebu, ne pri zemlji, ne kake druge prisege; bodi pa vaše; dá, dá, in ne, ne! da ne padete pod sodbo. 
[5:13] Trpi li kdo med vami? moli naj; je li kdo dobre volje? prepeva naj. 
[5:14] Je-li kdo bolan med vami? pokliče naj k sebi starejšine občine, in molijo naj nad njim, ter pomazilijo ga z oljem v imenu Gospodovem; 
[5:15] In molitev vere bode pomagala bolniku, in ozdravil ga bode Gospod; in ako je storil grehe, odpustilo se mu bode. 
[5:16] Izpovedujte si med seboj grehe, in molite zase med seboj, da bodete ozdravljeni! Mnogo more krepka molitev pravičnega. 
[5:17] Elija je bil človek enakočuten z nami in v molitvi je molil, naj ne dežuje, in deževalo ni na zemlji tri leta in mesece tri; 
[5:18] In zopet je molil, in nebo je dalo dežja, in zemlja je rodila sad svoj. 
[5:19] Bratje, ako kdo med vami zabrede od resnice in ga kdo nazaj pripelje, 
[5:20] Vedi, da kdor nazaj pripelje grešnika s krive poti, rešil bode dušo njegovo smrti, in pokril grehov obilost. 

### I Peter

[1:1] Peter apostelj Jezusa Kristusa izvoljenim tujcem raztrosa v Pontu, Galaciji, Kapadociji, Aziji in Bitiniji; 
[1:2] Po sklepu Boga očeta v posvečenji Duha, v pokorščino in pokropljenje s krvjo Jezusa Kristusa; milost in mir naj se vam napolni. 
[1:3] Hvaljen Bog in oče Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa, kateri je po obilem usmiljenji svojem prerodil nas v živo upanje po vstajenji Jezusa Kristusa od mrtvih, 
[1:4] V dedščino neminljivo in neoskrunjeno in nevenljivo, hranjeno v nebesih za nas, 
[1:5] Kateri se v moči Božji po veri hranimo v zveličanje, pripravljeno, da se razodene v skrajnem času; 
[1:6] V katerem se radujete ravnokar nekaj časa, (ako treba), v žalosti, v mnogoterih izkušnjavah; 
[1:7] Da se izkušnja vere vaše najde za mnogo dražjo od minljivega, a v ognji izkušenega zlata, v hvalo in čast in slavo v razodetji Jezusa Kristusa, 
[1:8] Katerega ne poznajoč ljubite, v katerega sedaj ne gledajoč a verujoč radujete se v radosti neizrečni in oslavljeni; 
[1:9] Ko ste zadobili namen vere svoje, zveličanje duš. 
[1:10] O katerem zveličanji so preiskavali in izsledovali preroki, kateri so prerokovali o milosti proti vam, 
[1:11] Preiskujoč, na kateri ali kakošen čas meri Duh Kristusov, kateri je v njih naprej pričal za trpljenja Kristusova in slave po njih; 
[1:12] Katerim se je razodelo, da tistega niso podajali sebi, nego nam, kar se vam je sedaj oznanilo po njih, kateri so vam oznanjali evangelj v Duhu svetem poslanem z nebes, v kar angeli pogledati želé. 
[1:13] Zato opašite ledja razuma svojega, bodite trezni, in upajte popolnoma v milost, katera se vam prinaša v razodetji Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:14] Kakor pokorščine otroci, ne ravnajoč se po prejšnjih željah v nevednosti svoji, 
[1:15] Nego po svetem, kateri vas je poklical, bodite tudi sami sveti v vsem vedenji. 
[1:16] Ker pisano je: "Sveti bodite, ker sem jaz svet." 
[1:17] In če očeta imenujete njega, ki sodi brez licegledja po vsakega delu, vedite se v strahu tujčevanja svojega čas; 
[1:18] Vedoč, da niste odkupljeni z minljivim, srebrom ali zlatom, iz praznega življenja svojega podedovanega od očetov, 
[1:19] Nego z drago krvjo kakor jagnjeta brez madeža in hibe, Kristusa; 
[1:20] Kateri je bil naprej namenjen pred ustanovitvijo sveta, prikazal pa se je v zadnjih časih za vas, 
[1:21] Kateri po njem verujete v Boga, ki ga je obudil iz mrtvih in dal mu slavo, da je vera vaša tudi upanje v Boga. 
[1:22] Posvetivši duše svoje v pokorščini resnice po Duhu v bratoljubje odkritosrčno, ljubite se iz čistega srca med seboj iskreno, 
[1:23] Prerojeni ne iz semena minljivega, nego neminljivega, po besedi Boga, ki živi in ostane vekomaj. 
[1:24] Kajti "Vse meso je kakor trava, in vsa slava človekova kakor trave cvet. Posušila se je trava, in cvet njen je odpadel; 
[1:25] Beseda pa Gospodova ostane vekomaj." Ta pa je beseda, katera se vam je oznanila. 
[2:1] Odloživši torej vso hudobijo in vso zvijačo in licemerstva in zavisti in vsa obrekovanja, 
[2:2] Kakor novorojena deteta hrepenite po pametnem, nepokvarjenem mleku, 
[2:3] Da v njem rastete, če ste res okusili, da je blag Gospod. 
[2:4] K njemu pristopivši, kamenu živemu, ki so ga zavrgli ljudje, izvoljen pa je pri Bogu in čislan, 
[2:5] Bodite tudi vi, kakor živo kamenje zidani, hiša duševna, duhovništvo sveto, da darujete duševne daritve po volji Bogu po Jezusu Kristusu. 
[2:6] Zato je tudi pisano v pismu: "Glej, na Sijon denem vogelni kamen, izvoljen, čislan, in kdor veruje vanj, ne bode se osramotil." 
[2:7] Vam torej čast, verujočim; nepokornim pa "kamen, katerega so zavrgli zidarji, ta je postal za vogelni kamen," in "kamen izpotike in pohujšanja skala;" 
[2:8] Kateri se izpotikajo, ker so nepokorni besedi, za kar so bili tudi postavljeni; 
[2:9] Vi pa "rod izvoljeni, duhovništvo kraljevo, ljudstvo sveto," ljudstvo za last, da oznanjajte kreposti njega, ki vas je poklical iz temé v čudovito svetlobo svojo; 
[2:10] Kateri nekdaj ne ljudstvo, sedaj pa ljudstvo Božje; ne pomiloščeni, sedaj pa pomiloščeni. 
[2:11] Ljubljeni, opominjam vas kakor tujce in popotnike, da se zdržujete mesnih poželenj, katera se vojskujejo zoper dušo; 
[2:12] Vedenje svoje med pogani imejte lepo, da, ker vas obrekujejo kakor hudodelnike, iz dobrih dél, ko jih vidijo, slavé Boga o dnevi obiskanja. 
[2:13] Bodite torej podložni vsaki stvari človeški zavoljo Gospoda; bodi si kralju, kakor najvišjemu; 
[2:14] Bodi si poglavarjem, kakor po njem poslanim v kazen hudodelnikov, a dobrodelnikov hvalo; 
[2:15] Ker tako je volja Božja, da z dobrimi deli zamašujete nespametnih ljudi nevednost; 
[2:16] Kakor svobodni in ne za pokrivalo hudobije imajoč svobodo, nego kakor hlapci Božji. 
[2:17] Vse spoštujte, bratovščino ljubite, Boga se bojte, kralja čestite! 
[2:18] Hlapci, podložni bodite v vsem strahu gospodom, ne samo dobrim in rahlim, nego tudi osornim. 
[2:19] Kajti to je milost, ako kdo iz vestnosti do Boga prenaša težave, po krivem trpeč. 
[2:20] Kaka namreč slava, če bodete trpeli grešeč in zato tepeni? Nego če ste dobro delajoč in trpeč stanovitni, to je milost pri Bogu. 
[2:21] Kajti v to ste bili poklicani, ker je tudi Kristus trpel za vas, zapustivši vam zgled, da hodite po sledovih njegovih; 
[2:22] "Kateri ni storil greha, in zvijača se ni našla v ustih njegovih," 
[2:23] Kateri psovan ni nazaj psoval, trpeč ni pretil, nego prepuščal sodečemu pravično; 
[2:24] Kateri je grehe naše sam na telesu svojem nesel na les, da bi grehom odumrli in živeli pravici; "po katerega progi ste bili ozdravljeni." 
[2:25] Bili ste namreč kakor ovce tavajoče, ali povrnili ste se zdaj k pastirju in čuvaju duš vaših. 
[3:1] Enako, žene, pokorne bodite svojim možem, da, če tudi kateri niso poslušni besedi, pridobé se po vedenji žen brez besede, 
[3:2] Ko so videli v strahu sveto vedenje vaše. 
[3:3] Dika vaša ne bodi vnanja, spletanje lâs, in navešanje zlatnine, ali oblačenje kril; 
[3:4] Nego skriti človek srca, v neminljivosti krotkega in mirnega duha, kateri je drag pred Bogom. 
[3:5] Tako namreč so se nekdaj dičile tudi svete žene, katere so upale v Boga, podložne svojim možem; 
[3:6] Kakor je bila Sara poslušna Abrahamu, imenujoč ga gospoda svojega. Katere otroci ste postale vé, če delate dobro in se ne bojite nobenega strahú. 
[3:7] Možjé, enako, živite z njimi po spoznanji, kakor slabšemu orodju ženskemu čast deleč, kakor tudi sodediči milosti življenja, da se ne ovirajo molitve vaše. 
[3:8] Slednjič pa, vsi bodite enodušni, sočutni, bratoljubni, milosrčni, blagovoljni, 
[3:9] Ne vračajoč hudega za hudo, ali psovanja za psovanje; a nasprotno "blagoslavljajoč, vedoč, da ste za to poklicani, da podedovate blagoslov. 
[3:10] "Kajti kdor hoče življenje ljubiti in videti dobre dni, brzdá naj jezik svoj pred hudim, in ustne svoje, da ne govoré zvijače. 
[3:11] Ogiblje se naj hudega, in dela naj dobro; išče naj mirú in hodi za njim. 
[3:12] Ker oči Gospodove so nad pravičnimi in ušesa njegova nad njih molitvami; obličje pa Gospodovo nad njimi, ki delajo hudo." 
[3:13] In kdo je, da bi vam kaj hudega storil, če postanete posnemalci dobrega? 
[3:14] Ali ko bi tudi trpeli za pravico, blagor vam! "Strahú pa njih ne bojte se, in ne begajte se; 
[3:15] Gospoda pa Boga posvečujte v srcih svojih." Pripravljeni pa bodite vedno na zagovor vsakemu, kateri zahteva od vas odgovora za upanje v vas, s krotkostjo in strahom; 
[3:16] In dobro vest imejte, da se v tem, za kar vas obrekujejo kakor hudodelnike, osramoté, kateri obrekujejo vaše lepo vedenje v Kristusu. 
[3:17] Kajti bolje, da dobro delajoč, če hoče volja Božja, trpite, nego hudo delajoč; 
[3:18] Ker tudi Kristus je enkrat za grehe trpel, pravični za krivične, da nas pripelje Bogu; usmrten v mesu, oživljen pa v duhu, 
[3:19] V katerem je tudi šel in oznanjal duhovom v ječi, 
[3:20] Kateri so bili nekdaj neposlušni, ko je enkrat potrpežljivost Božja čakala o dnevih Noeta, ko se je napravljala ladija, v katero se je rešilo malo, to je osem duš, po vodi; 
[3:21] Čemur podoben tudi zdaj nas rešuje krst (ne mesne nesnage odloga, nego dobre vesti obljuba do Boga), po vstajenji Jezusa Kristusa, 
[3:22] Kateri je na desnici Božji, po vnebohodu, in podredjeni so mu angeli in oblasti in moči. 
[4:1] Ker je torej Kristus za nas trpel v mesu, oborožite se tudi vi z istim mišljenjem; ker kdor je trpel v mesu, jenjal je grešiti; 
[4:2] Da ne živite več človeškim slam, nego volji Božji ostali čas v mesu. 
[4:3] Dovolj namreč nam bodi pretekli čas življenja, da smo delali poganov voljo, hodeč v nezmernosti, slah, pijanosti, požrešnosti, pijančevanji in nepostavnem malikovanji; 
[4:4] Zato se čudijo, da ne letate z njimi v isto razuzdanost nezmernosti, obrekujoč; 
[4:5] Kateri bodo odgovor dajali njemu, ki je pripravljen soditi žive in mrtve. 
[4:6] Zato se je namreč tudi mrtvim oznanjal evangelj, da se sodijo po človeško v mesu, živé pa po Božje v duhu. 
[4:7] Vsega konec pa se je približal; bodite torej pametni in trezni za molitve; 
[4:8] Pred vsem pa ljubezen med seboj iskreno imajoč, ker ljubezen bode pokrila grehov obilost;" 
[4:9] Gostoljubni med seboj, brez godrnjanja. 
[4:10] Kakor je kateri dar prejel, delite si ga med seboj, kakor dobri gospodarji mnogotere milosti Božje; 
[4:11] Če kdo govori, kakor izreke Božje; če kdo streže, kakor iz moči, katero deli Bog; da se v vsem oslavlja Bog po Jezusu Kristusu, kateremu je slava in moč na vekov veke. Amen. 
[4:12] Ljubljeni, ne čudite se ognjeni preskušnji v vas, ki vam prihaja za izkušnjo, kakor da se vam godi kaj tujega, 
[4:13] Temuč kakor ste deležni trpljenja Kristusovega, veselite se, da se bodete tudi v razodenji slave njegove hvalili in veselili. 
[4:14] Če vas psujejo v imenu Kristusovem, blagor vam; kajti slave in Božji Duh počiva nad vami: zanje se preklinja, za vas pa se oslavlja. 
[4:15] Kajti nihče iz med vas naj ne trpi kakor morilec, ali tat, ali hudodelnik, ali kakor lakomnik; 
[4:16] Če pa kakor kristijan, ne bodi ga sram, a slavi naj Boga zategadelj. 
[4:17] Kajti čas, da začne sodba od hiše Božje; če pa najprej od nas, kaj bo tistih konec, kateri so neposlušni evangelju Božjemu? 
[4:18] In, če se s težka reši pravični, kje ostane brezbožni in grešnik?" 
[4:19] Zato naj tudi, kateri trpé po volji Božji, kakor zvestemu stvarniku izročajo duše svoje v dobrodelstvu. 
[5:1] Starejšine med vami opominjam, sostarejšina in priča trpljenj Kristusovih, deležnik tudi slave, ki se ima razodeti: 
[5:2] Pasite čedo Božjo med vami, nadzorujoč ne po sili, nego prostovoljno; tudi ne za grd dobiček, nego radovoljno, 
[5:3] Tudi ne kakor gospodovalci dedščin, nego kakor zgledi postavši čede; 
[5:4] In ko se bode prikazal višji pastir, dobili bodete nevenljivi venec slave. 
[5:5] Enako, mlajši, pokorni bodite starejšim; vsi pa pokorni si med seboj, privežite si ponižnost; ker "Bog se ustavlja prevzetnim, ponižnim pa daje milost." 
[5:6] Ponižajte se tedaj pod mogočno roko Božjo, da vas poviša ob času; 
[5:7] Vso skrb svojo vrzite nanj, ker on skrbi za vas. 
[5:8] Trezni bodite, čujte, ker nasprotnik vaš, hudič, kakor lev rujoveč hodi okrog in išče koga bi pogoltnil. 
[5:9] Njemu se ustavljajte, trdni v veri, vedoč, da ista trpljenja prenaša bratovščina vaša na svetu. 
[5:10] Bog pa vse milosti, kateri nas je poklical v večno slavo svojo v Kristusu Jezusu, po kratkem trpljenji pripravi vas sam, utrdi, pokrepčaj, ustanóvi! 
[5:11] Njemu slava in moč na vekov veke! Amen. 
[5:12] Po Silvanu sem vam, zvestem bratu, kakor sodim, na kratko pisal, opominjajoč in pričajoč, da je tá prava milost Božja, v kateri stojite. 
[5:13] Pozdravlja vas izvoljena v Babilonu, in Marko sin moj. 
[5:14] Pozdravljajte se med seboj v poljubu ljubezni. Mir vam vsem v Kristusu Jezusu! Amen. 

### II Peter

[1:1] Simeon Peter hlapec in apostelj Jezusa Kristusa, njim, ki so zadobili z nami enakovredno vero v pravici Boga našega in zveličarja Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:2] Milost vam in mir naj se napolni v spoznanji Boga in Jezusa Gospoda našega. 
[1:3] Ker nam je Božja moč njegova vse za življenje in pobožnost podarila, po spoznanji njega, ki nas je poklical po slavi in kreposti, 
[1:4] Po katerih so se nam podarile največje in dragocene obljube, da postanete po njih deležniki Božje narave, ter ubežite pogubi, ki je v poželenji na svetu; 
[1:5] Ravno za to, prinesite sleherno pridnost, in pridodelite v veri svoji krepost, v kreposti pa spoznanje, v spoznanji pa zmernost, 
[1:6] V zmernosti pa stanovitnost, v stanovitnosti pa pobožnost, 
[1:7] V pobožnosti pa bratoljubje, v bratoljubji pa ljubezen. 
[1:8] Kajti če je to pri vas in obilo, dela, da niste nedelavni in nerodovitni v spoznanje Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:9] Kdor namreč nima tega, on je slep, kratkoviden, in je pozabil očiščenja prejšnjih grehov svojih. 
[1:10] Zato se, bratje, bolj trúdite, da utrdite poklic svoj in izvoljenje; kajti če tako delate, ne izpotaknete se nikdar. 
[1:11] Kajti tako se vam bode obilo dovolil vhod v večno kraljestvo Gospoda našega in zveličarja Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:12] Zato ne bodem v nemar pustil, vedno opominjati vas tega, dasì veste in ste utrjeni v dani vam resnici. 
[1:13] Pravično pa se mi zdí, dokler sem v tej koči, zbujati vas v opominjanji; 
[1:14] Vedoč, da skoraj pride odloga koče moje, kakor mi je tudi Gospod naš Jezus Kristus naznanil. 
[1:15] Potrudil se pa bodem, da bodete imeli po mojem odhodu vedno spominjati se tega. 
[1:16] Kajti ne držeč se izmišljenih basni, oznanili smo vam Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa moč in prihod, nego ker smo bili samovidne priče njegovega veličastva. 
[1:17] Kajti prejel je od Boga očeta čast in slavo, ko mu je prišel tak glas od veličastne slave: Ta je sin moj ljubljeni, kateri mi je po volji." 
[1:18] In ta glas smo mi slišali prihajoč z neba, ko smo bili z njim na sveti gori. 
[1:19] In trdnejšo imamo besedo preroško, na katero po pravici pazite, kakor na svetilnico, ki sveti na temnem kraji, dokler dan ne prisije, in danica vzide v srcih vaših; 
[1:20] To najprej spoznajoč, da nobeno prerokovanje pisma ni lastne razrešitve; 
[1:21] Kajti prerokovanje ni nikdar prišlo po volji človeški, nego od Duha svetega gnani so govorili sveti ljudje Božji. 
[2:1] Bili so pa tudi lažipreroki v ljudstvu, kakor bodo tudi med vami lažiučitelji, kateri bodo zraven vpeljavali pogubne razkole in zatajevali Gospoda, ki jih je odkupil, pripravljajoč si naglo pogubo; 
[2:2] In mnogo jih bode hodilo za njih pogubami, za katerih voljo se bode obrekovala pot resnice; 
[2:3] In v lakomnosti vas bodo z izmišljenimi besedami prekanjali, katerim sodba že zdavnaj ne odlaša, in poguba njih ne spí. 
[2:4] Kajti Bog ni prizanesel angelom, ki so grešili, temuč jih z verigami temé v pekel pahnil in hraniti jih dal v sodbo. 
[2:5] In staremu svetu ni prizanesel, nego Noeta osmega ohranil za glasnika pravice, 
[2:6] Ko je potop svetu brezbožnih poslal, in je mesti Sodom in Gomoro upepelivši v pogubljenje obsodil, zgled postavivši njim, ki bodo brezbožni, 
[2:7] In pravičnega Lota, trpečega od razuzdanega vedenja neukrotnih, je otél. 
[2:8] (Kajti s pogledom in sluhom je pravični dan na dan pravično dušo mučil z nepostavnimi deli, prebivajoč med njimi); 
[2:9] Gospod vé pobožne rešiti iz izkušnjave, krivične pa za dan sodbe hraniti v kaznovanje; 
[2:10] Najbolj pa nje, ki hodijo za mesom v poželenji oskrumbe, in zaničujejo gospostvo. Predrzniki samopašni, ne bojé se preklinjati slave; 
[2:11] Kjer angeli, po kreposti in moči večji, ne izrekajo proti njim pred Gospodom preklinjajoče sodbe. 
[2:12] Ti pa, kakor nespametne živali telesne stvarjene v lov in klanje, v tem, česar ne poznajo, preklinjajoč, bodo se pogubili v pogubi svoji, prejemši krivice plačilo. 
[2:13] Oni, katerim se veselje zdí požrešnost po dnevi, madeži in sramote, razuzdano živeč v zmotah svojih in gosteč se z vami, 
[2:14] Oči imajoč polne prešestnice in brez pokoja v grehu; vabeč duše neutrjene, imajoč srce vajeno lakomnosti, prekletstva otroci, 
[2:15] Ki so zapustivši ravno pot tavali, hodili po poti Balaama sina Bosorjevega, kateri je ljubil krivice plačilo, 
[2:16] A prejel lastne nepostavnosti posvarilo; brezglasno uprežno živinče, ki je izpregovorivši s človeškim glasom, zabranilo prerokovo nespamet. 
[2:17] Ti so studenci brez vode, megle, ki jih goni vihar, katerim je hranjen mrak teme vekomaj. 
[2:18] Kajti prazno zabuhlost govoreč vabijo v poželjivostih mesa, v razuzdanosti nje, kateri so v resnici ubežali njim, ki hodijo po zmotnjavi, 
[2:19] Obetajoč jim svobodo, ko so sami hlapci pogube; kajti od kogar je kdo premagan, njegov je tudi hlapec postal. 
[2:20] Kajti če se taki, ki so ubežali oskrumbam sveta v spoznanji Gospoda in zveličarja Jezusa Kristusa, zopet zapletó vanje in so premagani, zgodilo se jim je zadnje hujše od prvega. 
[2:21] Kajti bolje jim je bilo, da bi ne bili spoznali pota pravice, nego spoznavši obrniti se zopet od dane jim svete zapovedi. 
[2:22] Prigodilo se jim je pa po resničnem pregovoru: "Pes, ki se je obrnil k lastni izbluvi," in "Svinja omita v lužo blatno." 
[3:1] Tu vam, ljubljeni, pišem že drugi list, v obéh zbujam v opominu vaš čisti razum; 
[3:2] Da se spominjate prej govorjenih besed svetih prerokov, in nas aposteljnov zapovedi Gospoda in zveličarja; 
[3:3] To najprej vedóč, da pridejo v zadnjih dnevih posmehovalci, hodeči po lastnih svojih poželenjih, 
[3:4] In govoreči: Kje je obljuba prihoda njegovega? Kajti odkar so legli očetje, vse ostane tako od stvarjenja začetka. 
[3:5] Kajti hotoma ne vedó tega, da so bila od nekdaj nebesa in zemlja, ki je postala iz vode in z vodo, po besedi Božji; 
[3:6] Po katerih je tedanji svet poginil z vodo potopljen; 
[3:7] Sedanja nebesa pa in zemlja shranjena so z isto besedo, ognju hranjena za dan sodbe in pogube brezbožnih ljudî. 
[3:8] To eno pa vam ne bodi skrito, ljubljeni, da je en dan pred Gospodom kakor tisoč let, in tisoč let kakor en dan. 
[3:9] Gospod ne odlaša z obljubo, kar neki imajo za odlašanje; nego potrpežljiv je z nami, ker noče, da se pogubé neki, nego da vsi pridejo do pokore. 
[3:10] Prišel pa bode dan Gospodov kakor tat po noči, v katerem preidejo nebesa z ropotom, in prvine, razpadejo goreč, in zemlja in dela na nji zgoré. 
[3:11] Ko torej vse to razpada, koliki morate biti v svetem vedenji in pobožnosti, 
[3:12] Čakajoč in hrepeneč po prihodu dneva Gospodovega, po katerem nebesa razpadejo v ognji, in se prvine goreč raztopé? 
[3:13] Novih pa nebes in zemlje nove pričakujemo po obljubi njegovi, v katerih prebiva pravica. 
[3:14] Zato, ljubljeni, tega čakajoč, trudite se, da bodete brez madeža in brez hibe najdeni v miru pred njim; 
[3:15] In potrpežljivost Gospoda našega imejte za blaginjo; kakor vam je tudi ljubljeni brat naš Pavel pisal po dani mu modrosti; 
[3:16] Kakor tudi v vseh listih, govoreč v njih o tem; v katerih je nekaj težko razumljivega, kar nevedni in neutrjeni zavijajo, kakor tudi ostala pisma, v lastno pogubo svojo. 
[3:17] Vi torej, ljubljeni, ki to naprej veste, pazite, da vas pregrešnih zmota za seboj ne potegne in ne padete iz lastnega trdega stanja; 
[3:18] Temveč rastite v milosti in spoznanji Gospoda našega in zveličarja Jezusa Kristusa. Njemu slava sedaj in vekomaj! Amen. 

### I John

[1:1] Kar je bilo s konca, kar smo čuli, kar smo videli na svoje oči, kar smo gledali, in so tipale naše roke, o besedi življenja; 
[1:2] (In življenje se je prikazalo, in videli smo in pričamo, in oznanjamo vam večno življenje, katero je bilo pri očetu, in prikazalo se je nam:) 
[1:3] Kar smo videli in čuli, oznanjamo vam, da imate tudi vi deleštvo z nami; in deleštvo naše je z očetom in sè sinom njegovim Jezusom Kristusom. 
[1:4] In to vam pišemo, da bode veselje vaše napolnjeno. 
[1:5] In to je oznanilo, katero smo slišali od njega in ga oznanjamo vam, da je Bog luč, in temé v njem ni nobene. 
[1:6] Ako pravimo, da imamo deleštvo z njim in hodimo po temi, lažemo in ne delamo resnice; 
[1:7] Če pa hodimo po luči, kakor je on v luči, imamo deleštvo med seboj, in kri Jezusa Kristusa sina njegovega nas očišča slehernega greha. 
[1:8] Ako pravimo, da nimamo greha, sami sebe slepimo, in resnice ni v nas. 
[1:9] Če spoznavamo grehe svoje, zvest je in pravičen, da nam odpustí grehe in očisti nas sleherne krivice. 
[1:10] Ako pravimo, da nismo grešili, delamo ga za lažnika, in besede njegove ni v nas. 
[2:1] Otročiči moji, to vam pišem, da ne grešite, in če kdo greši, imamo odvetnika pri očetu, Jezusa Kristusa pravičnega; 
[2:2] In on je sprava za grehe naše; ne pa samo za naše, nego tudi za ves svet. 
[2:3] In v tem spoznavamo, da smo ga spoznali, ako držimo zapovedi njegove. 
[2:4] Kdor pravi: "Spoznal sem ga, in ne drži zapovedi njegovih, lažnik je in v njem ni resnice; 
[2:5] Kdor pa drži besedo njegovo, v njem se je resnično popolnila ljubezen Božja. V tem spoznavamo, da smo v njem. 
[2:6] Kdor pravi, da v njem ostaja, mora, kakor je on živel, tudi tako živeti. 
[2:7] Bratje, ne pišem vam nove zapovedi, nego zapoved staro, katero ste imeli od začetka; zapoved stara je beseda, katero ste slišali od začetka. 
[2:8] Zopet vam pišem novo zapoved, kar je resnično v njem in v vas; ker tema izgine in luč resnična že sveti. 
[2:9] Kdor pravi, da je v luči, in sovraži brata svojega, v temi je do sedaj. 
[2:10] Kdor ljubi brata svojega, ostaja v luči in pohujšanja ni v njem. 
[2:11] Kdor pa sovraži brata svojega, v temi je, in po temi hodi in ne vé, kam gré, ker tema je oslepila oči njegove. 
[2:12] Pišem vam, otročiči, ker so vam grehi odpuščeni po imenu njegovem. 
[2:13] Pišem vam, očetje, ker ste spoznali njega, ki je od začetka. Pišem vam, mladeniči, ker ste premagali hudobnega. Pišem vam, otročiči, ker ste spoznali očeta. 
[2:14] Pisal sem vam, očetje, ker ste spoznali njega, ki je od začetka. Pisal sem vam, mladeniči, ker ste krepki, in beseda Božja ostaja v vas, in premagali ste hudobnega. 
[2:15] Ne ljubite sveta, ne kar je na svetu. Če kdo ljubi svet, ni ljubezni očetove v njem; 
[2:16] Ker vse, kar je na svetu, poželenje mesa, in poželenje očî, in življenja napuh, ni iz očeta, nego iz sveta je. 
[2:17] In svet izgine in poželenje njegovo; kdor pa dela voljo Božjo, ostane vekomaj. 
[2:18] Otročiči, skrajna ura je, in kakor ste slišali, da protikrist se bliža, vstali so sedaj mnogi protikristi; 
[2:19] Odtod spoznavamo, da je skrajna ura. Iz nas so izšli, ali niso bili iz nas; kajti ako bi bili iz nas, ostali bi bili z nami; ali izkazati se je moralo, da niso vsi iz nas. 
[2:20] In vi imate mazilo od svetega, in veste vse. 
[2:21] Nisem vam pisal, ker ne znate resnice, nego ker jo znate, in da ni nobena laž iz resnice. 
[2:22] Kdo je lažnik, če ne kdor tají, da Jezus je Kristus? Ta je protikrist, kateri tají očeta in sina. 
[2:23] Vsak, kateri tají sina, tudi očeta nima. 
[2:24] Vi torej, kar ste slišali od začetka, ostane naj v vas. Če ostane v vas, kar ste slišali od začetka, ostali bodete tudi vi v sinu in v očetu. 
[2:25] In ta je obljuba, katero nam je on obljubil, večno življenje. 
[2:26] To sem vam pisal za tiste, ki vas slepé. 
[2:27] In vi, mazilo, katero ste prejeli od njega, ostane v vas, in treba ni, da bi vas kdo učil; nego kakor vas isto mazilo uči vsega, in je resnično, in ni laž; in kakor vas je učilo, ostanete v njem. 
[2:28] In sedaj, otročiči, ostanite v njem, da, kader se prikaže, imamo zaupanje, in se ne osramotimo pred njim o prihodu njegovem. 
[2:29] Ako veste, da je pravičen, spoznajte, da je vsak, kateri dela pravico, iz njega rojen. 
[3:1] Glejte, koliko ljubezen nam je dal oče, da se imenujemo otroci Božji. Zato nas svet ne spoznava, ker ni njega spoznal. 
[3:2] Ljubljeni, sedaj smo otroci Božji; in ni se še pokazalo, kaj bodemo; vemo pa, da, kader se pokaže, bodemo njemu enaki, ker ga bodemo videli, kakor je. 
[3:3] In vsak, kdor ima upanje to v njega, posvečuje se, kakor je on svet. 
[3:4] Vsak, kdor dela greh, dela tudi krivico; in greh je krivica. 
[3:5] In veste, da se je on prikazal, da vzame grehe naše; in greha ni v njem. 
[3:6] Vsak, kdor v njem ostane, ne greši; vsak, kdor greši, ni ga videl, in ni ga spoznal. 
[3:7] Otročiči, nihče naj vas ne slepi; kdor dela pravico, je pravičen, kakor je on pravičen. 
[3:8] Kdor dela greh, je iz hudiča; ker hudič greši od začetka. Za to se je prikazal sin Božji, da razdene dela hudičeva. 
[3:9] Vsak, kdor je rojen iz Boga, ne dela greha, ker seme njegovo ostaja v njem; in grešiti ne more, ker je rojen iz Boga. 
[3:10] V tem so očitni otroci Božji in otroci hudičevi. Vsak, kdor ne dela pravice, ni iz Boga, in kdor ne ljubi brata svojega. 
[3:11] Kajti to je oznanilo, katero ste slišali od začetka, da se ljubímo med seboj; 
[3:12] Ne kakor je bil Kajn iz hudobnega in je ubil brata svojega; in za kaj ga je ubil? Ker so bila hudobna dela njegova, dela pa brata njegovega pravična. 
[3:13] Ne čudite se, bratje moji, če vas svet sovraži. 
[3:14] Mi vemo, da smo prešli iz smrti v življenje, ker ljubimo brate; kdor ne ljubi brata, ostaja v smrti. 
[3:15] Vsak, kdor sovraži brata svojega, je ljudomorec; in veste, da noben ljudomorec nima večnega življenja, ki bi ostalo v njem. 
[3:16] V tem smo spoznali ljubezen, da je on dal dušo svojo za nas; tudi mi moramo dati duše za brate. 
[3:17] Kdor pa ima živež sveta, in gleda brata svojega, ki ima potrebo, in zapre osrčje svoje pred njim, kako ostane ljubezen Božja v njem? 
[3:18] Otročiči moji, ne ljubimo z besedo, ne z jezikom, nego v dejanji in resnici. 
[3:19] In v tem spoznavamo, da smo iz resnice, in pred njim bodemo pregovorili srca svoja; 
[3:20] Kajti če nas srce obsoja, ker je Bog večji od srca našega, pozna tudi vse. 
[3:21] Ljubljeni, če nas srce naše ne obsoja, imamo zaupanje do Boga, 
[3:22] In karkoli prosimo, dobimo od njega, ker držimo zapovedi njegove, in delamo, kar mu je po volji. 
[3:23] In ta je zapoved njegova, da verujmo v ime sina njegovega, Jezusa Kristusa, in ljubimo se med seboj, kakor nam je dal zapoved. 
[3:24] In kdor drži zapovedi njegove, ostane v njem, in on v njem. In v tem spoznavamo, da ostaja v nas, iz Duha, katerega nam je dal. 
[4:1] Ljubljeni, ne verujte vsakemu duhu, nego presojajte duhove, ali so iz Boga; ker mnogo lažiprerokov je izšlo na svet. 
[4:2] V tem spoznate Duha Božjega: vsak duh, ki spoznava Jezusa Kristusa, da je prišel v mesu, je iz Boga. 
[4:3] In vsak duh, ki ne spoznava Jezusa Kristusa, da je prišel v mesu, ni iz Boga; in ta je protikristov, kateri ste slišali da pride, in sedaj je že na svetu. 
[4:4] Vi ste iz Boga, otročiči, in premagali ste jih; ker večji je on, ki je v vas, nego on, ki je v svetu. 
[4:5] Oni so iz sveta; za to govoré iz sveta, in svet jih posluša. 
[4:6] Mi smo iz Boga; kdor pozna Boga, pusluša nas; kdor ni iz Boga, nas ne posluša; iz tega spoznavamo duha resnice in duha zmote. 
[4:7] Ljubljeni, ljubimo se med seboj; ker ljubezen je iz Boga, in vsak, kdor ljubi, rojen je iz Boga in pozna Boga; 
[4:8] Kdor ne ljubi, ni spoznal Boga, da je Bog ljubezen. 
[4:9] V tem se je razodela ljubezen Božja v nas da je sina svojega edinorojenega Bog na svet poslal, da živimo po njem. 
[4:10] V tem je ljubezen, ne ker smo mi ljubili Boga, nego ker je on ljubil nas, in poslal sina svojega v spravo za grehe naše. 
[4:11] Ljubljeni, če nas je Bog tako jubil, dolžni smo tudi mi ljubiti se med seboj. 
[4:12] Boga ni nihče nikdar videl; če se ljubimo med seboj, ostaja Bog v nas, in ljubezen njegova je popolnjena v nas. 
[4:13] V tem spoznavamo, da ostajamo v njem, in on v nas, ker nam je dal iz Duha svojega. 
[4:14] In mi smo gledali in pričamo, da je oče poslal sina zveličarja sveta. 
[4:15] Kdor spozna, da je Jezus sin Božji, v njem ostaja Bog in on v Bogu. 
[4:16] In mi smo spoznali in verovali ljubezen, katero ima Bog v nas. Bog je ljubezen, in kdor ostaja v ljubezni, ostaja v Bogu, in Bog v njem. 
[4:17] V tem se je popolnila ljubezen z nami, da imamo zaupanje o dnevi sodbe, da, kakor je on, smo tudi mi na tem svetu. 
[4:18] Strahú ni v ljubezni, temuč popolna ljubezen ven vrže strah, ker strah ima kazen; kdor pa se boji, ni se popolnil v ljubezni. 
[4:19] Mi ga ljubimo, ker nas je on prvi ljubil. 
[4:20] Ako kdo pravi: Boga ljubim, in sovraži brata svojega, je lažnik; kajti kdor ne ljubi brata, katerega vidi, kako more ljubiti Boga, katerega ne vidi? 
[4:21] In to zapoved imamo od njega, da, kdor ljubi Boga, naj ljubi tudi brata svojega. 
[5:1] Vsak, kdor veruje, da Jezus je Kristus, rojen je iz Boga, in vsak, kdor ljubi njega, ki ga je rodil, ljubi tudi rojenega iz njega. 
[5:2] V tem spoznavamo, da ljubimo otroke Božje, kader ljubimo Boga, in držimo zapovedi njegove. 
[5:3] Kajti to je ljubezen Božja, da držimo zapovedi njegove; in zapovedi njegove niso težke. 
[5:4] Ker vse, kar je rojeno iz Boga, premaga svet; in ta je zmaga, ki je premagala svet, vera naša. 
[5:5] Kdo je, ki premaga svet, če ne kdor veruje, da je Jezus sin Božji? 
[5:6] Ta je, ki je prišel po vodi in krvi, Jezus Kristus; ne v vodi samo, nego v vodi in krvi; in Duh je, ki priča, ker Duh je resnica. 
[5:7] Ker trije so, ki pričajo v nebesih, Oče, Beseda in Duh sveti; in ti trije so eno. 
[5:8] In trije so, ki pričajo na zemlji, Duh in voda in kri, in ti trije so eno. 
[5:9] Če dobimo pričanje ljudî, pričanje Božje je večje; ker to je pričanje Božje, katero je pričal za svojega sina. 
[5:10] Kdor veruje v sina Božjega, ima pričanje v sebi; kdor ne veruje Bogu, naredil ga je za lažnika, ker ni veroval v pričanje, katero je Bog pričal za sina svojega. 
[5:11] In to je pričanje, da nam je Bog dal večno življenje, in to življenje je v sinu njegovem. 
[5:12] Kdor ima sina, ima življenje; kdor nima sina Božjega, nima življenja. 
[5:13] To sem vam pisal, kateri verujete v ime sina Božjega, da veste, da imate večno življenje, in da verujete v ime sina Božjega. 
[5:14] In to je zaupanje, katero imamo do njega, da, kader kaj prosimo po volji njegovi, nas sliši; 
[5:15] In če vemo, da nas sliši, česar prosimo, vemo, da imamo prošeno, česar smo prosili od njega. 
[5:16] Če kdo vidi brata svojega, da greši ne greha za smrt, prosil bode, in dal mu bode življenje, grešečim ne za smrt. Je greh za smrt; ne za tega pravim, da naj prosi. 
[5:17] Vsaka grivica je greh; in je greh ne za smrt. 
[5:18] Vemo, da vsak, kdor je rojen iz Boga, ne greši; nego kdor je rojen iz Boga, hrani se, in hudobni se ga ne dotakne. 
[5:19] Vemo, da smo iz Boga, in cel svet leži v hudem. 
[5:20] Vemo pa, da je sin Božji prišel, in je nam dal razum, da spoznamo resničnega; in v resničnem smo, v sinu njegovem Jezusu Kristusu. Ta je resnični Bog in življenje večno. 
[5:21] Otročiči, ogibajte se malikov! Amen. 

### II John

[1:1] Starejšina gospé izvoljeni in otrokom njenim, katere jaz ljubim v resnici, (in ne jaz sam, nego tudi vsi, ki so spoznali resnico), 
[1:2] Po resnici, katera ostaja v nas, in z nami bode vekomaj; 
[1:3] Z vami bode milost, usmiljenje, mir od Boga očeta in od Gospoda Jezusa Kristusa, sina očetovega, v resnici in ljubezni. 
[1:4] Veselil sem se močno, ker sem našel izmed otrok tvojih, ki hodijo v resnici, kakor smo zapoved dobili od očeta. 
[1:5] In sedaj te prosim, pospá, ne da bi ti pisal novo zapoved, nego katero smo imeli od začetka, da se ljubimo med seboj. 
[1:6] In to je ljubezen, da živimo po zapovedih njegovih. To je zapoved, kakor ste slišali od začetka, da v njej živite; 
[1:7] Ker mnogi sleparji prišli so na svet, kateri ne spoznavajo Jezusa Kristusa, da je prišel v mesu. Ta je slepar in protikrist. 
[1:8] Pazite, da ne izgubimo, kar smo pridelali, nego dobimo polno plačilo. 
[1:9] Vsak, kdor prestopa in ne ostaja v uku Kristusovem, nima Boga; kdor ostaja v uku Kristusovem, ta ima očeta in sina. 
[1:10] Če kdo pride k vam, in ne prinese tega uka, ne sprejemajte ga v hišo, in ne pozdravljajte ga; 
[1:11] Kajti kdor ga pozdravlja, udeležuje se hudobnih del njegovih. 
[1:12] Mnogo sem imel vam pisati, a nisem hotel s papirjem in črnilom; ali upam priti k vam, in iz ust do ust govoriti, da bode veselje vaše popolno. 
[1:13] Pozdravljajo te otroci sestre tvoje izvoljene. Amen. 

### III John

[1:1] Starejšimi Gaju ljubljenemu, katerega jaz ljubim v resnici. 
[1:2] Ljubljeni, v vsem želim, da se ti naj dobro godi in bodeš zdrav, kakor se dobro godi duši tvoji. 
[1:3] Kajti veselil sem se močno, ko so prišli bratje in so pričali za resnico tvojo, kakor ti živiš v resnici. 
[1:4] Večjega veselja nimam od tega, da čujem, da otroci moji živé v resnici. 
[1:5] Ljubljeni, zvesto ravnaš v tem, kar delaš za brate in za tujce, 
[1:6] Kateri so pričali za ljubezen tvojo pred občino; in dobro bodeš storil, če jih spremljaš kakor je vredno Boga. 
[1:7] Kajti zaradi imena njegovega zo izšli, ničesa ne jemajoč od poganov; 
[1:8] Mi torej smo dolžni sprejemati take, da postanemo sodelalci resnici. 
[1:9] Pisal sem občini; ali Dijotrefej, ki hoče prvakovati med njimi, nas ne sprejme. 
[1:10] Zato, če pridem, opomnim ga del njegovih, ki jih dela, s hudobnimi besedami blebetajoč zoper nas; in ne zadovoljen s tem, ne samo sam ne sprejema bratov, temuč tudi njim, ki hočejo, brani in jih iz občine meče. 
[1:11] Ljubljeni, ne posnemaj slabega, nego dobro. Kdor dobro dela, je iz Boga; kdor pa slabo dela, ni videl Boga. 
[1:12] Demetriju so pričali vsi in sama resnica; in tudi mi pričamo, in veste, da je pričanje naše resnično. 
[1:13] Mnogo sem imel pisati, ali nočem ti pisati s črnilom in peresom; 
[1:14] Upam pa videti te skoraj, in govorila bodeva iz ust do ust. 
[1:15] Mir ti! Pozdravljajo te prijatelji. Pozdravi prijatelje po imenu. 

### Jude

[1:1] Juda, Jezusa Kristusa hlapec, a brat Jakobov, v Bogu očetu posvečenim in Jezusu Kristusu hranjenim poklicanim: 
[1:2] Usmiljenje vam in mir in ljubezen naj se napolni. 
[1:3] Ljubljeni, ko sem si mnogo prizadeval pisati vam o skupnem zveličanji, potreba mi je bilo pisati vam opominjajoč, da se borite za vero enkrat dano svetim. 
[1:4] Kajti priplazili so se neki ljudje, zdavnaj naprej zapisani za to sodbo, brezbožni, ki milost Boga našega krivo rabijo v razuzdanost, in tajé edinega vladarja Boga in Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:5] Spomniti pa vas hočem, ko enkrat to veste, da je Gospod, ki je rešil ljudstvo iz dežele Egiptovske, pozneje pogubil ne verujoče. 
[1:6] In angele, ki niso hranili poglavarstva svojega, nego so zapustili lastno domovje, shranil je v sodbo vélikega dneva z večnimi vezmí pod temo; 
[1:7] Kakor Sodoma in Gomora, in mesta okolo njih, ki so enako kakor té, kurbala se in hodila za drugim mesom, so zgled, ker trpé kazen večnega ognja. 
[1:8] Enako torej tudi ti, sanjajoč, oskrunjajo meso, zaničujejo gospostvo, preklinjajo slave. 
[1:9] Mihael pa, nadangelj, ko se je s hudičem prepirajoč pregovarjal o telesu Mojzesovem, ni se upal izreči sodbe preklinjevanja, nego rekel je: Kaznúj te Gospod! 
[1:10] Ti pa preklinjajo, česar ne vedó; kar pa znajo naravno, kakor nespametne živali, v tem se pogubljajo. 
[1:11] Gorjé jim; ker hodili so po potu Kajnovem in za plačilo Bileamovo zabredli so v zmoto; in v nasprotji Kore so poginili. 
[1:12] Ti so pri bratovskih pojedinjah vaših zapreke, ko se gosté skup brez straha, same sebe pasó; oblaki brez vode, ki jih gonijo vetrovi; drevesa poznojesenska, brez sadú, dvakrat mrtva, izkoreninjena; 
[1:13] Divji morski valovi, ki izpenjavajo lastno sramoto: zvezde tavajoče, katerim je mrak teme hranjen vekomaj. 
[1:14] Prerokoval je pa tudi tem sedmi od Adama, Enoh, govoreč: "Glej, prišel je Gospod v mirijadah svetih svojih. 
[1:15] Sodbo delat vsem in kaznovat vse njih brezbožne, za vsa dela brezbožnosti, katera so storili, in za vse trdo, kar so govorili zoper njega grešniki brezbožni. 
[1:16] Ti so godrnjači, pritoževalci, ki hodijo po svojih poželenjih; in usta njih govoré šopirno, občudujoč osebe zaradi koristi. 
[1:17] Vi pa, ljubljeni, spominjajte se besed, ki so jih naprej govorili aposteljni Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa; 
[1:18] Kajti rekli so vam: V zadnjem času bodejo posmehovalci, hodeči po svojih poželenjih brezbožnosti. 
[1:19] Ti so, ki se odločujejo, počutniki, ne imajoči Duha. 
[1:20] Vi pa, ljubljeni, izpodbujajte se v presveti veri svoji, ter molite v Duhu svetem, 
[1:21] Hranite se v ljubezni Božji, pričakujte usmiljenje Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa v večno življenje! 
[1:22] In ene milujte razločujoč; 
[1:23] Ene pa rešite v strahu, potegnivši jih iz ognja, sovražeč tudi obleko oskrunjeno po mesu. 
[1:24] Njemu pa, kateri vas more ohraniti brez izpotike, in postaviti pred slavo svojo brez madeža v radovanji, 
[1:25] Edinemu modremu Bogu, zveličarju našemu, slava in veličastvo, krepost in oblast zdaj in na vse veke! Amen. 

### Revelation of John

[1:1] Razodenje Jezusa Kristusa, katero mu je dal Bog, da pokaže hlapcem svojim, kaj se ima skoraj zgoditi; in naznanil poslavši po angelu svojem hlapcu svojemu Janezu, 
[1:2] Kateri je pričal besedo Božjo in pričanje Jezusa Kristusa in kar je videl. 
[1:3] Blagor mu, kdor bere, in kateri slišijo besede prerokovanja, in hranijo, kar je v njem pisano; kajti čas je blizu. 
[1:4] Janez sedmerim občinam v Aziji: milost vam in mir od njega, kateri je in je bil in bode; in od sedmerih duhov, kateri so pred prestolom njegovim; 
[1:5] In od Jezusa Kristusa, priče zveste, prvorojenega od mrtvih in višjega kraljev zemeljskih; njemu, kateri nas je ljubil in omil nas grehov naših v krvi svoji, 
[1:6] (In naredil nas za kralje in duhovnike Bogu in očetu svojemu), njemu slava in krepost na vekov veke! Amen. 
[1:7] Glej, z oblaki ide, in videlo ga bode vsako oko, in kateri so ga prebodli, in javkali bodo nad njim vsi rodovi zemlje. Dà, amen. 
[1:8] Jaz sem A in O, začetek in konec, govori Gospod, kateri je in je bil in bode, vsemogočni. 
[1:9] Jaz Janez, brat vaš in tovariš v stiski in v kraljestvu in stanovitnosti Jezusa Kristusa, bil sem na otoku, imenovanem Patmu, po besedi Božji in po pričanji Jezusa Kristusa. 
[1:10] Bil sem v duhu o dnevi Gospodovem, in čul sem za seboj glas velik kakor trombe govoreče: 
[1:11] Jaz sem A in O, prvi in zadnji; in: Kar vidiš, zapiši v knjigo, in pošlji občinam v Aziji, v Efez in v Smirno in v Pergam, in Tijatire in v Sarde in v Filadelfijo in v Laodicejo. 
[1:12] In obrnil sem se gledat glas, kateri je govoril z menoj, in obrnivši se videl sem sedem svečnikov zlatih, 
[1:13] In sredi sedmerih svečnikov podobnega sinu človeškemu, oblečenega z obleko do tál in opasanega na prsih sè zlatim pasom; 
[1:14] Glava pa njegova in lasje beli kakor volna bela, kakor sneg; in oči njegove kakor plamen ognjen; 
[1:15] In noge njegove enake svetlemu zlatu, kakor v peči razbeljene; in glas njegov kakor glas mnogih vodâ; 
[1:16] In v desni svoji roki imajoč sedem zvezd; in iz ust njegovih dvorezen oster meč izhajajoč; in obličje njegovo, kakor solnce sije v moči svoji. 
[1:17] In ko sem ga videl, padel sem pred noge njegove kakor mrtev; in položil je name desno roko svojo govoreč mi: Ne boj se; jaz sem prvi in zadnji in živi; 
[1:18] In bil sem mrtev, in glej, živ sem na vekov veke, amen; in ključe imam od pekla in smrti. 
[1:19] Zapiši, kar si videl, in kar je in kar se ima zgoditi po tem; 
[1:20] Skrivnost sedmerih zvezd, katere si videl v desnici moji, in sedmero svečnikov zlatih. Sedmere zvezde so angeli sedmerih občin; in sedmeri svečniki, katere si videl, so sedmere občine. 
[2:1] Angelu občine Efeške piši: To pravi on, ki drži sedmero zvezd v desni svoji, ki hodi sredi sedmerih svečnikov zlatih; 
[2:2] Vem dela tvoja, in trud tvoj, in stanovitnost tvojo, in da ne moreš nositi hudobnih, in si poskušal njé, ki se imenujejo aposteljne, a niso; in našel si jih lažnjive, 
[2:3] In nosil si in stanovitnost imaš in za ime moje si se trudil in nisi se utrudil; 
[2:4] Ali zoper tebe imam, da si opustil prvo svojo ljubezen: 
[2:5] Spominjaj se torej, odkod si izpadel; in izpokóri se, in delaj prva dela; ako pa ne, pridem ti hitro, in premaknem svečnik tvoj z mesta njegovega, če se ne izpokoriš. 
[2:6] Ali to imaš, da sovražiš dela Nikolajcev, katera tudi jaz sovražim. 
[2:7] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam: Kdor premaga, dal mu bodem jesti z drevesa življenja, katero je v sredi raja Božjega. 
[2:8] In angelu občine Smirenske piši: To pravi prvi in zadnji, kateri je bil mrtev in je oživel: 
[2:9] Vem dela tvoja in stisko in siromaštvo, (bogat pa si), in preklinjanje njih, ki pravijo, da so Judje, in niso, nego zbornica satanova. 
[2:10] Nič se ne boj, kaj ti bode trpeti. Glej, hudič bode vrgel jih izmed vas v ječo, da bodo izkušeni; in imeli bodete stisko deset dnî. Bodi zvest do smrti, in dal ti bodem venec življenja. 
[2:11] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam: Kdor premaga, naj se mu nič hudega ne zgodi od druge smrti. 
[2:12] In angelu občine v Pergamu piši: To pravi on, ki drži meč, dvorezni, ostri: 
[2:13] Vem dela tvoja, in kje prebivaš, kjer prestol satanov, in hraniš ime moje, in nisi zatajil vere moje tudi o dnevih, v katerih je Antipa priča moja zvesta, umorjen bil pri vas, kjer satan prebiva. 
[2:14] Ali imam zoper tebe nekaj malega, da imaš tam njé, ki se držé uka Balaamovega, kateri je učil Balaka dajati pohujšanje pred sinovi Izraelovimi, jesti malikove žrtve in kurbati se. 
[2:15] Tako imaš tudi ti nje, ki se držé uka Nikolajcev, kar sovražim. 
[2:16] Izpokóri se, ako pa ne, pridem ti hitro, in vojskoval se bodem z njimi z mečem svojih ust. 
[2:17] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam: Kdor premaga, dal mu bodem jesti mane skrite, in dal mu bodem bel kamen, in na kamenu novo ime zapisano, katerega nihče ni spoznal, razen kdor ga prejme. 
[2:18] In angelu občine v Tijatirih piši: To pravi sin Božji, kateri ima oči svoje kakor plamen ognjen, in noge njegove enake svetlemu zlatu; 
[2:19] Vem dela tvoja in ljubezen in službo in vero in stanovitnost tvojo, in dela tvoja, in da je zadnjih več nego prvih. 
[2:20] Ali imam zoper tebe nekaj malega, da puščaš ženo Jezabelo, ki se imenuje prerokinjo, učiti in slepiti hlapce moje, kurbati se in jesti malikove žrtve. 
[2:21] In dal sem ji čas, da se izpokori od kurbarije svoje, in ni se izpokorila. 
[2:22] Glej, jaz jo vržem na posteljo, in prešestnike z njo, v stisko veliko, če se ne izpokoré od dél svojih; 
[2:23] In otroke njé pomorim sè smrtjo; in spoznale bodo vse občine, da sem jaz, ki preiskujem obisti in srca; in dal vam bodem vsakemu po delih vaših; 
[2:24] Vam pa pravim, in ostalim v Tijatirih, kateri nimajo tega uka, in kateri niso spoznali globočin satanovih, kakor pravijo: Ne vržem na vas druge teže; 
[2:25] Razen kar imate, hranite, dokler ne pridem. 
[2:26] In kdor premaga in kdor hrani do konca dela moja, dal mu bodem oblast nad pogani; 
[2:27] In pasel jih bode sè šibo železno, kakor se razbijajo posode lončene, kakor sem tudi jaz prejel od očeta svojega: 
[2:28] In dal mu bodem zvezdo jutranjo. 
[2:29] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam. 
[3:1] In angelu občine v Sardih piši: To pravi on, ki ima sedmero duhov Božjih in zvezd sedmero: Vem dela tvoja, da imaš ime, da živiš, in si mrtev. 
[3:2] Zbúdi se in utrdi drugo, ki umira: kajti del tvojih nisem našel popolnjenih pred Bogom. 
[3:3] Spominjaj se torej, kako si prejel in slišal, in hrani in izpokóri se. Ako se torej ne zbudiš, pridem k tebi kakor tat, in vedel ne hodeš, o kateri uri pridem k tebi. 
[3:4] Imaš malo imén tudi v Sardih, katera niso oskrunila svojih oblék; in hodili bodo z menoj v belih, ker so vredni. 
[3:5] Kdor premaga, ta bode oblekel bele obleke; in izbrisal ne bodem imena njegovega iz knjige življenja, in spoznal bodem ime njegovo pred očetom svojim in pred angeli njegovimi. 
[3:6] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam. 
[3:7] In angelu občine v Filadelfiji piši: To pravi sveti, resnični, on ki ima "ključ Davidov, kateri odpira, in nihče ne zapre, in zapira, in nihče ne odpre." 
[3:8] Vem dela tvoja. Glej, dal sem pred te duri odprte, in nihče jih ne more zapreti; ker majhno imaš moč in hranil si besedo mojo, in zatajil nisi mojega imena. 
[3:9] Glej, dam iz zbornice satanove njé, ki pravijo, da so Judje, a niso, nego lažejo; glej, storil bodem, da pridejo in pokleknejo pred noge tvoje, in spoznajo, da sem te jaz ljubil. 
[3:10] Ker si ohranil stanovitnosti moje besedo, ohranil te bodem tudi jaz iz ure izkušnjave, katera ima priti na vesoljni svet, izkušat nje, ki prebivajo na zemlji. 
[3:11] Glej, hitro pridem; hrani, kar imaš, da nihče ne vzame tvojega venca. 
[3:12] Kdor premaga, naredim ga za steber v svetiščih Boga svojega, in ven več ne izide, in zapišem nanj ime Boga svojega in ime mesta Boga svojega, novega Jeruzalema, kateri z neba shaja od Boga mojega, in ime moje novo. 
[3:13] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam. 
[3:14] In angelu občine Laodicejske piši: To pravi on, ki je amen, priča zvesta in resnična, začetek stvarjenja Božjega: 
[3:15] Vem dela tvoja, da nisi ne mrzel ne vroč; da bi bil mrzel ali vroč! 
[3:16] Tako, ker si mlačen in ne mrzel ne vroč, bodem te izpljunil iz svojih ust. 
[3:17] Ker praviš: Bogat sem in obogatel sem, in ničesa ne potrebujem, in ne veš, da tí si ubogi in nesrečni in siromaški in slepi in nagi; 
[3:18] Svetujem ti, da kupiš od mene zlatá očiščenega v ognji, da obogatiš; in oblačila bela, da jih oblečeš, in da se ne pokaže sramota nagosti tvoje; in z mazilom pomaži oči svoje, da bodeš videl. 
[3:19] Jaz katere ljubim, kaznujem in pokorim; prizadevaj si torej in izpokori se. 
[3:20] Glej, pred vrati stojim in trkam; če kdo čuje glas moj in odpre vrata, vnidem k njemu, in večerjal bodem z njim in on z menoj. 
[3:21] Kdor premaga, dal mu bodem, da sedí z menoj na prestolu mojem, kakor sem tudi jaz premagal in sedel z očetom svojim na prestol njegov. 
[3:22] Kdor ima uho, naj sliši, kaj Duh govori občinam. 
[4:1] Po tem sem videl in glej: duri odprte v nebu, in glas prvi, katerega sem slišal, kakor trombe govoreče z menoj, govoreč: Stopi sem gor, in pokažem ti, kaj se ima zgoditi po tem. 
[4:2] In hitro sem bil v duhu, in glej: prestol je stal na nebu, 
[4:3] In na prestolu sedeč; in sedeči je bil enak na videz kamenu jaspidu in sardu, in mavra okrog prestola na videz enaka smaragdu. 
[4:4] In okrog prestola prestolov dvajset in štirje; in na prestolih sem videl štiri in dvajsetero starejšin sedečih, oblečenih z belimi oblačili, in imeli so na svojih glavah vence zlate. 
[4:5] In iz prestola izhajajo bliski in gromi in glasovi; in sedem bakelj ognjenih gorečih pred prestolom, katere so sedmeri duhovi Božji; 
[4:6] In pred prestolom morje stekleno, enako kristalu. In na sredi prestola in okrog prestola štiri živali, polne očes spredaj in zadaj. 
[4:7] In prva žival enaka levu, in druga žival enaka teletu, in tretja žival imajoča obličje kakor človek; in četrta žival enaka orlu letečemu. 
[4:8] In četvere živali, vsaka zase, imele so po šest peroti na okolo, in znotraj polne očés; in pokoja nimajo noč in dan govoreč: Svet, svet, svet, Gospod Bog vsemogočni, kateri je bil in je in bode. 
[4:9] In kader bodejo dale živali slavo in čast in hvalo sedečemu na prestolu, živečemu na vekov veke, 
[4:10] Padli bodo štiri in dvajseteri starejšine pred sedečega na prestolu in molili živečega na vekov veke in vrgli vence svoje pred prestol, govoreč: 
[4:11] Vreden si, Gospod, prejemati slavo in čast in moč; ker ti si vstvaril vse stvari, in po volji tvoji so in so bile vstvarjene. 
[5:1] In videl sem na desni sedečega na prestolu knjigo pisano znotraj in zadaj, zapečateno sè sedmémi pečati. 
[5:2] In videl sem angela mogočnega oznanjujočega z velikim glasom: Kdo je vreden odpreti knjigo, in odpeti sedmere pečate njene? 
[5:3] In nihče ni mogel na nebu, ne na zemlji, ne pod zemljo odpreti knjige, ne gledati je. 
[5:4] In jaz sem jokal silno, da ni bil nihče za vrednega najden odpreti in brati knjigo, ne gledati je. 
[5:5] In eden izmed starejšin mi reče: Ne jokaj; glej, zmagal je lev, ki je iz roda Judovega, korenina Davidova, odpreti knjigo in odpeti sedmere pečate njene. 
[5:6] In videl sem, in glej: na sredi prestola in četverih živali in v sredi starejšin, jagnje stoječe kakor zaklano, imajoč sedem rogov in očés sedem, katera so sedmeri duhovi Božji, poslani na vso zemljo. 
[5:7] In prišlo je in vzelo knjigo iz desnice sedečega na prestolu. 
[5:8] In ko je bilo vzelo knjigo, padle so četvere živali in štiri in dvajseteri starejšine pred jagnje, imajoč vsak strune in zlate čaše, polne kadil, katera so molitve svetnikov; 
[5:9] In pojó pesem novo, govoreč: Vredno si prejeti knjigo in odpeti pečate njene; ker si bilo zaklano in si nas odkupilo Bogu s krvjó svojo, iz vsakega rodú in jezika in ljudstva in naroda; 
[5:10] In storilo si nas Bogu našemu za kralje in duhovnike; in kraljevali bodemo na zemlji. 
[5:11] In videl sem in slišal sem glas mnogih angelov okrog prestola in živali in starejšin, in bilo je njih število mirijad mirijade, in tisočev tisoči, 
[5:12] Govorečih z glasom velikim: Vredno je jagnje zaklano prejeti moč in bogastvo in modrost in krepost in čast in slavo in hvalo. 
[5:13] In vsaka stvar, katera je na nebu in na zemlji in pod zemljo, in na morji kar je, in kar je v njih vse, čul sem govoreče: Sedečemu na prestolu in jagnjetu hvala in čast in slava in moč na vekov veke! 
[5:14] In četvere živali so rekle: Amen! In štiri in dvajseteri starejšine padli so in molili živečega na vekov veke. 
[6:1] In videl sem, ko je jagnje odpelo enega izmed pečatov, in čul sem eno izmed štirih živali govorečo kakor groma glas: Pridi in glej! 
[6:2] In videl sem, in glej: konj bél, in sedeči na njem imajoč lok; in dal se mu je venec in izšel je zmagovit in da zmaga. 
[6:3] In ko je odpelo drugi pečat, čul sem drugo žival govorečo: Pridi in glej! 
[6:4] In izšel je drug konj rujav, in sedečemu na njem dalo se je vzeti mir sè zemlje, in da naj se koljejo med seboj; in dal se mu je meč velik. 
[6:5] In ko je odpélo tretji pečat, čul sem tretjo žival govorečo: Pridi in glej! In videl sem, in glej: konj črn, in sedeči na njem imajoč tehtnico v roki svoji. 
[6:6] In slišal sem glas v sredi četverih živali govoreč: Merica pšenice za en denar, in tri merice ječmena za en denar; in olju in vinu ne stórí hudega. 
[6:7] In ko je odpelo pečat četrti, slišal sem glas četrte živali govoreč: Pridi in glej! 
[6:8] In videl sem, in glej: konj bled, in sedeči na njem, imé mu smrt, in pekel ga spremlja; in dala se jima je oblast pomoriti četrtino zemlje z mečem in lakoto in kugo, in od zveri zemeljskih. 
[6:9] In ko je odpelo peti pečat, videl sem pod oltarjem duše zaklanih zavoljo besede Božje in zavoljo pričanja, katero so imeli. 
[6:10] In vpile so z glasom velikim rekoč: Doklej, o Gospod sveti in resnični ne sodiš in ne maščuješ krvi naše nad njimi, ki prebivajo na zemlji? 
[6:11] In dala so se jim vsaki bela oblačila, in reklo se jim je, naj bodo pokojne še malo časa, dokler ne izpolnijo tudi sohlapci njih in bratje njih, kateri imajo biti umorjeni, kakor tudi oné. 
[6:12] In videl sem, ko je odpelo pečat šesti; in glej, potres velik je postal, in solnce je postalo črno kakor vreča raševa; 
[6:13] In mesec je postal kakor kri, in zvezde nebeške so padale na tla, kakor meče smokva zimsko sadje svoje, ko jo trese velik veter; 
[6:14] In nebo je izginilo kakor knjiga, ko se zvije, in vse gore in otoki premaknili so se sè svojih mest. 
[6:15] In kralji zemeljski in velikaši in bogatini in polkovniki in mogočniki in vsi hlapci in vsi svobodnjaki skrili so se v jame in v skale gorske, 
[6:16] In rekó goram in skalam: Padite na nas in skrite nas obličju sedečega na prestolu in jezi jagnjetovi; 
[6:17] Ker prišel je dan véliki, jeze njegove in kdo more stati? 
[7:1] In po tem sem videl štiri angele stoječe na četverih voglih zemlje, držeč četvere vetrove zemlje, da ne veje veter po zemlji, ne po morji, ne po nobenem drevesu. 
[7:2] In videl sem druzega angela vzhajajočega od solnčnega vzhoda, imajočega pečat Boga živega; in zavpil je z glasom velikim četverim angelom, katerim je bilo dano kaziti zemljo in morje, govoreč: 
[7:3] Ne kazite zemlje, ne morja, ne dreves, dokler ne zapečatimo hlapcev Boga našega na čelih njihovih. 
[7:4] In čul sem število zapečatenih: sto in štiri in štirideset tisoč zapečatenih iz vseh rodov sinov Izraelovih: 
[7:5] Iz rodú Judovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Rubenovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Gadovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih. 
[7:6] Iz rodú Azerovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Neftalejmovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Manasejevega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; 
[7:7] Iz rodú Simeonovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Levijevega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Isaharjevega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; 
[7:8] Iz rodú Zabulonovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Jožefovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih; iz rodú Benjaminovega dvanajst tisoč zapečatenih. 
[7:9] Potem sem videl, in glej: druhal velika, katere sešteti nihče ni mogel, iz vseh narodov in rodov in ljudstev in jezikov, stoječi pred prestolom in pred jagnjetom, oblečeni z belimi oblačili, in palme v njih rokah; 
[7:10] In vpijoči z glasom velikim, rekoč: Zveličanje Bogu našemu sedečemu na prestolu in jagnjetu! 
[7:11] In vsi angeli so stali okrog prestola in starejšin in četverih živali in padli so pred prestolom na obličje svoje in molili so Boga, rekoč: 
[7:12] Amen! Hvala in slava in modrost in zahvala in čast in moč in krepost Bogu našemu na vekov veke! Amen. 
[7:13] In odgovoril je eden izmed starejšin rekoč mi: Ti, oblečeni z oblačili belimi, kdo so, in odkod so prišli? 
[7:14] In rekel sem mu: Gospod, ti veš. In reče mi: Ti so oni, ki gredó iz stiske vélike in oprali so oblačila svoja in pobelili oblačila svoja v krvi jagnjetovi. 
[7:15] Zato so pred prestolom Božjim in strežejo mu noč in dan v svetišči njegovem. In sedeči na prestolu bode prebival nad njimi. 
[7:16] Lačni ne bodo več, ne žejni več, in nanje ne pade solnce, ne vročina nobena; 
[7:17] Kajti jagnje na sredi prestola bode jih paslo in vodilo jih do živih studencev vodâ; in obrisal bode Bog vsako solzo z njih oči. 
[8:1] In ko je odpelo pečat sedmi, nastalo je molčanje na nebu kake pol ure. 
[8:2] In videl sem sedmere angele, kateri stojé pred Bogom, in dalo se jim je sedem tromb. 
[8:3] In drug angelj je prišel in stopil pred oltar, držeč zlato kadilnico; in dalo se mu je kadil mnogo, da jih daruje za molitve vse svetih na oltar zlati pred prestolom. 
[8:4] In šel je kvišku dim kadil za molitve svetih iz roke angelove pred Boga. 
[8:5] In angelj vzame kadilnico, in napolni jo iz ognja oltarja in vrže na zemljo. In nastali so glasovi in gromi in bliski in potres. 
[8:6] In sedmeri angeli imajoč sedmere trombe pripravijo se, da zatrobijo. 
[8:7] In prvi angelj zatrobi in nastane toča in ogenj, namešena s krvjó, in vrže se na zemljo, in tretjina drevés je pogoréla in vsa trava zelena je pogorela. 
[8:8] In drugi angelj zatrobi, in kakor gora velika z ognjem goreča vrže se v morje; in tretjina morja postane kri. 
[8:9] In tretjina stvarî pomrje v morji, ki imajo življenje, in tretjina ladij se razbije. 
[8:10] In tretji angelj zatrobi, in z neba pade zvezda velika goreča kakor baklja, in pade na tretjino rék in na studence vodâ. 
[8:11] In ime zvezde se imenuje; Pelin; in tretjina vodâ postane pelin in mnogo ljudî je umrlo od vodâ, ker so bile ogrenéle. 
[8:12] In četrti angelj zatrobi, in udarjena je bila tretjina solnca in tretjina meseca in tretjina zvezd, da otemni tretjina njih in dan ne sije, tretjina njegova, in noč enako. 
[8:13] In videl sem, in slišal sem enega angela letečega po sredi neba, govorečega z glasom velikim: Gorjé, gorje, gorje prebivalcem na zemlji zaradi ostalih glasov trombe treh angelov, kateri bodejo trobili. 
[9:1] In peti angelj zatrobi, in videl sem zvezdo iz neba padšo na zemljo, in dal se ji je ključ od vodnjaka brezna; 
[9:2] In odpre vodnjak brezna, in privali se dim iz vodnjaka, kakor dim peči velike, in solnce otemni in zrak od dima iz vodnjaka. 
[9:3] In iz dima izidejo kobilice na zemljo, in dá se jim oblast, kakor imajo oblast škorpijoni zemljé; 
[9:4] In reče se jim, naj ne storé hudega travi zemljé, ne kaki zelenjavi, ne kakemu drevesu, razen ljudém samim, kateri nimajo pečata Božjega na čelih svojih. 
[9:5] In dá se jim, da naj jih ne pomoré, nego da naj se mučijo pet mesecev; in mučenje njih kakor mučenje škorpijona, kader piči človeka. 
[9:6] In v tistih dnevih iskali bodo ljudje smrti, in ne bodo je našli; in želeli bodo umreti, in smrt bode bežala od njih. 
[9:7] In podobe kobilic enake konjem, pripravljenim na vojsko, in na njih glavah venci enaki zlatu, in obličja njih kakor obličja človeška; 
[9:8] In imele so lasé kakor lasé ženske; in zobje njih bili so kakor levov; 
[9:9] In imele so oklepe kakor oklepe železne; in glas njih peroti kakor glas mnogih vóz s konji, tekočimi v vojsko. 
[9:10] In repe imajo enake škorpijonom, in žela so bila na njih repih; in oblast njih škodovati ljudém mesecev pet. 
[9:11] In nad seboj imajo kralja angela brezna; ime mu po hebrejsko: Abadon, in po grško ima ime: Pogubnik. 
[9:12] Gorjé eno je prešlo; glej, še dvoje gorjé pride po tem! 
[9:13] In šesti angelj zatrobi, in slišal sem glas eden iz četverih rogóv oltarja zlatega pred Bogom, 
[9:14] Kateri je rekel šestemu angelu, ki je imel trombo: Reši četvere angele, zvezane ob réki veliki, Evfratu. 
[9:15] In rešili so se četveri angeli, pripravljeni na uro in dan in mesec in leto, da pomoré tretjino ljudî. 
[9:16] In število vojskâ konjištva dvé mirijadi mirijad; in čul sem njih število. 
[9:17] In tako sem videl konje v prikazni, in sedeče na njih imajoč oklepe ognjene in temnorudeče in žvepljene; in glave kónj kakor glave levov, in iz ust njih izhaja ogenj in dim in žveplo. 
[9:18] Ti trije pobili so tretjino ljudî, ogenj in dim in žveplo izhajajoče iz njih ust. 
[9:19] Kajti njih oblasti so v njih ustih; ker njih repi so enaki kačam, imajoč glave, in z njimi škodijo. 
[9:20] In ostali ljudje, kateri niso bili pomorjeni s temi šibami, niso se izpokorili od del svojih rok, da bi ne molili hudih duhóv in malikov zlatih in srebrnih in bronastih in kamenenih in lesenih, kateri ne morejo ne gledati, ne slišati, ne hoditi; 
[9:21] In niso se izpokorili od moritev svojih, in ne od čaranj svojih, in ne od kurbarije svoje, in ne od svojih tatvin. 
[10:1] In videl sem druzega angela mogočnega, idočega dol z nebá, oblečenega z oblakom, in mavra na glavi; in obličje njegovo kakor solnce, in nogi njegovi kakor stebri ognjeni; 
[10:2] In imel je v roki svoji knjižico odprto; in postavil je nogo svojo desno na morje, levo pa na zemljo; 
[10:3] In zavpil je z glasom velikim, kakor rjove lev; in ko je zavpil, govorili so sedmeri gromovi glase svoje; 
[10:4] In ko so sedmeri gromovi govorili glase svoje, hotel sem pisati; in čul sem glas iz neba govoreč mi: Zapečati, kar so govorili sedmeri gromovi, in ne piši tega. 
[10:5] In angelj, katerega sem videl stoječega na morji in na zemlji, vzdigne roko svojo v nebo, 
[10:6] In priseže pri živem na vekov veke, kateri je vstvaril nebo in kar je v njem, in zemljo in kar je na njej; in morje in kar je v njem: Časa ne bode več; 
[10:7] Nego o dnevih glasú sedmega angela, ko bode trobil, izpolni se skrivnost Božja, kakor je bil obljubil hlapcem svojim, prerokom. 
[10:8] In glas, ki sem ga čul iz neba, govoril je zopet z menoj in rekel: Pojdi, vzemi knjižico odprto v roki angela, stoječega na morji in na zemlji; 
[10:9] In odšel sem k angelu, govoreč mu; Daj mi knjižico. In reče mi: Vzemi in pojej jo! in zagrenila bode trebuh tvoj, a v ustih tvojih bode sladka kakor med. 
[10:10] In vzamem knjižico iz roke angelove, in pojém jo. In bila je v ustih mojih kakor med sladka; in ko sem jo bil pojedel, zagrenel je trebuh moj. 
[10:11] In reče mi: Zopet moraš prerokovati pri ljudstvih in narodih in jezikih in kraljih mnogih. 
[11:1] In dá se mi pero enako palici; in angelj je stal rekoč: Vstani in izmeri svetišče Božje, in oltar in kateri molijo v njem; 
[11:2] In vežo znotraj svetišča vrzi ven, in ne meri je, ker je dana bila poganom; in mesto sveto bodejo teptali dva in štirideset mesecev. 
[11:3] In dal bodem dvema pričama svojima, in prerokovali bodeti tisoč dve sto šestdeset dnî oblečeni z vrečami. 
[11:4] To sti oliki dvé in svečnika dva stoječa pred Bogom zemlje. 
[11:5] In če jima hoče kdo kaj žalega storiti, izide jima ogenj iz ust in požre njijne sovražnike; in če jima hoče kdo kaj žalega storiti, mora tako umorjen biti: 
[11:6] Té imati oblast nebo zapreti, da ne dežuje v dnevih njijnega prerokovanja; in oblast imati nad vodami, izpremeniti jih v kri, in bíti zemljo z vsako šibo, kolikorkrat hočeti. 
[11:7] In kader bodeti izpolnili pričanje svoje, bode zver, ki vzhaja iz brezna, vojsko napravila z njima in zmagala ji in umorila ji. 
[11:8] In trupli njijni na ulicah mesta vélikega, katero se imenuje duhovno Sodoma in Egipt, kjer je bil tudi Gospod naš križan. 
[11:9] In gledali bodo iz ljudstev in rodov in jezikov in narodov trupli njijni tri dnî in pol, in trupel njijnih ne bodo pustili dejati v grobe. 
[11:10] In prebivalci na zemlji bodo se veselili nad njima in se radovali, in dari si bodo pošiljali med seboj, ker sta ta dva preroka mučila prebivalce na zemlji. 
[11:11] In po treh dnevih in pol izšel je življenja duh iz Boga na njiju, in stala sta na noge svoje, in strah velik je padel na one, ki so ji gledali. 
[11:12] In čula sta glas velik z neba govoreč jima: Pojta sem gor! In šla sta gor na nebo v oblaku in videli so ji sovražniki njijni. 
[11:13] In v tisti uri nastal je potres velik, in desetina mesta je padla in pobitih je bilo v potresu imen človeških sedem tisoč, in ostali bili so v strahu in dajali so slavo Bogu nebeškemu. 
[11:14] Gorje drugo je prešlo: glej, gorje tretje pride hitro! 
[11:15] In sedmi angelj zatrobi, in nastanejo glasovi veliki na nebu govoreči: Kraljestva sveta so postala Gospoda našega in Kristusa njegovega, in kraljeval bode na vekov veke. 
[11:16] In štiri in dvajseteri starejšine, sedeči pred Bogom na prestolih svojih, padli so na obličja svoja, in molili Boga rekoč: 
[11:17] Zahvaljujemo se ti, Gospod Bog vsemogočni, kateri je in je bil in bode, da si prejel moč véliko svojo in si zakraljeval. 
[11:18] In narodi so se razsrdili, in prišla je jeza tvoja, in čas mrtvih, da se sodijo, in se dá plačilo hlapcem tvojim prerokom in svetnikom in boječim se imena tvojega, vélikim in malim, in da se pogubé, kateri pogubljajo zemljo. 
[11:19] In odpre se svetišče Božje na nebu; in videla se je skrinja zaveze njegove v svetišči njegovem; in nastali so bliski in glasi in gromovi in potres in toča velika. 
[12:1] In znamenje veliko se je videlo na nebu: žena oblečena sè solncem, in mesec pod njenimi nogami, in na glavi njeni venec dvanajsterih zvezd; 
[12:2] In noseča kriči v bolečinah in mukah porodnih. 
[12:3] In videlo se je drugo znamenje na nebu, in glej: zmaj velik, ognjen, imajoč sedem glav in rogov deset, in na glavah njegovih sedem dijademov; 
[12:4] In rep njegov potegne tretjino zvezd nebeških in jih vrže na zemljo. In zmaj stopi pred ženo, katera ima poroditi, da, ko bode porodila, požre dete njeno. 
[12:5] In rodila je sina, kateri bode pasel vse narode s palico železno; in zgrabljeno je bilo dete njeno pred Boga in prestol njegov. 
[12:6] In žena je bežala v puščavo, kjer ima kraj pripravljen od Boga, da jo tam živé dnî tisoč dvé sto šestdeset. 
[12:7] In nastala je vojska na nebu; Mihael in angeli njegovi so se vojskovali zoper zmaja, in zmaj se je vojskoval in angeli njegovi; 
[12:8] In niso zmogli, in mesto njih ni se več našlo na nebu; 
[12:9] In vržen je bil zmaj véliki, kača stara, z imenom hudič, in satan, ki slepi vesoljni svet, vržen je bil na zemljo, in angeli njegovi so bili vrženi z njim. 
[12:10] In čul sem glas velik, govoreč na nebu: Zdaj je zveličanje in moč in kraljestvo postalo Boga našega in oblast Kristusa njegovega; ker vržen je dol naših bratov tožnik, kateri jih je tožil pred Bogom našim noč in dan. 
[12:11] In oni so ga premagali po krvi jagnjetovi, in po besedi pričanja svojega, in ljubili niso življenja svojega do smrti. 
[12:12] Zato veselite se nebesa in kateri prebivate v njih; gorjé prebivalcem zemlje in morja, ker dol je šel hudič k vam imajoč jezo veliko, vedoč, da ima malo časa. 
[12:13] In ko je videl zmaj, da je vržen na zemljo, preganjal je ženo, ki je rodila sina. 
[12:14] In dali ste se ženi dve peroti orla vélikega, da poleti v puščavo, na kraj svoj, kjer se živi tam čas in čase in časa pol, od obličja kače. 
[12:15] In vrgla je kača zad za ženo iz ust svojih vodo kakor reko, da bi jo reka odnesla. 
[12:16] In pomogla je ženi zemlja, in odprla je zemlja usta svoja in popila reko, katero je bil vrgel zmaj iz svojih ust. 
[12:17] In razsrdi se zmaj nad ženo in gre napravit vojsko z ostalimi semena njenega, kateri hranijo zapovedi Božje in imajo pričanje Jezusa Kristusa. 
[12:18] 
[13:1] In stal sem na pesku morskem; in videl sem iz morja zver vzhajajočo, ki je imela sedem glav in rogov deset; in na rogovih njenih deset dijademov in na glavah njenih ime preklinjanja. 
[13:2] In zver, katero sem videl, bila je enaka pardalu, in noge njene kakor medvedove in usta njena kakor usta levova. In dal ji je zmaj moč svojo in prestol svoj in oblast veliko. 
[13:3] In videl sem eno izmed glav njenih kakor zaklano na smrt; in rana smrtna njena se je ozdravila, in čudila se je vsa zemlja zad za zverjo. 
[13:4] In molili so zmaja, kateri je bil dal oblast zveri, in molili so zver, govoveč: Kdo zveri enak? Kdo more vojskovati se z njo? 
[13:5] In dala so se ji usta govoreča stvari velike in preklinjanja. In dala se ji je oblast napraviti vojsko štirideset mesecev in dva; 
[13:6] In odprla je usta svoja v preklinjanje proti Bogu, preklinjati ime njegovo in šator njegov in prebivalce v nebesih. 
[13:7] In dalo se ji je napraviti vojsko sè svetniki in premagati jih; in dala se ji je oblast nad vsemi rodovi in jeziki in narodi. 
[13:8] In molili jo bodo vsi, ki prebivajo na zemlji, katerih imena niso zapisana v knjigi življenja jagnjeta zaklanega od ustanovitve sveta. 
[13:9] Če ima kdo uho, naj sliši. 
[13:10] Če kdo robstvo vodi, v robstvo hodi. Če bode kdo z mečem moril, mora umoriti se z mečem. Tukaj je stanovitnost in vera svetnikov. 
[13:11] In videl sem drugo zver vzhajajočo iz zemlje; in imela je dva rogova, enaka jagnjetu, in govorila je kakor zmaj; 
[13:12] In vso oblast prve zveri dela pred njo; in dela zemljo in prebivalce njene, da naj molijo prvo zver, kateri se je bila ozdravila rana smrti njene; 
[13:13] In dela znamenja velika, da napravi tudi, da pada ogenj z neba na zemljo pred ljudmi. 
[13:14] In slepí prebivalce na zemlji sè znamenji, katera ji je bilo dano delati pred zverjo, rekoč prebivalcem na zemlji, naj naredé podobo zveri, katera ima rano od meča in je oživela. 
[13:15] In dano ji je bilo dati duh podobi zveri, da naj tudi govori podoba zveri in storí, da naj se umoré, kateri ne molijo podobe zveri. 
[13:16] In storí, da se vsem malim ter vélikim, in bogatim ter ubogim, in svobodnim ter hlapcem dá znamenje na desno njih roko, ali na njih čela. 
[13:17] In da naj nihče ne more kupovati ali prodajati, razen kdor ima znamenje, ali ime zveri, ali število imena njenega. 
[13:18] Tukaj je modrost. Kdor ima razum, izračuni naj število zveri; kajti število je človeško; in število njegovo šest sto šest in šestdeset. 
[14:1] In videl sem, in glej: jagnje stoječe na gori Sijonski in z njim sto štiri in štirideset tisočeri, imajoč ime očeta njegovega zapisano na čelih svojih. 
[14:2] In slišal sem glas iz neba kakor glas mnogih vodâ, in kakor groma velikega glas; in glas sem slišal citralcev citrajočih na citre svoje. 
[14:3] In pojó kakor pesem novo pred prestolom, in pred četverimi živalmi in starejšinami; in nihče se ni mogel naučiti pesmi, razen sto štiri in štirideset tisočeri, odkupljeni od zemlje. 
[14:4] Ti so, kateri se niso oskrunili se ženami; device so namreč. Ti so, ki hodijo za jagnjetom kamorkoli ide. Ti so bili odkupljeni od ljudî, prvina Bogu in jagnjetu; 
[14:5] In v ustih njihovih ni se našla zvijača; kajti brez madeža so pred prestolom Božjim. 
[14:6] In videl sem druzega angela letečega po sredi neba, imajočega evangelj večni oznanjati prebivalcem na zemlji, in vsem narodom in rodom in jezikom in ljudstvom; 
[14:7] Govorečega z glasom velikim: Bojte se Boga, in dajte mu slavo, ker prišla je ura sodbe njegove; in molite njega, ki je naredil nebo in zemljo in morje in studence vodâ. 
[14:8] In drug angelj je šel za njim, govoreč; Padel je, padel Babilon, mesto véliko, ker je z omotnim vinom kurbarije napojilo vse narode. 
[14:9] In tretji angelj pride za njima, govoreč z glasom velikim: Če kdo moli zver in podobo njeno, in vzame znamenje na čelo svoje, ali na roko svojo; 
[14:10] Bode tudi on pil od omotnega vina Božjega, katero je čisto mešano v čaši jeze njegove; in mučil se bode v ognji in žveplu pred svetimi angeli in pred jagnjetom. 
[14:11] In njih mučenja dim vzhaja na vekov veke; in oddihljaja nimajo noč in dan, kateri molijo zver in podobo njeno; in če vzame kdo znamenje njenega imena. 
[14:12] Tukaj je stanovitnost svetnikov; tukaj kateri hranijo zapovedi Božje in vero Jezusovo. 
[14:13] In slišal sem glas z neba govoreč mi: Piši: Blagor mrtvim, kateri umrjó v Gospodu posedaj. Dà, pravi Duh, odpočijejo se naj od trudov svojih; dela pa njih gredó za njimi. 
[14:14] In videl sem, in glej: oblak bel, in na oblaku sedeč enak sinu človeškemu, imajoč na glavi svoji venec zlat, in v roki svoji oster srp. 
[14:15] In drug angelj izide iz svetišča, vpijoč z glasom velikim sedečemu na oblaku; Pošlji srp svoj in žanji, kajti prišla ti je žetve ura, ker posušila se je žetev zemlje. 
[14:16] In sedeči na oblaku vrže srp svoj na zemljo, in žela se je zemlja. 
[14:17] In drug angelj izide iz svetišča na nebu, imajoč tudi on oster srp. 
[14:18] In drug angelj izide do oltarja, imajoč oblast nad ognjem, in zavpije z glasom velikim imajočemu srp ostri rekoč: Pošlji srp svoj ostri in odreži grozdje trte zemeljske; kajti dozorele so jagode njene. 
[14:19] In angelj vrže srp svoj na zemljo, in obrezaval je trto zemeljsko, in metal v tlačilnico véliko jeze Božje. 
[14:20] In tlačila se je tlačilnica zunaj mesta, in izšla je kri iz tlačilnice noter do vajetov kónj, tisoč šest sto stadij daleč. 
[15:1] In videl sem drugo znamenje na nebu veliko in čudovito: sedem angelov imajočih sedmero šib skrajnih, ker se je v njih izpolnila jeza Božja. 
[15:2] In videl sem kakor morje stekleno, namešano z ognjem, in zmagovalce nad zverjo in nad podobo njeno in nad znamenjem njenim, nad številom imena njenega, stoječe ob morji steklenem, imajoč citre Božje. 
[15:3] In pojó pesem Mojzesa, hlapca Božjega, in pesem jagnjetovo, govoreč: Velika in čudovita dela tvoja, Gospod Bog vsemogočni; pravična in resnična pota tvoja, kralj svetnikov! 
[15:4] Kdo bi se te ne bal, Gospod, in ne slavil tvojega imena? Ker sam si svet; ker vsi narodi bodo prišli in molili pred teboj; ker razodele so se sodbe tvoje. 
[15:5] In potem sem videl, in glej: odpre se svetišče šatorja pričanja na nebu; 
[15:6] In izidejo sedmeri angeli, imajoč sedmero šib iz svetišča, oblečeni s platnom čistim in svetlim, in opasani okolo prsi sè zlatimi pasi. 
[15:7] In iz četverih živali dá ena sedmerim angelom sedem čaš zlatih, polnih jeze Boga živega na vekov veke. 
[15:8] In napolni se svetišče dima od slave Božje in od moči njegove; in nihče ni mogel vniti v svetišče, dokler se ne izpolnijo sedmere šibe sedmerih angelov. 
[16:1] In slišal sem glas velik iz svetišča govoreč sedmerim angelom: "Pojdite in izlijte čaše jeze Božje na zemljo. 
[16:2] In otide prvi ter izlije čašo svojo na zemljo; in naredi se ulé hudo in strupeno na ljudî imajoče znamenje zveri, in nje, ki so molili njeno podobo. 
[16:3] In drugi angelj izlije čašo svojo v morje; in naredi se kri kakor mrliča; in vsaka duša živa umrje v morji. 
[16:4] In tretji angelj izlije čašo svojo v reke in studence vodâ; in naredi se kri. 
[16:5] In slišal sem angela vodâ govorečega: Pravičen si, Gospod, kateri si in si bil in sveti, ker si to sodil; 
[16:6] Ker kri svetnikov in prerokov so prelili, in krvi si jim dal piti; kajti vredni so. 
[16:7] In slišal sem druzega od oltarja govorečega: Dà, Gospod, Bog vsemogočni, resnične in pravične so sodbe tvoje. 
[16:8] In četrti angelj izlije čašo svojo na solnce; in dalo se mu je ljudî izžgati v ognji; 
[16:9] In izžgali so se ljudje v silni vročini, in preklinjali so ime Boga, ki ima oblast do teh šib, in niso se izpokorili, da bi mu slavo dajali. 
[16:10] In peti angelj izlije čašo svojo na prestol zveri; in kraljestvo njeno je otemnélo; in grizli so si jezike svoje od muke, 
[16:11] In preklinjali so Boga nebeškega od muk svojih in od ulés svojih, in niso se izpokorili od svojih del. 
[16:12] In šesti angelj izlije čašo svojo na reko véliko Evfrat; in posuši se voda njena, da se pripravi pot kraljev od solnčnega vzhoda. 
[16:13] In videl sem iz ust zmajevih in iz ust zveri in iz ust lažipreroka tri nečiste duhove enake žabam; 
[16:14] So namreč duhovi hudičev, ki delajo znamenja, kateri izhajajo na kralje zemlje in vesoljnega sveta, da jih zberó na vojsko tistega velikega dné Boga vsemogočnega. 
[16:15] Glej, pridem kakor tat, in blagor mu, kdor čuje in hrani oblačila svoja, da ne hodi nag in ne gledajo sramote njegove. 
[16:16] In zbere jih na kraj imenovan po hebrejsko: Harmagedon. 
[16:17] In sedmi angelj izlije čašo svojo v zrak; in izšel je glas velik od svetišča nebeškega, izpred prestola, govoreč: Zgodilo se je! 
[16:18] In nastanejo glasovi in gromi in bliski, in potres nastane velik, kakoršnega ni bilo, odkar so ljudje bili na zemlji; tolik potres, tako velik! 
[16:19] In mesto véliko postane na tri dele, in mesta narodov padejo; in Babilona vélikega so se spomnili pred Bogom, dati mu čašo vina omotnega jeze njegove. 
[16:20] In vsi otoki so bežali, in gorâ ni bilo najti. 
[16:21] In toča velika, skoraj talent težka pada dol iz neba na ljudî; in preklinjali so ljudje Boga zaradi šibe toče, ker velika je šiba njena silno. 
[17:1] In prišel je eden iz sedmerih angelov, imajočih sedmere čaše, in govoril je z menoj, rekoč mi: Sem! pokažem ti sodbo kurbe vélike, sedeče ob mnogih vodah; 
[17:2] S katero so se kurbali kralji zemeljski, in upijanili so se z vinom kurbarije njene zemlje prebivalci. 
[17:3] In odnese me v puščavo v duhu; in videl sem ženo sedečo na zveri škrlatni, polni imen preklinjanja, imajoči sedem glav in rogov deset. 
[17:4] In žena oblečena z bagrom in škrlatom in pozlačena sè zlatom in dragim kamenjem in biseri, imajoč zlato čašo v roki svoji, polno gnjusob in nečistosti kurbarije svoje, 
[17:5] In na čelu svojem ime zapisano: Skrivnost, Babilon véliki, mati kurb in gnjusob zemlje! 
[17:6] In videl sem ženo pijano krvi svetnikov, in krvi pričevalcev Jezusovih; in čudil sem se, videč jo, čudom silnim. 
[17:7] In reče mi angelj: Zakaj se čudiš? Jaz ti povem skrivnost žene in zveri, katera jo nosi, katera ima sedem glav in rogov deset. 
[17:8] Zver, katero si videl, bila je, in ni je, in priti ima gor iz brezna in iti v pogubo. In čudili se bodo prebivalci na zemlji, (katerih imena niso zapisana v knjigi življenja od ustanovitve sveta), gledajoč zver, katera je bila in je ni, dasi je. 
[17:9] Tukaj razum, kateri ima modrost. Sedmere glave so sedem gorâ, kjer žena sedí na njih, in so kraljev sedem. 
[17:10] Pet jih je padlo in eden je, drugi ni še prišel; in kader pride, sme malo časa ostati. 
[17:11] In zver, katera je bila in je ni, je sam osmi, in je izmed sedmerih in gre v pogubo. 
[17:12] In deseteri rogovi, katere si videl, so deset kraljev, kateri še niso prejeli kraljestva, ali oblast kakor kralji prejmó eno uro sè zverjo. 
[17:13] Ti imajo eno misel, in moč in oblast svojo izročé zveri. 
[17:14] Ti se bodo vojskovali z jagnjetom, in jagnje jih bode zmagalo, ker je gospodov Gospod in kraljev Kralj, in z njim poklicani in izvoljeni in zvesti. 
[17:15] In govori mi: Vode, katere si videl, kjer kurba sedí, ljudstva so in druhali, in narodi in jeziki. 
[17:16] In deseteri rogovi, katere si videl na zveri, ti bodejo sovražili kurbo in jo pusto naredili in golo, in meso njeno pojedli in njo sežgali v ognji. 
[17:17] Kajti Bog je dal v srca njih, da storé misel njegovo, in da storé eno misel, in dadó kraljestvo svoje zveri, dokler se ne izvršé besede Božje. 
[17:18] In žena, katero si videl, je mesto véliko, katero ima kraljestvo nad kralji zemljé. 
[18:1] In po tem sem videl angela idočega dol z nebá, imajočega oblast veliko; in zemlja se je razsvetlila od slave njegove. 
[18:2] In zavpije v moči z glasom velikim govoreč: Padel je, padel Babilon véliki, in postal je prebivališče hudičev, in ječa vseh nečistih duhov, in ječa vseh nečistih in sovraženih tičev. 
[18:3] Ker od vina omotnega kurbarije njene so pili vsi narodi, in kralji zemeljski so se kurbali z njo; in trgovci zemljé so obogateli od premoči njene. 
[18:4] In slišal sem drug glas z neba govoreč: Izidite iz nje, ljudstvo moje, da se ne udeležite grehov njenih, in da ne dobite od njenih šib; 
[18:5] Kajti grehi njeni so dospeli do neba, in spomnil se je Bog krivic njenih. 
[18:6] Vrnite ji, kakor je tudi ona vam vračala, in podvojite ji dvojno po delih njenih; v čaši, v kateri je mešala, mešajte ji dvojno. 
[18:7] Kolikor se je poveličala in preširno živela, toliko ji dajte muke in žalosti: ker v prsih svojih govori: Kraljica sedim, in vdova nisem, in žalosti ne bodem videla, 
[18:8] Za to pridejo v enem dnevi šibe njene, smrt in žalost in lakot; in v ognji se bode sežgala; kajti močan je Gospod Bog, ki jo sodi. 
[18:9] In jokali bodo in žalovali za njo kralji zemlje, kateri so se kurbali z njo in preširno živeli, ko bodo videli dim požara njenega, 
[18:10] Od daleč stoječ v strahu pred muko njeno, govoreč: Gorjé, gorjé, mesto veliko, Babilon, mesto močno, ker v eni uri je prišla sodba tvoja. 
[18:11] In trgovci zemlje jokajo in žalujejo za njo, ker blaga njih nihče več ne kupuje; 
[18:12] Blaga v zlatu in srebru in drazem kamenji in biserji in bisu in bagru in svili in škrlatu, in vsakoterega lesa vonjavega in vsakoterega orodja slonokoščenega, in vsakoterega orodja iz lesa predrazega in brona in železa in mramorja; 
[18:13] In sladke skorje in dišav in mire in kadila, in vina in olja, in bele moke in pšenice, in goved in ovác, in kónj in vóz, in teles in duš človeških. 
[18:14] In sadje poželenja duše tvoje je odšlo od tebe, in vse veličastvo in vsa sijajnost je odšla od tebe, in večjih ne najdeš. 
[18:15] Trgovci s tem, ki so obogateli od nje, stali bodo od daleč v strahu pred muko njeno, jokajoč in žalujoč in govoreč: 
[18:16] Gorje, gorje, mesto véliko, oblečeno z bisom in bagrom in škrlatom, in pozlačeno sè zlatom in dragim kamenjem in biserji; kajti v eni uri je opustošeno toliko bogastvo! 
[18:17] In vsi krmarji, in vsi na ladijah, druhal in brodniki in kateri obdeljujejo morje, stali so od daleč, 
[18:18] In vpili so videč dim požara njenega, govoreč: Katero je enako mestu vélikemu? 
[18:19] In vrgli so prahú na glave svoje in vpili so jokajoč in žalujoč, govoreč: Gorje, gorje, mesto véliko, v katerem so obogateli vsi, kateri imajo ladije na morji, od dragocenosti njegove; kajti v eni uri se je opustošilo. 
[18:20] Veséli se njega, nebo, in sveti aposteljni in preroki, ker je Bog sodil sodbo vašo nad njim. 
[18:21] In dvignil je en angelj, močán, kamen, velik kakor mlinski kamen in vrgel v morje, govoreč: Tako v napadu bode vržen Babilon, mesto véliko, in ne najde se več. 
[18:22] In glas citralcev in godcev in piskačev in trobentačev naj se ne čuje več v tebi, in noben umeteljnik kake umeteljnosti naj se ne najde več v tebi, in mlina glas naj se v tebi več ne čuje, 
[18:23] In svetilnice luč naj ne sveti več v tebi, in glas ženina in neveste naj se ne čuje več v tebi; ker trgovci tvoji bili so velikaši zemljé, ker v čarovniji tvoji tavali so vsi narodi. 
[18:24] In v njem se je našla kri prerokov in svetnikov in vseh zaklanih na zemlji. 
[19:1] In po tem sem čul kakor glas druhali mnoge, velik na nebu, govoreč: Aleluja! zveličanje in slava in čast in moč Gospodu Bogu našemu! 
[19:2] Kajti resnične in pravične so sodbe njegove; ker sodil je kurbo véliko, katera je pačila zemljo s kurbarijo svojo, in maščeval je hlapcev svojih kri od roke njene. 
[19:3] In drugič so rekli: Aleluja! In dim njen vzhaja na vekov veke. 
[19:4] In padli so starejšine štiri in dvajseteri, in četvere živali, in molili so Boga sedečega na prestolu, rekoč: Amen, aleluja! 
[19:5] In glas je izšel iz prestola, govoreč: Hvalite Boga našega, vsi hlapci njegovi in boječi se njega, in mali in véliki! 
[19:6] In čul sem kakor glas druhali mnoge, in kakor glas mnogih vodâ, in kakor glas gromov močnih, govorečih: Aleluja, ker zakraljeval je Gospod, Bog vsemogočni. 
[19:7] Veselimo se in radujmo in dajajmo slavo njemu! Ker prišlo je ženitovanje jagnjetovo, in pripravila se je nevesta njegova. 
[19:8] In dalo se ji je, da se obleče z bisom čistim in svetlim; bis namreč so pravice svetnikov. 
[19:9] In reče mi: Piši: Blagor jim, kateri so poklicani na gostí ženitovanja jagnjetovega. In reče mi: To so besede resnične Božje. 
[19:10] In padel sem pred noge njegove, molit ga; in reče mi: Nikar! Sohlapec sem tvoj in izmed bratov tvojih imajočih pričanje Jezusovo; Boga móli; kajti pričanje Jezusovo je duh prerokovanja. 
[19:11] In videl sem nebo odprto in glej: bel konj, in sedeči na njem imenovan zvesti in resnični, in v pravici sodi ter se vojskuje. 
[19:12] Oči pa njegove kakor plamen ognjen, in na glavi njegovi mnogi dijademi; imel je ime zapisano, katerega nihče ne zna, razen on; 
[19:13] In ogrnen z oblačilom pomočenim s krvjo, in imenuje se ime njegovo: Beseda Božja. 
[19:14] In vojske v nebesih šle so za njim na belih konjih, oblečeni z bisom belim in čistim; 
[19:15] In iz ust njegovih izhaja oster meč, da z njim udarja narode, in on jih bode pasel s šibo železno, in on tepta tlačilnico vina srdú in jeze Boga vsemogočnega. 
[19:16] In ima na obleki in na bedru svojem ime zapisano: Kralj kraljev in gospodov Gospod. 
[19:17] In videl sem enega angela stoječega v solnci; in zavpil je z glasom velikim, govoreč vsem tičem, letajočim po sredi nebá: Pridite in zbirajte se na kosilo Boga vélikega, 
[19:18] Da jeste meso kraljev in meso polkovnikov in meso mogočnih, in meso kónj in sedečih na njih, in meso vseh svobodnih in hlapcev, in majhnih in velikih; 
[19:19] In videl sem zver in kralje zemljé in njih vojske zbrane, vojskovat se sè sedečim na konji, in z vojsko njegovo. 
[19:20] In zgrabljena je bila zver, in z njo lažiprerok, kateri je delal znamenja pred njo, s katerimi je slepil njé, ki so bili sprejeli znamenje zveri, in njé, ki so molili podobo njeno; živa sta bila vržena ta dva v jezero ognjeno, sè žveplom goreče. 
[19:21] In drugi so bili pomorjeni z mečem sedečega na konji, z onim, ki je izhajal iz ust njegovih; in vsi tiči so se pasli z njih mesom. 
[20:1] In videl sem angela, idočega dol z nebes, imajočega od brezna ključ, in verigo veliko na roki svoji. 
[20:2] In zgrabi zmaja, staro kačo, katera je hudič in satan, in zveže ga tisoč let, 
[20:3] In vrže ga v brezno, in zapre ga in zapečati nad njim, da ne slepi več narodov, dokler se ne izpolni tisoč let; in potem se mora rešiti nekaj časa. 
[20:4] In videl sem prestole, in sedli so nanje in sodba se je dala njim, in duše obglavljenih zaradi pričanja Jezusa in zaradi besede Božje, in kateri niso molili zveri, ne podobe njene, in niso sprejeli znamenja na čelo svoje in na roko svojo; in živeli so ter kraljevali s Kristusom tisoč let. 
[20:5] Drugi pa mrtvi niso oživeli, dokler se ne izpolni tisoč let. To je vstajenje prvo. 
[20:6] Srečen in svet, kdor ima del v prvem vstajenji; do teh druga smrt nima oblasti; nego duhovniki bodo Božji in Kristusovi, in kraljevali bodo z njim tisoč let. 
[20:7] In ko se bode izpolnilo tisoč let, reši se satan iz ječe svoje, 
[20:8] In izide slepit narode na četverih voglih zemlje, Goga in Magoga, zbirat jih na vojsko, katerih število je kakor pesek morski. 
[20:9] In šli so gor na zemlje širjavo, in obdali so šatorišče svetnikov in mesto ljubljeno; in padel je ogenj od Boga z néba, in požrl jih je; 
[20:10] In hudič, ki jih je slepil, bil je vržen v jezero ognjeno in žvepljeno, kjer je zver in lažiprerok; in mučili se bodo noč in dan na vekov veke. 
[20:11] In videl sem bél prestol, velik, in sedečega na njem, kateremu izpred obličja je bežala zemlja in nebo, in ni se jima našlo mesto. 
[20:12] In videl sem mrtve, majhne in velike, stoječe pred Bogom, in odprle so se knjige; in odprla se je druga knjiga, katera je knjiga življenja; in sodili so se mrtvi po tem, kar je pisano v knjigah, po delih svojih. 
[20:13] In dalo je morje mrtve iz sebe; in smrt in pekel dala sta mrtve iz sebe; in sodili so se vsak po delih svojih. 
[20:14] In smrt in pekel sta bila vržena v jezero ognjeno; ta je druga smrt. In če se kdo ni našel zapisan v knjigi življenja, vržen je bil v jezero ognjeno. 
[20:15] 
[21:1] In videl sem nebo novo in zemljo novo; kajti prvo nebo in zemlja prva je prešla, in morja ni več. 
[21:2] In jaz Janez sem videl mesto sveto, Jeruzalem novi, idoče dol od Boga iz nebes, napravljeno kakor nevesta odičena ženinu svojemu; 
[21:3] In čul sem glas velik iz nebes govoreč: Glej, šator Božji med ljudmi, in bival bode med njimi; in oni bodo ljudstva njegova, in Bog sam bode med njimi, Bog njih. 
[21:4] In Bog bode obrisal vse solze z njih oči, in smrti ne bode več; ne žalovanja ne kričanja, in truda ne bode več; kajti prvo je prešlo. 
[21:5] In rekel je sedeči na prestolu: Glej, novo vse naredim. In reče mi: Piši; ker té besede so resnične in zveste. 
[21:6] In reče mi: Zgodilo se je. Jaz sem A in O, začetek in konec. Jaz bodem dal žejnemu iz studenca vode življenja zastonj. 
[21:7] Kdor premaga, podedoval bode vse, in bodem mu Bog, in on mi bode sin. 
[21:8] Strahopetnim pa in nevernim in ostudnim in morilcem in kurbirjem in zavdajalcem in malikovalcem in vsem lažnjivcem, delež njih je v jezeru gorečim z ognjem in žveplom, kar je druga smrt. 
[21:9] In k meni pride eden izmed sedmerih angelov, imajočih sedmero čaš, polnih sedmerih šib skrajnih, in govoril je z menoj rekoč: Sèm! pokažem ti ženo nevesto jagnjetovo. 
[21:10] In odnese me v duhu na goro veliko in visoko, in pokaže mi mesto véliko, Jeruzalem sveti, ki shaja od Boga z nebá; imajoč slavo Božjo. 
[21:11] In svetloba njegova enaka kamenu predragemu, kakor kamenu jaspidu prezornemu; 
[21:12] In imajoč zid velik in visok, imajoč dvanajst vrât, in na vratih angelov dvanajst, in imena na njih zapisana, katera so dvanajsterih rodov sinov Izraelovih; 
[21:13] Proti vzhodu troje vrat, proti severju troje vrat, proti jugu troje vrat, proti zahodu troje vrat. 
[21:14] In zid mestni imajoč vkladnikov dvanajst, in na njih imena dvanajsterih aposteljnov jagnjetovih. 
[21:15] In govoreči z menoj imel je merilo zlato, da izmeri mesto in vrata njegova in zid njegov. 
[21:16] In mesto leži na štiri vogle, in dolžava njegova tolikošna kolikoršna tudi širjava. In izmeril je mesto z merilom na stadijev dvanajst tisoč; dolžava in širjava in višava njegova so enake. 
[21:17] In izmeril je zid njegov sto in štiri in štirideset lahtí, človeška mera, katera je angelova. 
[21:18] In steber zidú njegovega je bil jaspid, in mesto čisto zlato, enako steklu čistemu. 
[21:19] In vkladniki zidú mestnega odičeni z vsem dragim kamenjem; vkladnik prvi jaspid, drugi safir, tretji kalcedon, četrti smaragd, 
[21:20] Peti sardoniks, šesti sard, sedmi krizolit, osmi beril, deveti topáz, deseti krizopráz, enajsti hijacint, dvanajsti ametist. 
[21:21] In dvanajstera vrata dvanajst biserov; vsaka vrata so bila iz enega bisera. In ulice mestne čisto zlato, kakor steklo prozorno. 
[21:22] In svetišča nisem videl v njem; kajti Gospod, Bog vsemogočni, je svetišče njegovo, in jagnje. 
[21:23] In mesto ne potrebuje solnca, ne meseca, da svetita v njem; kajti slava Božja ga je razsvetlila, in svetilnica njegova je jagnje. 
[21:24] In narodi zveličanih bodo hodili v luči njegovi; in kralji zemlje nosijo slavo in čast svojo vanje. 
[21:25] In vrata njegova se ne zaklepajo podnevi; kajti noči ne bode tam; in nosili bodo slavo in čast narodov vanje. 
[21:26] In vanje ne vnide nič nizkega, ne kar dela gnjusobo in laž; samo kateri so zapisani v življenja knjigi jagnjetovi. 
[21:27] 
[22:1] In pokazal mi je čisto reko vode življenja, svetlo kakor kristal, izhajajočo iz prestola Božjega in jagnjetovega. 
[22:2] Sredi ulic njegovih in reke tam pa tam drevo življenja, ki dela sadov dvanajst, vsak mesec dajoč sad svoj; in listje drevesovo je v ozdravljenje narodov. 
[22:3] In nobenega prokletstva ne bode več; in prestol Božji in jagnjetov bode v njem; in hlapci njegovi bodo mu služili; 
[22:4] In gledali bodo obličje njegovo, in ime njegovo na njih čelih. 
[22:5] In noči ne bode tam; in potreba jim ni svetilnice in uči solnčne, ker Gospod Bog jih razsvetljuje; in kraljevali bodo na vekov veke. 
[22:6] In reče mi: Té besede so gotove in resnične; in Gospod, svetih prerokov Bog, poslal je angela svojega, kazat hlapcem svojim, kaj se ima zgoditi hitro. 
[22:7] Glej, hitro pridem. Blagor mu, kdor hrani besede prerokovanja té knjige! 
[22:8] In jaz Janez sem, ki sem videl to in slišal; in ko sem slišal in videl, padel sem molit pred noge angelove, kateri mi je to kazal. 
[22:9] In reče mi: Nikar! kajti sohlapec sem tvoj in izmed bratov tvojih, prerokov, in njih, ki hranijo besede te knjige; Boga môli. 
[22:10] In reče mi: Ne zapečati besed prerokovanja te knjige; ker čas je blizu. 
[22:11] Kdor dela krivico, naj jo dela še, in kdor je nesnažen bodi še nesnažen; in pravični opravičuj se še, in sveti naj se še posvečuje. 
[22:12] In glej, hitro pridem, in plačilo moje z menoj povrnit vsakemu, kakor bode delo njegovo. 
[22:13] Jaz sem A in O, začetek in konec, prvi in zadnji. 
[22:14] Blagor jim, kateri delajo zapovedi njegove, da bode njih oblast do drevesa življenja, in skozi vrata vnidejo v mesto. 
[22:15] Zunaj pa psi in čarovniki in kurbirji in morilci in malikovalci, in vsak, kdor ljubi in dela laž. 
[22:16] Jaz Jezus poslal sem angela svojega, pričat vam to po občinah. Jaz sem korenina in rod Davidov, zvezda svetla in jutranja. 
[22:17] In Duh in nevesta govorita: Pridi! in kdor sliši, naj reče: Pridi! in kdor je žejen, pridi, in kdor hoče, vzemi vodo življenja zastonj! 
[22:18] Pričam namreč vsakemu, kdor sliši besede prerokovanja té knjige: Če temu kdo pridene, njega zadene Bog sè šibami, zapisanimi v tej knjigi. 
[22:19] In če kdo odvzame od besed knjige tega prerokovanja, odvzame mu Bog dél njegov od knjige življenja, in iz mesta svetega in kar je pisano v tej knjigi. 
[22:20] On, ki to priča, govori: Dà, hitro pridem. Amen, dà, pridi, Gospod Jezus! 
[22:21] Milost Gospoda našega Jezusa Kristusa z vami vsemi! Amen.
