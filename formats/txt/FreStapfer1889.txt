### Matthew

[1:1] Table généalogique de Jésus-Christ, fils de David, fils d'Abraham

[1:5] Salmon engendra Boès, qu'il eut de Rachab ; Boès engendra Jobed, qu'il eut de Ruth ; Jobed engendra Jessaï ;
[1:6] Jessaï engendra David, le roi David engendra Salomon, qu’il eut de la femme d'Urie ;
[1:7] Salomon engendra Roboam ; Roboam engendra Abia ; Abia engendra Asaph ;
[1:8] Asaph engendra Josaphat ; Josaphat engendra Joram ; Joram engendra Ozeia ;

[1:10] Ezéchias engendra Manassé ; Manassé engendra Amon ; Amon engendra Josias ;

[1:17] En tout donc, d'Abraham jusqu'à David : quatorze générations. — De David jusqu'à la déportation à Babylone : quatorze générations. — De la déportation à Babylone jusqu'au Christ: quatorze générations.
[1:18] Voici comment Jésus-Christ vint au monde : Marie, sa mère, après avoir été fiancée à Joseph et avant qu'ils eussent vécu ensemble, se trouva enceinte par l'Esprit saint.
[1:19] Or Joseph, son mari, était un juste. Ne voulant pas lui faire affront, il résolut de rompre avec elle sans bruits.
[1:20] Comme il était en cette pensée, un ange du Seigneur lui apparut en songe et lui dit : «Joseph, fils de David, n'hésite pas à recevoir chez toi, ta femme, Marie, car ce qu'elle a conçu est de l'Esprit saint.
[1:21] Elle mettra un fils au monde et tu lui donneras le nom de Jésus ; c'est lui, en effet, qui sauvera son peuple de ses péchés.»
[1:22] (Or tout cela arriva afin que fût accompli ce que le Seigneur avait dit par le prophète en ces mots :
[1:23] «Voici la vierge sera enceinte ; elle mettra un fils au monde ; Et on lui donnera le nom d'Emmanuel» ce qui signifie : Dieu avec nous.)
[1:24] Joseph, à son réveil, agit d'après les ordres de l'ange du Seigneur : il reçut sa femme chez lui ;
[1:25] et il ne la connut point avant qu'elle eût mis au monde un fils auquel il donna le nom de Jésus.
[2:1] Jésus étant né à Bethléem, dans la Judée, aux jours du roi Hérode, des mages arrivèrent d'Orient à Jérusalem.
[2:2] «Où est, demandèrent-ils, le nouveau-né, roi des Juifs? Nous avons vu son étoile en Orient et nous sommes venus pour l'adorer.»
[2:3] En entendant de telles paroles, le roi Hérode fut troublé et, avec lui, toute la ville de Jérusalem ;
[2:4] il convoqua tous les chefs des prêtres et scribes du peuple et s'informa d'eux où devait naître le Christ.
[2:5] Ils lui répondirent : «A Bethléem dans la Judée.» (Voici, en effet, ce qui a été écrit par le prophète :
[2:6] «Et toi, Bethléem, terre de Juda, Tu n'es certainement pas le plus petit des chefs-lieux de Juda, Car de toi sortira un conducteur Qui paîtra mon peuple, Israël.»)
[2:7] Là dessus, Hérode fit appeler les mages en secret et s'informa auprès d'eux de l'époque où l'étoile avait paru.
[2:8] Puis il les envoya à Bethléem. «Allez, leur dit-il, prenez des informations exactes sur cet enfant et, quand vous l'aurez trouvé, faites-le moi savoir, pour que, moi aussi, j'aille l'adorer.»
[2:9] Sur ces paroles du roi, ils partirent ; et l'étoile qu'ils avaient vue en Orient les précédait jusqu'à ce que, parvenue au-dessus du lieu où était l'enfant, elle s'arrêta.
[2:10] A la vue de l'étoile, ils se réjouirent d'une grande joie.
[2:11] Ils entrèrent dans la maison, ils virent l'enfant avec Marie sa mère ; et, se prosternant, ils l'adorèrent. Ensuite, ouvrant leurs trésors, ils lui offrirent en présent de l'or, de l'encens et de la myrrhe.
[2:12] Ayant été miraculeusement avertis en songe de ne pas revenir vers Hérode, ils regagnèrent leur pays par un autre chemin.
[2:13] Après leur départ, un ange du Seigneur apparut en songe à Joseph et lui dit : «Lève-toi! prends l'enfant et sa mère, et fuis en Égypte où tu resteras jusqu'à ce que je te reparle ; car Hérode va rechercher l'enfant afin de le faire périr.»
[2:14] Cette nuit même, Joseph se leva, prit l'enfant et sa mère et partit pour l'Égypte.
[2:15] Il y resta jusqu'à la mort d'Hérode. (C'était afin que fût accompli ce que le Seigneur avait dit par le prophète en ces mots : «J'ai rappelé mon fils d'Égypte».)
[2:16] Quant à Hérode, se voyant joué par les mages, il se mit fort en colère, et envoya tuer tous les enfants de Bethléem et de ses environs âgés de deux ans et au-dessous suivant l'époque dont il s'était informé auprès des mages.
[2:17] (C'est alors que fut accompli ce qui avait été dit par le prophète Jérémie en ces mots :
[2:18] «Une voix a été entendue dans Rama, Des pleurs et de longs sanglots ; C'est Rachel pleurant ses enfants, Et elle ne veut pas être consolée parce qu'ils ne sont plus.»)
[2:19] Quand Hérode fut mort, un ange du Seigneur apparut en songe à Joseph en Égypte
[2:20] et lui dit : «Lève-toi, prends l'enfant et sa mère et retourne dans le pays d'Israël ; car ceux qui en voulaient à la vie de l'enfant sont morts.»
[2:21] Joseph se levant donc prit l'enfant et sa mère et rentra dans le pays d'Israël.
[2:22] Mais ayant appris qu'Archélaüs régnait en Judée à la place d'Hérode son père, il appréhenda d'y aller. Miraculeusement averti en songe, il partit pour la province de Galilée
[2:23] et, y étant arrivé, il habita une ville appelée Nazareth. (C'était afin que fut accompli ce qui a été dit par les prophètes : Il sera appelé Nazaréen).
[3:1] En ces jours-là, parut Jean-Baptiste, prêchant dans le désert de la Judée.
[3:2] Il disait : «Repentez-vous, car le Royaume des cieux est proche.»
[3:3] (C'est Jean que le prophète Ésaïe a annoncé quand il a dit: «Une voix crie dans le désert : Préparez la voie du Seigneur ; Aplanissez ses sentiers. » )
[3:4] Il avait un vêtement de poil de chameau, et une ceinture de cuir autour des reins. Sa nourriture était des sauterelles et du miel sauvage.
[3:5] Alors accouraient à lui et la ville de Jérusalem et toute la Judée et toute la région du Jourdain.
[3:6] Tous étaient baptisés par lui dans le fleuve, en confessant leurs péchés.
[3:7] Mais, voyant beaucoup de Pharisiens et de Sadducéens venir à son baptême, il leur dit : «Engeance de vipères, qui vous a appris à fuir la colère à venir?
[3:8] Produisez donc un fruit digne de la repentance ;
[3:9] et ne prétendez pas dire en vous-mêmes : nous avons pour père Abraham ; car, je vous le dis, Dieu peut faire surgir des pierres que voici des enfants à Abraham.
[3:10] Déjà la cognée touche la racine des arbres. Tout arbre donc qui ne produit pas de bon fruit sera coupé et jeté au feu.
[3:11] Moi je vous baptise avec l'eau pour la repentance, mais celui qui doit venir après moi est plus puissant que moi et je ne suis pas même digne d'être le porteur de ses sandales ; lui vous baptisera avec l'Esprit saints et le feu.
[3:12] Il a le van dans la main, et il nettoiera son aire, et rassemblera son froment dans le grenier, mais la paille, il la brûlera au feu inextinguible.»
[3:13] Ce fut alors que Jésus vint de la Galilée au Jourdain, vers Jean, pour être baptisé par lui.
[3:14] Mais Jean s'en défendait vivement : «C'est moi, disait-il, qui ai besoin d'être baptisé par toi, et c'est toi qui viens à moi!»
[3:15] Jésus lui répondit par ces paroles : (Laisse-moi faire pour l'heure présente, car c'est ainsi qu'il nous convient d'accomplir toute justice.» Alors il le laissa faire.
[3:16] Jésus, ayant été baptisé, sortit aussitôt de l'eau, et voilà que les cieux furent ouverts, et il vit l'Esprit de Dieu descendre sous la figure d'une colombe et venir sur lui.
[3:17] En même temps une voix vint des cieux disant : «Celui-ci est mon Fils, le bien-aimé en qui je me complais.»
[4:1] Jésus ensuite fut conduit par l'Esprit dans le désert pour y être tenté du diable.
[4:2] Lorsqu'il eut jeûné pendant quarante jours et quarante nuits, il finit par avoir faim.
[4:3] Si tu es Fils de Dieu, lui dit le tentateur en s'approchant, dis que ces pierres deviennent des pains.»
[4:4] Mais Jésus lui fit cette réponse : «Il est écrit : «Ce n'est pas de pain seulement que vivra l'homme, mais de toute parole qui sort de la bouche de Dieu.»
[4:5] Alors le diable le mena avec lui dans la ville sainte et le plaça sur le faite du Temple.
[4:6] Si tu es Fils de Dieu, lui dit-il, jette-toi en bas ! car il est écrit : «A ses anges il donnera des ordres à ton égard ; Ils te soutiendront de leurs mains De peur que ton pied ne se heurte contre une pierre.»
[4:7] Jésus lui répondit : «Il est également écrit : «Tu ne tenteras point le Seigneur ton Dieu.»
[4:8] Le diable le mena encore avec lui sur une montagne d'une immense hauteur et lui montra tous les royaumes du monde et leur gloire
[4:9] et lui dit : «Tout cela, je te le donnerai, si, tombant à mes pieds, tu m'adores.»
[4:10] Jésus lui répondit : «Arrière, Satan! car il est écrit : «Tu adoreras le Seigneur ton Dieu et c'est à lui seul que tu rendras un culte.»
[4:11] Alors le diable le laissa ; et voilà que des anges s'approchèrent et ils le servaient.
[4:12] Ayant appris que Jean avait été livré, Jésus se retira en Galilée ;
[4:13] et, ayant quitté Nazareth, il vint s'établir à Capharnaüm, ville du rivage sur les confins de Zabulon et de Nephthali
[4:14] (C'était afin que fût accompli ce qui avait été dit par le prophète Ésaïe :
[4:15] «Terre de Zabulon et terre de Nephthali sur le chemin de la mer, au delà du Jourdain, Galilée des païens!
[4:16] Le peuple assis dans les ténèbres a vu une grande lumière! Et sur ceux qui étaient assis dans la région et dans l'ombre de la mort une lumière s'est levée !»)
[4:17] Dès lors, Jésus commença à parler en public et à dire : «Repentez-vous ; car le Royaume des cieux est proche.»
[4:18] Marchant le long de la mer de Galilée, il vit deux frères, Simon (celui qu'on appelle Pierre) et André son frère, jetant leur filet dans la mer ; car ils étaient pêcheurs ;
[4:19] et il leur dit : Venez à ma suite, et je ferai de vous des pêcheurs d'hommes.»
[4:20] Eux aussitôt, laissant les filets, le suivirent.
[4:21] Continuant son chemin, il vit deux autres frères, Jacques, fils de Zébédée, et Jean son frère, dans leur barque avec Zébédée leur père, raccommodant leurs filets ; il les appela.
[4:22] Eux aussitôt, laissant la barque et leur père, le suivirent.
[4:23] Jésus parcourait toute la Galilée ; enseignant dans leurs synagogues, prêchant l'Évangile! du Royaume, et guérissant toute maladie et toute infirmité parmi le peuple,
[4:24] et sa renommée se répandit dans la Syrie entière. On lui apporta tous les malades, tous ceux qui étaient atteints de souffrances et de douleurs quelconques, des démoniaques, des lunatiques, des paralytiques et il les guérit.
[4:25] Et de grandes multitudes le suivirent venant de la Galilée, de la Décapole, de Jérusalem, de la Judée et de l'autre rive du Jourdain.
[5:1] Voyant ces multitudes, il gravit la montagne, il y fit sa demeure ; ses disciples s'approchèrent de lui ;
[5:2] et, ouvrant la bouche, il les enseignait, disant :
[5:3] «Heureux les pauvres en esprit, parce que le Royaume des cieux est à eux !»
[5:4] «Heureux ceux qui sont dans l'affliction, parce qu'ils seront consolés!»
[5:5] «Heureux ceux qui sont doux, parce qu’ils auront la terre en héritage!»
[5:6] «Heureux ceux qui ont faim et soif de la justice, parce qu'ils seront rassasiés!»
[5:7] «Heureux les miséricordieux, parce qu'ils obtiendront miséricorde!»
[5:8] «Heureux ceux qui ont le coeur pur, parce qu'ils verront Dieu!»
[5:9] «Heureux les pacifiques, parce qu'ils seront appelés fils de Dieu!»
[5:10] «Heureux ceux qui sont persécutés à cause de la justice, parce que le Royaume des cieux est à eux !»
[5:11] «Heureux serez-vous quand on vous outragera et vous persécutera et qu'on dira faussement toute sorte de mal de vous à cause de moi.
[5:12] Réjouissez-vous, soyez transportés de joie, parce que votre récompense sera grande dans les cieux ; c'est ainsi, en effet, qu'on a persécuté les prophètes qui vous ont précédés.»
[5:13] «Vous êtes le sel de la terre ; si le sel s'affadit, avec quoi lui rendra-t-on sa saveur? Il n'est plus bon à rien, sinon à être jeté dehors et foulé aux pieds par les passants.»
[5:14] «Vous êtes la lumière du monde ; une ville ne peut être cachée quand elle est située sur une montagne.
[5:15] On n'allume pas une lampe pour la mettre sous le boisseau, mais on la met sur le pied-de-lampe et elle luit à tous ceux qui sont dans la maison.
[5:16] Qu'ainsi votre lumière luise devant les hommes, afin qu'ils voient vos bonnes oeuvres et glorifient votre Père qui est dans les cieux.»
[5:17] «Ne pensez pas que je sois venu détruire la Loi ou les Prophètes ; je ne suis pas venu pour détruire, mais pour accomplir ;
[5:18] car je vous le dis en vérité : jusqu'à ce que le ciel et la terre aient passé, il ne disparaîtra de la Loi, ni la plus petite lettre, ni un seul petit traita qui n'ait reçu sa pleine réalisation.
[5:19] Et celui qui annulera un de ces commandements, même le moindre et enseignera les hommes à le faire, sera réputé le moindre dans le Royaume des cieux ; mais celui qui les pratiquera et les enseignera, celui-là sera réputé grand dans le Royaume des cieux.»
[5:20] «Aussi je vous le dis : Si votre justice n'est pas supérieure à celle des Scribes et des Pharisiens vous n'entrerez point dans le Royaume des cieux.»
[5:21] «Vous avez entendu qu'il a été dit aux hommes d'autrefois : «Tu ne tueras point ;» celui qui aura tué sera passible du jugement.
[5:22] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi : Quiconque se met en colère contre son frère sera passible du jugement. Celui qui dira à son frère : Raca, sera passible de la justice du Sanhédrin. Celui qui lui dira : fou, sera passible de la Géhenne du feu.»
[5:23] «Lors donc que tu présentes ton offrande à l'autel et que là tu te souviens que ton frère a quelque chose contre toi,
[5:24] laisse là ton offrande, devant l'autel, et va d'abord te réconcilier avec ton frère ; et puis, viens présenter ton offrande.»
[5:25] «Mets-toi d'accord avec ton adversaire, promptement, pendant que tu es encore en chemin avec lui, de peur que cet adversaire ne te livre au juge, et le juge à celui qui exécute ses sentences, et que tu ne sois jeté en prison.
[5:26] Tu n'en sortiras pas, je te le dis en vérité, que tu n'aies payé jusqu'au dernier quadrant.»
[5:27] Vous avez entendu qu'il a été dit : «Tu ne commettras point d'adultère»
[5:28] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi : quiconque regarde une femme avec convoitise a déjà, dans son coeur, commis l'adultère avec elle.»
[5:29] «Si ton oeil droit est pour toi une cause de chute, arrache-le et jette-le loin de toi. Il vaut mieux pour toi qu'un de tes membres périsse et que ton corps tout entier ne soit pas jeté dans la Géhenne.
[5:30] Et si ta main droite est pour toi une cause de chute, coupe-la et jette-la loin de toi ; il vaut mieux pour toi qu'un de tes membres périsse et que ton corps tout entier n'aille pas dans la Géhenne.
[5:31] Il a été dit : «Celui qui répudie sa femme doit lui remettre un acte de divorce.»
[5:32] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi : quiconque répudie sa femme — excepté pour cause d'infidélité — l'expose à commettre un adultère et celui qui épouse une femme divorcée, commet un adultère.»
[5:33] Vous avez encore entendu qu'il a été dit aux hommes d'autrefois : «Tu ne te parjureras pas, mais tu t'acquitteras envers le Seigneur de tes serments.»
[5:34] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi, de ne prêter aucune sorte de serment ; ne jurez point par le ciel, car il est le trône de Dieu ;
[5:35] «par la terre», car elle est l'escabeau de ses pieds ; «par Jérusalem», car elle est une ville du Grand Roi.
[5:36] Ne jure pas non plus «sur ta tête», car tu ne peux faire blanc ou noir un seul de tes cheveux.
[5:37] Que votre langage soit: oui, oui ; ou : non, non. Ce qu'on ajoute vient du Malin.»
[5:38] Vous avez entendu qu'il a été dit : «Oe il pour oeil, dent pour dent.»
[5:39] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi : ne résistez point au méchant ; au contraire, si quelqu'un te frappe à la joue droite, présente-lui aussi l'autre.
[5:40] Si quelqu'un veut t'appeler en justice et t'enlever ta tunique, abandonne-lui aussi le manteau ;
[5:41] et si quelqu'un veut te faire faire une corvée d'un mille, fais-en deux pour lui.»
[5:42] «A qui te demande, donne ; de qui veut t'emprunter, ne te détourne pas.»
[5:43] «Vous avez entendu qu'il a été dit : «Tu aimeras ton prochain et tu haïras ton ennemi.»
[5:44] Eh bien, je vous dis, moi : aimez vos ennemis, et priez pour ceux qui vous persécutent,
[5:45] afin que vous deveniez fils de votre Père qui est dans les cieux, car il fait lever son soleil sur les mauvais et sur les bons, et descendre la pluie sur les justes et sur les injustes.
[5:46] Si vous aimez ceux qui vous aiment quelle récompense avez-vous? Les publicains ne le font-ils pas aussi?
[5:47] Et si pour vos frères seuls, vous avez un bon accueil, en quoi dépassez-vous l'ordinaire? Les païens ne le font-ils pas aussi ?»
[5:48] «Soyez donc, vous, parfaits comme votre Père céleste est parfait.»
[6:1] «Gardez-vous de pratiquer votre justice devant les hommes pour en être regardés ; autrement il n'y a pas pour vous de récompense de votre Père qui est dans les cieux.»
[6:2] «Quand donc tu feras l'aumône, ne fais pas sonner de la trompette devant toi, comme font les hypocrites dans les synagogues et dans les rues pour être glorifiés des hommes. En vérité, je vous le dis, ils ont reçu leur récompense.
[6:3] Pour toi, quand tu fais l'aumône, que ta main gauche ignore ce que fait ta main droite,
[6:4] en sorte que ton aumône se fasse dans le secret, et ton Père, qui voit dans le secret, te donnera ce qui t'est dû.»
[6:5] «Lorsque vous prierez, ne soyez pas comme ces hypocrites qui aiment, faisant leur prière, à stationner debout dans les synagogues et dans les angles des places publiques pour être bien en évidence. En vérité, je vous le dis, ils ont reçu leur récompense.
[6:6] Toi quand tu pries, entre dans ta chambre, ferme ta porte, prie ton Père qui est là, dans le secret, et ton Père, qui voit dans le secret, te donnera ce qui t'est dû.»
[6:7] En priant, ne multipliez pas les paroles, comme font les païens ; ils s'imaginent, en effet, que c'est à force de paroles qu'ils se feront exaucer.
[6:8] Ne les imitez point ; car votre Père sait de quoi vous avez besoin avant que vous le lui demandiez.
[6:9] Voici donc comment vous devez prier : «Notre Père, qui es dans les cieux !» «Que ton nom soit sanctifié !»
[6:10] «Que ton Règne vienne!» «Que ta volonté soit faite sur la terre comme dans le ciel!
[6:11] Donne-nous aujourd'hui notre pain quotidien !»
[6:12] «Et remets-nous nos dettes comme nous-mêmes remettons les leurs à nos débiteurs.»
[6:13] «Et ne nous induis pas en tentation, mais délivre-nous du Malin »
[6:14] «Si, en effet, vous remettez aux hommes leurs offenses, votre Père céleste vous remettra aussi les vôtres ;
[6:15] mais si vous ne remettez point aux hommes leurs offenses, votre Père, non plus, ne vous remettra pas vos offenses.»
[6:16] «Quand vous jeûnez, ne prenez pas, comme les hypocrites, un air accablé ; ils se font des visages tout défaits, afin que leur jeûne attire les regards. En vérité, je vous le dis : ils ont reçu leur récompense!
[6:17] Toi, quand tu jeûnes, parfume ta tête et lave ton visage
[6:18] afin que les hommes ne s'aperçoivent pas que tu jeûnes, mais seulement ton Père qui est là, dans le secret, et ton Père, qui voit dans le secret te donnera ce qui t'est dû.»
[6:19] «Ne vous amassez point de trésors sur la terre où le ver et la rouille rongent et où les voleurs pénètrent et dérobent.
[6:20] Mais amassez-vous des trésors dans le ciel, où il n'y a ni ver, ni rouille qui rongent, ni voleurs qui pénètrent et dérobent.
[6:21] Car là où est ton trésor, là sera aussi ton coeur.»
[6:22] La lampe du corps est l'oeil ; si ton oeil n'a rien qui le trouble, ton corps entier sera dans la lumière ;
[6:23] si ton oeil est en mauvais état, ton corps entier sera dans les ténèbres. Si donc la lumière qui est en toi est ténèbres, combien seront profondes ces ténèbres!»
[6:24] «Nul ne peut servir deux maîtres ; ou bien, en effet, il haïra l'un et aimera l'autre ; ou bien il s'attachera au premier et méprisera le second. Vous ne pouvez servir Dieu et Mamôn.
[6:25] Voilà pourquoi je vous dis de ne pas vous inquiéter : pour votre vie de ce que vous mangerez ou de ce que vous boirez ; pour votre corps de quoi vous vous vêtirez. La vie n'est-elle pas plus que la nourriture, et le corps plus que le vêtement.
[6:26] Regardez les oiseaux du ciel ; ils ne sèment ni ne moissonnent, ni ne recueillent en des greniers ; et votre Père céleste les nourrit. Ne valez-vous pas beaucoup plus qu'eux?
[6:27] Qui de vous peut, par toutes ses préoccupations, ajouter une seule coudée à la durée de sa vie.
[6:28] Et quant au vêtement, pourquoi vous en inquiéter? Observez comment croissent les lis des champs. Ils ne travaillent ni ne filent.
[6:29] Cependant, je vous le déclare, Salomon lui-même dans toute sa gloire, n'était pas vêtu comme l'un deux.
[6:30] Si donc cette herbe des champs qui existe aujourd'hui et qui demain sera jetée au four, Dieu la revêt de la sorte, combien plutôt vous-mêmes, hommes de petite foi !»
[6:31] «Donc, ne vous inquiétez pas, disant : «Que mangerons-nous?» ou : «que boirons-nous?» ou : «comment nous vêtirons-nous?»
[6:32] Oui, tout cela les païens s'en enquièrent. Or, votre Père céleste sait bien que vous avez besoin de tout cela.
[6:33] Cherchez premièrement le Royaume et sa justice et toutes ces choses vous seront données par surcroît.»
[6:34] «Donc, ne vous inquiétez pas du lendemain ; le lendemain aura soin de lui-même. A chaque jour suffit sa peine.»
[7:1] «Ne jugez point pour que vous ne soyez point jugés ;
[7:2] car en telle forme que vous jugez vous serez jugés, et la mesure que vous faites aux autres sera votre mesure.
[7:3] Pourquoi regardes-tu la paille qui est dans l'oeil de ton frère? Et la poutre qui est dans ton oeil, tu ne la remarques pas?
[7:4] Et comment dis-tu à ton frère : «laisse-moi ôter cette paille de ton oeil» et cela quand il y a une poutre dans le tien!
[7:5] Hypocrite, ôte d'abord de ton oeil la poutre et alors tu verras à ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère!»
[7:6] «Ne donnez pas aux chiens ce qui est sacré, et ne répandez pas vos perles devant les pourceaux, de peur qu'ils ne les foulent aux pieds et que, se tournant contre vous, ils ne vous déchirent.»
[7:7] «Demandez et il vous sera donné ; cherchez et vous trouverez ; frappez, et il vous sera ouvert ;
[7:8] car quiconque demande reçoit, et qui cherche trouve, et à celui qui frappe on ouvrira.
[7:9] Quel est celui d'entre vous, quand son fils lui demandera du pain, qui lui donnera une pierre?
[7:10] et quand il lui demandera du poisson, lui donnera-t-il un serpent?
[7:11] Si donc, tout mauvais que vous êtes, vous savez donner de bonnes choses à vos enfants, combien plus votre Père qui est dans les cieux, en donnera-t-il de bonnes à ceux qui les lui demandent?»
[7:12] «Tout ce que vous voulez que les hommes vous fassent, faites-le leur aussi : c'est «la Loi et les Prophètes».
[7:13] «Entrez par la porte étroite, parce que large est la porte et spacieuse la voie qui mènent à la perdition, et nombreux sont ceux qui entrent par elle!
[7:14] et parce que étroite est la porte et resserrée la voie qui mènent à la vie, et petit est le nombre de ceux qui la trouvent!»
[7:15] «Prenez garde aux faux prophètes qui viennent à vous, déguisés en brebis et, au dedans, sont des loups rapaces.
[7:16] Vous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits. Est-ce sur des épines que l'on cueille le raisin? sur des chardons les figues?
[7:17] Ainsi tout bon arbre donne de bons fruits ; et le mauvais arbre donne de mauvais fruits.
[7:18] Un bon arbre ne peut donner de mauvais fruits, ni un mauvais arbre donner de bons fruits.
[7:19] Tout arbre qui ne donne pas de bons fruits est coupé et jeté au feu.
[7:20] Donc, vous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits.»
[7:21] «Ce ne sont pas tous ceux qui me disent : «Seigneur! Seigneur ! qui entreront dans le Royaume des cieux, mais celui qui fait la volonté de mon Père qui est dans les cieux.
[7:22] Plusieurs me diront en ce jour-là: «Seigneur! Seigneur! n'est-ce pas en ton nom que nous avons prophétisé? en ton nom que nous avons chassé les démons? en ton nom que nous avons fait beaucoup de miracles?»
[7:23] Et alors je leur dirai hautement : «Je ne vous ai jamais connus!» «Retirez-vous de moi vous qui commettiez l'iniquité.
[7:24] «Celui donc qui entend de moi ces paroles et les met en pratique c'est l'homme sage qui a bâti sa maison sur le roc ;
[7:25] et la pluie est tombée, et les fleuves sont arrivés, et les vents ont soufflé et ont fondu sur cette maison, et elle n'est pas tombée parce qu'elle était fondée sur le roc.»
[7:26] «Et celui qui entend de moi ces paroles et ne les met pas en pratique, c'est l'homme insensé qui a bâti sa maison sur le sable,
[7:27] et la pluie est tombée, et les fleuves sont arrivés et les vents ont soufflé et ont fondu sur cette maison, et elle est tombée, et sa ruine a été grande.»
[7:28] Jésus avait achevé de parler ; les multitudes étaient extrêmement frappées de son enseignement ;
[7:29] en effet, il le donnait comme ayant autorité et non comme leurs Scribes.
[8:1] Quand il descendit de la montagne, de grandes troupes le suivirent.
[8:2] Survint un lépreux qui s'approcha et se prosterna.devant lui : «Seigneur, dit-il, si tu le veux, tu peux me guérir.»
[8:3] Jésus étendit la main, le toucha et dit : «Je le veux, sois guéri» ; et à l'instant il fut guéri de sa lèpre.
[8:4] Jésus ajouta : «Garde-toi de parler de ceci à personne ; mais va te montrer au prêtre et offre le don prescrit par Moïse ; que ce leur soit un témoignage.»
[8:5] Comme il entrait dans Capharnaüm, un centurion s'approcha de lui, lui adressant cette prière :
[8:6] Seigneur, mon serviteur est dans ma maison, étendu sur son lit, paralytique et en proie à de cruelles souffrances.»
[8:7] Jésus lui répondit : «J'irai, et je le guérirai.»
[8:8] Alors le centurion reprit : «Seigneur, je ne suis pas digne que tu entres sous mon toit, mais donne seulement un ordre et mon serviteur sera guéri.
[8:9] Car moi (qui ne suis pourtant qu'un subordonné) j'ai sous mes ordres des soldats, et si je dis à l'un : «va-t'en» — il s'en va ; à l'autre : «viens» — il vient ; à mon esclave : «fais cela — il le fait.»
[8:10] Jésus fut dans l'admiration de ce langage ; et s'adressant à ceux qui le suivaient : «Je vous le dis en vérité, chez personne, même en Israël, je n'ai trouvé une foi aussi grande?
[8:11] Je vous déclare que plusieurs viendront de l'Orient et de l'Occident et se mettront à table avec Abraham, Isaac et Jacob dans le Royaume des cieux,
[8:12] tandis que les fils du Royaume seront jetés dehors dans les ténèbres. Là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.»
[8:13] Ensuite Jésus dit au centurion ; «Va et qu'il te soit fait comme tu as cru.» Et, à cette heure même, le serviteur fut guéri.
[8:14] Arrivé à la maison de Pierre, Jésus vit la belle-mère de celui-ci, couchée ; elle avait la fièvre.
[8:15] Il lui toucha la main et la fièvre disparut ; aussi se leva-t-elle et se mit-elle à les servir.
[8:16] Le soir venu, on lui apporta beaucoup de démoniaques, et d'un mot il chassait les Esprits. Il guérit aussi tous ceux qui étaient malades,
[8:17] afin que fût accompli ce qu'avait annoncé le prophète Ésaïe disant : «C'est lui qui a pris nos infirmités et porté nos maladies.»
[8:18] Voyant de nombreuses troupes autour de lui, Jésus donna l'ordre de passer sur l'autre rive.
[8:19] Alors un Scribe, s'avançant, lui dit : «Maître, je te suivrai partout où tu iras.»
[8:20] Jésus lui répond : «Les renards ont des tanières et les oiseaux du ciel ont des nids ; mais le Fils de l'homme n'a pas où reposer sa tête.»
[8:21] «Seigneur, lui dit un autre des disciples, permets-moi d'aller d'abord ensevelir mon père.»
[8:22] «Suis-moi! Lui répond Jésus, et laisse les morts ensevelir leurs morts!»
[8:23] Il monta dans la barque, suivi de ses disciples.
[8:24] Soudain une grande tempête s'éleva sur la mer, à tel point que la barque était couverte par les vagues. Lui, il dormait.
[8:25] Les disciples s'approchèrent de lui et le réveillèrent. «Sauve-nous, Seigneur, lui dirent-ils, nous périssons !»
[8:26] Il leur répondit : «Pourquoi vous effrayez-vous, hommes de peu de foi?» Alors il se leva, fit des menaces aux vents et à la mer, et il se fit un grand calme.
[8:27] Ces hommes dirent alors remplis d'admiration : «Qui est-il pour que lui obéissent et les vents et la mer?»
[8:28] Quand il fut arrivé à l'autre bord, dans le pays des Gadaréniens, vinrent à sa rencontre deux démoniaques, sortant des sépulcres. Ils étaient si dangereux que personne n'osait passer par ce chemin.
[8:29] Qu'y a-t-il entre nous et toi, fils de Dieu?» se mirent-ils à crier. «Es-tu venu ici pour nous torturer avant le temps.»
[8:30] Or, il y avait, dans l'éloignement, un nombreux troupeau de pourceaux qui paissaient.
[8:31] Les démons lui adressaient cette demande : «Si tu nous chasses, envoie-nous dans ce troupeau de pourceaux.»
[8:32] «Allez !» leur dit Jésus. Alors ils partirent et entrèrent dans les pourceaux ; et voilà que, d'une course impétueuse, le troupeau tout entier se précipita dans la mer et périt dans les flots.
[8:33] Les gardeurs prirent la fuite ; ils allèrent à la ville tout raconter, et ce qui était arrivé aux démoniaques.
[8:34] Là dessus, la ville entière sortit au devant de Jésus, et, quand ces gens le virent ils le prièrent de s'éloigner de leur pays.
[9:1] Montant dans une barque, Jésus repassa l'eau et vint dans sa ville.
[9:2] On lui présenta un paralytique étendu sur un lit. Voyant leur foi, il dit au paralytique : «Courage! mon enfant, tes péchés sont pardonnés.»
[9:3] Il y avait là quelques Scribes. «Cet homme blasphème», se dirent-ils en eux-mêmes ;
[9:4] mais Jésus vit leurs pensées et dit : «Pourquoi pensez-vous le mal dans vos coeurs?
[9:5] Lequel est le plus facile de dire : «Tes péchés sont pardonnés» ou de dire : Lève toi et marche?»
[9:6] Or, afin que vous sachiez que le Fils de l'homme a, sur la terre, le pouvoir de pardonner des péchés lève-toi, dit-il au paralytique, emporte ton lit et retourne dans ta maison.»
[9:7] Il se leva et s'en alla en sa maison.
[9:8] Les multitudes, voyant cela, furent saisies de crainte et rendirent gloire à Dieu de ce qu'il avait donné une telle puissance aux hommes.
[9:9] Jésus, parti de là, vit, en passant, un homme, appelé Matthieu, assis au bureau du péage. Il lui dit ; «Suis-moi.» Matthieu se leva et le suivit.
[9:10] Jésus étant à table dans la maison de Matthieu, il arriva que beaucoup de publicains et de pécheurs, étant survenus, s'y trouvèrent avec lui et avec ses disciples.
[9:11] Ce que voyant, les Pharisiens dirent à ses disciples : «Pourquoi votre Maître mange-t-il avec les publicains et les pécheurs?»
[9:12] Jésus les entendit : «Ce ne sont pas, dit-il, les gens bien portants qui ont besoin de médecin ; ce sont les malades.»
[9:13] Allez apprendre le sens de cette parole : «Je veux miséricorde et non pas sacrifice ;» car je ne suis pas venu appeler des justes, mais des pécheurs.»
[9:14] Alors les disciples de Jean s'approchèrent de lui et lui demandèrent : «Pourquoi, lorsque nous et les Pharisiens nous jeûnons, tes disciples ne jeûnent-ils pas?»
[9:15] Jésus leur répondit : «Les amis de l'époux peuvent-ils s'attrister durant le temps que l'époux est avec eux? Des jours viendront où l'époux leur sera enlevé, ils jeûneront alors.»
[9:16] «Personne ne met un morceau d'étoffe neuve à un vieux vêtement ; car ce morceau emporte une partie du vêtement qu'il recouvre et fait une plus grande déchirure.
[9:17] Ce n'est pas non plus dans de vieilles outres que l'on verse du vin nouveau ; sans quoi les outres se rompent, le vin se répand et les outres sont perdues. Mais on verse le vin nouveau dans des outres neuves, et tous deux se conservent.»
[9:18] Il leur parlait encore lorsqu'un chef de synagogue entra et se prosterna devant lui. «Ma fille, dit-il, vient de mourir ; mais viens, pose ta main sur elle, et elle vivra.»
[9:19] Jésus se leva et le suivit avec ses disciples.
[9:20] Or une femme, malade d'une perte de sang depuis douze années, s'approcha par derrière et toucha la frange de son vêtement.
[9:21] Car elle se disait à elle-même : «Si seulement je touche son vêtement, je serai guérie.»
[9:22] Jésus se retournant et la voyant, lui dit: «Courage, ma fille, ta foi t'a guérie.» Et à l'instant même la femme fut guérie.
[9:23] Parvenu à la maison du chef, Jésus dit, en voyant tes joueurs de flûtes et la foule qui se livrait à de bruyantes lamentations :
[9:24] «Retirez-vous, cette jeune fille n'est pas morte, mais elle dort.» On se moquait de lui ;
[9:25] mais quand on eut renvoyé tout le monde, il entra, saisit la main de la jeune fille, et elle se réveilla.
[9:26] Le bruit s'en répandit dans tout le pays.
[9:27] Comme Jésus partait de là, deux aveugles le suivirent, criant et disant : «Aie pitié de nous, fils de David!»
[9:28] Il entra dans la maison, les aveugles vinrent l'y trouver : «Croyez vous, leur dit Jésus, que j'aie la puissance de faire cela?» — Ils répondirent: «Oui, Seigneur!»
[9:29] «Qu'il vous soit fait selon votre foi!» dit-il alors en leur touchant les yeux.
[9:30] Et leurs yeux s'ouvrirent. Jésus ajouta d'un ton sévère : «Veillez à ce que nul ne le sache!»
[9:31] Mais eux, s'en étant allés, publièrent sa renommée dans tout ce pays.
[9:32] Après leur départ, on lui présenta un muet qui avait un démon.
[9:33] Et le démon ayant été chassé, le muet parla. Les multitudes disaient dans leur admiration : «On n'a jamais rien vu de semblable en Israël !»
[9:34] Quant aux Pharisiens, ils disaient : «C'est par le Prince des démons qu'il chasse les démons!
[9:35] Jésus cependant parcourait toutes les villes et tous les villages, enseignant dans leurs synagogues, prêchant l'Évangile du Royaume et guérissant toute sorte de maux et d'infirmités.
[9:36] Voyant les multitudes, il fut ému de compassion, car elles étaient comme des brebis sans berger, épuisées et gisantes çà et là.
[9:37] Alors il dit à ses disciples : «La moisson est grande et les ouvriers en petit nombre.
[9:38] Priez donc le maître de la moisson d'envoyer des, ouvriers dans sa moisson.»
[10:1] Et ayant réuni ses douze disciples, il leur donna puissance sur les Esprits impurs pour les chasser, et sur toute maladie et toute infirmité pour la guérir.
[10:2] Voici les noms des douze apôtres : le premier est Simon appelé Pierre, et André, son frère ; — Jacques, fils de Zébédée, et Jean, son frère ; —
[10:3] Philippe et Barthélemi ; — Thomas et Matthieu le, publicain ; — Jacques, fils d'Alphée, et Thaddée ; —
[10:4] Simon le Cananite et Judas l'Iskariôte, — celui-là même qui le trahit.
[10:5] Tels sont les douze que Jésus envoya en mission après leur avoir donné ces instructions : «Ne prenez pas un chemin menant chez les païens, et n'entrez pas dans les villes des Samaritains ;
[10:6] allez de préférence vers les brebis perdues de la maison d'Israël.
[10:7] Allez dire dans vos prédications que le Royaume des cieux est proche.
[10:8] Rendez la santé aux malades, ressuscitez des morts, guérissez des lépreux, chassez des démons.» «Vous avez reçu gratuitement, donnez gratuitement.»
[10:9] «Ne vous munissez ni d'or, ni d'argent, ni de monnaie quelconque dans vos ceintures,
[10:10] ni de sac pour la routes, ni de second vêtement, ni de chaussures, ni d'un bâton, car l'ouvrier est digne de sa nourriture.
[10:11] Dans toute ville, dans tout village où vous entrerez, informez-vous qui est digne de vous recevoir, et demeurez chez lui jusqu'à votre départ.
[10:12] En entrant dans la maison, saluez-la, et si vraiment c'est une digne maison, que votre paix vienne sur elle.
[10:13] Si elle n'est pas digne, que votre paix revienne à vous.»
[10:14] «Si l'on ne vous reçoit pas et si l'on n'écoute pas vos paroles, sortez de cette maison ou de cette ville, en secouant la poussière de vos pieds.
[10:15] En vérité, je vous le dis, il y aura, au jour du jugement, moins de rigueur pour la terre de Sodome et de Gomorrhe que pour cette cité.»
[10:16] Voici que je vous envoie comme des brebis au milieu de loups. Soyez donc prudents comme les serpents et simples comme les colombes.»
[10:17] «Soyez sur vos gardes avec les hommes, car ils vous livreront aux tribunaux et ils vous flagelleront dans leurs synagogues.
[10:18] Et, à cause de moi, vous serez traduits devant des procurateurs et des rois pour être en témoignage à eux et aux païens.
[10:19] Quand on vous livrera, ne vous inquiétez nullement ni de ce que vous direz, ni comment vous le direz ; car ce que vous devrez dire vous sera donné au moment même ;
[10:20] ce ne sera pas vous qui parlerez, mais l'Esprit de votre Père qui parlera en vous.»
[10:21] Un frère livrera son frère à la mort et un père son enfant. Des enfants se soulèveront contre leurs parents et les feront mourir,
[10:22] et vous serez en haine à tout le monde à cause de mon nom. Mais celui qui aura persévéré jusqu'à la fin, celui-là sera sauvé.»
[10:23] Quand ils vous persécuteront dans une ville, fuyez dans une autre ; car, je vous le dis en vérité, vous n'aurez point achevé de parcourir les villes d'Israël que le Fils de l'homme sera venu.»
[10:24] Un disciple n'est pas au-dessus de son maître, ni un esclave au-dessus de son seigneur.
[10:25] Il suffit au disciple d'être comme son maître et à l'esclave comme son seigneur. S'ils ont appelé Beelzéboul le maître de la maison, combien plutôt encore ceux de sa famille.
[10:26] Ne les craignez donc point, car il n'y a rien de caché qui ne doive être révélé, ni de secret qui ne doive être connu.
[10:27] Ce que je vous dis dans les ténèbres, dites-le dans la lumière, et ce que vous entendez à l'oreille, prêchez-le sur les toits.»
[10:28] «Ne craignez pas ceux qui tuent le corps, mais ne peuvent tuer l'âme. Craignez plutôt Celui qui peut faire périr et l'âme et le corps dans la Géhenne.»
[10:29] «Deux passereaux ne se vendent-ils pas un as! Et l'un d'eux, ne tombe pas sur la terre sans votre Père!
[10:30] Jusqu'aux cheveux de votre tête, tous, ils sont comptés !
[10:31] Ne craignez donc point ; vous êtes de plus de valeur que bien des passereaux!»
[10:32] «Qui donc me confessera devant les hommes, je le confesserai moi aussi devant mon Père qui est dans les cieux.
[10:33] Qui me reniera devant les hommes, je le renierai moi aussi devant mon Père qui est dans les cieux.»
[10:34] «Ne pensez pas que je sois venu répandre la paix sur la terre ; je ne suis pas venu répandre la paix, mais jeter le glaive.
[10:35] Je suis venu mettre la division entre l'homme «... Et son père, La fille et sa mère, La belle-fille et sa belle-mère
[10:36] et l'homme aura pour ennemis ceux de sa propre maison.»
[10:37] «Qui aime son père ou sa mère plus que moi n'est pas digne de moi.» «Qui aime son fils ou sa fille plus que moi n'est pas digne de moi.»
[10:38] «Qui ne prend pas sa croix et ne marche pas à ma suite n'est pas digne de moi.»
[10:39] «Sauver sa vie, c'est la perdre! Perdre sa vie à cause de moi, c’est la sauver!
[10:40] «Qui vous reçoit me reçoit, qui me reçoit, reçoit Celui qui m'envoyé.
[10:41] Qui reçoit un prophète à titre de prophète recevra la récompense d'un prophète. Qui reçoit un juste à titre de juste, recevra la récompense d'un juste.
[10:42] Qui aura donné à boire, ne fut-ce qu'un verre d'eau froide à l'un de ces petits qui sont là, à titre de disciple, je vous le dis en vérité, ne perdra point sa récompense.»
[11:1] Après avoir achevé de donner ces instructions aux douze disciples, Jésus partit de là pour aller enseigner et prêcher dans leurs villes.
[11:2] Jean, ayant appris dans sa prison les oeuvres du Christ, lui envoya dire par ses disciples :
[11:3] «Es-tu celui qui doit venir ou devons-nous en attendre un autre?»
[11:4] Pour leur répondre, Jésus leur dit : «Allez annoncer à Jean ce que vous entendez et voyez :
[11:5] des aveugles voient, des estropiés marchent, des lépreux sont guéris, des sourds entendent, des morts ressuscitent, des pauvres entendent l'Évangile.
[11:6] Heureux est celui pour qui je ne serai pas une occasion de chute.»
[11:7] Comme ils s'en allaient, Jésus se mit à parler de Jean aux multitudes : «Au désert, qu'êtes-vous allés voir? Est-ce un roseau agité par le vent?
[11:8] Qu'êtes-vous allés voir? Est-ce un homme aux vêtements efféminés? Mais ceux qui portent des vêtements efféminés sont dans les demeures des rois.
[11:9] Qu'êtes-vous allés voir? Est-ce un prophète? Oui, vous dis-je, et plus qu'un prophète.
[11:10] C'est celui dont il est écrit : «Voici que j'envoie mon messager pour te précéder et préparer ton chemin devant toi».
[11:11] En vérité, je vous le dis, parmi ceux que les femmes ont enfantés, nul ne s'est levé plus grand que Jean-Baptiste ; mais le plus petit dans le Royaume des cieux est plus grand que lui.
[11:12] Depuis les jours de Jean-Baptiste jusqu'à maintenant le Royaume des cieux est pris par violence et les violents s'en emparent.»
[11:13] «Tous les prophètes et la Loi ont exercé, jusqu'à Jean, leur ministère prophétique,
[11:14] et si vous voulez admettre cette parole, lui-même est Élie qui doit venir.
[11:15] Que celui qui a des oreilles entende,
[11:16] «A qui assimilerai-je cette génération-ci : Elle est semblable à des enfants assis sur la place publique, qui crient à leurs camarades :
[11:17] «Nous vous avons joué de la flûte Et vous n'avez pas dansé ; Nous avons entonné des chants lugubres Et vous ne vous êtes pas frappé la poitrine.»
[11:18] «Jean est venu en effet, pratiquant l’abstinence du manger et du boire, et on dit : «Il est possédé d'un démon.»
[11:19] Le Fils de l'homme est venu, mangeant et buvant comme tout le monde, et on dit: «Voilà un amateur de bonne chère, un buveur de vin, un ami des publicains et des pécheurs.» «A la sagesse, les oeuvres qu'elle accomplit rendent justice.»
[11:20] Il commença alors à faire des reproches aux villes dans lesquelles il avait fait le plus grand nombre de ses miracles, pour ne pas s'être repenties
[11:21] «Malheur à toi, Chorazein ! Malheur à toi, Bethsaïda car si les miracles faits au milieu de vous l'avaient été dans Tyr et dans Sidon, elles se seraient depuis longtemps repenties, en se revêtant d'un sac et dans la cendre.
[11:22] Aussi, je vous le dis, il y aura moins de rigueur pour Tyr et pour Sidon, au jour du jugement, que pour vous.
[11:23] Et toi, Capharnaüm, crois-tu que tu seras élevée jusqu'au ciel? Tu seras abaissée jusqu'à la Demeure-des-morts, parce que si dans Sodome avaient été faits les miracles faits au milieu de toi, elle serait encore debout aujourd’hui.
[11:24] Aussi, je vous le dis, il y aura moins de rigueur pour la terre de Sodome, au jour du jugement, que pour toi.»
[11:25] En ce temps-là, Jésus prononça ces paroles : «Je te bénis, ô Père, ô Seigneur du ciel et de la terre, de ce que tu as caché ces choses à des sages et à des savants et de ce que tu les a révélées à de petits enfants.
[11:26] Oui, Père, je te bénis de ce que tel a été ton bon plaisir.»
[11:27] «Tout m'a été confié par mon Père, et personne ne connaît le Fils, excepté le Père, et personne ne connaît le Père, excepté le Fils et celui à qui il plaît au Fils de le révéler.»
[11:28] «Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et c'est moi qui vous soulagerai.
[11:29] Prenez mon joug sur vous et apprenez de moi, parce que je suis doux et humble de coeur et vous trouverez du soulagement pour vos âmes ;
[11:30] car mon joug est doux et mon fardeau est léger.»
[12:1] En ce temps-là, — un jour de sabbat, — Jésus passa par les blés. Ses disciples avaient faim ; ils se mirent à cueillir des épis et à manger.
[12:2] Les Pharisiens les virent. «Voilà tes disciples, dirent-ils à Jésus, qui font ce qu'il n'est pas permis de faire un jour de sabbat.»
[12:3] Il leur répondit : «N'avez-vous pas lu ce que fit David lorsqu'il eut faim, et ce que firent ses compagnons?
[12:4] — comment il entra dans la maison de Dieu et mangea les pains de proposition, qu'il n'était permis de manger ni à lui, ni à ses compagnons, mais aux prêtres seuls?
[12:5] N'avez-vous pas aussi lu dans la Loi que, le jour du sabbat, les prêtres violent dans le Temple le repos sabbatique et cependant sont innocents?
[12:6] Or, je vous le dis, il y a ici quelque chose de plus grand que le Temple.
[12:7] Si vous saviez ce que signifie : «Je veux miséricorde et non sacrifice» vous n'auriez pas condamné des innocents :
[12:8] le Fils de l'homme est maître du sabbat.»
[12:9] Il partit de là et se rendit dans leur synagogue.
[12:10] Il s'y trouvait un homme qui avait une main paralysée ; pour avoir un prétexte à accusation, ils lui posèrent une question : «Est-il permis, dirent ils, de guérir les jours de sabbat?»
[12:11] Il leur répondit : «Si l’un de vous n'a qu'une brebis et que, le jour du sabbat, cette brebis tombe dans une fosse, est-ce qu'il ne la prendra pas, est-ce qu'il ne la retirera pas?
[12:12] De quel prix cependant n'est pas un être humain en comparaison d'une brebis ? Donc, il est permis les jours de sabbat d'être bienfaisant.»
[12:13] Là-dessus, il dit à l'homme : «Étends ta main. Il l’étendit et elle redevint aussi saine que l’autre.
[12:14] Quant aux Pharisiens, ils sortirent et allèrent se concerter entre eux sur les moyens de le perdre.
[12:15] Jésus l'apprit et partit de là. Beaucoup le suivirent ; il les guérit tous
[12:16] et, par des menaces, il leur interdit de le faire connaître.
[12:17] (C'était pour que fût accompli ce qu'avait dit le prophète Ésaïe:
[12:18] «Voici mon serviteur, celui que j'ai élu, Mon bien-aimé, celui en qui mon âme s'est complu ; Je mettrai m on Esprit sur lui Et il annoncera le jugement aux nations ;
[12:19] Il ne disputera pas ; il ne criera pas ; On n'entendra pas sa voix dans les places publiques ;
[12:20] Il ne brisera pas le roseau froissé Et il n'éteindra pas la mèche encore fumante, Jusqu'à ce qu'il ait fait triompher sa cause
[12:21] Et les nations espéreront en son nom.»)
[12:22] On lui présenta alors un démoniaque aveugle et muet ; il le guérit de sorte que le muet parlait et voyait.
[12:23] Et la multitude était toute transportée et disait: «Celui-là n'est-il point le Fils de David ?
[12:24] Les Pharisiens, l'entendant, dirent : «Celui-là ne chasse les démons que par le prince des démons, Beelzéboul.»
[12:25] Mais Jésus, connaissant leurs pensées, leur dit : «Tout Royaume divisé contre lui-même tombe en ruines ; nulle ville, nulle maison divisée contre elle-même ne subsistera.
[12:26] Or, si Satan chasse Satan, il est divisé contre lui-même, comment alors son Royaume subsistera-t-il ?
[12:27] Et si, moi, je chasse les démons par Beelzéboul, par qui vos fils les chassent-ils? C'est pourquoi ils seront eux-mêmes vos juges !
[12:28] Mais si c'est par l'Esprit de Dieu que je chasse les démons, le Royaume de Dieu est donc venu jusqu'à vous.»
[12:29] «Comment quelqu'un peut-il entrer dans la maison du guerrier et lui ravir ce qu'il possède s'il n'a tout d'abord chargé de liens le guerrier. Ce n'est qu'alors qu'il pourra piller sa maison.»
[12:30] «Qui n'est point avec moi est contre moi, et qui n'amasse point, avec moi, disperse.
[12:31] C'est pourquoi je vous dis ceci : tout péché, tout blasphème sera pardonné aux hommes, mais le blasphème contre l'Esprit ne sera point pardonné.
[12:32] Si quelqu'un prononce un mot contre le Fils de l'homme, il lui sera pardonné ; mais si quelqu'un parle contre l'Esprit saint, il ne lui sera pardonné ni dans ce siècle, ni dans l'autre.».
[12:33] «Dites l'arbre bon et son fruit bon, ou dites l'arbre mauvais et son fruit mauvais, car au fruit on connaît l'arbre.»
[12:34] «Engeance de vipères! Comment, étant méchants, pourriez-vous dire de bonnes choses ; c'est de l'abondance du coeur que la bouche parle.
[12:35] De son bon trésor l'homme bon tire de bonnes choses ; de son mauvais trésor l'homme mauvais tire de mauvaises choses.»
[12:36] Je vous le déclare, au jour du Jugement les hommes rendront compte de toute parole oiseuse qu'ils auront dite.
[12:37] Par tes paroles, en effet, tu seras justifié et par tes paroles condamné.»
[12:38] «Alors quelques-uns des Scribes et des Pharisiens vinrent lui dire: «Maître, nous voulons voir un signe de toi.»
[12:39] Il répondit par ces paroles : «Mauvaise et adultère génération ! elle demande un signe ! et nul signe ne lui sera donné, sinon celui du prophète Jonas.
[12:40] De même, en effet, que Jonas fut trois jours et trois nuits dans le ventre de la baleine, de même le Fils de l'homme sera trois jours et trois nuits dans le sein de la terre.»
[12:41] Lors du jugement, les hommes de Ninive se lèveront avec cette génération et la condamneront, car, eux, ils se repentirent à la prédication de Jonas. Et voici, sous vos yeux, plus que Jonas!
[12:42] Lors du jugement, la reine du Midi se lèvera avec cette génération et la condamnera, car cette reine vint des extrémités de la terre pour écouter la sagesse de Salomon. Et voici, sous vos yeux, plus que Salomon!»
[12:43] Lorsque l'Esprit impur est sorti d'un homme, il erre par des lieux arides, cherchant du repos, et il n'en trouve pas.
[12:44] Il dit alors: «Je retournerai dans ma maison, d'où je suis parti» ; il y revient et la trouve vide, nettoyée et parée.
[12:45] Là-dessus, il va s'associer sept autres Esprits plus méchants que lui-même ; ils y pénètrent et y demeurent ; et le dernier état de cet homme devient pire que le premier. Ainsi en sera-t-il de cette génération mauvaise !»
[12:46] Comme il parlait encore à la foule, sa mère et ses frères, qui se tenaient dehors, demandèrent à l'entretenir.
[12:47] (Quelqu'un lui dit : voilà ta mère et tes frères, qui se tiennent dehors et demandent à te parler.)
[12:48] Il répondit à celui qui le lui disait : «Qui est ma mère et qui sont mes frères ?»
[12:49] Puis, étendant la main sur ses disciples, il ajouta :
[12:50] «Voici ma mère et mes frères ! Car faire la volonté de mon Père, qui est dans les cieux, c'est être mon frère, c'est être ma soeur, c'est être ma mère !»
[13:1] Ce même jour, Jésus sortit de la maison et s'assit au bord de la mer
[13:2] et on se rassembla en si grand nombre autour de lui qu'il monta dans une barque et y prit place pour parler de là à toute la multitude restée sur le rivage.
[13:3] Il leur dit beaucoup de choses en paraboles : «Voilà que le semeur est sorti pour semer.
[13:4] Il jette sa semence, et des grains sont tombés le long du chemin et les oiseaux sont venus et les ont mangés.»
[13:5] «D'autres sont tombés sur un sol pierreux, où il n'y avait pas beaucoup de terre, et ils ont immédiatement poussé, parce que la terre était sans profondeur.
[13:6] Mais le soleil s'est levé et a brûlé la plante qui, n'ayant point de racine, s'est desséchée.»
[13:7] «D'autres grains sont tombés parmi les épines et les épines ont grandi et les ont étouffés.»
[13:8] «D'autres sont tombés dans la bonne terre et ils ont donné du fruit, tel grain en a produit cent, tel autre soixante, tel autre trente.
[13:9] Que celui qui a des oreilles entende !»
[13:10] Ses disciples s'approchèrent et lui dirent : «Pourquoi leur parles-tu en paraboles?»
[13:11] Il leur répondit : «Parce qu'à vous il est donné de pénétrer les mystères du Royaume des cieux, mais à ceux-là, non point.
[13:12] Car à celui qui a, il sera donné, et il sera dans l’abondance ; mais à celui qui n'a pas, même ce qu'il a lui sera ôté.
[13:13] C'est pour cela que je leur parle en paraboles, c'est parce que tout en voyant, ils ne voient point ; tout en entendant, ils n'entendent ni ne comprennent.
[13:14] En eux s'accomplit la prophétie d'Ésaïe, qui dit : «De vos oreilles vous entendrez et vous ne comprendrez point ; De vos yeux vous regarderez et vous ne verrez point ;
[13:15] Car le coeur de ce peuple s'est épaissi, Leurs oreilles sont devenues sourdes Et leurs yeux se sont fermés, De peur que leurs yeux ne voient, De peur que leurs oreilles n'entendent, De peur que leur coeur ne comprenne, De peur qu'ils ne se convertissent, De peur que je ne les guérisse.
[13:16] «Heureux vos yeux, à vous, parce qu’ils voient ; heureuses vos oreilles, parce qu'elles entendent !
[13:17] car, je vous le dis en vérité, nombre de prophètes et de justes ont désiré voir ce que vous voyez et ne l'ont pas vu, entendre ce que vous entendez et ne l'ont pas entendu.»
[13:18] «Pour vous donc, écoutez le sens de la parabole du semeur :
[13:19] «Chaque fois qu'un homme entend la parole du Royaume et ne s'en pénètre pas, survient le Malin et il enlève ce qui a été semé dans son coeur ; voilà celui qui a reçu la semence le long du chemin.»
[13:20] «Celui qui l'a reçue sur un sol pierreux, c'est l'homme qui entend la parole et qui tout d'abord l'accueille avec joie.
[13:21] Mais il n'a pas de racine en lui-même ; il n'est que pour un temps ; une affliction ou une persécution survenant à cause de la parole, il y trouve aussitôt une occasion de chute.»
[13:22] «Celui qui a reçu la semence parmi les épines, c'est l'homme qui écoute la parole, mais les sollicitudes de ce monde et la séduction de la richesse étouffent la parole et la rendent stérile. »
[13:23] «Celui qui a reçu la semence dans la bonne terre, c'est l'homme qui écoute la parole et s'en pénètre ; celui-là porte des fruits et en donne, tantôt cent, tantôt soixante, tantôt trente.»
[13:24] Il leur proposa une autre parabole. «Voici, dit-il, une similitude du Royaume des cieux : Un homme avait semé du bon grain dans son champ ;
[13:25] mais pendant que ses gens dormaient, son ennemi vint semer de l'ivraie au milieu du froment et s'en alla.»
[13:26] «Lorsque l'herbe poussa et porta du fruit, on vit paraître l'ivraie.»
[13:27] «Les serviteurs s'adressèrent au maître de la maison ; ils lui dirent : «Seigneur, n'est-ce pas du bon grain que tu as semé dans ton champ? D'où provient donc l’ivraie?»
[13:28] Il leur répondit : «C'est un ennemi qui a fait cela.» Ils lui dirent alors : «Veux-tu que nous allions l'arracher?» —
[13:29] «Non, répondit-il, de peur qu'en arrachant l'ivraie, vous ne déraciniez en même temps le froment.
[13:30] Laissez-les croître l'un et l'autre jusqu'à la moisson ; au temps de la moisson, je dirai aux moissonneurs : arrachez d'abord l'ivraie et liez-la en gerbes pour la brûler ; quant au froment, vous le recueillerez dans mon grenier.»
[13:31] Il leur proposa une autre parabole : «Le Royaume des cieux est semblable à un grain de sénevé qu'un homme prend et sème dans son champ.
[13:32] C'est bien la plus petite de toutes les semences, et quand il a pris sa croissance, il est plus grand que les plantes potagères ; il devient un arbre, tellement que les oiseaux du ciel viennent faire leurs nids dans ses branches.»
[13:33] Il leur raconta une autre parabole : «Le Royaume des cieux est semblable à du levain qu'une femme prend et qu'elle cache dans trois mesures de farine jusqu'à ce que le levain ait partout pénétré.»
[13:34] Toutes ces choses, Jésus les dit en paraboles aux multitudes ; il ne leur parlait qu'en paraboles
[13:35] (afin que fût accomplie la parole du prophète : «J'ouvrirai ma bouche pour parler en paraboles ; Je révélerai des choses restées cachées depuis la création.»)
[13:36] Lorsqu'il eut congédié la foule et fut rentré dans la maison, ses disciples vinrent le trouver et lui dirent : «Explique-nous la parabole de l'ivraie dans le champ.»
[13:37] Il leur répondit : «Celui qui sème le bon grain, c'est le Fils de l'homme.»
[13:38] «Le champ, c'est le monde.» «Le bon grain, ce sont les enfants du Royaume. L'ivraie, ce sont les enfants du Malin.»
[13:39] «L'ennemi qui l'a semée, c'est le diable.» «La moisson, c'est la fin du monde ; les moissonneurs, ce sont les anges.»
[13:40] «De même donc qu'on arrache l'ivraie et qu'on la brûle dans le feu, de même, à la fin du monde,
[13:41] le Fils de l'homme enverra ses anges et ils arracheront de son Royaume tous les scandales et tous ceux qui opèrent l'iniquité
[13:42] et ils les précipiteront dans l'ardente fournaise. Là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.
[13:43] C'est alors que les justes, dans le Royaume de leur Père, resplendiront comme le soleil. — Que celui qui a des oreilles entende»
[13:44] «Le Royaume des cieux est semblable à un trésor enfoui dans un champ. L'homme qui le trouve le tient caché et puis, débordant de joie, il s'en va vendre tout ce qu'il a et il achète ce champ.»
[13:45] «Le Royaume des cieux est encore semblable à un marchand en quête de belles perles
[13:46] et qui, en ayant trouvé une d'un grand prix, est allé vendre tout ce qu'il avait et a acheté cette perle.»
[13:47] «Le Royaume des cieux est encore semblable à un filet que l'on a jeté en mer et qui a ramassé des poissons de toutes sortes.
[13:48] Quand il a été plein, les pêcheurs l'ont tiré à eux ; puis, s'asseyant sur le rivage, ils ont mis tous ceux qui étaient bons dans des jarres et ils ont jeté les mauvaise.
[13:49] Il en sera de même à la fin du monde: les anges viendront séparer les méchants du milieu des justes
[13:50] et ils précipiteront ces méchants dans l'ardente fournaise. Là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.»
[13:51] «Avez-vous compris tout cela?» — «Oui, répondirent-ils.»
[13:52] Alors il leur dit : «Ainsi donc tout scribe instruit sur le Royaume des cieux est semblable à un homme, chef de maison, qui tire de son trésor des choses nouvelles et des choses anciennes.»
[13:53] Quand Jésus eut achevé de raconter ces paraboles, il partit de là
[13:54] et revint chez ses compatriotes. Il se mit à enseigner dans leur synagogue, ce dont ils furent extrêmement surpris ; ils disaient : «D'où lui viennent cette sagesse et ces miracles?
[13:55] N'est-ce pas là le fils du charpentier? Sa mère ne s'appelle-t-elle pas Marie? Et Jacques, et Joseph, et Simon et Jude ne sont-ils pas ses frères?
[13:56] Ses soeurs ne demeurent-elles pas toutes avec nous? D'où lui vient donc tout cela?»
[13:57] Pour eux il était une occasion de chute. Alors Jésus leur dit : «Un prophète n'est sans honneur que dans sa patrie et dans sa maison.»
[13:58] Aussi ne fit-il là que peu de miracles, à cause de leur incrédulité.
[14:1] C'est vers ce moment que le tétrarque Hérode entendit parler de Jésus.
[14:2] «Cet homme, dit-il, à ses courtisans, c'est Jean-Baptiste! Il est ressuscité d'entre les morts! De là, ces puissances miraculeuses qui agissent en lui!»
[14:3] Hérode, en effet, avait arrêté Jean, l'avait garrotté et jeté en prison : et cela à cause d'Hérodiade, la femme de son frère Philippe,
[14:4] et parce que Jean lui disait : «Il ne t'est pas permis d'avoir cette femme-là.»
[14:5] Hérode eût bien voulu le mettre à mort, mais il avait peur du peuple, lequel tenait Jean pour prophète.
[14:6] Or, au jour anniversaire de la naissance d'Hérode, la fille d'Hérodiade ayant dansé au milieu de la salle, avait tellement plu au tétrarque
[14:7] qu'il lui avait juré, par serment, de lui accorder tout ce qu'elle lui demanderait.
[14:8] «Donne-moi, lui avait-elle dit alors, poussée par sa mère, ici même, sur un plat, la tête de Jean Baptiste.»
[14:9] Le roi en avait été attristé ; cependant à cause de son serment, à cause aussi des convives, il avait commandé de la lui donner
[14:10] et d'aller décapiter Jean dans la prison.
[14:11] Sa tête avait été apportée sur un plat et donnée à la jeune fille, qui l'avait remise à sa mère.
[14:12] Les disciples de Jean étaient venus prendre son corps et l'ensevelir ; puis ils étaient allés en informer Jésus.
[14:13] Ayant appris cet événement, Jésus partit de là en barque pour se retirer à l'écart dans quelque endroit solitaire. Mais les troupes, l'ayant su, sortirent des villes et le suivirent à pied,
[14:14] et en débarquant il vit une foule immense, il en eut compassion et il guérit leurs malades.
[14:15] Sur le soir, les disciples s'approchèrent de lui et lui dirent : «L'endroit est désert et l'heure est déjà avancée, renvoie donc les foules, afin que les uns et les autres aillent dans les villages acheter de quoi se nourrir.)
[14:16] Mais Jésus leur dit : «Il n'est pas nécessaire qu'ils s'en aillent ; donnez-leur vous-mêmes à manger.»
[14:17] «Mais, répondirent-ils, nous n'avons ici que cinq pains et deux poissons.»
[14:18] Il dit : «Apportez-les-moi ici»,
[14:19] et, après avoir commandé que la multitude s'assît sur l'herbe, il prit les cinq pains et les deux poissons, et, levant les yeux au ciel, il prononça la bénédiction, puis il rompit les pains, les donna aux disciples et les disciples aux foules.
[14:20] Tous mangèrent, tous furent rassasiés, et on emporta les morceaux qui restaient : douze paniers pleins.
[14:21] Quant au nombre de ceux qui avaient mangé, il était de cinq mille hommes environ, sans compter des femmes et des enfants.
[14:22] Aussitôt après, il pressa les disciples de remonter dans la barque et de le précéder sur la rive opposée, tandis qu'il renverrait les multitudes.
[14:23] Quand il les eut renvoyées, il gravit la montagne afin de prier dans la solitude. Le soir vint et il était seul en ce lieu.
[14:24] Pendant ce temps la barque, déjà au milieu de la mer, était battue des flots, ayant le vent contraire.
[14:25] Or, à la quatrième veille de la nuit, il vint à eux en marchant sur la mer.
[14:26] Quand les disciples le virent, marchant sur la mer, ils furent bouleversés. «C'est un fantôme», dirent-ils, en jetant des cris de terreur.
[14:27] Mais aussitôt il leur parla, il leur dit : «Rassurez-vous ; c'est moi, soyez sans crainte.»
[14:28] Pierre alors s'adressa à lui: Si c'est toi, Seigneur, commande que je vienne à toi sur les flots.» —
[14:29] «Viens»,dit Jésus. Descendant de la barque, Pierre marcha sur les flots et alla vers Jésus ;
[14:30] mais quand il sentit le vent il fut pris de peur et commença à s'enfoncer, alors il s'écria : «Seigneur, sauve-moi.»
[14:31] Jésus étendit immédiatement la main et lui dit en le saisissant : «Homme de peu de foi, pourquoi as-tu douté?»
[14:32] Ils entrèrent dans la barque et le vent cessa.
[14:33] Alors ceux qui s'y trouvaient se prosternèrent devant lui, disant : «Tu es vraiment Fils de Dieu.»
[14:34] Ayant passé l'eau, ils arrivèrent au pays de Gennesaret.
[14:35] Les gens de l'endroit, l'ayant reconnu, firent prévenir tout le voisinage et lui présentèrent tous leurs malades,
[14:36] le priant de les laisser seulement toucher la frange de son vêtement. Et tous ceux qui la touchèrent furent guéris.
[15:1] Alors des Pharisiens et des Scribes qui arrivaient de Jérusalem s'approchèrent de Jésus et lui dirent :
[15:2] «Pourquoi tes disciples transgressent-ils la tradition des anciens? Ils ne pratiquent pas l'ablution des mains lorsqu’ils prennent leur repas.»
[15:3] Il leur répondit ainsi : «Et vous, pourquoi transgressez-vous, au profit de votre tradition, le commandement de Dieu?
[15:4] En effet, Dieu a dit : «Honore ton père et ta mère» et : «qu'il soit puni de mort, celui qui maudira son père!»
[15:5] Mais vous, voici ce que vous enseignez : celui qui dira à son père ou à sa mère : «Je déclare offrande à Dieu ce dont tu voudrais être assisté par moi,» ne sera pas tenu d'honorer son père ou sa mère.
[15:6] Et c'est ainsi, qu'au profit de votre tradition, vous avez réduit à néant la parole de Dieu.
[15:7] Hypocrites ! C'est bien à vous que s'applique la prophétie d'Ésaïe :
[15:8] «C'est des lèvres que ce peuple m'honore! Quant à son coeur, il est fort loin de moi !
[15:9] C'est en vain qu'ils me rendent un culte ; Ils enseignent des doctrines qui ne sont que des ordonnances humaines ! »
[15:10] Il appela à lui la multitude. «Écoutez et comprenez» leur dit-il ;
[15:11] Ce qui rend l'homme impur ce n'est pas ce qui entre dans la bouche ; ce qui rend l'homme impur, c'est ce qui sort de la bouche.»
[15:12] Les disciples s'approchèrent alors et lui dirent : «Sais-tu que les Pharisiens, en entendant ces paroles, ont été scandalisés.»
[15:13] Il leur répondit : «Toute plante que n'a point plantée mon Père céleste sera déracinée.
[15:14] Laissez-les ; ce sont des conducteurs aveugles ! Quand un aveugle conduit un aveugle, ils tombent tous deux dans une fosse».
[15:15] Pierre, reprenant, lui dit : «Explique-nous la parabole.»
[15:16] - «Êtes-vous encore, vous aussi, sans intelligence?» leur répondit-il.
[15:17] «Ne comprenez-vous pas que tout ce qui entre dans la bouche va au ventre et, de là, est rejeté en quelque lieu secret?
[15:18] mais ce qui sort de la bouche vient du coeur, et voilà ce qui rend l'homme impur!
[15:19] Pensées mauvaises, homicides, adultères, fornications, vols, faux témoignages, calomnies viennent en effet du coeur ;
[15:20] oui, voilà ce qui rend l'homme impur! Quant à manger sans avoir pratiqué l'ablution des mains, ce n'est point contracter une impureté.»
[15:21] Jésus partit de là et se retira du côté de Tyr et de Sidon.
[15:22] Une Chananéenne de ces contrées vint à lui en s'écriant : «Seigneur, Fils de David, aie pitié de moi, ma fille est cruellement tourmentée par un démon.»
[15:23] Il ne lui répondit pas un mot. Ses disciples intervinrent pour le prier de renvoyer cette femme ; — «elle nous poursuit de ses cris», disaient-ils.
[15:24] Alors il prit la parole : «C'est seulement aux brebis perdues de la maison d'Israël que j'ai été envoyé.»
[15:25] Mais la femme vint se prosterner devant lui, disant : «Seigneur, viens à mon secours.»
[15:26] Alors il répondit : «Il n'est pas bon de prendre le pain des enfants et de le jeter aux chiens.»
[15:27] Elle répliqua : «Si, Seigneur, car les chiens mangent quelques-unes des miettes qui tombent de la table de leurs maîtres.»
[15:28] - «Ô femme! ta foi est grande! reprit alors Jésus, qu'il te soit fait comme tu veux.» Et à cette heure même sa fille fut guérie.
[15:29] Parti de là, Jésus longea la mer de Galilée. Puis il gravit la montagne et y demeura.
[15:30] Et des troupes nombreuses arrivèrent vers lui, ayant avec elles des paralytiques, des aveugles, des sourds-muets, des estropiés et beaucoup d'autres que l'on déposa à ses pieds. Il les guérit.
[15:31] De sorte que les multitudes étaient dans l'admiration de voir les sourds-muets parler, les estropiés se guérir, les paralytiques marcher, les aveugles voir. Et elles rendaient gloire au Dieu d'Israël.
[15:32] Jésus, cependant, appela ses disciples et leur dit : «J'ai compassion de cette multitude ; voici déjà trois jours qu'ils ne me quittent pas, et ils n'ont pas de quoi manger. Je ne veux pas les renvoyer à jeun, de peur qu'ils ne défaillent sur la route.»
[15:33] Les disciples lui repartirent : «Où donc trouver, en ce lieu solitaire, un assez grand nombre de pains pour rassasier une foule pareille?
[15:34] —«Combien de pains avez-vous?» leur dit Jésus. — «Sept, répondirent-ils, et quelques poissons.»
[15:35] Il donna ordre à la foule de s'asseoir par terre.
[15:36] Puis il prit les sept pains et les poissons, et rendant grâces, les rompit et les donna aux disciples ; et les disciples les donnèrent à la foule.
[15:37] Tous mangèrent ; tous furent rassasiés et des morceaux qui restèrent on emporta sept corbeilles pleines.
[15:38] Quatre mille hommes furent ainsi nourris, sans compter des femmes et des enfants.
[15:39] Quand il eut congédié les multitudes, il monta dans la barque et se rendit au pays de Magadan.
[16:1] Pour le mettre à l'épreuve, les Pharisiens et les Sadducéens vinrent lui demander de leur faire un signe qui vînt du ciel.
[16:2] Il leur fit cette réponse : «[Le soir, il vous arrive de dire : «Il fera beau, car le ciel est rouge »,
[16:3] et le matin : «Aujourd'hui il y aura un orage, car le ciel est d'un rouge sinistre.» Vous savez donc juger l’aspect du ciel, et les signes du temps où vous êtes vous ne le pouvez pas !]
[16:4] Race mauvaise et adultère qui demande un signe! — Un signe! il ne lui en sera pas donné d'autre que celui de Jonas!» Et les laissant, il s'en alla.
[16:5] Les disciples, en passant l'eau, oublièrent de prendre des pains.
[16:6] Or, Jésus leur dit : «Faites bien attention, prenez bien garde au levain des Pharisiens et des Sadducéens.» —
[16:7] «C'est parce que nous n'avons pas pris de pains!» pensèrent et se dirent entre eux les disciples.
[16:8] Jésus, le sachant, leur dit : «Comment pouvez- vous penser ici aux pains que vous n'avez pas,» hommes de peu de foi?
[16:9] Est-ce que vous ne comprenez pas encore? est-ce que vous ne vous souvenez plus des cinq pains pour les cinq mille hommes et du nombre de paniers que vous avez emportés?
[16:10] ni des sept pains pour les quatre mille hommes et du nombre de corbeilles que vous avez emportées?
[16:11] Comment ne comprenez-vous pas quand je si dis : Prenez bien garde au levain des Pharisiens et des Sadducéens, que je ne vous parle pas de pains?»
[16:12] Ils comprirent alors :il ne leur avait pas dit de se garder du levain qu'on met dans le pain, mais de la doctrine des Pharisiens et des Sadducéens.
[16:13] Étant allé aux environs de Césarée de Philippe, Jésus interrogea ses disciples : «Que dit-on qu'est le Fils de l'homme?»
[16:14] Ils répondirent : «Les uns disent : c'est Jean-Baptiste ; les autres : c'est Élie ; d'autres : c'est Jérémie, ou : c'est l'un des prophètes.»
[16:15] — «Et vous, continua-t-il, qui dites-vous que je suis?»
[16:16] Simon Pierre répondit par ces mots : «Tu es le Christ, le Fils du Dieu vivant.»
[16:17] Jésus alors lui adressa ces paroles : «Heureux es-tu, Simon Bar-Jona, parce que ce n'est ni la chair ni le sang qui t'ont révélé cela ; mais mon Père qui est dans les cieux.
[16:18] Eh bien, moi, je te dis : Tu es Pierre et sur cette pierre j'édifierai mon Église et les portes de la Demeure-des-morts ne prévaudront point contre elle.
[16:19] Je te donnerai les clefs du Royaume des cieux et tout ce que tu lieras sur la terre sera lié dans les cieux, et tout ce que tu délieras sur la terre sera délié dans les cieux.»
[16:20] En même temps, il recommanda à ses disciples de ne dire à personne qu'il était, lui, le Christ.
[16:21] A partir de ce moment, Jésus-Christ commença à expliquer à ses disciples qu'il lui fallait : — aller à Jérusalem ; — beaucoup souffrir de la part des Anciens, des chefs des prêtres et des Scribes ; - être mis à mort ; — ressusciter le troisième jour.
[16:22] Le tirant alors à l'écart, Pierre se mit à le reprendre : «Que Dieu ait pitié de toi, Seigneur! non, il ne t'arrivera rien de tout cela.»
[16:23] Mais lui, se retournant vers Pierre : «Va-t'en ! Arrière de moi! Satan !» lui dit-il ; «tu m'es un scandale, parce que tes pensées ne sont pas de Dieu, mais des hommes.»
[16:24] Jésus dit alors à ses disciples: «Si quelqu'un veut venir à ma suite, qu'il renonce à lui-même, qu'il porte sa croix et qu'il me suive.
[16:25] Celui qui voudra sauver sa vie, la perdra ; et il trouvera la vie, celui qui l'aura perdue à cause de moi.
[16:26] A quoi servira-t-il à, un homme de gagner le monde entier s'il perd sa vie? Qu'est-ce qu'il donnera en échange de sa vie?
[16:27] Le Fils de l'homme doit venir dans la gloire de son Père et accompagné de ses anges et alors il rendra à chacun selon ses oeuvres.
[16:28] En vérité, je vous le dis, quelques-uns sont ici présents qui ne goûteront point la mort avant d'avoir vu le Fils de l'homme venant en sa Royauté.»
[17:1] Six jours après, emmenant avec lui Pierre, Jacques et Jean, son, frère, Jésus les conduisit sur une haute montagne, à l'écart.
[17:2] Et alors, devant eux, il fut transfiguré : sa face resplendit comme le soleil ; ses vêtements devinrent blancs comme la lumière.
[17:3] Et voilà que leur apparurent Moïse et Élie, s'entretenant avec lui.
[17:4] Pierre alors, s'adressant à Jésus, lui dit : «Seigneur, qu'il nous est bon d'être ici! si tu veux, je dresserait trois tentes, une pour toi, une pour Moïse, une pour Élie... »
[17:5] Il parlait encore, lorsqu'une nuée lumineuse les enveloppa, et que de cette nuée sortit une voix disant : «Celui-ci est mon Fils, le bien-aimé en qui je me complais. Écoutez-le.»
[17:6] Quand les disciples entendirent cette voix, ils tombèrent sur leur face, frappés de terreur.
[17:7] Mais Jésus s'approcha et, les touchant, leur dit :
[17:8] «Levez-vous et soyez sans crainte.» Levant alors les yeux, ils ne virent plus personne que lui, Jésus, seul.
[17:9] Comme ils descendaient de la montagne, Jésus leur fit cette recommandation : «Ne parlez à personne de cette vision jusqu'à ce que le Fils de l'homme soit ressuscité d'entre les morts.»
[17:10] Les disciples lui demandèrent : «Pourquoi les Scribes disent-ils : Il faut, avant tout, qu'Élie vienne?»
[17:11] Il leur répondit : «Oui, Élie doit venir et rétablir toutes choses.
[17:12] Eh bien, je vous le déclare, Élie est déjà venu ; et ils ne l'ont pas reconnu ; ils ont, au contraire, fait de lui tout ce qu'ils ont voulu. De même le Fils de l'homme doit souffrir par leurs mains.»
[17:13] Les disciples comprirent alors que c'était de Jean-Baptiste qu'il leur parlait.
[17:14] Lorsqu'ils eurent rejoint la multitude, un homme s'avança vers lui et, se jetant à genoux, lui dit :
[17:15] «Seigneur, aie pitié de mon fils ; il est lunatique, et ses souffrances sont grandes, car il lui arrive souvent de tomber dans le feu, souvent aussi dans l'eau.
[17:16] Je l'ai apporté à tes disciples et ils ont été impuissants à le guérir.
[17:17] Jésus alors prononça ces paroles : «génération incrédule et perverse, jusqu'à quand serai-je avec vous? jusqu'à quand vous supporterai-je? Apportez-moi l'enfant ici.»
[17:18] Il lui fit des menaces ; et le démon sortit de lui. Cet enfant, dès ce moment, fut guéri.
[17:19] Les disciples, s'approchant alors de Jésus, lui dirent en particulier : «Pourquoi, nous, avons-nous été impuissants à chasser ce démon?»
[17:20] Il répondit: «A cause de votre peu de foi, car je vous le dis en vérité, si vous aviez de la foi gros comme un grain de sénevé, vous diriez à cette montagne : «Transporte-toi d'ici là» et elle s'y transporterait ; rien ne vous serait impossible.
[17:21] (Mais ce genre de démon ne s'expulse que par la prière et le jeûne).
[17:22] Pendant qu'ils séjournaient en Galilée, Jésus leur dit : «Le Fils de l'homme va être livré entre les mains des hommes,
[17:23] ils le tueront ; le troisième jour il ressuscitera.) Ces paroles les affligèrent extrêmement.
[17:24] Quand ils arrivèrent à Capharnaüm, ceux qui recevaient les didrachmes s'adressèrent à Pierre et lui dirent : «Est-ce que votre maître ne paye pas les didrachmes?
[17:25] «Il les paye, répondit-il. Et quand il entra dans la maison, Jésus le prévint en lui disant: «Quel est ton avis, Simon? de qui les rois de la terre perçoivent-ils l’impôt ou le cens? de leurs fils ou des étrangers.»
[17:26] Pierre répondit : «des étrangers». «Donc, reprit Jésus, les Fils, sont libres ;
[17:27] cependant pour ne pas les scandaliser, va à la mer et jette l'hameçon. Le premier poisson qui se prendra, tire-le de l'eau, ouvre-lui la bouche, tu y trouveras un statère ; prends-le et donne-le-leur pour moi et pour toi.»
[18:1] A ce moment, les disciples vinrent à Jésus et lui dirent : «Qui est le plus grand dans le Royaume des cieux?»
[18:2] Alors Jésus appela à lui un enfant, le plaça au milieu d'eux
[18:3] et leur dit : «Je vous le dis en vérité, si vous n'avez été changés et n'êtes devenus semblables aux enfants, vous n'entrerez pas dans le Royaume des cieux.
[18:4] Qui donc se fera humble comme cet enfant sera, lui, le plus grand dans le Royaume des cieux ;
[18:5] et qui recevra, en mon nom, un enfant comme celui-ci, me reçoit.»
[18:6] «Mais celui qui aura été une occasion de chute pour l'un de ces petits qui croient en moi, il vaudrait mieux pour lui qu'on lui pendît au cou une de ces meules que tournent les ânes, et qu'on le précipitât dans les profondeurs de la mer.
[18:7] Malheur au monde à cause des scandales! Il faut bien qu'il arrive des scandales ; mais malheur à l'homme par qui le scandales arrive!»
[18:8] «Si ta main ou ton pied sont pour toi une occasion de chute, coupe-les et jette-les loin de toi ; il t'est meilleur d'entrer dans la vie mutilé ou estropié, que d'être jeté, avec tes deux mains et tes deux pieds, dans le feu éternel.
[18:9] Si ton oeil est pour toi une occasion de chute, arrache-le et jette-le loin de toi ; il t'est meilleur d'entrer borgne dans la vie, que d'être jeté, avec tes deux yeux, dans la géhenne du feu.»
[18:10] «Gardez-vous de mépriser un seul de ceux qui sont les petits! car, je vous le dis, leurs anges, dans les cieux, voient sans cesse la face de mon Père qui est dans les cieux.
[18:11] (Car le Fils de l'homme est venu pour sauver ce qui était perdu).
[18:12] «Que pensez-vous de ceci : Si un homme a cent brebis et que l'une d'elles vienne à s'égarer, ne laisse-t-il pas les quatre-vingt-dix-neuf autres dans les montagnes, pour aller chercher celle qui s'est égarée ;
[18:13] et s'il arrive qu'il la retrouve, en vérité je vous le dis, il a plus de joie au sujet de celle-là qu'au sujet des quatre-vingt-dix-neuf autres qui ne se sont point égarées.»
[18:14] «De même ce n'est pas la volonté de votre Père qui est dans les cieux que périsse un seul de ceux qui sont les petits.»
[18:15] «Si ton frère a péché contre toi, va le trouver et reprends-le, toi, seul avec lui. S'il t'écoute, tu auras gagné ton frère.
[18:16] S'il ne t'écoute pas, amène avec toi une ou deux personnes, afin que tout soit décidé d'après l'avis de deux ou trois témoins.
[18:17] Puis, s'il refuse de les écouter, dis-le à l'église. Et, s'il refuse aussi d'écouter l'église, qu'il soit pour toi comme un païen et un publicain.»
[18:18] «Je vous le dis en vérité : tout ce que vous aurez lié sur la terre sera lié dans le ciel ; et tout ce que vous aurez délié sur la terre sera délié dans le ciel.»
[18:19] «Je vous répète, en vérité, que si, sur la terre, deux d'entre vous s'accordent pour demander une chose quelconque, ils l'obtiendront de mon Père qui est dans les cieux.
[18:20] Là, en effet, où deux ou trois sont réunis en mon nom, je suis présent au milieu d'eux.»
[18:21] Alors Pierre, s'approchant, lui dit : «Seigneur, si mon frère, pèche contre moi, combien de fois lui pardonnerai-je? sera-ce jusqu'à sept fois?»
[18:22] Jésus lui répondit: «Je ne te dis pas jusqu'à sept fois, mais jusqu'à soixante-dix fois sept fois.
[18:23] A ce sujet, voici à quoi est semblable le Royaume des cieux : Un roi voulut faire rendre compte à ses serviteurs.
[18:24] Quand il eut commencé à compter, on lui en présenta un, débiteur de dix mille talents.
[18:25] Comme il n'avait pas de quoi les rendre, son maître ordonna qu'on le vendît, lui, sa femme, ses enfants, tout ce qu'il possédait, pour l'acquittement de sa dette.
[18:26] Ce serviteur, tombant à ses pieds, se prosterna devant lui et lui dit : «Sois patient envers moi, et je te rendrai tout.»
[18:27] Le maître eut alors pitié de son serviteur, il le laissa aller et lui fit remise de sa dette.
[18:28] En sortant, ce serviteur rencontra un de ses compagnons qui lui devait cent deniers, et alors, le tenant à la gorge jusqu'à l'étrangler, il lui dit : «Rends ce que tu dois!»
[18:29] Son compagnon, tombant à ses pieds, le supplia en disant : «Sois patient envers moi et je te rendrai» ;
[18:30] mais lui ne voulut pas ; il s'en alla et le jeta en prison jusqu'à ce qu'il eût payé sa dette.
[18:31] Voyant ce qui se passait, les autres serviteurs en furent profondément affligés ; et ils vinrent raconter à leur maître tout ce qui était arrivé.
[18:32] Alors le maître fit appeler celui qui avait ainsi agi et lui dit : «Serviteur méchant! Je t'ai remis ta dette parce que tu m'as supplié.
[18:33] Ne te fallait-il pas avoir pitié toi aussi de ton compagnon, comme moi-même j'avais eu pitié de toi?»
[18:34] Et son maître, irrité, livra cet homme aux bourreaux, jusqu'à ce qu'il eût payé toute sa dette.»
[18:35] «Ainsi vous fera mon Père céleste si chacun de vous ne pardonne pas à son frère de tout son coeur.»
[19:1] Quand Jésus eut achevé ces discours, il quitta la Galilée et se rendit sur la frontière de la Judée, de l'autre côté du Jourdain.
[19:2] De grandes multitudes le suivirent et, il y fit des guérisons.
[19:3] Les Pharisiens vinrent à lui et, pour le mettre à l'épreuve, ils lui dirent : «Est-il permis de répudier sa femme pour un motif quelconque?»
[19:4] Il répondit par ces paroles : «N'avez-vous pas lu que, à l'origine, le Créateur a fait un couple, mâle et femelle?»
[19:5] et il a dit : «A cause de cela l'homme laissera son père et sa mère pour s'attacher à sa femme et ils seront deux dans une seule chair.»
[19:6] Ainsi ils ne sont plus deux, mais une seule chair. Donc, ce que Dieu a uni, qu'un homme ne le sépare point.» —
[19:7] «Alors pourquoi, dirent-ils, Moïse a-t-il prescrit de donner à la femme un acte de divorce et de la répudier?»
[19:8] Il répondit : «C'est à cause de la dureté de vos coeurs que Moïse vous a permis de répudier vos femmes. Mais, à l'origine, il n'en était pas ainsi.
[19:9] Or, je vous le dis : qui répudie sa femme, si ce n'est pour infidélité, et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère.»
[19:10] Les disciples lui dirent : «Si telle est la condition de l'homme vis-à-vis de la femme, il vaut mieux ne pas se marier.»
[19:11] Il leur dit : «Tout le monde n'est pas capable de cette résolution, mais seulement ceux à qui cela est donné.
[19:12] Il y a des eunuques qui sont tels dès leur naissance, dès les entrailles de leur mère ; il en est d'autres que les hommes ont faits eunuques ; et enfin il y en a qui se sont faits eunuques eux-mêmes en vue du Royaume des cieux. Que celui qui a la force d'en arriver là, y arrive!»
[19:13] Alors on lui amena des enfants pour qu'il leur imposât les mains en priant. Comme les disciples blâmaient ceux qui les lui amenaient,
[19:14] Jésus leur dit : «Laissez les enfants et ne les empêchez point de venir à moi, car c'est à ceux qui leur ressemblent qu'appartient le Royaume des cieux.»
[19:15] Puis il leur imposa les mains et partit de là.
[19:16] S'approchant de lui, quelqu'un lui dit: «Maître, que dois-je faire e de bon pour avoir la vie éternelle?»
[19:17] Il lui répondit : «Pourquoi m'interroges-tu sur ce qui est bon ? Un seul être est bon. Si tu veux entrer dans la vie, observe les commandements. —
[19:18] «Lesquels?» dit-il. Jésus répondit : «Ceux-ci : Tu ne seras point meurtrier ; tu ne seras point adultère ; tu ne seras point voleur ; tu ne rendras point de faux témoignage ;
[19:19] honore ton père et ta mère et : tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même.»
[19:20] Le jeune homme lui dit : «Tout cela je l'ai observé ; que me manque-t-il encore?»
[19:21] Jésus lui répondit : «Si tu veux être parfait, va vendre ce que tu possèdes, donnes-en le prix à des pauvres : tu auras alors un trésor dans les cieux ; viens ensuite et suis-moi.»
[19:22] Le jeune homme, entendant ces paroles, s'en alla tout triste, car il avait beaucoup de biens.
[19:23] Jésus dit alors à ses disciples : «Je vous le dis en vérité, un riche entrera difficilement dans le Royaume des cieux.
[19:24] Oui, je vous le répète, il est plus facile à un chameau de passer par le trou d'une aiguille qu'à un riche d'entrer dans le Royaume de Dieu.»
[19:25] Ces paroles consternèrent les disciples : «Qui donc pourra être sauvé?» dirent-ils.
[19:26] Jésus leur répondit en les regardant : Aux hommes, cela est impossible ; mais à Dieu, tout est possible.»
[19:27] Pierre s'adressa alors à lui et lui dit : «Et nous, nous avons tout quitté ; nous t'avons suivi ; qu'y aura-t-il pour nous?»
[19:28] Jésus leur répondit : «le vous le dis en vérité, lorsque, dans le Renouvellement de toutes choses le Fils de l'homme, siégera sur le trône de sa gloire, vous aussi, vous, qui m'avez suivi, vous siégerez sur douze trônes, jugeant les douze tribus d'Israël ;
[19:29] et quiconque, à cause de mon nom, aura quitté des frères, des soeurs, un père, une mère, des enfants, des terres, des maisons, recevra beaucoup plus et possédera la vie éternelle.
[19:30] Plusieurs des premiers seront derniers et des derniers premiers ;
[20:1] Voici, en effet, à quoi est semblable le Royaume des cieux : Un maître de maison sortit de très grand matin, afin de louer des ouvriers pour sa vigne.
[20:2] Il convint avec ces ouvriers d'un denier pour la journée et les envoya à sa vigne.
[20:3] En sortant de nouveau vers la troisième heure, il en vit d'autres qui restaient sur la place publique sans rien faire.
[20:4] Et il leur dit : «Allez, vous aussi, à ma vigne, et je vous donnerai ce qui est juste.»
[20:5] Ils y allèrent. Il sortit également vers la sixième heure, puis vers la neuvième, et fit de même.
[20:6] Étant enfin sorti vers la onzième heure, il en trouva encore d'autres qui restaient là et il leur dit : «Pourquoi restez-vous ici toute la journée à ne rien faire?»
[20:7] Ils répondirent : «Parce que personne ne nous a loués,» et il leur dit : «Allez, vous aussi, à la vigne.»
[20:8] Le soir venu, le maître de la vigne dit à son intendant : «Appelle les ouvriers et remets-leur le salaire, en commençant par les derniers et finissant par les premiers.»
[20:9] Ceux de la onzième heure se présentèrent alors et reçurent chacun un denier.
[20:10] Les premiers vinrent à leur tour, et ils pensaient qu'ils recevraient davantage ; mais ils ne reçurent, eux aussi, qu'un denier chacun.
[20:11] En le prenant, ils murmuraient contre le maître de la maison ;
[20:12] ils disaient : «Ceux-ci, les derniers, ont fait seulement une heure et tu les égales à nous qui avons porté le poids du jour et de la chaleur?»
[20:13] «Il répondit à l'un d'eux : «Mon ami, je ne te fais aucun tort ; n'es-tu pas convenu avec moi d'un denier?
[20:14] Prends ce qui est à toi et va. Je veux donner à ce dernier autant qu'à toi.
[20:15] Ne m'est-il pas permis de faire de mes biens ce que je veux ? Pourquoi vois-tu de mauvais oeil que je sois bon ?»
[20:16] — «Ainsi les derniers seront premiers et les premiers derniers.»
[20:17] Jésus, montant à Jérusalem, prit, en particulier, les douze et, chemin faisant, il leur dit :
[20:18] «Voilà que nous montons à Jérusalem ; le Fils de l'homme y sera livré aux chefs des prêtres et aux Scribes, qui le condamneront à mort ;
[20:19] puis ils le livreront aux païens, pour qu'il soit bafoué, flagellé et crucifié ; et le troisième jour il ressuscitera.»
[20:20] Alors s'approcha de lui la mère des fils de Zébédée et ceux-ci avec elle, et elle se prosterna pour lui faire une demande.
[20:21] Il lui dit : «Que veux-tu?» Elle lui répondit : «Ordonne que, dans ton Royaume, mes deux fils que voici siègent l'un à ta droite, l'autre à ta gauche.»
[20:22] Jésus repartit : «Vous ne savez ce que vous demandez. Pouvez-vous boire la coupe que je vais boire moi-même?» — «Nous le pouvons» lui dirent-ils. —
[20:23] Et il répliqua : «Oui, ma coupe, vous la boirez ; mais quant à siéger à ma droite ou à ma gauche, ce n'est pas à moi de l'accorder, ces places sont à ceux pour qui mon Père les a préparées.»
[20:24] Les dix autres qui avaient entendu furent indignés contre les deux frères.
[20:25] Alors Jésus les appela et leur dit : «Vous savez que les princes des nations en sont les dominateurs, que les grands exercent sur elles un pouvoir impérieux.
[20:26] Il n'en sera pas ainsi parmi vous ; au contraire, qui voudra devenir grand parmi vous sera votre serviteur ;
[20:27] qui voudra être le premier parmi vous sera votre esclave,
[20:28] comme le Fils de l'homme, qui n'est pas venu pour être servi, mais pour servir et donner sa vie comme rançon pour plusieurs.»
[20:29] A leur sortie de Jéricho, Jésus fut suivi d'une grande foule.
[20:30] Et voici que deux aveugles, assis le long du chemin, entendant dire que c'était Jésus qui passait, se mirent à crier : «Aie pitié de nous, Seigneur Fils de David !»
[20:31] La foule les menaçait pour les faire taire, mais ils crièrent plus fort : «Aie pitié de nous, Seigneur, Fils de David!»
[20:32] Jésus s'arrêta, les appela et leur dit : «Que voulez-vous que je fasse pour vous ?»
[20:33] Ils lui répondirent : «Seigneur, que nos yeux soient ouverts !»
[20:34] Ému de compassion, Jésus toucha leurs yeux. Et subitement ils virent, et ils le suivirent.
[21:1] Quand ils furent près de Jérusalem et furent arrivés à Bethphagé, aux environs du mont des Oliviers, Jésus envoya deux disciples,
[21:2] en leur disant : «Allez à ce village qui est devant vous, et vous trouverez tout de suite une ânesse attachée et son ânon avec elle. Déliez-les et amenez-les-moi.
[21:3] Et si l'on vous dit quelque chose, vous répondrez : «Le Seigneur en a besoin» ; on les enverra immédiatement.»
[21:4] (Or, tout cela eut lieu afin que fût accomplie la parole du prophète :
[21:5] «Dites à la fille de Sion : Voici que ton Roi vient à toi, Plein de douceur, monté sur une ânesse Et sur un ânon, le petit d'une bête de somme.»)
[21:6] Les disciples partirent et firent ce que Jésus leur avait ordonné.
[21:7] Ils amenèrent l'ânesse et l'ânon ; ils placèrent sur eux leurs manteaux et Jésus s'assit dessus.
[21:8] La plus grande partie du peuple étendait ses vêtements sur le chemin ; d'autres coupaient des branches aux arbres et en jonchaient la route.
[21:9] Et toute cette multitude, ceux qui le précédaient et ceux qui le suivaient, criait : «Hosanna pour le Fils de David ! Béni soit celui qui vient au nom du Seigneur ! Hosanna au plus haut des cieux!»
[21:10] A son entrée dans Jérusalem, la ville entière fut en émoi ; on disait : «Qui est celui-ci ?»
[21:11] et les multitudes répondaient : «C'est le prophète Jésus de Nazareth de Galilée.»
[21:12] Jésus entra dans le Temple, et il en chassa tous les vendeurs et tous les acheteurs ; il renversa les tables des changeurs, ainsi que les sièges des marchands de colombes,
[21:13] et il leur dit : Il est écrit : «Ma maison s'appellera maison de prière.» «Eh bien! vous en faites une caverne de brigands.»
[21:14] Dans le Temple, aveugles et estropiés s'approchèrent de lui, et il les guérit.
[21:15] Voyant les merveilles qu'il accomplissait et les enfants crier dans le Temple et dire : «Hosanna pour le Fils de David!» les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes furent indignés :
[21:16] «Est-ce que tu entends ce que ceux-là crient?» lui dirent-ils. «Oui, leur répondit Jésus, n'avez-vous donc jamais lu cette parole : Dans la bouche des petits enfants et des nourrissons qu'on allaite, Tu t'es préparé des louanges.»
[21:17] Puis il les quitta et sortit de la ville pour aller à Béthanie, où il passa la nuit.
[21:18] Le matin, en revenant à la ville, il eut faim,
[21:19] et voyant sur le chemin un figuier isolé, il s'en approcha ; mais il n'y trouva rien, il n'y avait que des feuilles. Il lui dit alors : «Que jamais fruit ne naisse de toi désormais!»
[21:20] A l'instant même le figuier sécha. A cette vue, les disciples s'étonnèrent et ils dirent : «Comment ce. figuier s'est-il instantanément desséché?»
[21:21] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «En vérité, je vous le dis : si vous aviez de la foi et que vous ne doutiez point, non seulement vous feriez ce que j'ai fait à ce figuier, mais quand même vous diriez à cette montagne : Soulève-toi et jette-toi dans la mer, cela s'accomplirait.
[21:22] Tout ce que, dans la prière, vous demanderez avec foi, vous le recevrez.»
[21:23] Quand il fut entré dans le Temple, les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens du peuple vinrent à lui, pendant qu'il enseignait, et lui dirent : «En vertu de quelle autorité fais-tu ces choses? et qui t'a donné cette autorité ?»
[21:24] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «Je vous ferai, moi aussi, une question, une seule, et si vous me répondez, je vous dirai en vertu de quelle autorité je fais ces choses.
[21:25] Le baptême de Jean, d'où venait-il? du ciel ou des hommes?» Or ils faisaient, à part eux, ce raisonnement :
[21:26] «Si nous répondons : du ciel, — il nous dira : Pourquoi donc ne l'avez-vous pas cru? Et si nous répondons : des hommes, — nous avons à craindre la multitude, car tous tiennent Jean pour prophète.»
[21:27] Alors ils répondirent ainsi à Jésus : «Nous ne savons.» Et lui, il leur dit à son tour : «Je ne vous dis pas, moi non plus, en vertu de quelle autorité je fais ces choses.»
[21:28] «Que pensez-vous de ceci : un homme avait deux fils. Il s'adressa au premier et lui dit : «Mon enfant, va travailler aujourd'hui à ma vigne.»
[21:29] Celui-ci répondit : «J'y vais, seigneur» — et n'y alla pas.
[21:30] Venant ensuite à un autre fils, le père lui parla de même. Celui-là répondit : «Je ne veux pas» — et plus tard, touché de repentir, il y alla.
[21:31] Lequel des deux a fait la volonté de son père ?» — «C'est le dernier» répondirent-ils. Et Jésus ajouta : «En vérité, je vous le dis, les publicains et les femmes de mauvaise vie vous précèdent dans le Royaume de Dieu.
[21:32] Jean, en effet, est venu à vous dans la voie de la justice et, vous ne l'avez pas cru. Les publicains et les femmes de mauvaise vie l'ont cru ; et vous, qui avez vu cela, vous ne vous êtes pas repentis, vous n'avez pas fini par le croire.»
[21:33] Écoutez une autre parabole : Il y avait un homme, un maître de maison, qui avait planté une vigne ; après l'avoir entourée d'une haie, y avoir creusé une cuve et construit une tour, il la loua à des vignerons et fit une absence.
[21:34] Lorsque vint la saison de la récolte, il envoya ses serviteurs aux vignerons pour recueillir le produit de sa vigne.
[21:35] Or les vignerons s'emparèrent de ces serviteurs, ils battirent celui-ci, ils tuèrent celui-là, ils en lapidèrent un troisième.
[21:36] Le maître alors leur en envoya d'autres, plus nombreux que les premiers ; les vignerons les traitèrent de même.
[21:37] Enfin, il leur envoya son fils, disant : «Ils respecteront mon fils.»
[21:38] Mais quand ils virent le fils, ils se dirent à part eux : «Celui-là, c'est l'héritier ; allons ! tuons-le et nous aurons son héritage !»
[21:39] S'étant donc emparés de lui, ils le jetèrent hors de la vigne et le tuèrent.
[21:40] Eh bien, lorsque le maître de la vigne arrivera, que fera-t-il à ces vignerons?»
[21:41] On lui répondit : « Il fera périr misérablement ces misérables et il louera la vigne à d'autres vignerons qui lui en rendront les fruits à la saison.»
[21:42] Jésus leur dit : «Est-ce que vous n'avez jamais lu dans les Écritures : La pierre qu'ont rejetée ceux qui bâtissaient, Celle-là même est devenue la tête de l'angle ; C'est l'ouvrage du Seigneur, Ouvrage admirable à nos yeux.»
[21:43] «Voilà pourquoi je vous dis que le Royaume de Dieu vous sera enlevé et qu’il sera donné à un peuple qui en produira les fruits.
[21:44] Celui qui tombera sur cette pierre s'y brisera et celui sur qui elle tombera, elle le mettra en poussière.»
[21:45] En entendant ces paraboles, les chefs des prêtres et les Pharisiens comprirent que c'était d'eux qu'il parlait.
[21:46] Ils cherchaient bien à l'arrêter, mais ils redoutaient la multitude, parce qu'elle tenait Jésus pour prophète.
[22:1] Il reprit la parole, et continuant de raconter des paraboles, il leur dit :
[22:2] «Voici une similitude du Royaume des cieux : un roi, qui célébrait les noces de son fils,
[22:3] envoya ses serviteurs prévenir les conviés de s'y rendre ; mais ils ne voulurent pas venir.
[22:4] D'autres serviteurs furent, une seconde fois, envoyés avec cet ordre : dites ceci aux conviés : voici mon festin préparé ; mes boeufs et les animaux engraissés sont tués ; tout est prêt ; venez aux noces.»
[22:5] «Mais les conviés n'en tinrent nul compte et ils s'en allèrent, celui-ci à sa campagne, celui-là à ses affaires.
[22:6] Quant aux autres, ils s'emparèrent des serviteurs, les outragèrent et les tuèrent.
[22:7] Se mettant en colère, le roi envoya ses troupes exterminer ces meurtriers et incendier leur ville.
[22:8] Il dit ensuite à ses serviteurs : «Le festin de noces est prêt, mais ceux qui y avaient été invités n'en ont pas été dignes.
[22:9] Parcourez donc les carrefours ; et tous ceux que vous trouverez, appelez-les au festin de noces.»
[22:10] Les serviteurs s'en allèrent alors par les rues, rassemblèrent tous ceux qu'ils rencontrèrent, bons et mauvais, de sorte que la salle fut remplie de convives.»
[22:11] Étant entré pour voir ceux qui étaient à table, le roi vit là un homme qui n'avait point revêtu la robe nuptiale.
[22:12] Mon ami, lui demanda-t-il, comment es-tu entré ici sans avoir de robe nuptiale? Il eut la bouche fermée.
[22:13] Alors le roi dit aux gens de service: «Liez-le, pieds et mains, et jetez-le dehors, dans les ténèbres ; là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.
[22:14] Beaucoup, en effet, sont appelés ; peu sont élus.»
[22:15] Alors les Pharisiens, en s'en allant, se concertèrent pour le prendre au piège par ses propres paroles,
[22:16] et ils lui envoyèrent leurs disciples, accompagnés des Hérodiens, qui lui dirent : «Maître, nous savons que tu es véridique et que tu enseignes en toute vérité la voie de Dieu, sans avoir souci de qui que ce soit, sans regarder à la figure des uns ou des autres.
[22:17] Dis-nous donc quel est ton avis : Est-il permis, oui ou non, de payer l'impôt à César ?
[22:18] Mais Jésus, connaissant leur malice, répondit : «Pourquoi me mettez-vous à l'épreuve, hypocrites !
[22:19] montrez-moi la monnaie de l'impôt.» Ils lui présentèrent un denier.
[22:20] «De qui est cette image? demanda-t-il, de qui cette inscription?»
[22:21] Ils répondirent : «de César». Alors il leur dit : «Rendez donc à César ce qui est à César et à Dieu ce qui est à Dieu.»
[22:22] Cette réponse les surprit et ils le laissèrent, ils partirent.
[22:23] Ce même jour, des Sadducéens, disant qu'il n'y a point de résurrection, vinrent lui poser une question.
[22:24] «Maître, dirent-ils, Moïse a dit : «Si quelqu'un meurt sans laisser d'enfants, que son frère épouse sa veuve et suscite à celui-ci une postérité.»
[22:25] Or, parmi nous, il y a eu sept frères. Le premier s'est marié et est mort sans avoir de postérité ; il a laissé sa femme à son frère.
[22:26] Pareillement le second, puis le troisième, jusqu'au septième.
[22:27] Enfin, après eux tous, la femme est morte.
[22:28] Duquel des sept, ayant été la femme détours, sera-t-elle donc l'épouse à la résurrection ?»
[22:29] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «Vous êtes dans l'erreur, parce que vous ignorez et les Écritures et la puissance de Dieu.
[22:30] Les ressuscités, en effet, ne se marient pas et ne donnent pas en mariage, mais ils sont dans le ciel comme des anges.
[22:31] Et quant à la résurrection des morts, n'avez-vous pas lu cette parole que Dieu vous a dite :
[22:32] Je suis le Dieu d'Abraham, le Dieu d' Isaac, le Dieu de Jacob.» Or ce n'est point de morts, c'est de vivants qu'il est Dieu.»
[22:33] Les multitudes qui entendaient étaient extrêmement frappées de son enseignement.
[22:34] Apprenant qu'il avait fermé la bouche aux Sadducéens, les Pharisiens se réunirent ;
[22:35] et l'un d'eux, un légiste, lui demanda pour le mettre à l'épreuve :
[22:36] «Maître, quel est, dans la Loi, le plus grand commandement?»
[22:37] Jésus lui dit : «Tu aimeras le Seigneur ton Dieu, de tout ton coeur, de toute ton âme, de toute ta pensée.»
[22:38] C'est le grand et le premier commandement.
[22:39] Il y en a un second qui lui est semblable : «Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi même.»
[22:40] De ces deux commandements dépendent «la Loi» tout entière, ainsi que «les Prophètes ».
[22:41] Les Pharisiens se trouvant rassemblés, Jésus leur posa cette question :
[22:42] «Quelle est votre opinion sur le Christ? de qui est-il fils?» Ils lui dirent : «de David.»
[22:43] Comment donc, reprit-il, David inspiré l'appelle-t-il «Seigneur» quand il dit :
[22:44] «Le Seigneur a dit à mon Seigneur, Siège à ma droite Jusqu'à ce que j'aie mis tes ennemis sous tes pieds ?»
[22:45] Si David l'appelle «Seigneur» comment donc est-il son fils?» —
[22:46] Nul ne put lui répondre un mot et, depuis ce jour-là, personne n'osa plus le questionner.
[23:1] Jésus alors, parlant à la multitude en même temps qu'à ses disciples,
[23:2] dit : «C'est dans la chaire de Moïse que sont assis tes Scribes et les Pharisiens ;
[23:3] observez donc tout ce qu'ils vous disent et faites-le. Mais n'imitez pas leurs oeuvres, car ils disent et ne font pas.
[23:4] Ils lient en faisceau de pesants fardeaux et ils en chargent l'épaule des hommes ; mais eux ils ne veulent pas les remuer du bout du doigt.
[23:5] Toutes leurs actions ils les font pour être vus des autres ; en effet, ils portent d'énormes phylactères et leurs franges sont interminables ;
[23:6] dans les festins ils aiment la première place, dans les synagogues les premiers sièges,
[23:7] sur les places publiques les salutations, et que chacun leur donne le nom de Rabbi.
[23:8] «Quant à vous, ne vous faites pas appeler : Rabbi ; car un seul est votre maître, et pour vous, vous êtes tous frères.
[23:9] Et ne donnez à personne sur terre le nom de père : car un seul est votre Père : le Père céleste.
[23:10] Qu'on ne vous appelle pas non plus directeurs, car vous n'avez qu'un seul directeur : le Christ.
[23:11] Le plus grand parmi vous sera votre serviteur.
[23:12] Qui s'élèvera lui-même sera abaissé ; qui s'abaissera lui-même sera élevé.»
[23:13] «Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites ! parce que vous fermez la porte du Royaume des cieux au visage des hommes. Vous, vous n'entrez pas, et ceux qui viennent pour entrer vous ne les laissez pas entrer.
[23:14] (Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites ! parce que vous dévorez les ressources des veuves, en affectant de prier longuement, Voilà pourquoi le jugement aura pour vous plus de rigueur).
[23:15] Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites ! parce que vous parcourez terres et mers pour faire un seul prosélyte : et, lorsqu'il l'est devenu, vous en faites un fils de la Géhenne, deux fois pire que vous.»
[23:16] Malheur à vous, guides aveugles! qui dites : «Si quelqu'un jure par le Temple, ce n'est rien du tout ; mais si quelqu'un jure par l'or du Temple, il est engagé.»
[23:17] Insensés et aveugles ! lequel est donc le plus grand, ou de l'or ou du Temple qui sanctifie l'or?
[23:18] Et encore : «Si quelqu'un jure par l'autel, ce n'est rien du tout ; mais si quelqu'un jure par l'offrande qui est sur l'autel, il est engagé.»
[23:19] Aveugles, lequel est le plus grand ou de l'offrande, ou de l'autel qui sanctifie l'offrande?
[23:20] Qui jure par l'autel, jure et par l'autel et par tout ce qu'il porte.
[23:21] Qui jure par le Temple, jure et par le Temple et par Celui dont il est la demeure.
[23:22] Qui jure par le ciel, jure et par le trône de Dieu et par Celui qui y est assis.»
[23:23] «Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites ! parce que vous acquittez la dîme, et de la menthe, et de l'aneth, et du cumin et que vous laissez de côté ce qu'il y a de plus grave dans la Loi : la justice, la pitié, la bonne foi ! Il fallait faire ceci et ne pas omettre cela.
[23:24] Guides aveugles ! qui retenez au filtre le moucheron et qui engloutissez le chameau!»
[23:25] «Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites, parce que vous purifiez le dehors de la coupe et du plat quand ils sont remplis au dedans de rapines et d'immondices!
[23:26] Pharisien aveugle, purifie d'abord l'intérieur de la coupe et du plat s, afin que le dehors devienne pur aussi.»
[23:27] «Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites, parce que vous êtes pareils à des sépulcres blanchis ! Ils ont, à l'extérieur, une belle apparence ; mais au dedans, ils sont remplis d'ossements de morts et de toute sorte de pourriture.
[23:28] Vous de même ; à l'extérieur, vous paraissez justes aux hommes ; mais, au dedans, vous êtes pleins d'hypocrisie et d'iniquité.»
[23:29] «Malheur à vous, Scribes et Pharisiens hypocrites, parce que vous élevez des tombeaux aux prophètes, que vous ornez les sépulcres des justes
[23:30] et que vous dites : «Si nous eussions été là du temps de nos pères, nous n'aurions pas été leurs complices dans le meurtre des prophètes.»
[23:31] Et par là, vous vous rendez à vous-mêmes le témoignage que vous êtes bien les fils des meurtriers des prophètes.
[23:32] Ainsi, vous, vous comblez la mesure de vos pères !
[23:33] Serpents! Engeance de vipères ! comment éviterez-vous la condamnation de la Géhenne ?
[23:34] C'est pour cela que moi-même je vous envoie prophètes, sages et docteurs. Les uns vous les tuerez, vous les crucifierez ; les autres vous les flagellerez dans vos synagogues ; vous les traquerez de ville en ville,
[23:35] afin que retombe sur vous tout sang innocent versé sur la terre depuis le sang d'Abel le juste jusqu'au sang de Zaccharie, fils de Barachie, que vous avez massacré entre le Temple et l'autel !
[23:36] Je vous le dis en vérité, c’est sur cette génération-ci que tout cela retombera !»
[23:37] «Jérusalem ! Jérusalem ! qui tues les prophètes et qui lapides ceux qui te sont envoyés, combien de fois ai-je voulu rassembler tes enfants, comme la poules rassemble ses poussins sous ses ailes, et tu ne l'as pas voulu !
[23:38] Eh bien, votre demeure vous est laissée.
[23:39] Car je vous le déclare, vous ne me verrez plus, jusqu'à ce que vous disiez : «Béni soit celui qui vient au nom du Seigneur.»
[24:1] Jésus sortait du Temple et s'éloignait, lorsque ses disciples vinrent lui en faire remarquer les diverses constructions.
[24:2] Alors il leur parla ainsi : «De tout ce que vous voyez là, je vous le dis en vérité, il ne restera pas pierre sur pierre. Tout sera renversé.»
[24:3] Puis il alla s'asseoir sur le mont des Oliviers, les disciples s'approchèrent de lui et, le prenant à part, l'interrogèrent : «Dis-nous quand ces choses arriveront et quel sera le signe de ton avènement et de la fin du monde.»
[24:4] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles: «Veillez à ce que personne ne vous séduise ;
[24:5] car plusieurs viendront en prenant mon nom, ils diront : Je suis, moi, le Christ» et ils séduiront bien des hommes.
[24:6] Vous entendrez parler de guerres et de bruits de guerres ; gardez-vous de vous en troubler ; car il faut que cela arrive ; mais ce ne sera pas encore la fin.»
[24:7] «Se soulèvera, en effet, nation contre nation, royaume contre royaume. Il y aura, ici et là, des famines et des tremblements de terre.
[24:8] Tout cela ce seront les douleurs de l'enfantement qui commencent.»
[24:9] «On vous livrera alors aux tourments ; on vous mettra à mort ; vous serez, à cause de mon nom, en haine à toutes les nations.
[24:10] Et alors beaucoup seront pris au piège ; ils se trahiront les uns les autres, ils se haïront entre eux.
[24:11] Plusieurs faux prophètes surgiront et séduiront un grand nombre d'hommes.
[24:12] Et comme l'iniquité augmentera, l'amour du plus grand nombre se refroidira ;
[24:13] mais celui-là sera sauvé qui aura persévéré jusqu'à la fin.»
[24:14] «Cet Évangile du Royaume sera prêché par toute la terre et attesté à toutes les nations. Et c'est alors que viendra la fin.»
[24:15] «Quand vous verrez «l'abomination de la désolation», comme dit le prophète Daniel, installée dans le Lieu Saint (comprends bien, lecteur!),
[24:16] que ceux qui seront dans la Judée fuient aux montagnes ;
[24:17] que celui qui sera sur le toit n'en descende point pour emporter ce qui est dans sa maison ;
[24:18] que celui qui sera dans les champs ne revienne pas sur ses pas pour prendre son manteau.
[24:19] Malheur aux femmes qui seront enceintes et à celles qui allaiteront en ces jours-là !»
[24:20] «Priez pour que votre fuite n'arrive ni en hiver, ni en un jour de sabbat,
[24:21] car il y aura alors une grande tribulation, telle qu'il n'yen a pas eu de semblable depuis le commencement du monde jusqu'à présent, et qu'il n'y en aura plus jamais.
[24:22] Et si ces jours n'avaient pas été abrégés, nulle vie ne serait sauvée ; mais, à cause des élus, ces jours seront abrégés.»
[24:23] «Si l'on vous dit alors : «Voici le Christ est ici!» ou : «Le voilà!» ne le croyez pas.
[24:24] Car il surgira de faux Christs, et de faux prophètes, faisant de grands signes et prodiges, afin de séduire, si possible, même les élus.
[24:25] Ainsi, je vous ai prévenus.»
[24:26] «Si donc quelqu'un vous dit : «Voilà qu'il est dans le désert!» n'y allez pas. «Le voilà dans l'intérieur de la maison!» ne le croyez pas.
[24:27] Tel, en effet, l'éclair part d'Orient et brille jusqu'à l'Occident, tel sera l'avènement du Fils de l'homme.
[24:28] Partout où sera le cadavre, s'assembleront les vautours.»
[24:29] «Immédiatement après ces jours de tribulation, le soleil s'obscurcira, la lune ne donnera plus sa lumière, les étoiles tomberont du ciel, les puissances des cieux seront ébranlées.
[24:30] C'est alors qu'apparaîtra dans le ciel le signe du Fils de l'homme, et alors se frapperont la poitrine toutes les tribus de la terre, et elles verront le Fils de l'homme arrivant sur les nuées du ciel, en puissance et grande gloire,
[24:31] et il enverra ses anges, lesquels, au son éclatant de la trompette, rassembleront ses élus des quatre Vents de l'horizon, d'une extrémité du ciel à l'autre extrémité.»
[24:32] «Que le figuier vous serve de comparaison : quand ses branches deviennent tendres et que ses feuilles poussent, vous savez que l'été est proche ;
[24:33] de même quand vous verrez toutes ces choses, sachez qu'ils est proche, qu'il est aux portes.
[24:34] En vérité, je vous le dis, cette génération ne passera pas que tout cela n'arrive.
[24:35] Le ciel et la terre passeront, mais mes paroles ne passeront point.
[24:36] De ce jour et de l'heure nul ne sait rien, ni les anges des cieux, ni le Fils ; personne, excepté le Père, seul.»
[24:37] «Tels les jours de Noé, tel l'avènement du Fils de l'homme :
[24:38] de même, en effet, que, dans les jours précédant le déluge, les gens mangeaient, buvaient, se mariaient, mariaient les leurs, jusqu'au moment où Noé entra dans l'arche ;
[24:39] de même qu'ils ne comprirent rien jusqu'à ce que survint le déluge qui les emporta tous, de même en sera-t-il de l'avènement du Fils de l'homme.
[24:40] Deux hommes seront alors dans un champ : l'un sera pris ; l'autre sera laissé.
[24:41] Deux femmes seront à tourner la meule : l'une sera prise ; l'autre sera laissée.
[24:42] Veillez donc, parce que vous ne savez pas quel jour viendra votre Seigneur.
[24:43] Sachez ceci : si le maître de la maison connaissait l'heure de la nuit à laquelle doit venir le voleur, il veillerait, il ne laisserait pas forcer sa maison.
[24:44] Eh bien ! vous, soyez prêts, parce que c'est à une heure où vous n'y penserez pas que le Fils de l'homme viendra.»
[24:45] «Quel est, par conséquent, le serviteur fidèle et prudent que son maître a mis à la tête de ses gens pour donner à chacun sa nourriture au moment voulu?
[24:46] C'est celui que le maître, à son arrivée, trouvera agissant ainsi.
[24:47] Heureux ce serviteur! En vérité, je vous le dis, le maître l'établira sur tous ses biens.
[24:48] Mais si le serviteur, étant mauvais, dit en son coeur : «Mon maître tarde»,
[24:49] et qu'il se mette à battre ses compagnons de service, à manger et à boire avec les ivrognes,
[24:50] son maître surviendra au jour où ce serviteur ne s'y attend pas et à une heure qu'il ignore,
[24:51] et il le, déchirera à coups de verges et lui donnera le même lot qu'aux hypocrites. Là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.»
[25:1] «Alors le Royaume des cieux sera semblable à dix vierges qui, allèrent, leurs lampes à la main, à la rencontre de l'époux.
[25:2] Cinq d'entre elles étaient folles, cinq étaient sages.
[25:3] Folles, car, en prenant leurs lampes, elles n'avaient pas emporté d'huile avec elles ;
[25:4] mais les sages avaient pris, avec leurs lampes, de l'huile dans des vases.
[25:5] L'époux tardant à venir, elles s'assoupirent toutes et s'endormirent.
[25:6] Au milieu de la nuit un cri retentit : «Voici l'époux ! sortez au-devant de lui!»
[25:7] Alors toutes ces vierges se levèrent et apprêtèrent leurs lampes,
[25:8] et les folles dirent aux sages : «Nos lampes s'éteignent ; donnez-nous de votre huile.»
[25:9] Les sages répondirent : «Il n'y en aurait peut-être pas assez pour nous et pour vous ; allez plutôt à ceux qui en vendent et vous en achetez.»
[25:10] «Or, pendant qu'elles allaient en acheter, l'époux vint, et celles qui étaient prêtes entrèrent avec lui au festin de noces ; et la porte fut fermée.
[25:11] «Enfin arrivent aussi les autres vierges, en disant : «Seigneur! Seigneur! ouvre-nous!»
[25:12] mais il leur répondit : «En vérité, je vous le dis, je ne vous connais pas.»
[25:13] Donc, veillez, parce que vous ne savez ni le jour ni l'heure.»
[25:14] «Tel encore le Royaume des cieux, tel un homme qui, partant pour un voyage, appela ses serviteurs et leur confia ses biens.
[25:15] A celui-ci, il donna cinq talents ; à celui-là, deux ; à ce troisième, un seul ; à chacun suivant sa capacité personnelle. Aussitôt après, il partit.
[25:16] Celui qui avait reçu les cinq talents alla les faire valoir et en gagna cinq autres.
[25:17] De même celui qui en avait deux en gagna deux autres.
[25:18] Mais celui qui n'en avait reçu qu'un, alla faire un trou dans la terre et il y enfouit l'argent de son maître.
[25:19] Après un long temps écoulé, le maître revint et il fit rendre compte à ses serviteurs.
[25:20] Celui qui avait reçu les cinq talents se présenta, en apportant cinq autres. «Seigneur, dit-il, tu m'as confié cinq talents ; en voici cinq autres que j'ai gagnés.»
[25:21] Le maître lui dit : «Bien, serviteur bon et fidèle ; c'est dans peu de chose que tu t'es montré fidèle, c'est sur beaucoup que je t'établirai. Entre dans la joie de ton seigneur.»
[25:22] S'approchant aussi, celui qui avait reçu les deux talents, dit : «Seigneur, tu m'as confié deux talents ; en voici deux autres que j'ai gagnés.»
[25:23] Son maître lui dit : «Bien, serviteur bon et fidèle ; c'est dans peu de chose que tu t'es montré fidèle, c'est sur beaucoup que je t'établirai. Entre dans la joie de ton seigneur.»
[25:24] Mais celui qui avait reçu un seul talent vint à son tour et dit : Seigneur, je savais que tu es un homme dur, tu moissonnes là où tu n'as pas semé, tu ramasses sur l'aire où tu n'as pas étendu de gerbes ;
[25:25] et, plein de crainte, je suis allé enfouir en terre ton talent. Le voilà ; tu es en possession de ce qui t'appartient.»
[25:26] Mais son maître lui répondit par ces paroles : «Mauvais serviteur ! paresseux ! tu savais que je moissonne là où je n'ai pas semé et que je ramasse sur l'aire où je n'ai pas étendu de gerbes.
[25:27] Il te fallait en conséquence placer ton argent chez les banquiers, et, à mon retour, j'aurais retiré ce qui est à moi avec un intérêt.
[25:28] Donc, ôtez lui le talent et donnez-le à celui qui a les dix.
[25:29] Car à tout homme qui a il sera donné, et il sera dans l'abondance ; mais à celui qui n'a pas, même ce qu'il a lui sera ôté.
[25:30] Quant au serviteur inutile, jetez-le dehors, dans les ténèbres, — là seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents.
[25:31] Lorsque le Fils de l'homme viendra dans sa gloire, et, avec lui, tous les anges, il s'assiéra sur son trône de gloire.
[25:32] Devant lui seront rassemblées toutes les nations ; et il séparera les uns d'avec les autres, comme le berger sépare les brebis d'avec les boucs ;
[25:33] il placera les brebis à sa droite, les boucs à sa gauche.
[25:34] Après quoi, le Roi dira à ceux qui seront à sa droite : «Venez, les bénis de mon Père! entrez en possession du Royaume qui vous a été préparé depuis la création du monde ;
[25:35] car j'ai eu faim, et vous m'avez donné à manger ; j'ai eu soif, et vous m'avez donné à boire ; j'étais étranger, et vous m'avez recueilli ;
[25:36] nu, et vous m'avez vêtu ; malade, et vous m'avez visité ; en prison, et vous êtes venus près de moi.»
[25:37] Les justes alors lui répondront par ces paroles: «Seigneur, quand est-ce que nous t'avons vu avoir faim et que nous t'avons nourri? Avoir soif et que nous t'avons donné à boire?
[25:38] Quand est-ce que, te voyant étranger, nous t'avons recueilli ; que, te voyant dans la nudité, nous t'avons vêtu?
[25:39] Quand est-ce que nous t'avons vu malade ou en prison et que nous sommes venus près de toi?»
[25:40] Et le Roi leur fera cette réponse : «En vérité,. je vous le dis, toutes les fois que vous avez fait cela à un seul des plus petits parmi mes frères que voici, c'est à moi que vous l'avez fait.»
[25:41] Puis il dira à ceux qui seront à sa gauche : «Allez loin de moi, maudits, dans le feu éternel préparé pour le diable et ses anges.
[25:42] Car j'ai eu faim et vous ne m'avez pas donné à manger ; j’ai eu soif et vous ne m'avez pas donné à boire ;
[25:43] j'étais étranger et vous ne m'avez pas recueilli ; nu et vous ne m'avez pas vêtu ; malade et en prison et vous ne m'avez pas visité.»
[25:44] Alors ils répondront, eux aussi, par ces paroles : «Seigneur, quand est-ce que nous t'avons vu avoir faim, avoir soif, être étranger ou nu, ou malade, ou en prison, et que nous ne t'avons pas assisté ?»
[25:45] Mais il leur fera cette réponse : «En vérité, je vous le dis, toutes les fois que vous n'avez pas fait cela à un seul de ces plus petits, que voici, c'est à moi que vous ne l'avez pas fait.
[25:46] Et ceux-là s'en iront à un châtiment éternel et les justes à une vie éternelle.»
[26:1] Quand Jésus eut achevé tous ces discours, il dit à ses disciples :
[26:2] «Vous savez que dans deux jours aura lieu la Pâque, et le Fils de l'homme va être livré pour être crucifié.»
[26:3] Alors s'assemblèrent les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens du peuple dans la coure du Grand-Prêtre appelé Kaïphe,
[26:4] et ils tinrent conseil sur les moyens de s'emparer de Jésus par ruse et de le tuer.
[26:5] Toutefois ils disaient : «Rien pendant la fête, il pourrait y avoir un soulèvement du peuple. »
[26:6] Jésus était à Béthanie, dans la maison de Simon le lépreux.
[26:7] Comme il était à table, une femme portant un vase d'albâtre rempli d'un parfum de grand prix, s'approcha de lui et répandit ce parfum sur sa tête.
[26:8] Ce que voyant, les disciples s'indignèrent. «A quoi bon cette perte?» dirent-ils.
[26:9] «On aurait pu vendre cela fort cher et en donner le prix à des pauvres.»
[26:10] Mais Jésus, le sachant, leur dit : «Pourquoi faites-vous de la peine à cette femme? C'est une bonne oeuvre qu'elle a faite pour moi :
[26:11] car les pauvres, vous les avez toujours avec vous, tandis que moi, vous ne m'avez pas pour toujours.
[26:12] Si elle a répandu sur mon corps ce parfum, elle l'a fait pour m'ensevelir.
[26:13] En vérité, je vous le dis : Partout où sera prêché cet Évangile — dans le monde entier — on racontera aussi, en mémoire d'elle, ce qu'elle a fait.»
[26:14] C'est alors que l'un des douze, appelé Judas l'Iskariôte, alla, trouver les chefs des prêtres
[26:15] et leur dit : «Que voulez-vous me donner? je vous le livrerai.» Ils lui payèrent trente sicles d'argent.
[26:16] A partir de ce moment, il chercha une occasion favorable pour le livrer.
[26:17] Le premier jour des Azymes, les disciples vinrent à Jésus et dirent : «Où veux-tu que nous te préparions le repas pascal?»
[26:18] «Allez à la ville, leur répondit-il, chez un tel et parlez-lui ainsi : le maître te fait dire : mon temps est proche ; c'est chez toi que je célèbre la Pâque avec mes disciples.»
[26:19] Les disciples firent comme Jésus leur avait ordonné et ils préparèrent la Pâque.
[26:20] Le soir venu, il se mit à table avec les douze,
[26:21] et il dit pendant qu’ils mangeaient : «En vérité, je vous le dis, un de vous me livrera.»
[26:22] Extrêmement affligés, ils se mirent chacun à lui demander : «Est-ce moi, Seigneur?»
[26:23] Il leur répondit par ces paroles : «Celui qui a mis la main au plat avec moi, celui-là même me livrera.
[26:24] Le Fils de l'homme cependant s'en va, selon qu'il est écrit de lui ; mais malheur à cet homme par qui le Fils de l'homme est livré ! Mieux vaudrait pour cet homme-là ne jamais être né !»
[26:25] Judas, celui qui le livra, s'adressa alors à lui : Est-ce que c'est moi, Rabbi ?» - «Tu l’as dit», répondit Jésus.
[26:26] Pendant qu'ils mangeaient, Jésus prit du pain et, ayant prononcé la bénédiction, il le rompit et le donna aux disciples en disant : «Prenez, mangez, ceci est mon corps.»
[26:27] Prenant ensuite une coupe, il rendit grâces, la leur donna et dit : «Buvez-en tous ;
[26:28] car ceci est mon sang, le sang de l'alliance, lequel, en faveur de plusieurs, est répandu pour la rémission des péchés.
[26:29] Et désormais, je vous le dis, je ne boirai plus de ce fruit de la vigne jusqu'en ce jour où je le boirai avec vous, nouveau, dans le Royaume de mon Père.»
[26:30] Après le chant des Psaumes, ils partirent pour le mont des Oliviers.
[26:31] Jésus leur dit alors : «Cette nuit, je vous serai à tous une occasion de tomber. Il est écrit en effet : Je frapperai le berger et les brebis du troupeau seront dispersées.
[26:32] Mais, après ma résurrection, je vous précéderai en Galilée.»
[26:33] Pierre lui adressa ces paroles : «Quand tous viendraient à faillir à cause de toi, pour moi je ne succomberai jamais !»
[26:34] Jésus lui répondit : «En vérité, je te dis que, durant cette nuit, avant qu'un coq chante, tu me renieras trois fois!»
[26:35] Pierre lui répliqua : «Me fallût-il mourir avec toi, non, je ne te renierai pas!» Tous les disciples parlèrent de même.
[26:36] Alors Jésus vint avec les disciples en un lieu appelé Gethsémané et leur dit : «Asseyez-vous ici pendant que je me retirerai là et que je prierai.»
[26:37] Puis, prenant avec lui Pierre et les deux fils de Zébédée, il commença à être dans la tristesse et dans l'angoisse ;
[26:38] il leur dit alors : «Mon âme est accablée de tristesse jusqu'à la mort. Restez ici et veillez avec moi !»
[26:39] Puis, s'étant un peu avancé, il se prosterna la face contre terre, et il pria en disant : «Mon Père, si cela est possible, que cette coupe passe loin de moi ! Toutefois, non pas comme je veux, mais comme tu veux.»
[26:40] Il retourna près des disciples et il les trouva qui dormaient et il dit à Pierre : «Ainsi vous n'avez pas eu la force de veiller une seule heure avec moi ?
[26:41] Veillez et priez, afin de ne pas succombera l'épreuve ; certes, l'esprit est prompt, mais la chair est faible.»
[26:42] De nouveau, une seconde fois, il s'éloigna et pria, en disant : «Mon Père, si cette coupe ne peut passer sans que je la boive, que ta volonté soit faite !»
[26:43] Il revint encore vers eux et les trouva qui dormaient ; leurs yeux, en effet, étaient appesantis.
[26:44] Il les laissa, s'en alla de nouveau et pria pour la troisième fois, répétant les mêmes paroles.
[26:45] Puis il vint aux disciples et leur dit : «Dormez maintenant ; reposez-vous ; voici que l'heure approche et le Fils de l'homme va être livré entre les mains des pécheurs.
[26:46] Levez-vous ! allons ! le voici ! il approche celui qui me livre !»
[26:47] Il parlait encore, lorsqu'arriva Judas, l'un des douze, et avec lui, envoyée par les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens du peuple, une foule nombreuse armée d'épées et de bâtons.
[26:48] Le traître était convenu avec eux d'un signal ; il leur avait dit : «Celui auquel je donnerai un baiser, ce sera lui ; vous vous en saisirez,»
[26:49] Il s'approcha aussitôt de Jésus et, en lui disant: «Salut, Rabbi!», il l'embrassa, avec effusion.
[26:50] «Mon ami, lui dit Jésus, pourquoi es-tu ici ?» Ils s'avancèrent alors et, mettant la main sur lui, ils le saisirent.
[26:51] Aussitôt un de ceux qui étaient avec Jésus étendit la main, tira son épée, frappa le serviteur du Grand-Prêtre et lui coupa l'oreille.
[26:52] Jésus lui dit alors : «Remets ton épée à sa place, car tous ceux qui prennent l'épée périront par l'épée.
[26:53] Crois-tu qu'il me serait impossible d'invoquer mon Père, qui enverrait à mon secours, maintenant même, plus de douze légions d'anges ;
[26:54] mais comment s'accompliraient les Écritures, où il est annoncé qu'il en doit être ainsi?»
[26:55] Ce fut à ce moment que Jésus dit à cette troupe : «Pour vous emparer de moi, vous êtes venus comme contre un brigand, avec des épées et des bâtons. Tous les jours, assis dans le Temple, j'enseignais et vous ne m'avez pas arrêté.».
[26:56] (Tout cela arriva pour accomplir ce qu'avaient écrit les prophètes). L'abandonnant alors, tous les disciples prirent la fuite.
[26:57] Ceux qui avaient arrêté Jésus le conduisirent chez Kaïphe, le grand-prêtre, où s'étaient réunis les Scribes et les Anciens.
[26:58] Pierre pourtant le suivait de loin. Il alla jusqu'à la cour du Grand-Prêtre, y entra et s'assit parmi les gens de service pour voir comment cela finirait.
[26:59] Les chefs des prêtres et le Sanhédrin tout entier cherchaient contre Jésus quelque faux témoignage qui le fît condamner à mort ;
[26:60] mais ils n'en trouvaient pas, bien que plusieurs faux témoins se fussent présentés. Enfin, il en survint deux
[26:61] qui parlèrent ainsi : «Cet homme a dit: «Je peux renverser le Temple de Dieu et en trois jours le rebâtir.»
[26:62] Le Grand-Prêtre se leva et lui dit : «Tu ne réponds rien à ce que ces gens-ci déposent contre toi?»
[26:63] Mais Jésus gardait le silence. Le Grand-Prêtre lui dit : «Par le Dieu vivant, je t'adjure de nous dire si tu es le Christ, le Fils de Dieu.»
[26:64] Jésus lui répondit : «Tu l'as dit ; et, de plus, je vous le déclare, désormais vous verrez le Fils de l'homme siégeant à la droite de la Puissance et venant sur les nuées du ciel.»
[26:65] Alors le Grand-Prêtre déchira ses vêtements : «Il a blasphémé! dit-il, qu'avons-nous encore besoin de témoins? vous venez vous-même d'entendre le blasphème!
[26:66] Quel est votre avis?» Ils répondirent : «Il mérite la mort.»
[26:67] Dès ce moment ils lui crachèrent au visage et lui donnèrent des coups de poing ; d'autres des coups de bâton,
[26:68] en disant : «Fais le prophète, Christ, en nous nommant celui qui t'a frappé.»
[26:69] Pierre cependant était dehors, assis dans la cour. Une servante, s’étant approchée, lui dit : «Toi aussi tu étais avec Jésus de Galilée.»
[26:70] Et lui de le nier devant tout le monde. «Je ne sais pas, dit-il, de quoi tu parles.»
[26:71] Comme il repassait la porte, une autre servante l'aperçut et s'adressant à ceux qui étaient présents : «Celui-ci était avec Jésus de Nazareth.»
[26:72] Il le nia de nouveau : «Je jure que je ne connais pas cet homme.»
[26:73] Un moment après, ceux qui étaient là vinrent à Pierre et lui dirent : «Certainement, tu en es, toi aussi ; ta prononciation te trahit.»
[26:74] Il se livra alors à des imprécations ; il jura qu'il ne connaissait pas cet homme. Soudain un coq chanta.
[26:75] Et Pierre se souvint de la parole qu'avait dite Jésus : «Avant qu'un coq chante, tu me renieras trois fois.» Il sortit et, dehors, il pleura amèrement.
[27:1] Le jour s'étant levé, tous les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens du peuple tinrent conseil sur les moyens de mettre Jésus à mort.
[27:2] Et l'ayant chargé de liens, ils l’emmenèrent et le livrèrent à Pilate, le procurateur.
[27:3] En voyant qu'il était condamné, celui qui l'avait livré, Judas, poussé par le remords, rapporta aux chefs des prêtres et aux Anciens les trente sicles d'argent,
[27:4] disant : «J'ai péché en livrant un sang innocent. » Ils répondirent : «Que nous importe? c'est ton affaire.»
[27:5] Jetant alors les pièces d'argent dans le sanctuaire, Judas partit et il alla se pendre.
[27:6] Mais les chefs des prêtres ramassèrent la somme, disant : «Il n'est pas permis de la verser dans le Korban, puisque c'est le prix du sang.»
[27:7] Et après en avoir conféré ensemble, ils en achetèrent le «Champ-du-Potier» pour la sépulture des étrangers.
[27:8] De là le nom de «Champ-du-Sang» qu'on lui donne encore aujourd'hui.
[27:9] (C'est ainsi que fut accomplie la parole du prophète Jérémie : «Et ils ont reçu les trente pièces d'argent, prix de celui qui avait été évalué, évalué par les enfants d'Israël,
[27:10] et ils les ont données pour le champ du potier, ainsi que me l'avait ordonné le Seigneur. »)
[27:11] Jésus comparut devant le procurateur, et celui-ci l'interrogea : «C'est toi qui es le Roi des Juifs?» demanda-t-il. Jésus lui répondit : «Tu le dis.»
[27:12] Mais lorsque les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens l'acculèrent, il ne répondit rien.
[27:13] Alors Pilate lui dit : «Est-ce que tu n'entends pas tout ce dont ils t'accusent?»
[27:14] Jésus ne lui répondit sur aucun point, ce dont le procurateur fut extrêmement surpris.
[27:15] Or à chaque fête il avait coutume de remettre en liberté un prisonnier, celui que le peuple choisissait.
[27:16] Il y en avait un fameux détenu à ce moment, du nom de Bar-Abbas.
[27:17] Alors Pilate, qui savait que c'était par une haine jalouse que les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens lui avaient livré Jésus,
[27:18] leur dit, pendant qu'ils étaient rassemblés : «Lequel voulez-vous que je vous délivre? Bar-Abbas ou Jésus, celui qu'on appelle Christ?»
[27:19] (Tandis qu'il siégeait ainsi à son tribunal, sa femme lui envoya dire ceci : «Qu'il n'y ait rien entre toi et ce juste ; car j'ai eu aujourd'hui, dans mon sommeil, un affreux cauchemar à son sujet.»)
[27:20] Les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens persuadèrent à la foule de demander Bar-Abbas et de perdre Jésus.
[27:21] Le procurateur reprit sa question : «Lequel des deux voulez-vous que je vous délivre?» — Bar-Abbas ! répondirent-ils.
[27:22] Pilate leur dit : «Et Jésus, celui qu'on appelle Christ, qu'en ferai-je donc?» Ils répondirent tous : «Qu'il soit crucifié!» —
[27:23] «Mais qu'a-t-il fait de mal ?» dit encore Pilate. Et ils n'en criaient que plus fort : «Qu'il soit crucifié!»
[27:24] Voyant qu'il n'obtenait rien et que, au contraire, le tumulte augmentait, Pilate demanda de l'eau, se lava les mains devant la foule et dit : «Je ne suis pas responsable du sang de cet homme, à vous d'en répondre !»
[27:25] Et tout le peuple répliqua par ces mots : «Le sang de cet homme! qu'il retombe sur nous et sur nos enfants!»
[27:26] Pilate leur délivra alors Bar-Abbas. Quant à Jésus, l’ayant fait flageller, il l'abandonna au supplice de la croix.
[27:27] Les soldats du procurateur, emmenant Jésus dans le prétoire, assemblèrent autour de lui toute la cohorte.
[27:28] Ils lui ôtèrent ses vêtements, l'affublèrent d'un manteau militaire de couleur rouge.
[27:29] Puis, tressant une couronne avec des épines, ils la lui mirent sur la tête, ainsi qu'un roseau dans la main droite ; après quoi, se mettant à genoux devant lui, ils le bafouaient en disant : «Salut, le roi des Juifs !»
[27:30] Ils crachaient sur lui ; ils lui prenaient le roseau et lui en donnaient des coups sur la tête.
[27:31] Quand ils eurent fini de se moquer de lui, ils lui ôtèrent le manteau, lui remirent ses vêtements et l'emmenèrent pour le crucifier.
[27:32] En s'en allant, ils rencontrèrent un homme de Cyrène, nommé Simon ; et ils l'obligèrent à porter la croix de Jésus.
[27:33] Ils arrivèrent à un endroit nommé Golgotha, c'est-à-dire place du Crâne.
[27:34] Ils lui donnèrent à boire du vin mêlé de fiel, et l'ayant goûté, il refusa de le boire.
[27:35] Après l'avoir mis en croix, les soldats se partagèrent ses vêtements, en les tirant au sort.
[27:36] Ils s'étaient assis et le gardaient.
[27:37] Au-dessus de sa tête ils avaient placé une inscription indiquant son crime : CELUI-CI EST JÉSUS, LE ROI DES JUIFS.
[27:38] On crucifia avec lui deux brigands, l'un à sa droite, l'autre à sa gauche.
[27:39] Les passants l'injuriaient ; ils lui disaient, en gesticulant de la tête :
[27:40] «Toi qui détruis le Temple, et en trois jours le rebâtis, sauve-toi donc toi-même si tu es fils de Dieu!» — et : — «Descends de la croix!»
[27:41] Les chefs des prêtres, avec les Scribes et les Anciens, se moquaient aussi de lui et disaient :
[27:42] «Il en a sauvé d'autres et il ne peut pas se sauver lui-même!»— «Ah! il est roi d'Israël! que maintenant il descende de la croix et nous croirons en lui!» -
[27:43] Il a mis sa confiance en Dieu! que Dieu maintenant le délivre ! s'il veut de lui!» En effet, il a dit : Je suis fils de Dieu.»
[27:44] De même, les brigands que l'on avait crucifiés avec lui l'insultaient.
[27:45] Depuis la sixième jusqu'à la neuvième heure, des ténèbres se firent sur tout le pays.
[27:46] Vers la neuvième heure Jésus jeta un cri et dit d'une voix forte : «Helei! Helei! Lema sabachthanei?» C'est-à-dire : «Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné?
[27:47] Quelques-uns de ceux qui étaient là l'entendant : «Il appelle Élie, celui-là !» dirent-ils.
[27:48] L'un d'entre eux courut aussitôt prendre une éponge, la trempa dans du vinaigre, et l'attachant à un roseau, il lui donna à boire. Mais les autres disaient :
[27:49] «Laisse donc! voyons si Élie viendra le délivrer.»
[27:50] Jésus, jetant de nouveau un grand cri, rendit l'esprit.
[27:51] Et voilà que le rideau du Temples se déchira en deux depuis le haut jusqu'en bas ; la terre trembla ; les rochers se fendirent ;
[27:52] les tombeaux s'ouvrirent ; plusieurs des saints qui étaient morts ressuscitèrent en leurs corps ;
[27:53] et sortant de leurs tombeaux après la résurrection de Jésus, ils entrèrent dans la ville sainte et apparurent à plusieurs.
[27:54] Voyant le tremblement de terre et tout ce qui se passait, le centurion et ceux qui, avec lui, gardaient Jésus, furent frappés d'épouvante et dirent : «Cet homme-là était véritablement fils de Dieu.»
[27:55] Or il y avait là plusieurs femmes qui regardaient de loin c'étaient celles qui, depuis la Galilée, avaient suivi Jésus afin de le servir.
[27:56] Parmi elles, Marie-Magdeleine, Marie, mère de Jacques et de Joseph, ainsi que la mère des fils de Zébédée.
[27:57] Sur le soir arriva un homme riche, originaire d'Arimathée, nommé Joseph. Il était, lui aussi, un disciple de Jésus.
[27:58] Il alla trouver Pilate et demanda le corps de Jésus. Pilate ordonna de le lui remettre.
[27:59] Et Joseph, prenant le corps, l'ensevelit dans un linceul blanc
[27:60] et le déposa dans un sépulcre neuf, qu'il avait taillé dans le roc, et qui lui appartenait. Il roula une pierre énorme contre la porte du tombeau et s'en alla.
[27:61] Or Marie-Magdeleine et l'autre Marie étaient là, assises en face du sépulcre.
[27:62] Le lendemain (qui était le jour après la Préparation) les chefs des prêtres et les Pharisiens se rendirent ensemble chez Pilate
[27:63] et lui dirent : «Seigneur, nous nous sommes souvenus que, de son vivant, cet imposteur disait : «Après trois jours, je ressusciterai.»
[27:64] Ordonne donc que la tombe soit soigneusement surveillée jusqu'au troisième jour, de peur que ses disciples ne viennent voler le corps et ne disent ensuite au peuple : Il est ressuscité des morts. Imposture dernière qui serait pire que la première.»
[27:65] Pilate leur répondit : «Vous avez des gardes ; allez, surveillez comme vous l'entendez.»
[27:66] Alors ils allèrent s'assurer du sépulcre, en scellant la pierre en présence de la garde.
[28:1] Le sabbat passé, à l'aube du premier jour de la semaine, Marie-Magdeleine et l'autre Marie vinrent pour regarder le sépulcre.
[28:2] Tout à coup il se fit un violent tremblement de terre : c'était un ange du Seigneur qui descendait du ciel ; il s'approcha de la pierre, l'éloigna en la roulant et s'assit dessus.
[28:3] Son aspect était foudroyant ; ses vêtements blancs comme la neige.
[28:4] Tremblants d'épouvante devant lui, les gardes étaient comme morts.
[28:5] Mais l'ange s'adressant aux femmes leur dit : «Pour vous, soyez sans crainte ; vous cherchez, je le sais, Jésus, le crucifié.
[28:6] Il n'est pas ici, car, ainsi qu'il l'avait dit, il est ressuscité. Venez, regardez la place où il était couché ;
[28:7] et allez vite dire à ses disciples qu'il est ressuscité des morts ; il vous précède en Galilée ; là vous le verrez ; c'est moi qui vous le dis.»
[28:8] Elles sortirent immédiatement du tombeau, tremblantes et, remplies de joie, et coururent porter la nouvelle à ses disciples.
[28:9] Et voilà que Jésus s'avança à leur rencontre et leur dit : «Salut!» Elles s'approchèrent, embrassèrent ses pieds, et l'adorèrent.
[28:10] Alors Jésus leur dit : «Soyez sans crainte ; allez dire de ma part à mes frères de partir pour la Galilée, là ils me verront.»
[28:11] Quand elles se furent éloignées, quelques-uns des gardes vinrent à la ville et apprirent aux chefs des prêtres tout ce qui était arrivé.
[28:12] Ceux-ci se réunirent avec les Anciens, et après en avoir conféré, ils donnèrent une grosse somme aux soldats avec cet ordre :
[28:13] «Vous direz que ses disciples sont venus pendant la nuit et qu'ils l'ont volé pendant que vous dormiez.
[28:14] Si le procurateur devait entendre parler de cette affaire, nous nous chargeons de le convaincre et nous vous mettrons à couvert.»
[28:15] Les soldats prirent l'argent et agirent d'après ces instructions. Et le bruit qu'ils répandirent parmi les Juifs dure encore aujourd'hui.
[28:16] Cependant les onze disciples se rendirent en Galilée, sur la montagne que Jésus leur avait désignée.
[28:17] Le voyant, ils l'adorèrent. Mais quelques-uns doutèrent.
[28:18] Jésus alors s'approcha d'eux et leur parla ; il leur dit : «A moi a été donnée toute puissance au ciel et sur terre ;
[28:19] allez faire de toutes les nations mes disciples, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils,
[28:20] et du saint Esprit et leur enseignant à garder tout ce que je vous ai commandé. Voici, je suis avec vous tous les jours jusqu'à la fin du monde.» 

### Mark

[1:1] Commencement de l’Évangile de Jésus-Christ.
[1:2] Ainsi qu’il est écrit dans le prophète Ésaïe: «Voici j'envoie mon messager pour te précéder Et te préparer le chemin ;
[1:3] Une voix crie dans le désert : Préparez la voie du Seigneur, Aplanissez ses sentiers,»
[1:4] Jean parut dans le désert, donnant et prêchant un baptême de repentance pour la rémission des péchés.
[1:5] Tout le pays de Judée et tous les habitants de Jérusalem accouraient à lui et ils étaient baptisés par lui dans le Jourdain, en confessant leurs péchés.
[1:6] Jean avait un vêtement de poils de chameau et une ceinture de cuir autour des reins, et il se nourrissait de sauterelles et de miel sauvage.
[1:7] Il disait dans sa prédication : «Il va venir, après moi, celui qui est plus puissant que moi ! Je ne suis pas même digne, en me baissant, de délier la courroie de ses sandales.
[1:8] Moi, je vous ai baptisés d'eau ; mais lui vous baptisera avec l'Esprit saint.»
[1:9] Or, ce fut en ces jours mêmes que Jésus arriva de Nazareth en Galilée et il fut baptisé par Jean dans le Jourdain.
[1:10] Soudain, comme il sortait de l'eau, il vit les cieux ouverts et l'Esprit en forme de colombe descendre sur lui,
[1:11] et des cieux vint une voix : «Tu es mon Fils bien-aimé, en toi je me complais..»
[1:12] Et l'Esprit aussitôt entraîna Jésus au désert ;
[1:13] et il fut quarante jours dans le désert, tenté par Satan, et il fut parmi les bêtes, et les anges le servaient.
[1:14] Après que Jean eut été livré, Jésus se rendit en Galilée et y prêcha l'Évangile de Dieu :
[1:15] «Les temps sont accomplis ; le Royaume de Dieu est proche ; repentez-vous et croyez à l'Évangile.
[1:16] Comme il longeait la mer de Galilée, il vit Simon et son frère André jetant leurs filets dans la mer, car ils étaient pêcheurs.
[1:17] Jésus leur dit : «Venez après moi et je vous ferai devenir des pêcheurs d'hommes.»
[1:18] Sur-le-champ ils abandonnèrent les filets et le suivirent.
[1:19] S'étant avancé un peu plus loin, il vit, dans leurs barques, Jacques, fils de Zébédée, et Jean, son frère, qui raccommodaient leurs filets.
[1:20] Il les appela aussitôt ; et ceux-ci, laissant leur père Zébédée dans la barque avec les hommes de service, partirent à sa suite.
[1:21] Ils arrivèrent à Capharnaüm. Il commença immédiatement à entrer les jours de sabbat dans la synagogue et à y enseigner ;
[1:22] et ils étaient extrêmement frappés de son enseignement ; car il le donnait comme ayant autorité, et non comme les Scribes.
[1:23] Il y avait à ce moment même dans leur synagogue un homme possédé d'un esprit impur ; il s'écria :
[1:24] «Qu'y a-t-il entre nous et toi, Jésus de Nazareth? Tu es venu pour nous perdre ; je sais qui tu es : le Saint de Dieu!»
[1:25] Jésus alors le menaça : «Tais-toi! sors de cet homme !»
[1:26] Agitant violemment le possédé, l'Esprit impur sortit de lui en poussant un grand cri.
[1:27] Tous les assistants, terrifiés, s'interrogeaient les uns les autres : «Qu'est-ce que ceci ? Voilà un enseignement nouveau! il commande avec autorité même aux Esprits impurs, et ils lui obéissent.»
[1:28] Sa renommée se répandit promptement et partout aux environs, dans la Galilée entière.
[1:29] En sortant de la synagogue, ils se rendirent tout d'abord, accompagnés de Jacques et de Jean, dans la maison de Simon et d’André.
[1:30] La belle-mère de Simon était couchée ; elle avait la fièvre. On s'empressa de le dire à Jésus.
[1:31] Alors, s'approchant d'elle, il la prit par la main et la fit lever. La fièvre disparut et elle se mit à les servir.
[1:32] Le soir venu, après le coucher du soleil, on lui apporta tous les malades et les démoniaques.
[1:33] La ville entière se pressait à la porte.
[1:34] Il guérit plusieurs malades atteints de maux divers ; il chassa aussi beaucoup de démons et il défendait aux démons de parler, parce qu'ils savaient qui il était.
[1:35] S'étant levé de grand matin, avant le jour, il alla dans un lieu solitaire et là il priait.
[1:36] Simon et ceux qui étaient avec lui se mirent à sa recherche.
[1:37] Quand ils l'eurent trouvé, ils lui dirent : «Tout le monde te cherche.»
[1:38] Il leur répondit : «Allons dans les villages voisins, afin que j'y prêche aussi, car c'est pour cela que je suis sorti.»
[1:39] Il alla donc prêcher dans leurs synagogues et dans toute la Galilée, en chassant les démons.
[1:40] Un lépreux vint à lui et, se jetant à ses genoux, lui adressa cette prière : «Si tu le veux, tu peux me guérir !»
[1:41] Il en eut compassion ; il étendit la main et le toucha en disant : «Je le veux, sois guéri.»
[1:42] La lèpre disparut à l'instant ; cet homme fut guéri.
[1:43] Jésus le congédia immédiatement, en lui donnant cet avertissement sévère :
[1:44] «Garde-toi de parler de ceci à personne ; mais va te montrer au prêtre et offre pour ta guérison ce que Moïse a prescrit ; que ce leur soit un témoignage.»
[1:45] Mais, à peine parti, le lépreux se mit à répandre la nouvelle et à la proclamer ; de sorte que Jésus ne pouvait plus même paraître publiquement dans une ville ; mais il se tenait dehors dans des endroits déserts, et on venait à lui de toutes parts.
[2:1] Quelques jours après, il retourna à Capharnaüm. On apprit qu'il était dans telle maison,
[2:2] et on y accourut en si grand nombre qu'il n'y avait plus de place même devant la porte. Il leur annonçait la parole,
[2:3] lorsque survinrent des gens lui amenant un paralytique, porté par quatre hommes.
[2:4] Comme il leur était impossible de parvenir jusqu'à lui à cause de la foule, ils démolirent le toit au-dessus de la place où il se trouvait ; et, l'ouverture faite, ils descendirent le grabat sur lequel était couché le paralytique.
[2:5] Jésus, voyant leur foi, dit à ce paralytique: «Mon enfant, tes péchés sont pardonnés.»
[2:6] Il y avait là quelques Scribes qui se tenaient assis et ces pensées leur montaient au coeur :
[2:7] «Comment cet homme peut-il parler ainsi? Il blasphème! Qui peut pardonner des péchés que Dieu seul ?»
[2:8] Jésus connut aussitôt, par son esprit, qu'ils faisaient intérieurement ces réflexions, et il leur dit : «Pourquoi de telles pensées dans vos coeurs?
[2:9] Lequel est le plus facile de dire, à ce paralytique : «Tes péchés sont pardonnés» ; ou de lui dire : «Lève toi, emporte ton grabat et marche!»
[2:10] Or, afin que vous sachiez que la le Fils de l'homme a sur la terre le pouvoir de pardonner des péchés...» s'adressant au paralytique : «A toi, je dis :
[2:11] Lève-toi! emporte ton grabat et retourne dans ta maison.»
[2:12] Et l'homme se leva, prit immédiatement son grabat et sortit devant tout le monde ; tous en étaient stupéfaits et glorifiaient Dieu : «Jamais, disaient-ils, nous n'avons rien vu de pareil!»
[2:13] De nouveau, il se dirigea vers la mer. Toutes les multitudes venaient à lui, et il les enseignait.
[2:14] En passant, il vit Lévi, fils d'Alphée, assis au bureau du péage. Il lui dit : Suis-moi !» et il se leva et le suivit.
[2:15] Jésus était à table dans ta maison de Lévi, et il arriva que beaucoup de publicains et de pécheurs s'y trouvèrent avec lui et avec ses disciples ; car ils étaient nombreux et ils l'avaient suivi,
[2:16] ainsi que les Scribes d'entre les Pharisiens. Ceux-ci, le voyant manger avec les publicains et les pécheurs, dirent à ses disciples : «Pourquoi mange-t-il avec des publicains et des pécheurs?»
[2:17] Ce qu'ayant entendu, Jésus leur dit : «Ce ne sont pas ceux qui se portent bien qui ont besoin de médecin, ce sont les malades. Je ne suis pas venu appeler des justes, mais des pécheurs.»
[2:18] Les disciples de Jean et les Pharisiens jeûnaient. Ils vinrent lui demander : «Pourquoi les disciples de Jean et ceux des Pharisiens pratiquent-ils le jeûne, tandis que tes disciples ne le pratiquent pas?
[2:19] Jésus leur répondit : «Les amis de l'époux peuvent-ils jeûner pendant que l'époux est avec eux. Tout le temps que l'époux est avec eux, ils ne peuvent jeûner.
[2:20] Des jours viendront où l'époux leur sera enlevé ; ils jeûneront dans ces jours.»
[2:21] «Personne ne coud un morceau d'étoffe neuve à un vieux vêtement : autrement le morceau neuf emporte une partie du vieux vêtement qu'il recouvre et fait une plus grande déchirure.
[2:22] Personne, non plus, ne verse du vin nouveau dans de vieilles outres : autrement le vin fera éclater les outres, et il sera perdu, les outres aussi.»
[2:23] Il arriva — un jour de sabbat — que Jésus passa par les blés. Ses disciples se mirent, chemin faisant, à cueillir des épis :
[2:24] «Vois donc», lui dirent les Pharisiens, «pourquoi font-ils ce qu'aux jours de sabbat il n'est pas permis de faire?»
[2:25] Il leur répondit : «N'avez-vous jamais lu ce que fit David quand il fut contraint par la nécessité et qu'il eut faim, et ce que firent ses compagnons?
[2:26] Comment, sous le grand-prêtre Abiathar, il entra dans la maison de Dieu et mangea les pains de proposition, qu'il n'est permis qu'aux prêtres de manger, et en donna à ceux qui étaient avec lui?»
[2:27] Et il ajouta : «Le sabbat a été fait pour l'homme et non pas l'homme pour le sabbat.
[2:28] C'est pourquoi le Fils de l'homme est maître aussi du sabbat.»
[3:1] Une autre fois, il entra dans une synagogue, où se trouvait un homme qui avait la main paralysée.
[3:2] Ils l'observèrent pour voir si, un jour de sabbat, il le guérirait ; ils voulaient un prétexte à accusation.
[3:3] Jésus alors s'adressa à l'homme dont la main était paralysée : «Lève-toi au milieu de nous tous !»
[3:4] Puis il leur dit : «Aux jours de sabbat, est-il permis de faire le bien ou de faire le mal ? de sauver une vie ou de la perdre?» Ils gardèrent le silence.
[3:5] Alors, jetant sur eux un regard de colère, affligé d'un tel aveuglement de coeur, il dit à l'homme : «Étends la main!» Il l'étendit et sa main fut guérie.
[3:6] Quant aux Pharisiens, ils sortirent et allèrent immédiatement se concerter avec les Hérodiens sur les moyens de le perdre.
[3:7] Jésus se retira, avec ses disciples, du côté de la mer ; et une foule considérable, venue de Galilée et de Judée, l'y suivit.
[3:8] C'était une multitude immense, arrivant de Jérusalem, de l'Idumée, des terres situées au delà du Jourdain, des environs de Tyr et de Sidon, qui, à la nouvelle de ce qu'il faisait, venait à lui.
[3:9] Il dit alors à ses disciples de lui procurer une barque à cause de la foule qui risquait de l'étouffer.
[3:10] Il en guérissait, en effet, un grand nombre, et alors tous ceux qui avaient quelque mal se précipitaient sur lui, afin de le toucher.
[3:11] Quant aux Esprits impurs, lorsqu'ils le voyaient, ils tombaient devant lui et s'écriaient : «Tu es le Fils de Dieu» ;
[3:12] et, par de sévères menaces, il leur interdisait de le faire connaître.
[3:13] Ensuite il gravit la montagne ; il appela ceux qu'il lui plut de désigner lui-même et ils vinrent à lui.
[3:14] Alors il en choisit douze, auxquels il donna le nom d'apôtres, pour être avec lui et pour recevoir mission de prêcher,
[3:15] avec le pouvoir de chasser les démons.
[3:16] Voici les douze qu'il choisit : Simon, à qui il donna le nom de Pierre ; —
[3:17] Jacques, fils de Zébédée, et Jean, frère de Jacques, auxquels il donna le nom de Boanergès, c'est-à-dire fils du tonnerre ; —
[3:18] André ; — Philippe ; — Barthélemy ; — Matthieu ; — Thomas ; — Jacques, fils d'Alphée ; — Thaddée ; — Simon le Cananite ;
[3:19] Judas l'Iskariôte, celui-là même qui le trahit. Ensuite il entra dans une maison
[3:20] et la foule y accourut encore à tel point qu'ils ne pouvaient pas même manger.
[3:21] Ceux de sa parenté, l'ayant appris, vinrent pour l'emmener avec eux. On disait, en effet, qu'il avait perdu l'esprit.
[3:22] Quant aux Scribes, ceux qui étaient descendus de Jérusalem, ils disaient : «Il a en lui Beelzéboul», et : «C'est par le prince des démons qu'il chasse les démons.»
[3:23] Alors il les appela à lui et leur dit en paraboles : «Comment Satan peut-il chasser Satan ?
[3:24] Si un royaume est divisé contre lui, même, ce royaume ne peut subsister.
[3:25] Si une maison est divisée contre elle-même, cette maison ne pourra subsister ;
[3:26] de même si Satan se livre bataille à lui-même et se divise, il ne peut subsister, il touche à sa fin.
[3:27] Nul ne peut entrer dans la maison du guerrier et piller ce qu'il possède, s'il n'a tout d'abord chargé de liens le guerrier ; ce n'est qu'alors qu'il pourra piller sa maison.»
[3:28] En vérité, je vous le dis, toutes sortes de péchés seront pardonnés aux fils des hommes, ainsi que les blasphèmes aux blasphémateurs ;
[3:29] mais celui qui blasphème contre l'Esprit, qui est saint, ne reçoit point de pardon, n'en recevra jamais, mais il est coupable d'un éternel péché.»
[3:30] (C'était parce qu'ils disaient : «Il a en lui un Esprit impur).»
[3:31] Ce fut alors qu'arrivèrent sa mère et ses frères, qui, se tenant dehors, le firent demander.
[3:32] Quantité de gens étaient assis autour de lui, lorsqu'on lui dit : «Voilà dehors ta mère et tes frères qui te cherchent.»
[3:33] Il répondit ainsi : «Qui est ma mère et qui sont mes frères?»
[3:34] Puis il regarda ceux qui étaient assis en cercle autour de lui et dit : «Voici ma mère et mes frères ;
[3:35] faire la volonté de Dieu, c'est être mon frère, c'est être ma soeur, c'est être ma mère.»
[4:1] De nouveau il se mit à enseigner au bord de la mer. Il se rassembla autour de lui une multitude si prodigieuse qu’il monta dans une barque où il s'assit, et il se tint sur la mer, tandis que la foule restait à terre au bord de l'eau.
[4:2] Il leur enseignait beaucoup de choses en paraboles et il leur disait dans son enseignement :
[4:3] «Écoutez! Voilà que le semeur est sorti pour semer.
[4:4] Il jette sa semence, et il est arrivé qu'un grain est tombé le long du chemin et les oiseaux sont venus et l'ont mangé.»
[4:5] «Un autre est tombé sur un sol pierreux, où il n'y avait pas beaucoup de terre, et il a immédiatement poussé, parce que la terre était sans profondeur.
[4:6] Mais le soleil, en se levant, a brûlé la plante, qui, n'ayant point de racines, s'est desséchée.»
[4:7] «Un autre grain est tombé parmi les épines ; et les épines ont grandi et l'ont étouffé, de sorte qu'il n'a point donné de fruit.»
[4:8] «D'autres grains sont tombés dans la bonne terre, et ceux-là, montant et croissant, ont donné du fruit, tel grain en a produit trente, tel autre soixante, tel autre cent.»
[4:9] Et il ajouta : «Que celui qui a des oreilles pour entendre, entende!»
[4:10] Lorsqu'il fut seul, ceux qui l'entouraient l'interrogèrent avec les douze sur les paraboles.
[4:11] Il leur dit : «A vous il est donné de pénétrer le mystère du Royaume de Dieu ; mais à ceux-là, ceux du dehors, tout arrive sous forme de paraboles,
[4:12] afin que tout en regardant parfaitement, ils ne voient point, tout en entendant parfaitement, ils ne comprennent point, et cela pour qu'ils ne se convertissent pas et qu'il ne leur soit point pardonné.»
[4:13] Et il ajouta : «Ne comprenez-vous pas cette parabole ? Comment donc comprendrez-vous toutes les paraboles?
[4:14] Le semeur sème la parole.
[4:15] Les uns sont le long du chemin où la parole est semée, et quand ils l'ont entendue, Satan vient aussitôt et enlève la parole semée en eux.
[4:16] Les autres sont semblables ; il est des grains qui sont semés sur un sol pierreux : ceux-là quand ils entendent la parole, l'accueillent aussitôt avec joie,
[4:17] mais ils n'ont pas de racine en eux mêmes ; ils ne sont que pour un temps ; une affliction ou une persécution survenant à cause de la parole, ils y trouvent aussitôt une occasion de chute.
[4:18] D'autres sont semés parmi les épines : ceux-là ont écouté, la parole,
[4:19] mais les sollicitudes du siècle présent, la séduction de la richesse et les passions diverses font invasion, étouffent la parole et la rendent stérile.
[4:20] Enfin il y a ceux qui sont semés sur la bonne terre : ils écoutent la parole, ils la reçoivent et donnent des fruits, l'un trente, l'autre soixante, l'autre cent.»
[4:21] Il leur dit aussi : «Est-ce qu'on apporte la lampe pour la mettre sous le boisseau ou sous le lit? N'est-ce pas pour la mettre sur le pied-de-lampe?
[4:22] Rien n'est caché que ce qui doit être manifesté ; rien n'est secret que pour être mis au jour.
[4:23] Si quelqu'un a des oreilles pour entendre, qu'il entende !»
[4:24] Il leur dit aussi : «Faites attention à ce que vous entendez ; la mesure que vous faites aux autres sera votre mesure, et il y sera ajouté.
[4:25] Car à celui qui a, il sera donné, et à celui qui n'a pas, même ce qu'il a lui sera ôté.»
[4:26] Il dit aussi : «Il se passe pour le Royaume de Dieu ce qui se passe lorsqu'un homme jette la semence sur la terre.
[4:27] Qu'il dorme ou qu'il veille, nuit et jour, la graine germe, la plante grandit, sans qu'il sache comment.
[4:28] D'elle-même la terre donne son fruit : c'est d'abord une herbe ; c'est ensuite un épi ; c'est enfin le blé remplissant cet épi.
[4:29] Et quand la terre a ainsi donné son fruit, il y met aussitôt la faucille, car est arrivée la moisson.»
[4:30] Il dit aussi : «A quoi assimilerons-nous le Royaume de Dieu? Ou par quelle parabole le représenterons-nous ?
[4:31] Il est comme un grain de sénevé, la plus petite de toutes les semences lorsqu'on la sème sur la terre,
[4:32] mais qui monte lorsqu’il est semé et qui devient plus grand que toutes les plantes potagères et pousse de si vastes branches que, dans leur ombrage, les oiseaux du ciel peuvent faire leurs nids.»
[4:33] C'est par un grand nombre de paraboles de ce genre qu'il leur annonçait ta parole, dans la mesure où ils pouvaient comprendre.
[4:34] Il ne leur parlait qu'en paraboles ; puis, en particulier, il expliquait tout à ses disciples.
[4:35] Ce même jour, le soir venu, il leur dit : «Passons à l’autre rive.»
[4:36] Ils renvoient la foule, et l'emmènent dans la barque où il se trouvait ; d'autres barques les accompagnaient.
[4:37] Un grand tourbillon de vent s'éleva ; les vagues se jetaient dans la barque avec une telle force que déjà elle se remplissait.
[4:38] Et lui, à la poupe, la tête sur le coussin, il dormait. Ils le réveillèrent et lui dirent : «Maître, est-ce que tu ne te soucies pas que nous périssions?»
[4:39] Alors il se leva, il fit des menaces au vent et il dit à la mer : «Silence ! apaise-toi !» Et le vent tomba, il se fit un grand calme.
[4:40] Puis il leur dit : «Pourquoi vous effrayer? N'avez vous point encore de foi?»
[4:41] Et, frappés de terreur, ils se disaient l'un à l'autre : «Qui donc est cet homme pour que le vent et la mer lui obéissent ?»
[5:1] Ils allèrent de l'autre côté de la mer, dans le pays des Géraséniens.
[5:2] Au moment même où il débarquait, vint à sa rencontre, sortant des sépulcres, un homme possédé d'un esprit impur.
[5:3] Il faisait sa demeure dans les tombeaux, et personne ne pouvait plus le lier même avec une chaîne.
[5:4] Plusieurs fois on l’avait enchaîné ; on lui avait mis les fers aux pieds ; mais il avait rompu les chaînes et brisé les fers, et nul n'avait la force de s'en rendre maître.
[5:5] Il ne cessait nuit et jour d'errer parmi les sépulcres et sur les montagnes, en jetant des cris et en se meurtrissant contre les rochers.
[5:6] De loin, il aperçut Jésus ; il courut se prosterner devant lui
[5:7] et lui dit, en criant de toutes ses forces : «Qu'y a-t-il entre moi et toit, Jésus, Fils du Dieu Très-Haut? Au nom de Dieu, je t'en conjure, ne me torture point.
[5:8] (En effet, Jésus lui disait : «Esprit impur, sors de cet homme.»)
[5:9] Puis il l'interrogea : «Quel est ton nom?» «Mon nom, répondit-il, est Légion, car nous sommes nombreux.»
[5:10] Et cette Légion le suppliait de ne pas l'expulser du pays.
[5:11] Or il y avait là, paissant sur la montagne, un grand troupeau de pourceaux,
[5:12] et les esprits impurs lui adressaient cette demande : «Envoie-nous dans ces pourceaux, afin que nous entrions en eux».
[5:13] Jésus le leur permit. Alors ils partirent et entrèrent dans les pourceaux, et, d'une course impétueuse, le troupeau se précipita dans la mer ; il y en avait environ deux mille ; ils se noyèrent dans les flots.
[5:14] Les gardeurs prirent la fuite et allèrent répandre la nouvelle dans la ville et dans les campagnes. Les habitants vinrent voir ce qui s'était passé.
[5:15] Ils s'approchèrent de Jésus et aperçurent assis, avec ses vêtements, et plein de bon sens, le démoniaque, celui, qui avait eu la Légion ; cela leur fit peur.
[5:16] Les témoins oculaires leur racontèrent ce qui était arrivé au démoniaque et aux pourceaux.
[5:17] Les habitants prièrent alors Jésus de quitter leur pays.
[5:18] Comme il montait dans la barque, l'homme qui avait été délivré des démons lui demanda la permission de rester avec lui.
[5:19] Jésus n'y consentit pas, mais lui dit : «Va dans ta maison, vers les tiens ; apprends-leur les grandes choses que le Seigneur t'a faites et comme il a eu pitié de toi.»
[5:20] Cet homme partit et se mit à publier dans la Décapole les grandes choses que Jésus lui avait faites, et tous étaient dans l'admiration.
[5:21] Lorsque Jésus, ayant repassé l'eau dans la barque, fut de retour de l'autre côté, une foule considérable s'assembla autour de lui ; et comme il était au bord de la mer,
[5:22] arriva un chef de synagogue, du nom de Jaïrus, qui, en l'apercevant, alla se jeter à ses pieds
[5:23] et lui adressa d'instantes prières : «Ma petite fille, lui dit-il, est à toute extrémité ; viens, impose-lui les mains, afin qu'elle soit guérie et qu'elle vive.»
[5:24] Jésus partit avec lui, suivi d'une multitude nombreuse qui le pressait de tous côtés.
[5:25] Or il y avait là une femme, malade d'une perte de sang depuis douze années ;
[5:26] elle avait beaucoup souffert entre les mains de plusieurs médecins ; elle y avait dépensé tout son avoir et cela n'avait servi à rien ; au contraire, son état avait plutôt empiré.
[5:27] Elle avait entendu parler de Jésus, et venant dans la foule, par derrière, elle toucha son vêtement ;
[5:28] car elle disait : «Si seulement je touche ses vêtements, je serai guérie.»
[5:29] Immédiatement tarit la source du sang qu'elle perdait : elle sentit en son corps qu'elle était guérie de son infirmité ;
[5:30] et, en même temps, Jésus, ayant senti en lui-même la vertu qui sortait de lui, se retourna vers la foule et dit : «Qui a touché mes vêtements?»
[5:31] Ses disciples lui répondirent : «Tu vois la foule te presser de tous côtés et tu demandes : «Qui m'a touché?»
[5:32] Mais il regardait tout autour de lui pour voir celle qui avait fait cela.
[5:33] Alors la femme, toute craintive et tremblante, ayant conscience de ce qui lui était arrivé, vint se jeter à ses pieds et lui dit toute la vérité.
[5:34] Et lui, il lui dit : «Ma fille, ta foi t'a guérie ; va en paix et sois délivrée de ton infirmité.»
[5:35] Il parlait encore lorsque survinrent des gens du chef de la synagogue: «Ta fille est morte, lui dirent-ils, pourquoi fatiguer davantage le maître?»
[5:36] Mais Jésus, sans tenir compte de cette parole, dit au chef de synagogue : «Ne crains point, crois seulement.»
[5:37] Puis il ne permit à personne de l'accompagner, si ce n'est à Pierre, à Jacques et à Jean, frère de Jacques.
[5:38] Ils arrivent à la maison du chef de synagogue. Là, Jésus a le spectacle de tout un tumulte de gens pleurant tout haut et poussant des cris.
[5:39] Il entre et leur demande : «Pourquoi ce tumulte et ces pleurs? L'enfant n'est pas morte, mais elle dort.»
[5:40] Et on se moque de lui. Mais Jésus, faisant sortir tout le monde, ne prend avec lui que le père, la mère et les disciples qui l'accompagnaient ; puis il entre là où était l'enfant.
[5:41] Il lui saisit la main en disant : Talitha Koum, ce qui signifie : «Jeune fille, je te le dis, réveille-toi.»
[5:42] La jeune fille se leva soudain et se mit à marcher ; en effet, elle avait douze ans. Ils furent sur-le-champ frappés d'une profonde stupeur.
[5:43] Il leur recommanda, expressément de n'en parler à personne ; puis il dit de donner à manger à la jeune fille.
[6:1] Jésus partit de là et retourna dans son pays ; ses disciples le, suivirent.
[6:2] Le sabbat étant arrivé, il se mit à enseigner dans la synagogue. Et beaucoup parmi ses auditeurs étaient extrêmement surpris et disaient : «D'où lui viennent ces choses? Qu'est-ce donc que cette sagesse qui lui est donnée? et que ces grands miracles accomplis par ses mains ?
[6:3] N'est-ce pas là le charpentier, le fils de Marie, fière de Jacques, de Josès, de Judas, de Simon? Et ses soeurs ne demeurent-elles pas ici, avec nous?» Pour eux il était une occasion de chute.
[6:4] Alors Jésus leur dit : «Un prophète n'est sans honneur que dans sa patrie, dans sa parenté, dans sa maison.»
[6:5] Et il ne put faire parmi eux aucun miracle, excepté quelques guérisons de malades par l'imposition des mains.
[6:6] Il s'étonnait de leur incrédulité et parcourait, en enseignant, les villages d'alentour.
[6:7] Ayant réuni les douze, il commença à les envoyer en mission, deux à deux, leur donnant puissance sur les Esprits impurs.
[6:8] Il leur ordonna de ne rien emporter pour la route ; un bâton seulement ; ni pain, ni sac, ni monnaie quelconque dans la ceinture ;
[6:9] pour toutes chaussures, leurs sandales, et de ne pas prendre de second vêtement.
[6:10] Et il leur disait : «En quelque maison que vous entriez, demeurez-y jusqu'à ce que vous partiez de l'endroit ;
[6:11] et si quelque part on ne vous reçoit ni ne vous écoute, sortez de là, secouant, en témoignage contre eux, la poussière attachée à vos pieds.»
[6:12] Ils partirent donc, prêchant qu'on devait se repentira ;
[6:13] et ils chassaient beaucoup de démons et, faisant des onctions d'huile à beaucoup de malades, ils les guérissaient.
[6:14] Le roi Hérode l'apprit ; (en effet, le nom de Jésus était déjà célèbre) et il dit : «Jean-Baptiste est ressuscité d'entre les morts! de là ces puissances miraculeuses qui agissent en cet homme!»
[6:15] Les uns disaient : «C'est Élie!» d'autres : «C'est un prophète semblable à l'un de ceux d'autrefois!»
[6:16] Mais Hérode, qui entendait tout cela, disait : «C'est celui que j'ai décapité! c'est Jean! c'est lui qui est ressuscité!»
[6:17] En effet, cet Hérode avait fait arrêter Jean, l'avait fait garrotter et emprisonner : et cela à cause d'Hérodiade, la femme de son frère Philippe, que lui, Hérode, avait épousée.
[6:18] Car Jean lui avait dit : «Il ne t'est pas permis d'avoir la femme de ton frère.»
[6:19] De sorte qu'Hérodiade était acharnée à sa perte ; elle voulait sa mort ; cependant elle ne pouvait l'obtenir,
[6:20] parce qu'Hérode avait du respect pour Jean qu'il savait être un juste et un saint ; il veillait sur lui ; sur plusieurs points sa parole l'inquiétait, et volontiers il l'écoutait.
[6:21] Mais Hérodiade rencontra un jour opportun ; ce fut lorsque Hérode, à l'anniversaire de sa naissance, donna un banquet à ses dignitaires, à ses officiers et aux principaux personnages de la Galilée.
[6:22] Dans la salle entra la fille même d'Hérodiade, et elle, dansa et plut à Hérode et à ses convives. Le roi dit alors à la jeune fille : «Demande-moi ce que tu voudras et je te le donnerai.»
[6:23] Il lui en fit le serment : «Tout ce que tu demanderas, je te le donnerai, fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume!»
[6:24] La jeune fille sortit et dit à sa mère : «Que demanderai-je?» La mère répondit : «La tête de Jean-Baptiste.»
[6:25] Rentrant en toute hâte auprès du roi, la fille, lui fit ainsi sa demande : «Je veux qu'à l'instant même tu me donnes sur un plat la tête de Jean-Baptiste.»
[6:26] Le roi fut accablé de tristesse ; cependant, à cause de son serment, à cause aussi des convives, il ne voulut pas la refuser.
[6:27] Et immédiatement il fit appeler un exécuteur et lui donna ordre de rapporter la tête de Jean.
[6:28] Cet homme alla donc décapiter Jean dans sa prison, et, rapportant la tête sur un plat, il la donna à la jeune fille, et la jeune fille la donna à sa mère.
[6:29] Ce qu'ayant appris, les disciples de Jean vinrent prendre son corps et l’ensevelirent dans un tombeau.
[6:30] De retour auprès de Jésus, les apôtres lui rendirent compte de tout : de ce qu'ils avaient fait et de ce qu'ils avaient enseigné.
[6:31] Il leur dit alors : «Venez à l'écart, vous aussi, dans quelque endroit solitaire et reposez-vous un peu.» (En effet, il y avait une telle foule d'allants et de venants qu'ils n'avaient pas même le temps de manger.)
[6:32] Ils partirent donc dans la barque pour se retirer dans quelque endroit solitaire, à l'écart.
[6:33] Mais plusieurs les virent s'éloigner et les reconnurent, et de toutes les villes ils accoururent à pied là où ils allaient et y arrivèrent avant eux.
[6:34] En débarquant, il vit une foule immense ; il en eut compassion, parce qu'ils étaient comme des brebis sans berger, et il se mit à leur donner de nombreux enseignements.
[6:35] L'heure s'avançait beaucoup et ses disciples, s'approchant, lui dirent : «L'endroit est désert et déjà il se fait tard.
[6:36] Renvoie-les, afin qu'ils aillent aux environs dans les maisons de la campagne et dans les villages acheter chacun quelque chose à manger.»
[6:37] Mais Jésus leur répondit : «Donnez-leur vous-mêmes à manger.» «Pour leur donner à manger, répliquèrent-ils, nous faudra-t-il aller acheter des pains pour deux cents deniers !»
[6:38] Jésus reprit : «Combien de pain avez vous? Allez voir.» Après s'en être informés : «Cinq, dirent-ils, et deux poissons.»
[6:39] Alors il leur commanda de les faire tous asseoir, en divers groupes, sur l'herbe verte.
[6:40] Ils se rangèrent à terre par bandes de cent et de cinquante.
[6:41] Puis Jésus, prenant les cinq pains et les deux poissons, leva les yeux au ciel, prononça la bénédiction, rompit les pains et les donna aux disciples pour qu'ils les servissent à la foule ; il partagea aussi, entre tous, les deux poissons.
[6:42] Tous mangèrent, tous furent rassasiés,
[6:43] et on emporta douze paniers pleins de restes de pain et de poissons.
[6:44] Quant au nombre de ceux qui avaient mangé, il était de cinq mille hommes.
[6:45] Aussitôt après, il pressa ses disciples de remonter dans la barque, de prendre les devants et de se rendre, sur la rive opposée, à Bethsaïda, tandis que lui, il renverrait la foule.
[6:46] Quand il l'eut congédiée, il s'en alla sur la montagne, pour y prier.
[6:47] Le soir vint au milieu de la mer était la barque ; à terre, Jésus, demeuré seul.
[6:48] Les voyant qui se fatiguaient à ramer, car le vent leur était contraire, il vint à eux, vers la quatrième veille de la nuit, en marchant sur la mer, et il voulait les dépasser ;
[6:49] quand ils le virent, marchant sur la mer, ils crurent que c'était un fantôme et jetèrent des cris.
[6:50] Tous, en effet, le voyaient et étaient bouleversés. Mais aussitôt il leur parla ; il leur dit : «Rassurez-vous ; c'est moi ; soyez sans crainte.»
[6:51] Il monta avec eux dans la barque et le vent cessa. Leur stupeur allait grandissant ;
[6:52] car ils n'avaient pas même compris le, miracle des pains, tellement leur coeur était aveuglé.
[6:53] Ayant passé l'eau, ils arrivèrent au pays de Gennésaret, et ils abordèrent.
[6:54] A leur sortie de la barque, Jésus fut immédiatement reconnu.
[6:55] Alors toute la contrée fut en mouvement ; on se mit à lui apporter les malades sur leurs grabats, partout où l'on apprenait sa présence.
[6:56] Et partout où il entrait, villages, villes ou bourgades, on déposait les malades sur les places publiques, et on le priait de les laisser seulement toucher la frange de son vêtement ; et tous ceux qui la touchaient étaient guéris.
[7:1] Les Pharisiens et certains Scribes qui arrivaient de Jérusalem, se réunirent près de lui.
[7:2] Ils avaient vu quelques-uns de ses disciples prendre leur repas avec des mains impures, c'est-à-dire non purifiées par des ablutions. —
[7:3] (En effet, les Pharisiens et, en général, les Juifs ne mangent pas sans avoir pratiqué des ablutions sur les mains, y compris le poignet, conformément aux traditions des Anciens.
[7:4] Lorsqu'ils reviennent du marché, ils ne mangent pas avant de s'être plongés dans l'eau. Ils ont également une foule d'autres pratiques qu'ils observent par tradition : des ablutions de coupes, de vases de terre et de vases de cuivre). —
[7:5] Les Pharisiens et les Scribes posèrent donc une question à Jésus : «Pourquoi tes disciples ne suivent-ils pas la tradition des Anciens et prennent-ils leur repas avec des mains impures?
[7:6] Il leur répondit : «C'est bien à vous, hypocrites !, que s'applique la prophétie d'Ésaïe : «C'est des lèvres, est-il écrit, que ce peuple m' honore ! Quant à son coeur, il est fort loin de moi!
[7:7] C'est en vain qu'ils me rendent un culte! Ils enseignent des doctrines qui ne sont que des ordonnances humaines»
[7:8] «Vous laissez de côté le commandement de Dieu et vous observez la tradition des hommes! »
[7:9] Puis il ajouta : «Ah! que vous savez bien violer le commandement de Dieu pour observer votre tradition!
[7:10] Ainsi Moïse a dit: Honore ton père et ta mère.» et: «Qu'il soit puni de mort, celui qui maudira son père ou sa mère».
[7:11] Mais vous, voici ce que vous enseignez : Si un fils dit à son père ou à sa mère : «Je déclare Korban, c'est-à-dire offrande à Dieu, ce dont tu voudrais être assisté par moi»,
[7:12] il a la permission de ne plus rien faire ni pour son père ni pour sa mère.
[7:13] Et voilà comment, par la tradition que vous enseignez, vous réduisez à néant la parole de Dieu! Et combien d'autres choses pareilles vous faites!»
[7:14] De nouveau, il appela à lui la multitude : «Écoutez-moi tous, leur dit-il, et comprenez!
[7:15] Il n'est rien d'extérieur à l'homme qui, entrant en lui, puisse le rendre impur, c'est, au contraire, ce qui sort de l'homme qui le rend impur.
[7:16] (Si quelqu'un a des oreilles pour entendre, qu'il entende).
[7:17] Lorsque, rentré dans la maison, il fut loin de la foule, ses disciples l'interrogèrent sur cette parabole.
[7:18] Il leur répondit : «Eh quoi ! vous aussi, vous êtes sans intelligence? Ne comprenez-vous pas que rien de ce qui est extérieur ne peut, en entrant dans l'homme, le rendre impur,
[7:19] puisque cela n'entre pas dans son coeur, mais dans son ventre, puis s'en va en quelque lieu secret, ce qui montre que tous les aliments sont également pure?»
[7:20] Il dit aussi : «Ce qui, sort de l'homme, voilà ce qui le rend impur!
[7:21] car c'est de l'intime du coeur des hommes que sortent les pensées mauvaises : fornications, vols, homicides,
[7:22] adultères, rapacités, méchancetés, tromperie, impudicité, envie, calomnie, orgueil, démence.
[7:23] Toutes ces mauvaises choses sortent du dedans et rendent l'homme impur.»
[7:24] Parti de là, Jésus se rendit vers les frontières de Tyr et de Sidon. Il voulait, dans la maison où il entra, rester inconnu ; mais il ne lui fut pas possible de demeurer caché,
[7:25] car aussitôt qu'elle apprit sa présence, une femme, dont la fille était possédée d'un Esprit impur, entra auprès de lui et se jeta à ses pieds.
[7:26] Cette femme, syro-phénicienne de naissance, était païenne. Elle lui demanda de chasser de sa fille le démon.
[7:27] Il lui répondit : «Laisse d'abord se rassasier les enfants ; il n'est pas bon de prendre le pain des enfants et de le jeter aux chiens.»
[7:28] Elle répliqua en disant : «Si, Seigneur, même les chiens mangent, sous la table, quelques-unes des miettes des enfants.»
[7:29] Alors il lui dit : «A cause de cette parole, va! le démon est sorti de ta fille!»
[7:30] Elle retourna chez elle et trouva l'enfant reposant sur son lit ; le démon était chassé.
[7:31] Il reprit sa route, partit des environs de Tyr et revint par Sidon vers la mer de Galilée en traversant le territoire de la Décapole.
[7:32] On lui amena un sourd qui parlait difficilement et on le pria d'étendre la main sur lui.
[7:33] Il le conduisit hors de la foule, à l'écart, lui mit les doigts dans les oreilles, et toucha sa langue avec de la salive ;
[7:34] puis, levant les yeux au ciel, il poussa un soupir et lui dit : «Ephphatah ; (ce mot signifie : ouvre-toi).
[7:35] Les oreilles de ce sourd s'ouvrirent, et sa langue attachée se délia sur-le-champ : il parlait distinctement.
[7:36] Il leur recommanda de n'en rien dire à personne ; mais plus il le leur recommandait, plus ils le publiaient partout ;
[7:37] plus aussi était profonde leur surprise : Ils disaient : «Tout ce qu'il a fait est parfait! les sourds, il les fait entendre! les muets, il les fait parler!»
[8:1] Il arriva encore une fois, vers cette époque, que la foule étant très nombreuse et n'ayant pas de quoi manger, Jésus appela les disciples et leur dit :
[8:2] «J'ai compassion de cette multitude ; voici déjà trois jours qu'ils ne me quittent pas et ils n'ont pas de quoi manger.
[8:3] Si je les renvoie chez eux à jeun, ils tomberont en défaillance sur la route ; quelques-uns d'entre eux sont venus de loin.»
[8:4] Ses disciples lui répondirent : «Où pourrait-on, au milieu de ce désert, trouver des pains pour les rassasier?» —
[8:5] «Combien de pains avez-vous?» leur demanda Jésus. — «Sept», dirent-ils.
[8:6] Il donna ordre à la foule de s'asseoir par terre. Prenant ensuite les sept pains et rendant grâces, il les rompit et les donna à ses disciples pour qu'ils en fissent la distribution ; et ils les distribuèrent à la multitude.
[8:7] Ils avaient encore quelques poissons. Jésus les bénit aussi et les fit distribuer.
[8:8] Tous mangèrent et furent rassasiés. Des morceaux qui restèrent on emporta sept corbeilles ;
[8:9] or ils étaient quatre mille environ. Ensuite Jésus les congédia.
[8:10] Immédiatement après, il monta dans la barque avec ses disciples il et se rendit dans le pays de Dalmanutha,
[8:11] où survinrent les Pharisiens qui se mirent à discuter avec lui, lui demandant un signe venant du ciel ; c'était pour le mettre à l'épreuve.
[8:12] Quant à lui, il dit en soupirant du plus profond de son coeur : «Pourquoi cette race-là demande-t-elle un signe? Je vous le dis en vérité, à cette race-là il ne sera point donné de signe!»
[8:13] Il les laissa, remonta, dans la barque et passa sur l'autre rive.
[8:14] Or ils oublièrent de prendre des pains ; ils n'en avaient qu'un seul avec eux dans la barque ;
[8:15] et comme Jésus leur adressait cette recommandation : «Faites bien attention, prenez bien garde au levain des Pharisiens et à celui d'Hérode», —
[8:16] ils se communiquèrent leurs pensées : «C'est parce que nous n'avons pas de pains !»
[8:17] Jésus, le sachant, leur dit : «Comment pouvez-vous penser aux pains que vous n'avez pas? N'avez-vous donc encore ni compréhension, ni intelligence? Votre coeur est-il toujours aveuglés?
[8:18] Vous avez des yeux, vous ne voyez pas! Vous avez des oreilles, vous n'entendez pas ! Vous n'avez pas de mémoire!
[8:19] Quand j'ai rompu les cinq pains pour les cinq mille hommes, combien de paniers pleins de morceaux avez-vous emportés?» — «Douze», répondirent-ils. —
[8:20] «Et quand j'ai rompu les sept pains pour les quatre mille hommes, combien de corbeilles avez-vous remplies de morceaux et avez-vous emportées?» — «Sept», répondirent-ils. —
[8:21] Il reprit : «Est-ce que vous ne comprenez pas encore?»
[8:22] Ils arrivèrent à Bethsaïda ; on lui amena un aveugle et on le pria de le toucher.
[8:23] Prenant cet homme par la main, il le conduisit hors du village. Puis il lui mit de la salive sur les yeux, posa les mains sur lui et lui demanda s'il commençait à voir.
[8:24] Celui-ci regarda et répondit : «J'aperçois des hommes, parce que je vois comme des arbres qui marchent.»
[8:25] Alors Jésus posa encore une fois ses mains sur les yeux de l'aveugle, qui regarda : il était guéri ; il apercevait distinctement toutes choses.
[8:26] Jésus le renvoya dans sa maison en lui disant : «Ne rentre pas dans le village.»
[8:27] Jésus s'en alla, accompagné de ses disciples, vers les villages voisins de Césarée de Philippe. Durant la route, il interrogea ses disciples ; il leur dit : «Qui dit-on que je suis?»
[8:28] Ils lui répondirent : «Les uns, que tu es Jean Baptiste ; les autres, Élie ; d'autres encore, l'un des prophètes.»
[8:29] «Mais vous, reprit-il, qui dites-vous que je suis?» Pierre répondit par ces mots : «Tu es le Christ.»
[8:30] Il leur défendit expressément de parler de lui à qui que ce soit.
[8:31] Puis il commença à leur apprendre qu'il lui fallait, lui, le Fils de l'homme : — beaucoup souffrir ; — être rejeté par les Anciens, les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes ; — être mis à mort ; — ressusciter au bout de trois jours.
[8:32] Il exposait tout cela très clairement. Le tirant alors à l'écart, Pierre se mit à le reprendre.
[8:33] Mais lui, se retournant et regardant ses disciples, reprit sévèrement Pierre, lui disant : «Va-t'en ! Arrière de moi, Satan! parce que tes pensées ne sont pas de Dieu, mais des hommes.»
[8:34] Ayant appelé à lui la foule, ainsi que ses disciples, il leur dit : «Si quelqu'un veut venir derrière moi et me suivre, qu'il renonce à lui-même, qu'il porte sa croix et qu'il me suive.
[8:35] Celui qui voudra sauver sa vie, la perdra ; et il sauvera sa vie, celui qui l'aura perdue à cause de moi et de l'Évangile.
[8:36] A quoi servira-t-il à un homme de gagner le monde entier s'il perd sa vie?
[8:37] Qu'est-ce qu'il donnera en échange de sa vie?
[8:38] De celui qui, au sein de cette génération adultère et pécheresse, aura eu honte de moi et de mes paroles, le Fils de l'homme aura honte à son tour, quand il viendra dans la gloire de son Père avec les saints anges!»
[9:1] Il ajouta : «En vérité, je vous le dis, quelques-uns sont ici présents qui ne goûteront point la mort avant d'avoir vu venir, en puissance, le Royaume de Dieu.»
[9:2] Six jours après, emmenant seuls avec lui Pierre, Jacques et Jean, Jésus les conduisit sur une haute montagne, à l'écart. Et alors, devant eux, il fut transfiguré :
[9:3] ses vêtements devinrent resplendissants et d'une éblouissante blancheur. Nul foulon ici-bas ne saurait en produire une semblable.
[9:4] Élie leur apparut ; avec lui était Moïse ; et ils s'entretinrent avec Jésus.
[9:5] Pierre alors, s'adressant à Jésus, lui dit : «Rabbi !, qu'il nous est bon d'être ici! Dressons trois tentes, une pour toi, une pour Moïse, une pour Élie...»
[9:6] Il ne savait que dire ; ils étaient, en effet, terrifiés.
[9:7] Une nuée survint qui les enveloppa, et de cette nuée sortit une voix : «Celui-ci est mon Fils, le bien-aimé, écoutez-le!»
[9:8] Immédiatement ils regardèrent autour d'eux, et ne virent plus personne ; Jésus seul était avec eux.
[9:9] Comme ils descendaient de la montagne, il leur ordonna de ne raconter à personne ce qu'ils venaient de voir, si ce n'est lorsque le Fils de l'homme serait ressuscité d'entre les morts.
[9:10] Ils retinrent ces mots : «ressuscité d'entre les morts», et se demandaient, à part eux, ce qu'ils signifiaient ;
[9:11] et ils l'interrogèrent : «Comment les Scribes disent-ils : «Il faut, avant tout, qu'Élie vienne?»
[9:12] Il leur répondit : «Élie viendra avant tout et rétablira toutes choses ; d'où vient alors qu'il est écrit du Fils de l'homme : il doit beaucoup souffrir et être méprisé?
[9:13] Eh bien, je vous le déclare, Élie est venu et ils lui ont fait tout ce qu'ils ont voulu, conformément à ce qui est écrit de lui.»
[9:14] De retour auprès des disciples, ils les trouvèrent entourés d'une foule considérable ; des Scribes discutaient avec eux.
[9:15] Dès que la multitude aperçut Jésus, chacun fut en émoi ; on accourut à lui, on le saluait.
[9:16] Il les interrogea : «Qu'est-ce que cette discussion ?»
[9:17] L'un de ceux qui était dans la foule répondit : «Maître, je t'ai apporté mon fils ; un Esprit muet le possède,
[9:18] et partout où il s'empare de lui, il le renverse par terre ; alors l'enfant écume, grince des dents et devient tout raide. J'ai demandé à tes disciples de le chasser : ils n'en ont pas eu la force.» —
[9:19] «Ô génération sans foi, dit Jésus en leur répondant, jusqu'à quand serai-je au milieu de vous? Jusqu'à quand vous supporterai-je? Apportez-moi l'enfant.»
[9:20] On le lui apporta. Mais à peine eut-il vu
[9:21] Jésus que l'Esprit lui donna des convulsions, et, tombant par terre, il se tordait en écumant. Jésus interrogea son père : «Combien y a-t-il de temps que cela lui arrive?» — «Depuis sa première enfance», répondit-il ;
[9:22] «et souvent l'Esprit l'a jeté tantôt dans le feu, tantôt dans l'eau pour le faire périr ; si tu peux y faire quelque chose, aie pitié de nous, et viens à notre secours.»
[9:23] Jésus lui répondit : «Tu me dis : si tu peux ! Tout est possible à celui qui croit.»
[9:24] Aussitôt le père de l'enfant s'écria : «Je crois! Viens en aide à mon incrédulité !»
[9:25] Jésus, voyant la foule accourir, fit des menaces à l'Esprit impur : il lui dit : «Esprit sourd et muet, c'est moi qui te l'ordonne, sors de cet enfant et désormais n'y rentre plus!»
[9:26] L'Esprit jeta un cri et sortit, en agitant violemment l'enfant, qui devint comme mort ; aussi un grand nombre disaient-ils : «Il est mort.»
[9:27] Mais Jésus le prit par la main, le releva ; il revint à lui.
[9:28] Quand Jésus fut entré dans une maison, ses disciples lui demandèrent en particulier : «Pourquoi, nous, avons-nous été impuissants à expulser cet Esprit?»
[9:29] Jésus leur répondit : «Il est d'une espèce, qui ne peut absolument se chasser que par la prière.»
[9:30] Partis de là, ils traversèrent la Galilée, et il voulait que personne ne le sût,
[9:31] car il instruisait ses disciples ; il leur disait : «Le Fils, de l'homme sera livrés entre les mains des hommes ; ils le tueront ; puis, une fois mis à mort, après trois jours, il ressuscitera.»
[9:32] Mais ils ne comprenaient pas ce langage et ils craignaient de l'interroger.
[9:33] Ils arrivèrent à Capharnaüm ; et quand il fut à la maison, il leur demanda : «De quoi vous entreteniez-vous pendant la route?»
[9:34] Ils gardèrent le silence ; car ils avaient discuté en chemin sur celui d'entre eux qui était le plus grand.
[9:35] Jésus s'assit, appela les douze et leur dit : «Si quelqu'un veut être le premier, qu'il soit le dernier de tous et le serviteur de tous.»
[9:36] Puis il prit un enfant, le plaça au milieu d'eux, et, après l'avoir embrassé, il leur dit :
[9:37] «Qui reçoit en mon nom un enfant tel que celui-ci me reçoit. Et qui me reçoit, reçoit non pas moi, mais Celui qui m'a envoyé.»
[9:38] «Maître, lui dit Jean, nous avons vu un homme chasser des démons en ton nom, et comme il ne nous suit pas, nous l'en avons empêché.»
[9:39] Jésus répondit : «Ne l'en empêchez point, car per sonne, après avoir, en mon nom, fait un miracle, ne peut aussitôt mal parler de moi.
[9:40] En effet, qui n'est pas contre nous est pour nous.
[9:41] Et quiconque, en mon nom et parce que vous êtes au Christ, vous aura donné à boire un verre d'eau, je vous le dis en vérité, ne perdra point sa récompense.»
[9:42] «Quant à celui qui aura été une occasion de chute pour l'un de ces petits qui croient, il vaudrait mieux pour lui qu'on lui attachât au cou une de ces meules que tournent les ânes, et qu'on le jetât dans la mer.»
[9:43] «Si ta main est pour toi une occasion de chute, coupe-la ; il t'est meilleur d'entrer mutilé dans la vie, que d'aller avec tes deux mains dans la Géhenne, dans le feu inextinguible.
[9:44] (où leur ver ne meurt point et où le feu ne s'éteint point).
[9:45] Si ton pied est pour toi une occasion de chute, coupe-le ; il t'est meilleur d'entrer estropié dans la vie que d'être jeté avec tes deux pieds dans la Géhenne.
[9:46] (où leur ver ne meurt point et où le feu ne s'éteint point).
[9:47] Si ton oeil est pour toi une occasion de chute, arrache-le ; il t'est meilleur d'entrer borgne dans le Royaume de Dieu que d'être jeté, avec tes deux yeux, dans la Géhenne
[9:48] où : «Leur ver ne meurt pas et le feu ne s'éteint pas.»
[9:49] Car tous seront salés par le feu.
[9:50] Le sel est bon : mais si le sel devient insipide, avec quoi l'assaisonnerez-vous? En vous-mêmes ayez du sel, et, entre vous, vivez en paix.»
[10:1] Jésus, partant de là, se rendit sur les frontières de la Judée et de l'autre côté du Jourdain. De nouveau, des multitudes se rassemblèrent autour de lui ; de nouveau, suivant sa coutume, il les enseignait.
[10:2] Les Pharisiens vinrent à lui et lui demandèrent: «Est-il permis à un mari de répudier sa femme?» C'était pour le mettre à l'épreuve.
[10:3] Il leur répondit par ces paroles : «Qu'est-ce que Moïse vous a prescrit?» —
[10:4] «Moise, dirent-ils, a permis d'écrire un acte de divorce et de la répudier.»
[10:5] Alors Jésus reprit: «C'est à cause de la dureté de vos coeurs qu'il vous a écrit ce commandement.
[10:6] Mais au commencement du monde Dieu «a fait un couple, mâle et femelle»,
[10:7] «à cause de cela l'homme laissera son père et sa mère
[10:8] et ils seront deux dans une seule chair. Ainsi ils ne sont plus deux, mais une seule chair.
[10:9] Donc, ce que Dieu a uni, qu'un, homme ne le sépare point.»
[10:10] Dans la maison, les disciples l'interrogèrent encore sur le même sujet.
[10:11] «Qui répudie sa femme, leur dit-il, et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère à l'égard de la première.
[10:12] Et si une femme qui a quitté son mari en épouse un autre, elle commet un adultère.»
[10:13] Comme on lui apportait des enfants pour qu'il les touchât, les disciples blâmaient ceux qui les lui apportaient.
[10:14] Jésus le vit et s'en indigna. Il leur dit : «Laissez les enfants venir à moi ; ne les en empêchez pas ; car c'est à ceux qui leur ressemblent qu'appartient le Royaume de Dieu.
[10:15] En vérité, je vous le dis, qui ne recevra pas, comme un enfant, le Royaume de Dieu, n'y entrera pas.»
[10:16] Puis il les embrassa et, posant les mains sur eux, il les bénit.
[10:17] Comme il se mettait en route, quelqu'un courut à lui, se jeta à ses genoux et lui fit cette question : «Bon maître, que dois-je faire pour acquérir la vie éternelle?»
[10:18] Jésus lui dit : «Pourquoi m'appelles tu bon? nul n'est bon, si ce n'est Dieu seul!
[10:19] Tu connais les commandements: «Tu ne seras point adultère ; tu ne seras point meurtrier ; tu ne seras point voleur ; tu ne rendras point de faux témoignage ; tu ne commettras point de fraude ; honore ton père et ta mère.»
[10:20] Il répondit : «Tout cela, maître, je l'ai observé dès ma jeunesse.» —
[10:21] Jésus, le regardant, l'aima et lui dit : «Une chose te manque, va vendre ce que tu as ; donnes-en le prix aux pauvres ; tu auras alors un trésor dans le ciel ; viens ensuite et suis-moi.»
[10:22] Ce langage l'affligea ; il s'en alla tout triste, car il avait beaucoup de biens.
[10:23] Jésus, regardant autour de lui, dit à ses disciples : «Combien difficilement entreront dans le Royaume de Dieu ceux qui ont des richesses!»
[10:24] Ces paroles surprenaient les disciples. Jésus reprit alors en ces termes : «Qu'il est difficile, mes enfants, d'entrer dans le Royaume de Dieu!
[10:25] Il est plus facile à un chameau de passer par l'ouverture d'une aiguille 'qu'à un riche d'entrer dans le Royaume de Dieu.»
[10:26] Ils furent absolument consternés : «Qui pourra être sauvé?» se dirent-ils l'un à l'autre.
[10:27] Jésus leur répondit en les regardant : «Aux hommes, cela est impossible ; mais non à Dieu ; car tout est possible à Dieu.»
[10:28] Pierre se mit alors à lui dire : «Et nous, nous avons tout quitté ! nous t'avons suivi!»
[10:29] Jésus répondit : «En vérité je vous le dis, personne, à cause de moi et à cause de l'Évangile,
[10:30] ne quittera une maison, des frères, des soeurs, une mère, un père, des enfants, des terres, sans qu'il ne reçoive le centuple dès maintenant, en ce temps présent, des maisons, des frères, des soeurs, des mères, des enfants, des terres, avec des persécutions et, dans le siècle à venir, la vie éternelle.
[10:31] Mais plusieurs des premiers seront derniers et les derniers premiers.»
[10:32] Ils étaient en chemin, montant à Jérusalem. Jésus marchait en avant des disciples effrayés ; ceux qui le suivaient étaient dans la terreur. De nouveau il réunit les douze et se mit à leur dire ce qui allait lui arriver :
[10:33] «Voilà que nous montons à Jérusalem ; le Fils de l'homme y sera livré aux chefs des prêtres et aux Scribes qui le condamneront à mort ; puis ils le livreront aux païens
[10:34] qui se joueront de lui, lui cracheront au visage, le flagelleront et le tueront et, après trois jours, il ressuscitera.»
[10:35] Jacques et Jean (les fils de Zébédée) s'approchèrent de lui et lui dirent : «Maître, nous voudrions que tu nous accordes ce que nous allons te demander.»
[10:36] Il répondit : «Que voudriez-vous que je vous accorde?» —
[10:37] «Promets-nous, reprirent-ils, que nous siégerons, au jour de ta gloire, l'un à ta droite, l'autre à ta gauche.»
[10:38] Jésus repartit: «Vous ne savez ce que vous demandez. Pouvez-vous boire la coupe que je bois? ou être baptisés du baptême dont je suis baptisé?» —
[10:39] «Nous le pouvons», lui dirent-ils. — Et Jésus répliqua : «La coupe que je bois, vous la boirez ; le baptême dont je suis baptisé, vous en serez baptisés.
[10:40] Mais quant à siéger à ma droite ou à ma gauche, ce n'est pas à moi de l'accorder ; ces places sont à ceux pour lesquels elles ont été préparées.»
[10:41] Les dix autres qui avaient entendu commençaient à s'indigner contre Jacques et Jean ;
[10:42] Jésus alors les appela et leur dit : «Vous savez que ceux qui passent pour régner sur les nations, en sont les dominateurs, et que les grands, dans ces nations, exercent sur elles un pouvoir impérieux.
[10:43] Il n'en est pas ainsi parmi vous. Au contraire, qui voudra devenir grand parmi vous, sera votre serviteur ;
[10:44] qui voudra devenir le premier parmi vous, sera l'esclave de tous.
[10:45] Car le Fils de l'homme n'est pas venu pour être servi, mais pour servir et donner sa vie comme rançon pour plusieurs.»
[10:46] Ils arrivèrent à Jéricho. Lorsqu'il sortit de la ville avec ses disciples et une foule nombreuse, un aveugle, Bartimée (fils de Timée) mendiait, assis sur le bord de la route.
[10:47] Entendant dire que c'était Jésus de Nazareth, il se mit à crier : «Fils de David, Jésus, aie pitié de moi!»
[10:48] Beaucoup le menaçaient pour le faire taire, mais il n'en criait que plus fort : «Fils de David, aie pitié de moi!»
[10:49] Jésus s'arrêta. «Appelez-le», dit-il. On appela cet aveugle, on lui dit : «Prends courage, lève-toi, il t'appelle.»
[10:50] Il se dressa aussitôt, rejeta son manteau et s'avança vers Jésus.
[10:51] Jésus alors lui adressa ces paroles : «Que veux-tu que je fasse pour toi?» L'aveugle répondit : «Que j'y voie! Rabbouni !»
[10:52] «Va, lui dit Jésus, ta foi t'a sauvé.» Et subitement il vit, et il suivit Jésus dans le chemin.
[11:1] Quand ils furent près de Jérusalem, de Béthanie et de Bethphagé, du côté du mont des Oliviers, Jésus envoya deux de ses disciples, en leur disant :
[11:2] «Allez à ce village qui est devant vous ; et tout de suite, à l'entrée, vous trouverez un ânon attaché, que personne n'a jamais monté. Détachez-le et l'amenez.
[11:3] Si l'on vous demande pourquoi vous faites cela, répondez : Le Seigneur en a besoin et on l'enverra immédiatement ici.»
[11:4] Ils partirent et, au détour du chemin, ils trouvèrent l'ânon attaché tout contre une porte extérieure ; ils le délièrent.
[11:5] Quelques-uns de ceux qui étaient là leur dirent : «Que faites-vous? Pourquoi détachez-vous cet ânon?»
[11:6] Ils répondirent ce que Jésus leur avait dit ; et on les laissa faire. Ils amenèrent donc l'ânon,
[11:7] sur lequel ils placèrent leurs manteaux, à Jésus, qui s'assit sur lui.
[11:8] Sur le chemin, un grand nombre étendirent leurs vêtements et d'autres des rameaux coupés dans les champs.
[11:9] Et ceux qui le précédaient et ceux qui le suivaient criaient : «Hosanna! Béni soit celui qui vient au nom du Seigneur!
[11:10] Béni soit le Règne qui commence, le Règne de notre père David! Hosanna au plus haut des cieux !»
[11:11] Il entra à Jérusalem et pénétra dans le Temple. Il promena autour de lui son regard sur toutes choses, et comme l'heure s'avançait, il partit avec les douze pour Béthanie.
[11:12] Le lendemain, comme ils sortaient de Béthanie, il eut faim.
[11:13] Apercevant de loin un figuier couvert de feuilles, il y alla pourvoir s'il n'y découvrirait pas quelque fruit ; mais quand il s'en fut approché, il n'y trouva que des feuilles. En effet, ce n'était pas encore le moment des figues.
[11:14] Alors il s'adressa à l'arbre et lui dit : «Que personne ne mange désormais de ton fruit!» Ce mot fut entendu des disciples.
[11:15] Quand ils furent arrivés à Jérusalem, Jésus entra dans le Temple et se mit à chasser les vendeurs et les acheteurs ; il renversa les tables des changeurs, ainsi que les sièges des marchands de colombes ;
[11:16] de plus, il ne laissait personne, portant un objet quelconque, passer par le Temple.
[11:17] Et voici ce qu'il enseignait : «N'est-il pas écrit : «Ma maison s'appellera, pour tous les peuples, maison de prière ? Et vous, vous en avez fait une caverne de brigands !»
[11:18] En l'entendant, les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes cherchaient par quels moyens ils le feraient périr. En effet, ils avaient peur de lui à cause du peuple, qui, tout entier, était extrêmement frappé de son enseignement.
[11:19] Quand venait le soir, ils sortaient de la ville ;
[11:20] or, en repassant le matin, ils virent le figuier desséché jusqu'à la racine.
[11:21] Se souvenant de ce qui s'était passé, Pierre dit à Jésus : «Rabbi, voici le figuier que tu as maudit ; il s'est desséché.»
[11:22] Jésus alors, s'adressant à tous, leur dit : «Ayez foi en Dieu!
[11:23] En vérité, je vous le dis : Si quelqu’un dit à cette montagne, sans aucune hésitation dans son coeur, et en croyant à l'accomplissement de sa parole : «Soulève-toi, et jette-toi dans la mer», cela lui sera accordé.
[11:24] C'est pourquoi je vous dis : Croyez que vous recevrez tout ce que vous demandez dans votre prière, et tout vous sera accordé.
[11:25] En outre, quand vous vous mettez à prier, pardonnez à toute personne contre qui vous pourriez avoir quelque chose, afin que votre Père qui est dans les cieux vous pardonne aussi vos offenses.»
[11:26] (Si vous ne pardonnez pas, votre Père qui est dans les cieux ne vous pardonnera pas non plus vos offenses).
[11:27] Ils étaient retournés à Jérusalem ; et comme il allait et venait dans le Temple, les chefs des prêtres, les Scribes et les Anciens s'approchèrent de lui
[11:28] et lui dirent : «En vertu de quelle autorité fais-tu ces choses ? ou qui t'a donné l'autorité de les faire ?»
[11:29] Jésus leur répondit : «Je vous ferai, moi aussi, une question, une seule. Répondez-moi et je vous dirai en vertu de quelle autorité je fais ces choses :
[11:30] Le baptême de Jean venait-il du ciel ou des hommes? Répondez-moi.»
[11:31] Or ils faisaient, à part eux, ce raisonnement : «Si nous répondons : Du ciel, il dira : Pourquoi donc ne l'avez vous pas cru?
[11:32] Répondrons-nous alors : Des hommes?....» Ici ils avaient à craindre la foule ; car tout le monde tenait Jean pour un prophète.
[11:33] Alors ils répondirent ainsi à Jésus : «Nous ne savons.» Jésus répliqua : «Je ne vous dis pas, moi non plus, en vertu de quelle autorité je fais ces choses.»
[12:1] Puis il se mit à leur parler en paraboles : «Un homme avait planté une vigne ; après l'avoir entourée d'une haie, y avoir creusé une cuve et construit une tour, il la loua à des vignerons et fit une absence.
[12:2] La saison venue, il envoya, un serviteur aux vignerons pour recueillir de leurs mains une partie du produit de sa vigne.
[12:3] Or ceux-ci s'emparèrent de lui, le battirent et le renvoyèrent les mains vides.
[12:4] Le maître alors leur envoya un autre serviteur. Celui-là, ils le blessèrent à la tête et le traitèrent avec mépris.
[12:5] Il en envoya un autre : celui-là ils le tuèrent ; plusieurs autres : ils battirent ceux-ci et tuèrent ceux-là.
[12:6] Il avait encore un fils unique, un bien-aimé. Il le leur envoya le dernier, disant : «Ils respecteront mon fils.»
[12:7] Mais ces vignerons se dirent de l'un à l'autre : «Celui-là c'est l'héritier ; allons! tuons-le et l'héritage sera à nous!»
[12:8] Et s'étant emparés de lui, ils le tuèrent et le jetèrent hors de la vigne.
[12:9] Que fera le maître de la vigne? Il viendra, il fera périr les vignerons et donnera la vigne à d'autres.
[12:10] N'avez-vous pas lu ce passage de l'Écriture : «La pierre qu'ont rejetée ceux qui bâtissaient, Celle-là même est devenue la tête de l'angle,
[12:11] C'est l'ouvrage du Seigneur, Ouvrage admirable à nos yeux!»
[12:12] Ils cherchaient à l'arrêter ; car ils comprenaient bien que c'était eux qu'il avait en vue dans cette parabole ; mais ils redoutèrent la multitude. Alors ils le laissèrent et partirent.
[12:13] Ensuite ils lui envoyèrent quelques Pharisiens et Hérodiens pour le prendre au piège par ses propres paroles.
[12:14] Ils arrivent et lui disent: «Maître, nous savons que tu es véridique ; que tu n'as souci de qui que ce soit ; sans regarder à la figure des uns et des autres, tu enseignes en toute vérité la voie de Dieu. Est-il permis, oui ou non, de payer l'impôt à César? Le payerons-nous ou ne le payerons-nous pas?»
[12:15] Connaissant leur perfidie, il leur dit : «Pourquoi me mettez-vous à l'épreuve?
[12:16] Apportez-moi un denier, que je le voie.» Ils lui en apportèrent un. «De qui est cette image? demanda-t-il ; de qui est cette inscription?» Ils lui répondirent : «De Césars.»
[12:17] Alors Jésus leur dit : «Rendez à César ce qui est à César et à Dieu ce qui est à Dieu.» Et il les surprit extrêmement.
[12:18] Ensuite des Sadducéens (ceux qui disent qu'il n'y a point de résurrection) vinrent lui poser une question :
[12:19] «Maître, dirent-ils, voici ce que Moïse nous a prescrit : «Si le frère de quelqu'un meurt laissant sa femme sans enfants, celui-ci devra épouser la veuve, pour susciter à son frère une postérité.»
[12:20] Or il y a eu sept frères. Le premier a pris femme et est mort sans laisser de postérité.
[12:21] Le second a épousé la veuve et est mort aussi sans avoir de postérité. De même du troisième ;
[12:22] des sept aucun n'a laissé de postérité ; enfin, après eux tous, la femme aussi est morte.
[12:23] Eh bien, à la résurrection, duquel d'entre eux sera-t-elle l'épouse? Les sept, en effet, l'ont eue pour femme.»
[12:24] Jésus leur répondit : «N'êtes-vous pas dans une erreur qui provient de ce que vous ignorez et les Écritures et la puissance de Dieu?
[12:25] En effet, ceux qui ressuscitent d'entre les morts ne se marient ni ne donnent en mariage, mais ils sont dans les cieux comme des anges.
[12:26] Et quant aux morts, quant à leur résurrection, n'avez-vous pas lu dans le livre de Moïse, au passage où il est question du buisson, en quels termes Dieu lui a parlé : «Je suis, dit-il, le Dieu d'Abraham, le Dieu d'Isaac, le Dieu de Jacob.
[12:27] Or ce n'est point des morts, c'est des vivants qu'il est Dieu. Vous êtes donc dans une grande erreur.»
[12:28] Un Scribe s'approcha ; il avait entendu leur discussion, et, remarquant qu'il leur avait parfaitement répondu, il lui demanda: «Quel est parmi les commandements le premier de tous?»
[12:29] Jésus, répondit: «Voici le premier : «Écoute, Israël, le Seigneur notre Dieu est l'Unique Seigneur,
[12:30] et tu aimeras le Seigneur ton Dieu, de tout ton coeur, de toute ton âme, de toute ta pensée, de toute ta force» ; voici le second :
[12:31] «Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même.» Aucun autre commandement n'est plus grand que ceux là.» —
[12:32] «Très bien, maître, lui dit le Scribe ; tu es dans la vérité lorsque tu dis qu'Il est Unique et qu'il n'y en a pas d'autre que Lui,
[12:33] et lorsque tu dis que l'aimer de tout son coeur, de toute son intelligence, de toute sa force, et qu'aimer son prochain comme soi-même l'emporte sur tous les holocaustes et tous les sacrifices.»
[12:34] Jésus, remarquant la sagesse de ses paroles, lui dit : «Tu n'es pas loin du Royaume de Dieu.» Personne n'osait plus le questionner.
[12:35] Alors Jésus, prenant la parole, enseigna dans le Temple en ces termes : «Comment les Scribes disent-ils que le Christ est fils de David?
[12:36] David lui-même a ainsi parlé par l'Esprit saint : «Le Seigneur a dit à mon Seigneur : Siège à ma droite Jusqu'à ce que j'aie mis tes ennemis sous tes pieds.»
[12:37] David lui-même l'appelle «Seigneur» ; d'ou vient alors qu'il est son fils ?» La foule, qui était nombreuse, prenait plaisir à l'écouter.
[12:38] Voici encore ce qu'il disait dans son enseignement : «Méfiez-vous de ces Scribes qui se complaisent à se promener en robes solennelles, à recevoir des salutations sur les places publiques,
[12:39] à occuper les premiers sièges dans les synagogues, les premières places dans les festins,
[12:40] qui dévorent les ressources des veuves, et qui affectent de prier longuement. C'est pour ces hommes-là que le jugement aura le plus de rigueur.»
[12:41] Il s'était assis vis-à-vis du tronc et il regardait comment chacun, dans la foule, y mettait son offrande. Nombre de riches donnaient beaucoup ;
[12:42] survint une veuve pauvre qui mit deux lèptes (ce qui fait un quadrant).
[12:43] Il appela ses disciples et leur dit : «En vérité je vous le dis : Cette veuve pauvre a mis dans le tronc plus que tous les autres.
[12:44] Car tous les autres ont puisé dans leur superflu pour donner ; mais celle-ci a pris sur son indigence ; elle a donné tout ce qu'elle possédait, tout ce qu'elle avait pour vivre.»
[13:1] Comme Jésus sortait du Temple, un de ses disciples lui dit: «Regarde, maître ; quelles pierres! quelles constructions !» —
[13:2] «Tu vois, lui dit Jésus, ces grands édifices : il n'en restera pas pierre sur pierre ; tout sera renversé.»
[13:3] Puis il alla s'asseoir sur le mont des Oliviers en face du Temple ; et là Pierre, Jacques, Jean et André l'interrogèrent en particulier :
[13:4] «Dis-nous quand ces choses arriveront, et quel sera le signe qu'elles vont toutes s'accomplir ?»
[13:5] Jésus alors se mit à leur dire : «Veillez à ce que personne ne vous séduise :
[13:6] plusieurs viendront en prenant mon nom, disant : C'est moi ! et ils séduiront bien des hommes.
[13:7] Quand vous entendrez parler de guerres et de bruits de guerres, ne vous alarmez point ; il faut que cela arrive ; mais ce ne sera pas encore la fin.»
[13:8] «Se soulèvera, en effet, nation contre nation, royaume contre royaume ; il y aura ici et là des tremblements de terre ; il y aura des famines.
[13:9] Ce seront les douleurs de l'enfantement qui commencent! Quant à vous, prenez garde à vous-mêmes! On vous livrera aux tribunaux ; dans les synagogues, vous serez frappés de verges, et à cause de moi vous comparaîtrez devant des procurateurs et des rois, pour leur être en témoignage.»
[13:10] «Il faut d'abord que l'Évangile soit prêché dans toutes les nations.»
[13:11] «Quand vous serez ainsi emmenés et livrés, ne vous préoccupez pas d'avance de ce que vous aurez à dire ; mais parlez suivant ce qui vous sera donné au moment même ; ce ne sera pas vous qui parlerez, ce sera l'Esprit saint.»
[13:12] «Un frère livrera son frère à la mort et un père son enfant ; des enfants se soulèveront contre leurs parents et les feront mourir ;
[13:13] et vous serez en haine à tout le monde à cause de mon nom. Mais celui qui aura persévéré jusqu'à la fin, celui-là sera sauvé.»
[13:14] «Quand vous verrez «l'abomination de la désolation» installée au lieu où elle ne doit pas être (comprends bien, lecteur!), que ceux qui seront dans la Judée fuient dans les montagnes,
[13:15] que celui qui sera sur le toit ne descende point, ne rentre point pour emporter quelque chose de sa maison ;
[13:16] que celui qui sera dans les champs ne retourne point sur ses pas pour prendre son manteau.
[13:17] Malheur aux femmes qui seront enceintes et à celles qui allaiteront en ces jours-là!»
[13:18] «Priez pour que tout cela n'arrive pas en hiver.
[13:19] Car ce seront des jours d'une tribulation telle qu'il n'y en a pas eu de pareille depuis la création, depuis que Dieu commença à créer jusqu'à présent, et qu'il n'y en aura plus jamais.
[13:20] Et si le Seigneur n'avait pas abrégé ces jours, nulle vie ne serait sauvée ; mais à cause des élus, de ceux qu'il a choisis, il a abrégé ces jours.»
[13:21] «Si l'on vous dit alors : «Voyez! le Christ est ici !» ou : «Voyez! il est là!» ne le croyez pas.
[13:22] Il surgira de faux Christs et de faux prophètes opérant signes et prodiges afin, si possible, de séduire les élus.»
[13:23] «Vous, soyez sur vos gardes : je vous ai tout prédit.»
[13:24] «Cependant, ces jours-là, après cette tribulation, le soleil s'obscurcira, la lune ne donnera plus sa lumière,
[13:25] les étoiles tomberont du ciel ; les puissances qui sont dans les cieux seront ébranlées.
[13:26] Et c'est alors qu'on verra le Fils de l'homme arrivant, au sein des nuées, en grande puissance et gloire ;
[13:27] c'est alors qu'il enverra les anges et rassemblera les élus des quatre vents de l'horizon, depuis l'extrémité de la terre jusqu'à l'extrémité du ciel.»
[13:28] «Que le figuier vous serve de comparaison : Quand ses branches deviennent tendres et que ses feuilles poussent, vous savez que l'été est proche ;
[13:29] de même quand vous verrez arriver ces choses, sachez qu'il est proche, qu'il est aux portes.»
[13:30] «En vérité je vous le dis, cette génération ne passera pas que tout cela n'arrive.
[13:31] Le ciel et la terre passeront, mais mes paroles ne passeront point.»
[13:32] «De ce jour ou de l'heure, nul ne sait rien ; ni les anges dans le ciel, ni le Fils ; personne, excepté le Père.»
[13:33] «Soyez sur vos gardes ; soyez vigilants ; puisque vous ne savez pas quand viendra le moment.
[13:34] Lorsqu'un homme part pour un voyage, qu'il laisse sa maison, qu'il donne pouvoir à ses serviteurs, à chacun son travail, il recommande au portier de veiller.
[13:35] Veillez donc — (puisque vous ne savez pas quand viendra le maître de la maison, si ce sera le soir, ou au milieu de la nuit, ou au chant du coq, ou le matin) —
[13:36] de peur qu'arrivant à l'improviste il ne vous trouve endormis.
[13:37] Or, ce que je vous dis à vous, je le dis à tous: Veillez!»
[14:1] Deux jours après, c'étaient la Pâque et les Azymes. Les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes cherchaient un moyen de s'emparer de Jésus par ruse et de le tuer ;
[14:2] ils disaient cependant : «Rien pendant la fête, le peuple pourrait se soulever.»
[14:3] Jésus était à Béthanie dans la maison de Simon le lépreux. Comme il était à table, il vint une femme portant un vase d'albâtre rempli d'un très précieux parfum (de l'huile de nard pur) ; et, brisant le vase d'albâtre, elle en répandit le contenu sur la tête de Jésus.
[14:4] Or il s'en trouva quelques-uns qui en furent, à part eux, indignés : «A quoi bon perdre ainsi ce parfum?» —
[14:5] On aurait pu vendre ce parfum-là plus de trois cents denier set en donner le prix aux pauvres.» Ils étaient exaspérés contre cette femme.
[14:6] Mais Jésus dit: «Laissez-la ; pourquoi lui faites-vous de la peine? C'est une bonne oeuvre qu'elle a faite pour moi.
[14:7] Car les pauvres vous les avez toujours avec vous ; et quand vous le voulez, vous pouvez leur faire du bien ; tandis que moi vous ne m'avez pas pour toujours.
[14:8] Elle a fait ce qu'elle a pu. A l'avance, elle a parfumé mon corps pour la sépulture.
[14:9] En vérité, je vous le dis, partout où sera prêché l'Évangile — dans le monde entier — on racontera aussi, en mémoire d'elle, ce qu'elle a fait.»
[14:10] Cependant Judas l'Iskariôte, un des douze, alla trouver les chefs des prêtres pour le leur livrer.
[14:11] Ses paroles les mirent dans la joie, et ils lui promirent de lui donner de l'argent. Il chercha alors une occasion pour le livrer.
[14:12] Le premier jour des Azymes, le jour où l'on sacrifie la Pâque, les disciples dirent à Jésus : «Où veux-tu que nous allions te préparer ce qui est nécessaire pour le repas pascal?» —
[14:13] «Allez à la ville» leur répondit-il en y envoyant deux d'entre eux ; «vous rencontrerez un homme portant une cruche d'eau ; vous le suivrez
[14:14] et voici comment vous parlerez au propriétaire de la maison où il entrera : Le maître dit : «Où est la chambre qui m'est destinée et où je mangerai la Pâque avec mes disciples.»
[14:15] Lui-même alors vous montrera une chambre haute, grande, garnie de tapis, toute prête. C'est là que vous ferez pour nous les préparatifs.»
[14:16] Les disciples partirent, allèrent à la ville, trouvèrent toutes choses comme il les leur avait dites, et préparèrent la Pâque.
[14:17] Le soir venu, il s'y rendit avec les douze.
[14:18] Pendant qu'ils étaient à table et qu'ils mangeaient, Jésus dit : «En vérité je vous le dis, l'un de vous — qui mange avec moi me livrera.»
[14:19] Ils devinrent tout tristes et lui demandèrent l'un après l'autre : «Est-ce moi?»
[14:20] Il leur répondit : «C'est l'un des douze, c'est celui qui met la main au plat avec moi.
[14:21] Car le Fils de l'homme s'en va, selon qu'il est écrit de lui, mais malheur à cet homme par qui le Fils de l'homme est livré! Mieux vaudrait pour cet homme-là ne jamais être né!»
[14:22] Pendant qu'ils mangeaient, il prit du pain et, ayant prononcé la bénédiction, il le rompit et le leur donna en disant : «Prenez! ceci est mon corps.»
[14:23] Prenant ensuite une coupe, il rendit grâces, la leur donna et ils en burent tous.
[14:24] «Ceci est mon sang, leur dit-il, le sang de l'alliance, lequel est répandu pour plusieurs.
[14:25] En vérité, je vous le dis, je ne boirai plus jamais du fruit de la vigne jusqu'en ce jour où je le boirai nouveau dans le Royaume de Dieu.»
[14:26] Après le chant des Psaumes, ils partirent pour le Mont des Oliviers,
[14:27] et Jésus leur dit: «Tous, vous rencontrerez une occasion de tomber, car il est écrit : «Je frapperai le berger et les brebis seront dispersées ;»
[14:28] «Mais après ma résurrection je vous précéderai en Galilée.»
[14:29] Pierre lui dit : «Quand même tous viendraient à faillir, moi, jamais !»
[14:30] Jésus lui répondit : «En vérité je te dis que toi-même, aujourd’hui, durant cette nuit, avant qu'un coq chante deux fois, tu me renieras trois fois.»
[14:31] Pierre cependant insistait toujours plus : «Me fallût-il mourir avec toi, non, je ne te renierai pas!» Et tous parlèrent de même.
[14:32] Ils vinrent en un lieu du nom de Gethsémané, et Jésus dit à ses disciples : «Asseyez-vous ici pendant que je prierai.»
[14:33] Puis il prit avec lui Pierre, Jacques et Jean, et il commença à être dans l'abattement et dans l'angoisse ;
[14:34] et il leur dit : «Mon âme est accablée de tristesse jusqu'à la mort. Restez ici et veillez!»
[14:35] Puis, s'étant un peu avancé, il se prosternait la face contre terre, priant pour que cette heure, si cela était possible, passât loin de lui.
[14:36] Il disait : «Abba ! Père! tout t'est possible à toi ! Écarte loin de moi cette coupe ; cependant, non pas ce que je veux, mais ce que tu veux.»
[14:37] Il revint et il les trouva qui dormaient, et il dit à Pierre :«Tu dors, Simon! n'as-tu pas eu la force de veiller une seule heure?
[14:38] Veillez et priez pour ne pas succomber à l'épreuve!. Certes l'esprit est prompt, mais la chair est faible.
[14:39] Il s'éloigna de nouveau et pria, répétant les mêmes paroles ;
[14:40] puis il revint encore et les trouva qui s'étaient endormis ; leurs yeux en effet étaient appesantis, et ils ne savaient que lui répondre.
[14:41] La troisième fois qu'il revint, il leur dit: «Dormez maintenant ; reposez-vous ; c'est assez, l'heure est venue! Le Fils de l'homme va être livré entre les mains des pécheurs!
[14:42] Levez-vous ! Allons! Voici celui qui me livre! Il approche!»
[14:43] Au même instant, pendant qu'il parlait encore, arrive Judas, l'un des douze, et avec lui, envoyée par les chefs des prêtres, les Scribes et les Anciens, une troupe armée d'épées et de bâtons.
[14:44] Le traître était convenu avec eux d'un signal. Il leur avait dit : «Celui auquel je donnerai un baiser, ce sera lui. Vous vous en saisirez et l'emmènerez sûrement.
[14:45] Donc, en arrivant, il s'approcha de Jésus et l'appelant : «Rabbi», il l'embrassa avec effusion.
[14:46] Eux alors mirent la main sur lui et le saisirent.
[14:47] Mais un de ceux qui étaient présents, tirant l'épée, frappa le serviteur du Grand-Prêtre et lui coupa l'oreille:
[14:48] Jésus alors prononça ces paroles : «Pour vous emparer de moi, vous êtes venus, comme contre un brigand, avec des épées et des bâtons.
[14:49] Tous les jours, j'étais au milieu de vous, dans le Temple, j'enseignais et vous ne m'avez pas arrêté. Mais il en est ainsi pour que soient accomplies les Écritures.»
[14:50] L'abandonnant alors, tous les disciples prirent la fuite.
[14:51] Seul, un jeune homme le suivait ; il n'avait sur le corps qu'un léger vêtement. On saisit ce jeune homme,
[14:52] mais il s'échappa tout nu, abandonnant son vêtement.
[14:53] On conduisit Jésus chez le Grand-Prêtre, où tous s'assemblèrent en même temps, les chefs des prêtres, les Anciens, les Scribes.
[14:54] Pierre, qui le suivait de loin, parvint jusque dans l'intérieur de la coure du Grand-Prêtre. Là, il s'assit auprès du feu, mêlé aux gens de service et se chauffant.
[14:55] Les chefs des prêtres et le Sanhédrin tout entier cherchaient contre Jésus un témoignage qui le fît condamner à mort, mais ils n'en trouvaient pas.
[14:56] Plusieurs, en effet, déposaient mensongèrement contre lui ; mais leurs assertions étaient contradictoires.
[14:57] En surgit enfin quelques-uns qui portèrent à sa charge ce faux témoignage :
[14:58] Nous lui avons entendu dire ceci : «Je puis, moi, renverser ce Temple fait de main d'homme, et, en trois jours, j'en bâtirai un autre qui ne sera pas de main d'homme.»
[14:59] Mais ici même leurs dépositions ne concordaient pas.
[14:60] Alors le Grand-Prêtre se leva au milieu de l'assemblée et posa cette question à Jésus : «Ne réponds-tu rien à ce que ces gens-ci déposent contre toi?»
[14:61] Jésus gardait le silence ; il ne répondit rien. Le Grand-Prêtre lui posa une seconde question ainsi conçue : «Es-tu le Christ, le Fils de Celui qui est béni?»
[14:62] Jésus répondit :«Je le suis ; et vous verrez le Fils de l'homme siégeant à la droite de la Puissance et venant avec les nuées du ciel.»
[14:63] Alors le Grand-Prêtre, déchirant ses vêtements : «Qu'avons-nous encore besoin de témoins? dit-il ; vous avez entendu le blasphème!
[14:64] Quel est votre avis?» Tous le déclarèrent coupable et le condamnèrent à mort.
[14:65] Alors ils se mirent, quelques-uns, à cracher sur lui, à lui couvrir le visage d'un voile et à lui donner des coups de poing. «Fais le prophète!» lui disaient-ils. Quant aux gens de service, ils le reçurent à coups de bâton.
[14:66] Pierre était en bas, dans la cour ; survint l'une des servantes du Grand-Prêtre.
[14:67] Voyant Pierre qui se chauffait, elle lui dit en le regardant : «Toi aussi tu étais avec Jésus de Nazareth.»
[14:68] Et lui de le nier : «Je ne sais pas, dit-il, et ne comprends pas de quoi tu parles.» Il s'en alla et sortit dans le vestibule.
[14:69] Mais la servante l'aperçut : «Celui-là en est», répéta-t-elle à ceux qui étaient présents.
[14:70] De nouveau Pierre nia. Un moment après, ceux qui se trouvaient là recommencèrent à parler à Pierre : «Certainement tu en es ; car tu es aussi Galiléen.»
[14:71] Il se livra alors à des imprécations : «Je ne connais pas, je le jure, cet homme dont vous parlez.»
[14:72] Soudain un coq chanta pour la seconde fois. Et se souvenant de la parole que lui avait dite Jésus : «Avant qu'un coq chante deux fois, tu me renieras trois fois», Pierre se mit à pleurer.
[15:1] Dès le matin, les chefs des prêtres, auxquels s'étaient joints les Anciens et les Scribes, le Sanhédrin tout entier, qui avaient tenu conseil, chargèrent Jésus de liens, l'emmenèrent et le livrèrent à Pilate,
[15:2] qui l'interrogea : C'est toi qui es le Roi des Juifs?» Jésus répondit ainsi : «Tu le dis.»
[15:3] Les chefs des prêtres cependant formulaient contre lui des accusations en quantité.
[15:4] Pilate l'interrogea une seconde fois : «Tu ne réponds rien ! Vois tout ce dont on t'accuse!»
[15:5] Mais Jésus ne répondit plus rien, ce dont Pilate, fut très surpris.
[15:6] A chaque fête, il remettait en liberté un prisonnier, celui qu'on lui demandait.
[15:7] Or il y en avait un nommé Bar-Abbas, emprisonné avec les séditieux qui, dans une émeute, avaient commis un meurtre.
[15:8] La foule, étant donc montée au tribunal, se mit à demander ce qu'on lui accordait toujours.
[15:9] Pilate alors, qui comprit que c'était par une haine jalouse que les chefs des prêtres lui avaient livré Jésus,
[15:10] fit à la foule cette proposition : «Voulez-vous que je vous délivre «le Roi des Juifs» ?
[15:11] Mais les chefs des prêtres poussèrent la foule à demander de préférence la mise en liberté de Bar-Abbas.
[15:12] Pilate se fit entendre de nouveau : «Que ferai-je donc de celui que vous appelez «le Roi des Juifs»?
[15:13] Ils crièrent encore: «Crucifie-le!» —
[15:14] «Qu'a-t-il donc fait de mal?» reprit Pilate. Mais ils n'en criaient que plus fort : «Crucifie-le !»
[15:15] Pilate alors, voulant contenter la multitude, lui délivra Bar-Abbas, et, après avoir fait flageller Jésus, il l'abandonna au supplice de la croix.
[15:16] Les soldats emmenèrent Jésus à l'intérieur de la cour, c'est-à-dire dans le prétoire, où ils réunirent toute la cohorte.
[15:17] Ils l'habillèrent d'un manteau couleur de pourpre et lui mirent une couronne d'épines qu'ils avaient tressée.
[15:18] Puis ils lui rendirent leurs hommages : «Salut! Roi des Juifs!»
[15:19] Avec un roseau ils lui donnaient des coups sur la tète ; ils crachaient sur lui, et, se mettant à genoux, ils se prosternaient devant lui.
[15:20] Quand ils eurent fini de se moquer de lui, ils lui ôtèrent le manteau de pourpre et lui remirent ses vêtements. Ils l'emmenèrent pour le crucifier
[15:21] et ils obligèrent un passant, un certain Simon de Cyrène, le père d'Alexandre et de Rufus, qui revenait des champs, à porter sa croix.
[15:22] Ils le conduisirent ainsi à Golgotha, c'est un endroit dont le nom signifie : Le Crâne.
[15:23] Là ils lui donnèrent du vin mêlé de myrrhe ; mais il n'en prit pas.
[15:24] Ils le crucifièrent, puis se partagèrent ses vêtements, en tirant au sort la part de chacun.
[15:25] C'est à la troisième heure qu'ils le crucifièrent,
[15:26] et l'inscription indiquant son crime était ainsi conçue : LE ROI DES JUIFS.
[15:27] Avec lui deux brigands furent crucifiés, l'un à sa droite, l'autre à sa gauche.
[15:28] (ainsi s'accomplit la parole de l'Ecriture: il a été compté parmi les impies.)
[15:29] Les passants l'injuriaient ; ils lui disaient, en gesticulant de la tète : «Ohé! toi qui détruis le Temple et le rebâtis en trois jours,
[15:30] sauve-toi toi-même en descendant de la croix !»
[15:31] Les chefs des prêtres avec les Scribes se moquaient aussi de lui et se disaient l'un à l'autre : «Il en a sauvé d'autres et il ne peut pas se sauver lui-même!» —
[15:32] «Que «le Christ», que «le Roi d'Israël» descende maintenant de la croix, afin que nous voyions et que nous croyions!» Ceux mêmes que l'on avait crucifiés avec lui l'insultaient.
[15:33] Quand fut venue la sixième heure, des ténèbres se firent sur tout le pays jusqu'à la neuvième heure.
[15:34] A la neuvième heure, Jésus jeta un cri et dit d'une voix forte : «Héloï ! lema sabachthanei !» ce qui signifie : «Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné?»
[15:35] Quelques-uns des assistants l'entendant : «Le voilà qui appelle Élie», dirent-ils.
[15:36] Il y en eut un qui courut tremper une éponge dans du vinaigre et, l'attachant à un roseau, il lui donna à boire, en disant : «Laissez et voyons si Élie va venir le descendre !»
[15:37] Jésus cependant, ayant jeté un grand cri, expira.
[15:38] Et le rideau du Temple se déchira en deux depuis le haut jusqu'en bas.
[15:39] Voyant comment il avait expiré, le centurion, qui se tenait en face de lui, dit : «Cet homme-là était véritablement Fils de Dieu.»
[15:40] Il y avait là également des femmes qui regardaient de loin. Parmi elles, Marie Magdeleine, Marie, mère de Jacques le Petit et de Josès, et Salomé,
[15:41] qui le suivaient et le servaient lorsqu'il était en Galilée ; plusieurs autres encore qui étaient montées avec lui à Jérusalem.
[15:42] Déjà il se faisait tard, et comme c'était un jour de «Préparation», c'est-à-dire une veille de sabbat,
[15:43] Joseph, celui qui est d'Arimathée, membre estimé du Grand-Conseil, et qui lui aussi attendait le Royaume de Dieu, alla hardiment se présenter à Pilate et lui demanda le corps de Jésus.
[15:44] Surpris qu'il fût mort sitôt, Pilate fit appeler le centurion et lui demanda s'il était mort depuis longtemps.
[15:45] Informé par le centurion, il donna le corps à Joseph.
[15:46] Celui-ci, ayant acheté un linceul, descendit le corps de la croix, l'enveloppa du linceul et le déposa dans un sépulcre taillé dans le roc, puis il roula une pierre contre la porte du tombeau.
[15:47] Or, Marie Magdeleine et Marie, mère de Josès, regardaient où on le mettait.
[16:1] Quand le sabbat fut passé, Marie Magdeleine, Marie, mère de, Jacques, et Salomé achetèrent des aromates pour aller embaumer le corps de Jésus.
[16:2] De très grand matin, le premier jour de la semaine, elles se rendent au sépulcre ; le soleil se levait.
[16:3] «Qui donc, se demandaient-elles, nous roulera la pierre et l'ôtera de l'entrée de la tombe ?»
[16:4] Elles regardent et s'aperçoivent que cette pierre, qui était énorme, a été enlevée.
[16:5] Alors elles entrèrent dans le tombeau et virent, assis à droite, un jeune homme revêtu d'une robe blanche. Elles furent saisies de terreur.
[16:6] «Ne vous effrayez pas, leur dit-il ; vous cherchez Jésus de Nazareth, le crucifié ; il est ressuscité ; il n'est pas ici. Voyez la place où on l'avait déposé.
[16:7] Et maintenant allez dire à ses disciples et à Pierre qu’il vous précède en Galilée ; là vous le verrez, comme il vous l'a dit.»
[16:8] A leur sortie du tombeau, elles prirent la fuite. Elles étaient toutes tremblantes et hors d'elles, et ne dirent rien à personne Car elles avaient peur...
[16:9] (Ressuscité de grand matin le premier jour de la semaine, il apparut tout d'abord à Marie-Magdeleine, de laquelle il avait chassé sept démons.
[16:10] Celle-ci alla annoncer à ceux qui avaient été avec lui et qui étaient dans le deuil et dans les larmes.
[16:11] Eux, l'entendant dire qu'il vivait et qu'elle l'avait vu, ne la crurent pas.
[16:12] Ensuite il apparut sous une autre forme à deux d'entre eux qui étaient en chemin et se rendaient à la campagne.
[16:13] Ils vinrent également annoncer aux autres ; mais ils ne les crurent pas non plus.
[16:14] Enfin il apparut aux onze pendant qu'ils étaient à table ; il leur reprocha leur incrédulité et la dureté de leur coeur, parce qu'ils n'avaient pas cru ceux qui l'avaient vu ressuscité.
[16:15] Et il leur dit: «Allez dans tout le monde, prêchez l'Évangile à toute créature.
[16:16] Qui croira et recevra le baptême sera sauvé ; qui ne croira pas sera condamné.
[16:17] Et voici les miracles qui accompagneront ceux qui auront cru: en mon nom ils chasseront des démons ; ils auront le don des langues ;
[16:18] ils manieront des serpents, et les poisons qu'ils pourront boire ne leur feront point de mal. Ils imposeront les mains à des malades et ils les guériront.»
[16:19] Le Seigneur, après avoir ainsi parlé, fut enlevé au ciel et s'assit à la droite de Dieu.
[16:20] Quant à eux, ils partirent et prêchèrent partout, le Seigneur agissant avec eux et confirmant la parole par les miracles qui l'accompagnaient.) 

### Luke

[1:1] Cher Théophile, puisque plusieurs autres ont essayé de rédiger un récit des faits accomplis parmi nous,
[1:2] tels que nous les ont transmis ceux qui en ont été, dès l’origine, témoins oculaires et qui sont devenus ministres de la Parole,
[1:3] j’ai cru devoir, moi aussi, après m’être soigneusement informé de tout, depuis le commencement, t’en écrire une narration suivie,
[1:4] pour que tu reconnaisses la solidité des enseignements que tu as reçus.
[1:5] Aux jours d'Hérode, roi de Judée, vivait un prêtre nommé Zaccharie. Il était de la classe d'Abia et sa femme était d'entre les filles d'Aaron. Son nom était Élisabeth.
[1:6] Tous deux étaient justes devant Dieu, marchant irréprochables dans tous les commandements et toutes les ordonnances du Seigneur.
[1:7] Ils n'avaient point d'enfants ; parce qu'Élisabeth était stérile ; et tous deux étaient avancés en âge.
[1:8] Or, le tour de sa classe étant venu de remplir devant Dieu les fonctions sacerdotales,
[1:9] il lui échut par le sort (qui était le mode usité entre les prêtres) d'entrer dans le sanctuaire du Seigneur pour y offrir l'encens.
[1:10] Pendant cette heure de l'encens, la foule du peuple restait au dehors et priait.
[1:11] Or, à la droite de l'autel de l'encens, apparut à Zaccharie un ange du Seigneur, debout devant lui.
[1:12] A sa vue Zaccharie fut troublé, et la crainte le saisit.
[1:13] «Ne crains point, Zaccharie, lui dit l'ange ; car ta prière a été exaucée et ta femme Élisabeth t'enfantera un fils ; tu lui donneras le nom de Jean.
[1:14] Il sera ta joie et ton allégresse, et beaucoup se réjouiront de sa naissance. Devant le Seigneur,
[1:15] en effet, il sera grand ; il ne devra jamais boire ni vin, ni cervoise ; et, tout rempli de l'Esprit saint dès les entrailles de sa mère,
[1:16] il ramènera au Seigneur leur Dieu, de nombreux enfants d'Israël.
[1:17] Lui-même, dans l'esprit et la vertu d'Élie, se mettra en marche devant le Seigneur, afin de faire revivre dans les enfants le coeur même des aïeux, de ramener les rebelles à la sagesse des justes, et de préparer au Seigneur un peuple bien disposé.» —
[1:18] «A quoi reconnaîtrai-je cela, dit à l'ange Zaccharie, car je suis moi-même un vieillard, et ma femme est avancée en âge.»
[1:19] L'ange lui répondit par ces paroles : «Je suis, Gabriel qui me tiens devant Dieu. Et j'ai été envoyé pour te parler et t'annoncer cette Bonne Nouvelle.
[1:20] Et à cause de ton manque de foi en mes paroles, qui s'accompliront en leur temps, voilà que tu seras muet et ne pourras parler jusqu'au jour où ces choses arriveront.»
[1:21] Le peuple cependant attendait Zaccharie, et s'étonnait de le voir s'attarder dans le sanctuaire.
[1:22] Lorsqu'il sortit, il lui fut impossible de leur parler ; on comprit qu'il avait eu une vision dans le sanctuaire. Lui-même le leur faisait entendre par signes. Zaccharie resta sourd-muet.
[1:23] Quand la période de ses fonctions fut terminée, il retourna en sa maison ;
[1:24] ce fut alors que sa femme Élisabeth devint enceinte. Pendant cinq mois elle vécut dans le secret de sa demeure.
[1:25] «Voilà, disait-elle, ce qu'a fait pour moi le Seigneur en ces jours où il m'a regardée pour mettre fin à mon opprobre parmi les hommes.»
[1:26] Le sixième mois, Dieu envoya l'ange Gabriel dans une ville de Galilée, appelée Nazareth,
[1:27] vers une vierge, fiancée à un homme de la famille de David, nommé Joseph. Le nom de la vierge était Marie.
[1:28] L'ange, étant entré où elle était, lui dit: «Salut! une grâce, t'a été faite ; le Seigneur est avec toi!»
[1:29] A ces paroles, Marie fut toute troublée ; et elle se demandait ce que pouvait être une semblable salutation.
[1:30] «Ne crains point, Marie, reprit l'ange, car tu as trouvé grâce près de Dieu.
[1:31] Sache que tu vas concevoir en ton sein et enfanter un fils auquel tu donneras le nom de Jésus.
[1:32] Il sera grand ; on l'appellera : Fils du Très-Haut ; à lui le Seigneur Dieu donnera le trône de David son père ;
[1:33] il régnera à jamais sur la maison de Jacob et son règne n'aura point de fin.»
[1:34] Alors Marie dit à l'ange : «Comment cela se fera-t-il, puisque je ne connais point, d’homme?»
[1:35] Et l'ange lui répondit par ces paroles : «L'Esprit saint viendra sur toi, et une puissance du Très-Haut t'enveloppera de son ombre. C'est pourquoi l'Être saint qui doit naître sera appelé Fils de Dieu !
[1:36] Sache également qu'en sa vieillesse, ta parente Élisabeth, elle aussi, a conçu un fils, et que celle que l'on appelait stérile en est déjà à son sixième mois.
[1:37] Rien n'est impossible à Dieu.»
[1:38] Alors Marie dit : «Voici la servante du Seigneur. Qu'il me soit fait suivant ta parole.» Et l'ange la quitta.
[1:39] En ces jours-là, Marie se hâta de partir, se dirigeant vers le pays des montagnes. Elle alla dans une ville de Juda.
[1:40] En entrant dans la maison de Zaccharie elle salua Élisabeth.
[1:41] Et dès qu'Élisabeth eut entendu la salutation de Marie, l'enfant qu'elle portait tressaillit, et elle-même fut remplie d'Esprit saint.
[1:42] «Tu es bénie entre les femmes, s'écria-t-elle en élevant la voix, et le fruit de tes entrailles est béni!
[1:43] D'où me vient que la mère de mon Seigneur vienne me visiter?
[1:44] Aussitôt que ta voix, quand tu m'as saluée, a frappé mon oreille, l'enfant a tressailli de joie dans mon sein.
[1:45] Bienheureuse celle qui a cru à l'accomplissement de ce qui lui a été dit de la part du Seigneur!»
[1:46] Et Marie dit : «Mon âme magnifie le Seigneur,
[1:47] Et mon esprit est transporté de joie en Dieu mon Sauveur,
[1:48] Parce qu'il a abaissé son regard sur l'humilité de sa servante. Voilà que désormais toutes les générations m'appelleront la bienheureuse,
[1:49] Parce que le Tout-Puissant m'a fait de grandes choses! Son nom est saint,
[1:50] Sa miséricorde se répand de génération en génération Sur ceux qui le craignent.
[1:51] Il a déployé la force de son bras, Il a dissipé les pensées des coeurs des superbes,
[1:52] Il a jeté bas de leurs trônes les puissants, Et il a exalté les humbles ;
[1:53] Il a comblé de biens les affamés, Et il a renvoyé les riches à vide ;
[1:54] Il a secouru Israël son serviteur, Il s'est souvenu de sa miséricorde,
[1:55] Ainsi qu'il l'avait dit à nos pères, à Abraham et à sa postérité pour toujours.»
[1:56] Marie séjourna environ trois mois avec Élisabeth, et retourna ensuite en sa maison.
[1:57] Parvenue au terme de sa grossesse, Élisabeth enfanta un fils.
[1:58] Ayant appris que le Seigneur faisait ainsi éclater par elle sa miséricorde, ses voisins et ses parents partagèrent sa joie.
[1:59] Le huitième jour, ils vinrent pour la circoncision de l'enfant. Ils lui donnaient le nom de Zaccharie, celui de son père,
[1:60] quand sa mère prit la parole : «Non, dit-elle, il se nommera Jean.» —
[1:61] «Mais, lui dirent les autres, personne dans ta famille ne porte ce nom.»
[1:62] Et l'on demanda au père, par signes, comment il voulait le nommer.
[1:63] Alors, se faisant apporter des tablettes, Zaccharie écrivit ceci : «Jean est son nom.» Tout le monde fut surpris.
[1:64] Aussitôt la banche de Zaccharie s'ouvrit, sa langue se délia et il se mit à parler et à bénir Dieu.
[1:65] Chacun dans le voisinage fut saisi de crainte et, dans la région des montagnes de Judée, il ne fut bruit que de toutes ces choses.
[1:66] Chacun en les apprenant les recueillait dans son coeur et disait : «Que sera donc cet enfant?» En effet, la main du Seigneur était avec lui.
[1:67] Quant à Zaccharie, son père, il fut rempli d'Esprit saint et il prophétisa en ces termes :
[1:68] «Béni soit le Seigneur, le Dieu d'Israël! Car il a visité son peuple et opéré sa rédemption ;
[1:69] Il nous a suscité un Sauveur puissant, De la maison de David, son serviteur.
[1:70] (Ainsi qu'il l'avait annoncé par la bouche de ses saints prophètes qui jadis ont vécu.)
[1:71] Il nous délivre de nos ennemis, Et de la main de tous ceux qui nous haïssent ;
[1:72] Il montre sa miséricorde envers nos pères ; Il se souvient de sa sainte alliance ;
[1:73] Du serment par lui juré à notre père Abraham ; Il nous donne enfin à nous,
[1:74] délivrés de la main de nos ennemis, De le servir sans crainte, [de notre vie ;
[1:75] De marcher devant lui dans la sainteté et la justice tous les jours
[1:76] Et toi, enfant, tu seras appelé Prophète du Très-Haut ; Car tu iras devant le Seigneur ; Tu marcheras devant lui pour lui préparer les voies ;
[1:77] Tu donneras à son peuple la science du salut, Tu lui diras que ses péchés lui sont remis ;
[1:78] Que notre Dieu a des entrailles de miséricorde, Qu'il nous a regardés du haut des cieux, Que le soleil d'Orient se lève ;
[1:79] Qu'il illuminera ceux qui sont assis dans les ténèbres et l'ombre de la mort ; Qu'il dirigera nos pas dans un chemin de paix.»
[1:80] L'enfant grandissait et son esprit se fortifiait, et jusqu'au jour de sa manifestation à Israël, les déserts furent sa demeure.
[2:1] Vers cette époque, parut un édit de César-Auguste ordonnant le recensement de tous les habitants de la terre.
[2:2] Ce recensement fut le premier, et Cyrénius était alors légat impérial en Syrie.
[2:3] Tout le monde allait se faire enregistrer ; et chacun en son lieu d'origine.
[2:4] Joseph (qui était de la maison et de la famille de David) partit, lui aussi, de Nazareth, ville de la Galilée, pour monter au pays de Judée et se rendre à la cité de David, appelée Bethléem,
[2:5] afin d'y être inscrit avec Marie, sa fiancée, qui était enceinte.
[2:6] Or il advint, pendant qu'ils étaient en cet endroit, que le moment d'enfanter arriva ;
[2:7] et elle mit au monde son fils premier-né. Elle l'emmaillota et le coucha dans une crèche, parce qu'il n'y avait pas pour eux de place à l'hôtellerie.
[2:8] Il y avait, en ce même lieu, des bergers qui vivaient dans les champs et gardaient leurs troupeaux durant les veilles de la nuit.
[2:9] Un ange du Seigneur leur apparut, et une gloire du Seigneur resplendit autour d'eux ; et ils furent saisis d'une grande crainte.
[2:10] L'ange leur dit : «Ne vous effrayez point, car je vous apporte la Bonne Nouvelle d'une grande joie, qui sera pour tout le peuple :
[2:11] Aujourd'hui, en la cité de David, vous est né un Sauveur ; c'est le Christ, le Seigneur.
[2:12] Et, pour vous, voici quel sera le signe : vous trouverez un petit enfant emmailloté et couché dans une crèche.»
[2:13] Soudain s'unirent à l'ange des multitudes appartenant à l'armée du ciel. Et tous louaient Dieu et disaient :
[2:14] «Gloire à Dieu au plus haut des cieux Et paix sur la terre aux hommes de bonne volonté»
[2:15] Quand les anges s'éloignèrent, remontant au ciel, les bergers se dirent l'un à l'autre : «Allons jusqu'à Bethléem, voyons ce qui, est arrivé, ce que le Seigneur nous a fait connaître.»
[2:16] Étant partis en toute hâte, ils trouvèrent Marie, Joseph et le petit enfant couché dans la crèche.
[2:17] Quand ils l'eurent vu, ils firent connaître ce qui leur avait été dit de cet enfant.
[2:18] Chacun, en écoutant les bergers, était émerveillé de ce qu'ils racontaient.
[2:19] Quant à Marie, elle conservait toutes ces paroles et les repassait en son coeur.
[2:20] Les bergers s'en retournèrent, glorifiant et louant Dieu de ce qu'ils avaient entendu et vu, toutes choses en parfait accord avec ce qui leur avait été dit.
[2:21] Lorsque huit jours après, l'enfant fut circoncis, on lui donna le nom de Jésus, celui que l'ange lui avait donné avant qu'il eût été conçu dans le sein maternel.
[2:22] Quand furent achevés les jours que la Loi de Moïse consacre à la purification, on porta l'enfant à Jérusalem pour le présenter au Seigneur
[2:23] (en exécution de ce qui est écrit dans sa Loi : «Tout enfant mâle premier-né sera dit consacré au Seigneur»
[2:24] et pour offrir en sacrifice (selon la prescription de la Loi du Seigneur) «soit une couple de tourterelles, soit deux jeunes colombes.»
[2:25] Or, à Jérusalem, il y avait alors un homme qui se nommait Siméon. Cet homme était juste et pieux, il attendait la consolation d'Israël, et sur lui reposait l'Esprit saint ;
[2:26] et cet Esprit saint lui avait révélé qu'il ne verrait point la mort avant qu'il eût vu l'Oint du Seigneur.
[2:27] Poussé par l'Esprit, il vint au Temple, et comme les parents de l'enfant Jésus l'y apportaient afin de se conformer, en ce qui le concernait, à l'usage légal,
[2:28] ce fut lui qui le reçut dans ses bras, et il bénit Dieu et dit :
[2:29] «Maintenant, ô mon Maître, tu laisses ton serviteur s'en aller, En paix, suivant ta parole ;
[2:30] Car mes yeux ont vu ton salut ;
[2:31] Salut que tu as préparé à la face de tous les peuples,
[2:32] Lumière qui se révélera aux nations Et gloire de ton peuple d'Israël !
[2:33] Le père et la mère de l'enfant s'émerveillaient de ce que l'on disait de lui.
[2:34] Siméon les bénit aussi et dit à Marie, sa mère : «Sache que cet enfant est au monde pour être la chute et le relèvement de plusieurs en Israël et pour être un signal de contradiction,
[2:35] et ton âme, à toi-même, sera transpercée par un glaive ; c'est ainsi que paraîtront au jour les sentiments de bien des coeurs.»
[2:36] Il y avait là également une prophétesse, Anne, fille de Phanuel, de la tribu d'Aser. Elle était toute chargée d'années. Après avoir, depuis sa virginité, vécu sept ans avec son mari, elle était devenue veuve.
[2:37] Agée alors de quatre-vingt-quatre ans, elle ne quittait point le Temple, servant nuit et jour le Seigneur dans les jeûnes et dans les prières,
[2:38] Elle aussi, survenant en cette même heure, rendit gloire à Dieu et parla de l'enfant à tous ceux qui attendaient la rédemption de Jérusalem.
[2:39] Quand furent accomplies toutes les prescriptions de la Loi du Seigneur, ils rentrèrent en Galilée, dans leur ville de Nazareth.
[2:40] L'enfant grandissait et se fortifiait ; il était plein de sagesse et la grâce de Dieu était sur lui.
[2:41] Chaque année, à la fête de Pâque, ses parents allaient à Jérusalem.
[2:42] Ils y montèrent pour la fête, comme de coutume, lorsqu'il eut atteint l'âge de douze ans.
[2:43] Les jours consacrés à la solennité étant passés, ils s'en revinrent. Or l'enfant Jésus était resté à Jérusalem. Ses parents ne s'en aperçurent point.
[2:44] Supposant qu'il était avec leurs compagnons de route, ils firent une journée de marche, le cherchant parmi ceux de leur parenté et parmi leurs connaissances.
[2:45] Ne l'ayant point trouvé, ils retournèrent à Jérusalem, le cherchant toujours.
[2:46] Ce fut au bout de trois jours qu'ils le trouvèrent, dans le Temple, assis au milieu des docteurs, les écoutant et les interrogeant.
[2:47] Tous ceux qui l'entendaient étaient confondus de son intelligence et de ses réponses.
[2:48] A sa vue, ses parents furent très surpris, et sa mère lui dit : «Mon enfant, pourquoi as-tu agi de la sorte à notre égard? Voilà que ton père et moi nous te cherchions dans une grande angoisse.» —
[2:49] «Pourquoi me cherchiez? vous?» leur répondit-il. «Ne saviez-vous pas qu'il faut que je sois aux affaires de mon Père.»
[2:50] Ses parents ne comprirent pas cette parole qu'il leur adressa.
[2:51] Descendant avec eux, il retourna à Nazareth ; il leur était soumis ; sa mère conservait toutes ces choses en son coeur ;
[2:52] et Jésus progressait en sagesse, en stature et en grâce, devant Dieu et devant les hommes.
[3:1] En l'an quinze du règne de Tibère César, — Ponce-Pilate étant procurateur de la Judée, — Hérode, tétrarque de la Galilée, —Philippe, son frère, tétrarque de l'Iturée et des terres de la Trachonite, — Lysanias, tétrarque de l'Abilène, —
[3:2] sous le pontificat de Banne et de Kaïphe, la parole de Dieu fut adressée à Jean, fils de Zaccharie, dans le désert.
[3:3] Et Jean s'en alla dans toute la région du Jourdain, prêchant un baptême de repentance pour la rémission des péchés,
[3:4] ainsi que cela est écrit au livre des paroles du prophète Ésaïe : «Une voix crie dans le désert : Préparez la voie du Seigneur, Aplanissez ses sentiers ;
[3:5] Toute vallée sera comblée ; Toute montagne et toute colline seront abaissées ; Les voies tortueuses seront changées en droits chemins ; Et les voies rocailleuses en routes unies ;
[3:6] Et toute chair verra le salut de Dieu»
[3:7] Aux foules qui accouraient pour être baptisées par lui, il disait : «Engeance de vipères, qui vous a appris à fuir la colère à venir?
[3:8] Produisez donc des fruits dignes de la repentance, et n'allez pas dire en vous-mêmes : Nous avons pour père Abraham ; car je vous le dis, Dieu peut faire surgir, des pierres que voici, des enfants à Abraham.
[3:9] Déjà la cognée touche la racine des arbres. Tout arbre donc qui ne produit pas de bon fruit, sera coupé et jeté au feu.» —
[3:10] «Qu'avons-nous à faire?» lui demandèrent alors les multitudes.
[3:11] Il leur répondit par ces paroles : «Que celui qui possède deux tuniques en donne une à celui qui n'en a pas et que celui qui a des aliments pour se nourrir fasse de même.»
[3:12] Des publicains vinrent pour être baptisés et lui dirent aussi : «Maître, qu'avons-nous à faire?» —
[3:13] «N'exigez rien de plus, leur répondit-il, que ce qui vous a été prescrit.»
[3:14] Des soldats aussi le questionnèrent : «Et nous, qu'avons-nous à faire?» A eux il dit : «Ne faites violence à personne ; ne faites tort à personne ; contentez-vous de votre paye.»
[3:15] Le peuple était en suspens ; et chacun se demandait, dans le secret de son coeur, si Jean n'était pas peut-être le Christ.
[3:16] Pour répondre à tous, Jean dit : «Moi, je vous baptise d'eau ; mais il va venir celui qui est plus puissant que moi ; je ne suis pas même digne de délier la courroie de ses sandales ; lui, vous baptisera avec l'Esprit saint et le feu.
[3:17] Il a le van dans la main pour nettoyer son aire et rassembler le froment dans son grenier ; mais la paille il la brûlera au feu inextinguible.»
[3:18] C'est ainsi qu'il annonçait la Bonne Nouvelle au peuples par des exhortations nombreuses et variées.
[3:19] Le tétrarque Hérode, cependant, ayant été repris par lui tant au sujet d'Hérodiade, femme de son frère, qu'au sujet des mille crimes qu'il avait commis,
[3:20] ajouta encore celui-ci à tous les autres: il fit jeter Jean en prison.
[3:21] Or tout le peuple ayant reçu le baptême, et Jésus aussi ayant été baptisé, il advint que le ciel s'ouvrit, pendant qu'il priait,
[3:22] et que l'Esprit saint descendit sur lui sous une forme corporelle, sous la figure d'une colombe ; et une voix vint du ciel : «Tu es mon Fils bien-aimé, en toi je me complais.»
[3:23] Jésus, en ce commencement, avait environ trente ans et passait pour être le fils de Joseph, Fils d'Héli,
[3:24] Fils de Maththath, Fils de Lévi, Fils de Melchi, Fils de Jannaï, Fils de Joseph,
[3:25] Fils de Mattathias, Fils d'Amos, Fils de Naoum, Fils d'Eslei, Fils de Nangaï,
[3:26] Fils de Maath, Fils de Mattathias, Fils de Semeein, Fils de Josech, Fils de Joda,
[3:27] Fils de Joanan, Fils de Rèsa, Fils de Zorobabel, Fils de Salathiel, Fils de Nèrei,
[3:28] Fils de Melchei, Fils d'Addei, Fils de Kosam, Fils de Elmadam, Fils de Hèr,
[3:29] Fils de Jésus, Fils d'Éliézer, Fils de Jorem, Fils de Maththath, Fils de Lévi,
[3:30] Fils de Siméon, Fils de Judas, Fils de Joseph, Fils de Jonam, Fils d'Éliakim, Fils de Méléa,
[3:31] Fils de Menna, Fils de Mattatha, Fils de Natham, Fils de David,
[3:32] Fils de Jessaï, Fils de Jobed, Fils de Boos, Fils de Sala, Fils de Naasson,
[3:33] Fils d'Aminadab, Fils d'Admein, Fils d'Ami, Fils d'Esrom, Fils de Pharès, Fils de Judas,
[3:34] Fils de Jacob, Fils d'Isaac, Fils d'Abraham, Fils de Unira, Fils de Nachor, Fils de Serouch,
[3:35] Fils de Ragau, Fils de Phalek, Fils de Eber, Fils de Sala,
[3:36] Fils de Kainam, Fils d'Arphaxad, Fils de Sein, Fils de Noé, Fils de Lamech,
[3:37] Fils de Mathousalem. Fils d'Enoch, Fils de Jaret, Fils de Meleleèl, Fils de Kainam
[3:38] Fils d'Enos, Fils de Seth, Fils d'Adam, Fils de Dieu.
[4:1] Jésus, rempli de l'Esprit saint, revint des bords du Jourdain ; l'Esprit le poussait au désert.
[4:2] Il y passa quarante jours ; il était tenté par le diable. Durant ces quarante jours, il ne mangea rien, et quand ils furent achevés, il eut faim.
[4:3] Le diable lui dit : «Si tu es Fils de Dieu, dis à cette pierre de se changer en pain» ;
[4:4] et, Jésus lui répondit : «Il est écrit : «Ce n'est pas de pain seulement que vivra l'homme.»
[4:5] Puis le diable l'emmena, et lui montrant en un instant tous les royaumes de la terre :
[4:6] «Je te donnerai, lui dit-il, toute cette puissance et la gloire de ces royaumes, car elfe m'a été livrée, et je la donne à qui je veux.
[4:7] Donc, prosterne-toi en adoration devant moi et tout cela est à toi.»
[4:8] Et Jésus lui fit cette réponse : «Il est écrit : «Tu adoreras le Seigneur ton Dieu et c'est à lui seul que tu rendras un culte.»
[4:9] Le menant à Jérusalem, le diable le plaça sur le faîte du Temple et lui dit : «Si tu es Fils de Dieu, jette-toi d'ici en bas,
[4:10] car il est écrit : «A ses anges il donnera l'ordre de te garder
[4:11] Et de te soutenir de leurs mains, De peur que ton pied ne se heurte contre une pierre.»
[4:12] Jésus lui répondit par ces mots : «Il est dit : «Tu ne tenteras point le Seigneur ton Dieu.»
[4:13] Toute espèce de tentation étant achevée, te diable s'éloigna de lai, jusqu'à une autre occasion.
[4:14] Puissant par l'Esprit, Jésus retourna en Galilée ; sa renommée se répandit dans toute la contrée ;
[4:15] il enseignait dans les synagogues du pays et tous célébraient ses louanges.
[4:16] Étant allé à Nazareth, où il avait été élevé, il entra dans la synagogue le jour du sabbat, selon sa coutume, et il se leva pour faire la lecture.
[4:17] On lui présenta le livre du prophète Ésaïe. Il l'ouvrit et trouva un passage où il était écrit :
[4:18] «L'Esprit du Seigneur est sur moi ; m'a consacré par son onction pour annoncer l'Évangile aux pauvres, Il m'a envoyé pour annoncer aux captifs leur délivrance, Aux aveugles qu'ils vont recevoir la vue, Pour renvoyer les opprimés affranchis,
[4:19] Pour annoncer une année de faveur de la part du Seigneur.
[4:20] Il ferma le livre, le rendit au servant et s'assit. Tout le monde, dans la synagogue, avait les yeux fixés sur lui.
[4:21] Il commença ainsi : «Aujourd'hui s'accomplit ce passage de l'Écriture que vous venez d'entendre...»
[4:22] Tous lui rendaient témoignage et étaient ravis des paroles de grâce qui sortaient de sa bouche. «N'est-ce pas là, disait-on, le fils de Joseph?» —
[4:23] «Vous irez jusqu'à m'appliquer ce proverbe, reprit-il : Médecin, guéris-toi toi-même. Tout ce que tu as fait à Capharnaüm et dont nous avons entendu parler, fais-le donc également ici même dans ta patrie.»
[4:24] Puis il ajouta : «Je vous le dis en vérité, nul prophète n'est accepté dans sa patrie.
[4:25] Il y avait, aux jours d'Élie, ce que je vous dis là est la vérité, beaucoup de veuves en Israël, lorsque le ciel fut fermé pendant trois ans et demi, et qu'il y eut une grande famine sur toute la terre ;
[4:26] et cependant Élie ne fut envoyé à aucune d'elles, mais bien à une veuve de Sarepta, dans le pays de Sidon.
[4:27] Il y avait aussi, en Israël, beaucoup de lépreux au temps du prophète Élisée, et cependant aucun d'eux ne fut guéri. Celui qui fut guéri ce fut un Syrien : Naaman.»
[4:28] Ces paroles remplirent de colère tous ceux qui étaient dans la synagogue.
[4:29] Ils se levèrent et ils le chassèrent hors de la cité ; puis ils le menèrent jusqu'au sommet de la montagne sur laquelle leur ville avait été bâtie, pour le jeter en bas.
[4:30] Mais lui, passant au, milieu d'eux, s'en alla
[4:31] et descendit à Capharnaüm, ville de Galilée. Il y enseignait aux jours de sabbat.
[4:32] Et ils étaient extrêmement frappés de son enseignement, car sa parole était pleine d'autorité
[4:33] Dans la synagogue il y avait un homme possédé de l'Esprit d'un démon impur. Il se mit à jeter de grands cris :
[4:34] «Ah! qu'y a-t-il entre nous et toi, Jésus de Nazareth? Tu es venu pour nous perdre ; je sais qui tu es : le Saint de Dieu!»
[4:35] Jésus alors le menaça : «Tais-toi, dit-il, sors de cet homme!» Le renversant par terre au milieu de l'assemblée, le démon sortit de lui sans lui faire aucun mal.
[4:36] Tous furent terrifiés, et ils se parlaient les uns aux autres : «Qu'est-ce donc, disaient-ils, que cette parole? Il commande avec autorité et puissance aux Esprits impurs, et ils sortent !»
[4:37] Dans tout le pays environnant il n'était bruit que de lui.
[4:38] En sortant de la synagogue, il entra dans la maison de Simon. Or, la belle-mère de Simon était malade d'une forte fièvre. On implora Jésus en sa faveur.
[4:39] Il se pencha vers elle, commanda à la fièvre, et la fièvre disparut. Immédiatement cette femme se leva et se mit à les servir.
[4:40] Après le coucher du soleil, tous ceux qui avaient des malades, quels que fussent leurs maux, les lui amenèrent. Imposant les mains à chacun d'eux, Jésus les guérit.
[4:41] Des démons sortaient aussi d'un grand nombre, en s'écriant : «Tu es le Fils de Dieu!» Mais il les menaçait et leur défendait de parler ainsi ; car ils savaient qu'il était le Christ.
[4:42] Lorsqu'il fit jour, il sortit et s'en alla dans un lieu solitaire. Les multitudes se mirent à sa recherche ; elles arrivèrent jusqu'à, lui et elles le retenaient, ne voulant point qu'il les quittât.
[4:43] Mais il leur dit : «Il me faut annoncer dans d'autres villes aussi l'Évangile du Royaume de Dieu, car c'est pour cela que j'ai été envoyé.»
[4:44] Et il prêchait dans les synagogues de la Galilée.
[5:1] Un jour, qu'il se tenait sur le rivage du lac de Gennézareth, la foule se pressait autour de lui pour entendre la parole de Dieu.
[5:2] Il vit deux barques qui stationnaient près du bord ; les pêcheurs en étaient descendus et lavaient leurs filets.
[5:3] Montant alors dans l'une de ces barques, il pria Simon, à qui elle appartenait, de l'éloigner un peu de terre. Puis il s'assit ; et de la barque, il instruisait les multitudes.
[5:4] Lorsqu'il eut fini de parler, il dit à Simon : «Pousse au large, et vous lancerez vos filets pour la pêche.
[5:5] Simon lui fit cette réponse: «Maître nous avons travaillé toute la nuit sans rien prendre ; toutefois, sur ta parole je jetterai le filet.»
[5:6] Ce qu'ils firent ; et ils ramenèrent une telle quantité de poissons que les filets se déchiraient.
[5:7] Alors ils appelèrent à leur aide ceux de leurs camarades qui étaient dans l'autre barque ; ceux-ci arrivèrent et les deux barques furent remplies au point qu'elles s'enfonçaient.
[5:8] A cette vue, Simon Pierre tomba aux genoux de Jésus disant : «Éloigne toi de moi, Seigneur, car je suis un homme pécheur.»
[5:9] Un sentiment d'effroi l'avait, en effet, saisi, ainsi que tous ses compagnons, en présence de cette pêche et des poissons qu'ils venaient de prendre.
[5:10] Il en était de même de Jacques et de Jean, fils de Zébédée, qui étaient les camarades de Simon. «Ne crains point, dit Jésus à Simon, désormais tu seras pêcheur d'hommes.»
[5:11] Là-dessus, ramenant les barques à terre, ils quittèrent tout et le suivirent.
[5:12] Une autre fois, comme il était dans une ville, survint un homme couvert de lèpre. Voyant Jésus, il se prosterna, tout suppliant, la face contre terre, disant : «Seigneur, si tu le veux, tu peux me guérir.»
[5:13] Jésus étendit la main, le toucha et dit : «Je le veux, sois, guérit.» La lèpre disparut à l'instant.
[5:14] Jésus lui recommanda de n'en parler à personne : «Retire-toi, lui dit-il, va te montrer au prêtre, et offre pour ta guérison ce que Moïse a prescrit ; que ce leur soit un témoignage.
[5:15] Sa renommée se répandait de plus en plus ; d'immenses multitudes accouraient pour l'entendre et pour se faire guérir de leurs maladies.
[5:16] Quant à lui, il se tenait retiré dans les lieux solitaires et il y priait.
[5:17] Voici ce qui arriva, un des jours où il était à enseigner, ayant assis devant lui des Pharisiens et des Docteurs de la Loi venus des bourgs de Galilée et de Judée et de la ville de Jérusalem : La puissance du Seigneur était là pour guérir,
[5:18] lorsque survinrent des gens portant sur un lit un homme qui était paralysé. Ils cherchèrent à le faire entrer et à le placer devant Jésus ;
[5:19] et ne trouvant pas moyen de pénétrer à cause de la foule, ils montèrent sur la maison et descendirent le malade avec son petit lit par la toiture, au milieu de l'assemblée et devant Jésus.
[5:20] Voyant leur foi, celui-ci dit à l'homme : «Tes péchés te sont pardonnés.»
[5:21] Alors les Scribes et les Pharisiens se mirent à faire leurs réflexions : «Qui donc, disaient-ils, est celui-ci qui profère des blasphèmes? Qui peut pardonner des péchés que Dieu seul?»
[5:22] Connaissant leurs raisonnements, Jésus leur adressa ces paroles : Pourquoi ces pensées dans vos coeurs?
[5:23] Lequel est le plus facile, de dire : tes péchés te sont pardonnés, ou de dire : lève-toi et marche?
[5:24] Or, afin que vous sachiez que le Fils de l'homme a sur ta terre le pouvoir de pardonner des péchés...» s'adressant au paralytique : «A toi, je dis : Lève-toi, emporte ton petit lit et, va dans ta maison !
[5:25] Aussitôt, se levant devant eux, il emporta le petit lit sur lequel il était couché et retourna en sa maison glorifiant Dieu.
[5:26] Transportés d'enthousiasme, tous se mirent aussi à glorifier Dieu et, tout effrayés, ils disaient : «Quelle incroyable chose nous avons vue aujourd'hui!»
[5:27] Après cela, il sortit, et aperçut, assis au bureau du péage, un publicain du nom de Lévi. Il lui dit : «Suis-moi» ;
[5:28] et lui, abandonnant tout, se leva et le suivit.
[5:29] Lévi lui donna un grand festin en sa maison. Se trouvaient à table, entre autres convives, un grand nombre de publicains.
[5:30] Cela fit murmurer les Pharisiens et leurs Scribes : «Pourquoi, dirent-ils aux disciples, mangez-vous et buvez-vous avec des publicains et avec des pécheurs?»
[5:31] Jésus alors leur adressa ces paroles : «Ce ne sont pas ceux qui sont en bonne santé qui ont besoin de médecin, ce sont les malades.
[5:32] Je ne suis pas venu appeler à la repentance des justes, mais des pécheurs.»
[5:33] Ils lui dirent : «Les disciples de Jean se livrent fréquemment aux jeûnes et aux prières ; ceux des Pharisiens font de même ; et les tiens mangent et boivent.»
[5:34] Jésus leur répondit : «Pouvez-vous faire jeûner les amis de l'époux pendant que l'époux est avec eux?
[5:35] Des jours viendront où l'époux leur sera enlevé, ils jeûneront dans ces jours.»
[5:36] Il leur dit aussi une parabole : «Personne, dans un vêtement neuf ne déchire un morceau pour le coudre à un vêtement vieux ; autrement il aura déchiré le vêtement neuf et aura mis au vieux vêtement un morceau neuf qui ne s'accorde pas.
[5:37] Personne non plus ne verse du vin nouveau dans de vieilles outres ; autrement le vin nouveau fera éclater les outres ; il se répandra et les outres seront perdues.
[5:38] Mais on doit verser le vin nouveau dans des outres, neuves.
[5:39] «Quand on vient de boire du vin vieux, on n'en demande jamais du nouveau : Le vieux, dit-on, c'est le bon.»
[6:1] Il arriva — un jour de sabbat — que Jésus passa par des blés ; ses disciples cueillaient les épis et, les froissant dans leurs mains, en mangeaient les grains.
[6:2] «Pourquoi faites-vous, dirent quelques-uns des Pharisiens, ce qu'au jour du sabbat il n'est pas permis de faire?»
[6:3] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «N'avez-vous pas lu ce que fit David quand il eut faim et ce que firent ses compagnons?
[6:4] Comment il entra dans la maison de Dieu, prit les pains de proposition, en mangea et en donna à ceux qui étaient avec lui, quand il n'est permis qu'aux prêtres seuls d'en manger ?» —
[6:5] «Le Fils de l'homme, ajouta-t-il, est maître aussi du sabbat.»
[6:6] Un autre jour de sabbat, il entra dans la synagogue et il y enseigna. Il s'y trouvait un homme dont la main droite était paralysée.
[6:7] Les Scribes et les Pharisiens l'observaient pour voir si, un jour de sabbat, il le guérirait, et pour tirer de là quelque prétexte à accusation.
[6:8] Quant à lui, il connaissait leurs pensées. «Lève-toi, dit-il, à l'homme dont la main était paralysée, et tiens-toi debout au milieu de nous tous! L'homme se leva et se tint debout.
[6:9] «Je vous le demande, leur dit alors Jésus, est-il permis aux jours de sabbat de faire le bien ou de faire le mal? de sauver une vie ou de la perdre?»
[6:10] Ayant sur eux tous promené son regard, il dit à l'homme : «Étends ta main.»
[6:11] Il le fit et sa main fut guérie. Quant à eux, ils étaient fous de rage, et ils parlaient entre eux de ce qu'ils pourraient bien faire à Jésus.
[6:12] En ces jours-là, il se retira sur la montagne pour prier et passa la nuit à prier Dieu.
[6:13] Quand il fit jour, il convoqua ses disciples ; et il choisit douze d'entre eux, auxquels il donna le nom d'apôtres ;
[6:14] ce furent Simon, qu'il nomma Pierre, et André son frère ; — Jacques et Jean ; — Philippe et Barthélemi ; —
[6:15] Matthieu et Thomas ; — Jacques, fils d'Alphée, et Simon (celui qu'on appelle le zélateur) ;
[6:16] Judas, frère de Jacques, et Judas l'Iskariôte, qui fut un traître.
[6:17] Descendant de la montagne, avec eux, il s'arrêta sur un terrain uni. Là se trouvait, avec une foule considérable de ses disciples, une multitude immense de peuple, venue pour l'entendre et se faire guérir de ses maux, de toute la Judée, de Jérusalem et du littoral de Tyr et de Sidon.
[6:18] Ceux qui étaient tourmentés par des Esprits impurs en étaient délivrés
[6:19] et chacun dans la foule cherchait à le toucher, parce qu'il sortait de lui une vertu qui les guérissait tous.
[6:20] Jésus, levant les yeux sur ses disciples, dit: «Heureux êtes-vous, ô pauvres, parce qu'à vous appartient le Royaume de Dieu!»
[6:21] «Heureux, ô vous qui avez faim maintenant, parce que vous serez rassasiés!» «Heureux, ô vous qui pleurez maintenant, parce que vous rirez!»
[6:22] «Heureux serez-vous lorsque les hommes vous haïront, vous réprouveront, vous outrageront, proscriront votre nom comme maudit à cause du Fils de l’homme!
[6:23] En ce jour-là réjouissez-vous et sautez de joie! parce que votre récompense sera grande dans le ciel ; car c'est de même façon que leurs pères traitaient les prophètes.»
[6:24] «Malheur à vous cependant, riches, parce que vous avez aujourd'hui votre consolation!»
[6:25] «Malheur à vous qui maintenant avez tout à satiété, parce que vous aurez faim !» «Malheur à vous qui maintenant riez, parce que vous tomberez dans le deuil et les larmes!»
[6:26] «Malheur! lorsque tous les hommes diront du bien de vous, car c'est de même façon que leurs pères traitaient les faux prophètes!»
[6:27] «Quant à vous qui m'écoutez, voici ce que je vous dis : Aimez vos ennemis ; faites du bien à ceux qui vous haïssent ;
[6:28] bénissez ceux qui vous maudissent ; priez pour ceux qui vous font injure.
[6:29] Si quelqu'un te frappe sur une joue, présente-lui aussi l'autre ; et contre celui qui t'enlève ton manteau ne défends pas même ta tunique.»
[6:30] «A qui te demande, donne ; et à qui s'empare de ce qui est à toi, ne réclame rien.»
[6:31] «Comme vous voulez que les hommes agissent envers vous, agissez vous-mêmes pareillement envers eux.
[6:32] Si vous aimez ceux qui vous aiment, quel gré vous en saura-t-on? les pécheurs aussi aiment ceux qui les aiment.
[6:33] Et si vous faites du bien à ceux qui vous en font à vous-mêmes, quel gré vous en saura-t-on? Les pécheurs le font aussi.
[6:34] Et si vous prêtez à ceux dont vous espérez recevoir quelque chose, quel gré vous en saura-t-on? Les pécheurs aussi font des prêts aux pécheurs pour recevoir un jour le même service.
[6:35] Vous cependant aimez vos ennemis ; faites du bien et prêtez sans espérer quoi que ce soit. Et votre récompense sera grande et vous serez fils du Très-Haut, parce qu'il est bon pour les ingrats et pour les méchants.»
[6:36] «Soyez miséricordieux, comme votre Père est miséricordieux.
[6:37] Ne jugez point et vous ne serez point jugés ; ne condamnez point et vous ne serez point condamnés. Pardonnez, et il vous sera pardonné.
[6:38] Donnez, et il vous sera donné ; il sera versé dans votre sein une bonne mesure, pressée, tassée, débordante, car la mesure que vous faites aux autres sera votre mesure.»
[6:39] Il leur dit aussi une parabole : «Un aveugle peut-il conduire un aveugle? Ne tomberont-ils pas tous deux dans une fosse?»
[6:40] «Le disciple n'est pas au-dessus du maître ; il sera parfait quand il sera pareil à son maître.»
[6:41] «Pourquoi regardes-tu la paille qui est dans l'oeil de ton frère? Et la poutre qui est dans ton oeil à toi, tu ne la remarques pas!
[6:42] Comment peux-tu dire à ton frère : «Mon frère, laisse-moi ôter cette paille qui est dans ton oeil», ne voyant pas toi-même la poutre qui est dans le tien? Hypocrite, ôte d'abord de ton oeil la poutre et alors tu verras à ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère!»
[6:43] «Un arbre qui produit de mauvais fruits n'est pas bon ; à l'inverse, un arbre qui produit de bons fruits n'est pas mauvais ;
[6:44] car c'est par son fruit que chaque arbre se fait connaître. Sur des épines on ne cueille pas de figues ; sur des ronces on ne vendange pas de raisin.»
[6:45] «Du bon trésor de son coeur l'homme bon tire le bien ; de son mauvais trésor l'homme mauvais tire le mal ; car c'est de l'abondance du coeur que la bouche parle.»
[6:46] «Pourquoi m'appelez-vous : «Seigneur ! Seigneur !» et ne faites-vous pas ce que je dis?
[6:47] Quiconque vient à moi, entendant mes paroles et les mettant en pratique, je vais vous montrer à qui il ressemble.
[6:48] Il ressemble à un homme qui, en construisant une maison, a creusé très avant et a établi ses fondations sur le roc. L'inondation est survenue ; le torrent a fait irruption sur cette maison et il n'a pas eu la force de l'ébranler, parce qu'elle était bien construite.»
[6:49] «Quant à celui qui entend et ne met pas en pratique, il ressemble à un homme qui a bâti sa maison sur la terre sans fondations. Sur elle le torrent a fait irruption ; soudain elle s'est écroulée ; et la ruine de cette maison a été grande.
[7:1] Quand il eut achevé tous ces discours adressés au peuple, Jésus entra dans Capharnaüm.
[7:2] Or un centurion avait, malade et près de mourir, un serviteur qui lui était très cher.
[7:3] Ayant entendu parler de Jésus, il lui envoya quelques Anciens d'entre les Juifs, pour lui demander de venir et de guérir son serviteur.
[7:4] Ceux-ci, ayant abordé Jésus, le prièrent avec de grandes instances: «Il mérite, lui dirent-ils, que tu lui accordes cela,
[7:5] car il aime notre nation et c'est lui qui nous a bâti la synagogue.»
[7:6] Jésus était parti avec eux ; comme il n'était plus qu'à une o petite distance de la maison, le centurion envoya de ses amis lui dire : «Seigneur, ne prends pas tant de peine, car je ne suis pas digne que tu entres sous mon toit,
[7:7] et c'est pour cela que je ne me suis pas moi-même jugé digne d'aller à toi. Mais donne un ordre et mon serviteur sera guéri.
[7:8] Car moi (qui ne suis pourtant qu'un subordonné) j'ai sous mes ordres des soldats, et si je dis à l'un : «Va-t'en», il s'en va ; à l'autre : «Viens vient ; à mon, esclave : «Fais cela», il le fait.»
[7:9] Jésus fut dans l'admiration de ce langage ; et se tournant vers la foule qui le suivait : «Je vous le déclare, dit-il, même en Israël, je n'ai pas trouvé une foi aussi grande.»
[7:10] De retour à la maison, les envoyés du centurion trouvèrent le serviteur en pleine santé.
[7:11] Le lendemain il se dirigea vers une ville appelée Naïn ; avec lui allaient un grand nombre de ses disciples et une foule considérable.
[7:12] Comme il arrivait à la porte de la cité, il se trouva que l'on portait en terre un mort ; c'était un fils unique dont la mère était veuve. Une grande quantité d'habitants de la ville étaient avec elle.
[7:13] En la voyant, le Seigneur fut touché de compassions envers elle et lui dit : «Ne pleure point!»
[7:14] Puis il s'approcha et toucha le cercueil. Les porteurs s'arrêtèrent, et il dit : «Jeune homme, je te l'ordonne, lève-toi !»
[7:15] Et le mort se dressa sur son séant et se mit à parler. Jésus le rendit à sa mère.
[7:16] La crainte les saisit tous et ils glorifiaient Dieu : «Un grand prophète, disaient-ils, a surgi parmi nous, et Dieu a visité son peuple.»
[7:17] Le bruit de ce qui s'était passé se répandit partout en Judée et dans tout le pays environnant.
[7:18] Les disciples de Jean ayant rapporté tout cela à leur maître,
[7:19] celui-ci en désigna deux, et les envoya dire au Seigneur : «Es-tu celui qui doit venir, ou devons-nous en attendre un autre?»
[7:20] S'étant donc présentés à Jésus, ces hommes lui dirent : «Jean-Baptiste nous a adressés à toi pour te dire : Es-tu celui qui doit venir ou devons-nous en attendre un autre?»
[7:21] Or, en cet instant même, Jésus guérissait nombre de malades, d'infirmes, de possédés ; à beaucoup d'aveugles il faisait don de la vue.
[7:22] Alors il fit aux messagers celte réponse : «Allez annoncer à Jean ce que vous avez vu et entendu : des aveugles voient, des estropiés marchent, des lépreux sont guéris, des sourds entendent, des morts ressuscitent, des pauvres entendent l'Évangiles.
[7:23] Heureux est celui pour qui je ne serai pas une occasion de chute.»
[7:24] Quand les messagers furent partis, Jésus se mit à parler de Jean aux multitudes : «Au désert, qu'êtes-vous allés voir? Est-ce un roseau agité par le vent?
[7:25] Qu'êtes-vous allés voir? Est-ce un homme aux vêtements efféminés? Mais ceux qui se revêtent de riches habits et qui vivent au milieu des délices vivent dans les palais des rois.
[7:26] Qu'êtes-vous donc allés voir? Est-ce un prophète? Oui, vous dis-je, et plus qu'un prophète.
[7:27] C'est celui dont il est écrit: Voici que j'envoie mon messager pour te précéder Et préparer ton chemin devant toi.
[7:28] «Je vous le déclare, parmi ceux que les femmes ont enfantés, nul n'est plus grand que Jean. Mais le plus petit dans le Royaume de Dieu est plus grand que lui.»
[7:29] «En se faisant baptiser du baptême de Jean, tout le peuple qui l'écoutait, même les publicains ont reconnu la justice de Dieu ;
[7:30] mais en ne se faisant pas baptiser par lui, les Pharisiens et les légistes ont rejeté le dessein de Dieu à leur égard.»
[7:31] «A qui donc assimilerai-je les hommes de cette génération-ci? et à qui ressemblent-ils?
[7:32] Ils ressemblent à des enfants assis sur la place publique qui se crient les uns aux autres : Nous avons joué de la flûte Et vous n'avez pas dansé ; Nous avons entonné des chants lugubres Et vous n'avez pas pleuré.»
[7:33] «Et, en effet, Jean-Baptiste est venu s'abstenant de manger du pain et de boire du vin ; et vous dites : «Il est possédé d'un démon.»
[7:34] Le Fils de l'homme est venu mangeant et buvant comme tout le monde, et vous dites : «Voilà un amateur de bonne chère, un buveur de vin, un ami des publicains et des pécheurs.»
[7:35] «A la sagesse, justice est rendue par tous ses enfants.»
[7:36] Un des Pharisiens le pria de venir manger chez lui. Jésus, étant donc entré dans la maison du Pharisien, se mit à table.
[7:37] Or, une femme de la ville qui vivait dans le péché, ayant appris qu'il était à table dans la maison de ce Pharisien, apporta un vase d'albâtre rempli de parfum.
[7:38] Elle se plaça derrière lui, en pleurant, et se tint à ses pieds, qu'elle arrosa d'abord de ses larmes et qu'elle essuya ensuite de ses cheveux, à ses pieds qu'elle baisa longtemps et qu'elle oignit de son parfum.
[7:39] Voyant cela, le Pharisien qui l'avait invité pensait en lui-même: «Si cet homme était prophète, il saurait qui est cette femme qui le touche ; et ce qu'elle est : une pécheresse.
[7:40] Jésus alors s'adressant à lui : «Simon, j'ai quelque chose à te dire.» — «Parle, maître», répondit Simon.» —
[7:41] «Un certain créancier avait deux débiteurs ; le premier lui devait cinq cents deniers ; et le second cinquante.
[7:42] Ni l'un ni l'autre n'ayant de quoi le payer, il fit à chacun d'eux remise de sa dette. Lequel des deux l'aimera le plus?»
[7:43] Simon fit cette réponse : «Celui, je suppose, auquel il a remis davantage.» — «Tu viens de juger en toute droiture», reprit Jésus ;
[7:44] puis, se tournant vers la femme et parlant toujours à Simon: «Tu vois cette femme? Quand je suis entré dans ta maison tu ne m'as pas apporté d'eau pour mes pieds, mais elle, c'est avec ses larmes qu'elle les a arrosés, c'est avec ses cheveux qu'elle les a essuyés.
[7:45] Tu ne m'as pas donné de baiser ; mais elle, depuis l'instant où elle est entrée n'a cessé d'embrasser mes pieds.
[7:46] Sur ma tête, tu n'as pas fait d'onction d'huile ; mais elle, ce sont mes pieds qu'elle a oints de parfum.
[7:47] A cause de cela, je te le déclare, ses nombreux péchés lui sont pardonnés, parce qu'elle a beaucoup aimé. Celui à qui on pardonne peu, aime peu.»
[7:48] Puis il lui dit à elle : «Tes péchés te sont pardonnés.» —
[7:49] «Qui est cet homme qui va jusqu'à pardonner des péchés?» se demandèrent entre eux les convives.
[7:50] Lui, cependant, dit à la femme : «Ta foi t'a sauvée ; va en paix!»
[8:1] Ensuite, il alla de ville en ville et de village en village prêchant, et annonçant l'Évangile du Royaume de Dieu.
[8:2] Avec lui étaient les douze et quelques femmes qui avaient été délivrées de mauvais Esprits, ou guéries de maladies : Marie, celle qu'on appelle Magdelaine, de laquelle étaient sortis sept démons ;
[8:3] Jeanne, femme de Chouza, intendant d'Hérode ; Suzanne, et beaucoup d'autres qui l'assistaient de leurs biens.
[8:4] Comme il s'assemblait une foule énorme et que de toutes les villes on venait à lui, il dit cette parabole :
[8:5] «Le semeur est sorti pour semer sa semence ; il jette sa semence, et des grains sont tombés le long du chemin ; on les a foulés aux pieds ; et les oiseaux du ciel les ont mangés.»
[8:6] «D'autres sont tombés sur des pierres ; ils ont levé, puis séché ; ils n'avaient pas d'humidité.»
[8:7] «D'autres grains sont tombés au milieu des épines, et en même temps ont crû les épines ; et elles les ont étouffés.»
[8:8] «D'autres sont tombés dans la bonne terre ; ils ont levé ; ils ont porté du fruit au centuple.» Cela disant, il s'écriait : «Que celui qui a des oreilles pour entendre, entende!»
[8:9] Ses disciples lui demandèrent ce que signifiait cette parabole.
[8:10] Il répondit : «A vous il est donné de pénétrer les mystères du Royaume de Dieu, mais les autres ne les connaissent que par des paraboles, afin qu'ils voient sans voir et entendent sans comprendre.»
[8:11] «Voici le sens de cette parabole : «La semence, c'est la parole de Dieu.
[8:12] Le long du chemin sont ceux qui ont écouté ; mais ensuite vient le diable, qui enlève de leurs coeurs la parole, de peur qu'ils ne croient et ne soient sauvés.
[8:13] Sur des pierres sont ceux qui, après avoir écouté la parole, l'ont accueillie avec joie ; mais ils n'ont pas de racine ; ils ont la foi momentanément et, au moment de l'épreuve, ils se retirent.»
[8:14] «La semence tombée parmi les épines représente ceux qui ont écouté la parole, et puis ils sont partis, et chez eux elle demeure stérile, étouffée par les soucis, par les richesses et par les plaisirs de la vie.»
[8:15] «La semence tombée dans la bonne terre représente ceux qui retiennent dans un coeur excellent et bon la parole par eux entendue, et portent du fruit avec persévérance.»
[8:16] «Personne, quand il allume une lampe, ne la recouvre d'un vase ou ne la pose sous un lit ; on la place au contraire sur un pied-de-lampe, afin que ceux qui entrent voient la lumière.
[8:17] Car rien n'est caché qui ne doive être découvert, rien n'est secret qui ne doive être connu et mis au jour.
[8:18] Prenez donc garde comment vous écoutez. Car à celui qui aura, il sera donné, et à celui qui n'aura pas, même ce qu'il croit avoir lui sera ôté.»
[8:19] Sa mère et ses frères, étant venus le trouver, ne pouvaient, à cause de la foule, pénétrer jusqu'à lui.
[8:20] On l'en prévint : «Ta mère et tes frères sont là dehors, qui voudraient te voir.»
[8:21] Il répondit, par ces paroles : «Ma mère et mes frères, ce sont ceux-là, qui écoutent la parole de Dieu et qui la mettent en pratique.»
[8:22] Il monta, un jour, dans une barque avec ses disciples. «Faisons la traversée du lac», leur dit-il. Ils partirent.
[8:23] Tandis qu'ils naviguaient, Jésus s'endormit ; et un tourbillon de vent s'abattit sur le lac ; la barque s'emplissait d'eau ; ils étaient en danger.
[8:24] Les disciples allèrent à lui, le réveillèrent, lui disant : «Maître, maître, nous périssons!» Il se leva, se mit à menacer le vent et les flots soulevés. Ils s'arrêtèrent ; il se fit un calme.
[8:25] Il leur dit alors: «Où est votre foi?» Terrifiés, ils l'admiraient et se disaient l'un à l'autre : «Qui donc est cet homme qui commande aux vents et aux flots, et à qui ils obéissent?»
[8:26] Ils abordèrent au pays des Géraséniens, situé en face de la Galilée.
[8:27] Comme Jésus descendait à terre, vint à sa rencontre un homme de la ville, possédé par des démons. Il était depuis fort longtemps sans vêtements ; il vivait en dehors de tout domicile ; et demeurait dans les sépulcres.
[8:28] Apercevant Jésus, il tomba à ses pieds en jetant des cris, et dit de toutes ses forces : «Qu'y a-t-il entre moi et toi, Jésus, Fils du Dieu Très-Haut? Je t'en conjure, ne me torture point.»
[8:29] En effet, Jésus commandait à l'Esprit impur de sortir de cet homme dont depuis très longtemps il s'était emparé. On l'attachait avec des chaînes, on lui mettait des fers aux pieds pour le retenir ; il rompait tous les liens et le démon le poussait vers les lieux déserts. Jésus l'interrogea.
[8:30] «Quel est ton nom?» lui dit-il. — Il répondit : «Légion.» Une quantité de démons étaient, en effet, entrés dans cet homme.
[8:31] Ceux-ci supplièrent Jésus de ne pas ordonner qu'ils allassent à l'abîme,
[8:32] mais de leur permettre d'entrer dans un nombreux troupeau de pourceaux qui étaient là, paissant sur la montagne. Il le leur permit.
[8:33] Les démons sortirent alors de l'homme et entrèrent dans les pourceaux et, d'une course impétueuse, le troupeau se précipita dans le lac et s'y noya.
[8:34] Voyant ce qui était arrivé, les gardeurs prirent la fuite et allèrent répandre la nouvelle dans la ville et dans les campagnes.
[8:35] Les habitants sortirent pour voir ce qui s'était passé. Ils s'approchèrent de Jésus ; ils trouvèrent assis à ses pieds, avec ses vêtements, et plein de bon sens, l'homme de qui les démons étaient sortis. Cela leur fit peur.
[8:36] Les témoins oculaires leur racontèrent comment le démoniaque avait été guéri.
[8:37] Tout ce peuple du pays des Géraséniens pria alors Jésus de s'éloigner d'eux. En effet, ils étaient frappés de terreur. Il remonta donc dans la barque et s'en retourna.
[8:38] L'homme qui avait été délivré des démons lui demandait la permission de rester avec lui. Mais Jésus le congédia et lui dit :
[8:39] «Retourne en ta maison, et raconte tout ce que Dieu t'a fait.» Cet homme partit, publiant par toute la ville ce que lui avait fait Jésus.
[8:40] A son retour, Jésus fut reçu par la foule ; tous étaient à l’attendre.
[8:41] A ce moment un homme nommé Jaïrus, qui était chef de la synagogue, vint se jeter à ses pieds, le suppliant d'entrer dans sa maison,
[8:42] parce que sa fille unique, âgée de douze ans environ, se mourait.
[8:43] Il y allait pressé par la foule, lorsqu'une femme, malade d'une perte de sang depuis douze années, qui avait dépensé en médecins tout son avoir, sans qu'aucun d'eux eût pu la guérir,
[8:44] s'approcha par derrière et toucha la frange de son vêtement. Sa perte de sang s'arrêta immédiatement.
[8:45] Jésus demanda : «Qui est-ce qui m'a touché?» Tous s'en défendirent. «C'est la foule, maître, qui te presse, qui t'accable», lui dirent Pierre et ceux qui étaient avec luit.
[8:46] Jésus reprit : «Quelqu'un m'a touché, car j'ai senti qu'une vertu sortait de moi.»
[8:47] Se voyant découverte, la femme, toute tremblante, vint se jeter à ses pieds et déclara devant tout le monde pourquoi elle l'avait touché, et comment elle avait été immédiatement guérie.
[8:48] Et lui, il lui dit : «Ma fille, ta foi t'a guérie ; va en paix.»
[8:49] Comme il parlait encore, arriva quelqu'un de chez le chef de la synagogue disant: «Ta fille est morte, ne fatigue pas davantage le maître.»
[8:50] Jésus, entendant ces paroles, dit à Jaïrus : «Ne crains point, crois seulement, et elle sera sauvée.»
[8:51] Arrivé à la maison, il ne permit à personne d'entrer avec lui, sinon à Pierre, à Jean et à Jacques, ainsi qu'au père et à la mère de l'enfant.
[8:52] Tous ceux qui étaient là pleuraient à haute voix et se lamentaient sur elle. Il leur dit : «Ne pleurez pas, elle n'est pas morte, mais elle dort.»
[8:53] Et on se moquait de lui ; on savait bien qu'elle était morte.
[8:54] Jésus, alors, lui saisit la main et prononça ces paroles : «Mon enfant, réveille-toi !» Et son esprit revint.
[8:55] Elle se leva aussitôt, et Jésus commanda de lui donner à manger.
[8:56] Ses parents étaient transportés ; mais il leur ordonna de ne dire à personne ce qui était arrivé.
[9:1] Ayant réuni les douze, il leur donna force et puissance sur tous, les démons et le pouvoir de guérir des maladies.
[9:2] Puis il les envoya en mission pour prêcher le Royaume de Dieu et faire des guérisons.
[9:3] Voici ce qu'il leur dit : «N'emportez rien pour la route, ni bâton, ni sac, ni pain, ni argent, n'ayez pas même deux vêtements.
[9:4] En quelque maison que vous entriez, demeurez-y, et que, ce soit de là que vous partiez.
[9:5] Quant à ceux qui ne vous recevront pas, sortez de leur ville en secouant, en témoignage contre eux, la poussière de vos pieds.»
[9:6] Ils partirent et c'est de village en village qu'ils allaient, partout évangélisant et partout guérissant.
[9:7] Le tétrarque Hérode apprit tout ce qui se passait, et il était rendu fort perplexe par ce qu'on disait de Jésus. Pour les uns, Jean était ressuscité d'entre les morts ;
[9:8] pour les autres, Élie était apparu ; pour ceux-ci, un des anciens prophètes était revenu à la vie.
[9:9] «J'ai fait couper la tête à Jean, disait Hérode ; qui est donc cet homme dont j'entends dire de pareilles choses?» Et il était désireux de le voir.
[9:10] A leur retour, les apôtres racontèrent à Jésus tout ce qu'ils avaient fait. Il les prit avec lui et il se retira à l'écart dans une ville appelée Bethsaïda. Mais les multitudes l'apprirent et le suivirent.
[9:11] Il les accueillit en leur parlant du Royaume de Dieu et en rendant la santé à ceux qui avaient besoin d'être guéris.
[9:12] Le jour cependant commençait à baisser, et les douze, s'approchant, lui dirent : «Congédie les foules, afin qu'elles aillent dans les villages d'alentour et dans les maisons de la campagne trouver logement et nourriture ; nous sommes ici dans un désert.»
[9:13] Mais Jésus leur répondit : «Donnez-leur vous-mêmes à manger.» — Nous n'avons ici, répliquèrent-ils, que cinq pains et deux poissons, à moins que nous n'allions acheter de quoi nourrir tout ce peuple !»
[9:14] Or il y avait là à peu près cinq mille hommes. Jésus dit alors à ses disciples : «Faites-les asseoir par rangées de cinquante.»
[9:15] Ainsi firent-ils ; et tout le monde s'assit.
[9:16] Puis Jésus, prenant les cinq pains et les deux poissons, leva les yeux au ciel, prononça sur eux la bénédiction, les rompit et les donna aux disciples pour qu'ils les servissent à la foule.
[9:17] Tous mangèrent, tous furent rassasiés ; et on emporta les morceaux qui restaient ; il y en avait douze paniers.
[9:18] Comme il était un jour à prier dans un lieu solitaire, les disciples le rejoignirent et il leur fit cette question : «Parmi ces foules, qui dit-on que je suis?»
[9:19] Ils lui répondirent ainsi : «Jean-Baptiste ; d'autres: Élie ; d'autres encore : un des anciens prophètes revenu à la vie.» —
[9:20] «Et vous, continua-t-il, qui dites-vous que je suis?» Pierre répondit par ces mots : «Le Christ de Dieu.»
[9:21] Il leur défendit avec les plus rigoureuses recommandations de le dire à personne,
[9:22] ajoutant qu'il lui fallait, lui, le Fils de l'homme : — beaucoup souffrir ; — être rejeté par les Anciens, les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes ; — être mis à mort ; — ressusciter le troisième jour.»
[9:23] A tous il disait : «Si quelqu'un veut venir à ma suite, qu'il renonce à lui-même, que chaque jour il porte sa croix, et qu'il me suive.
[9:24] Celui qui voudra sauver sa vie, la perdra ; et il sauvera sa vie, celui qui l'aura perdue à cause de moi.
[9:25] A quoi servirait-il à un homme de gagner le monde entier, si c'est en se perdant lui-même et en consommant sa ruine?
[9:26] De celui qui aura eu honte de moi et de mes paroles, le Fils de l'homme aura honte à son tour quand il viendra dans sa gloire et dans celle du Père et des saints anges.
[9:27] Je vous dis la vérité : Quelques-uns sont ici présents qui ne goûteront point la mort, avant d'avoir vu le Royaume de Dieu.»
[9:28] Huit jours environ après avoir ainsi parlé, Jésus emmena avec lui Pierre, Jean et Jacques, et s'en alla prier sur la montagne.
[9:29] Tandis qu'il priait, l'aspect de son visage changea et ses vêtements devinrent d'une blancheur resplendissante.
[9:30] Deux hommes étaient là qui s'entretenaient avec lui ; c'étaient Moïse et Élie
[9:31] apparaissant en grande gloire ; ils parlaient de sa sortie du monde qu'il devait accomplir à Jérusalem.
[9:32] Cependant Pierre et ses compagnons avaient succombé au sommeil. C'est à leur réveil qu'ils virent sa gloire et les deux hommes qui se tenaient près de lui.
[9:33] Au moment où ceux-ci se séparaient de Jésus, Pierre lui dit : «Maître, qu'il nous est bon d'être ici! dressons trois tentes, une pour toi, une pour Moïse, une pour Élie!» Il ne savait ce qu'il disait.
[9:34] Pendant qu'il parlait, survint une nuée qui les enveloppa. Les disciples furent frappés de terreur quand ils les virent entrer dans la nuée.
[9:35] Or, de cette nuée sortit une voix disant : «Celui-ci est mon Fils, l'élu, écoutez-le!»
[9:36] Quand la voix se tut, Jésus se trouva seul. Ses disciples gardèrent le silence sur ce qu'ils avaient vu, et, à ce moment-là, n'en racontèrent rien à personne.
[9:37] Lorsque le lendemain ils descendirent de la montagne, une nombreuse multitude vint à la rencontre de Jésus
[9:38] et voilà que du sein de la foule un homme s'écria : «Maître, je t'en supplie, jette un regard sur mon fils ; c'est mon seul enfant ;
[9:39] et il y a un Esprit qui s'empare de lui : tout à coup il lui arrache un cri, lui donne des convulsions, le fait écumer et quand il se décide à le quitter, c'est pour le laisser tout brisé.
[9:40] J'ai prié tes disciples de le chasser, cela leur a été impossible.» —
[9:41] «Ô génération incrédule et perverse, dit Jésus en lui répondant, jusqu'à quand serai-je au milieu de vous et vous supporterai-je? Amène ici ton fils.»
[9:42] L'enfant s'approchait, quand le démon le jeta contre terre et lui donna des convulsions. Mais Jésus, menaçant l'Esprit impur, guérit l'enfant et le rendit à son père.
[9:43] Tous furent confondus de la grandeur de Dieu. Comme tout le monde s'émerveillait de tout ce que Jésus faisait, il dit à ses disciples :
[9:44] «Pour vous, mettez bien dans votre mémoire les paroles que voici : «Le Fils de l'homme va être livré entre les mains des hommes.»
[9:45] Les disciples ne comprirent pas ce langage ; il était voilé pour eux, afin qu'ils n'en sentissent pas la portée, et c'était un sujet sur lequel ils avaient peur de l'interroger.
[9:46] Entre eux une discussion s'éleva : lequel était le plus grand,
[9:47] Jésus, qui connaissait les pensées de leur coeur, prit un enfant, le plaça près de lui,
[9:48] et leur dit : «Qui reçoit en mon nom cet enfant-là, me reçoit ; et qui me reçoit, reçoit Celui qui m'a envoyé. Car celui qui est le plus petit parmi vous tous, c'est celui-là qui est grand!»
[9:49] Jean prit la parole : «Maître, dit-il, nous avons vu un homme chasser des démons en ton nom, et nous l’en avons empêché, parce qu'il ne te suit pas avec nous.» —
[9:50] «Ne l'en empêchez point! répondit Jésus ; car celui qui n'est pas contre vous est pour vous.»
[9:51] Cependant les jours où il devait être enlevé de ce monde approchaient et, d'un visage ferme, il partit pour Jérusalem,
[9:52] envoyant devant lui des messagers. Ceux-ci étant entrés, en s'en allant, dans un village de la Samarie pour lui préparer un logement,
[9:53] on refusa de le recevoir, parce que c'était vers Jérusalem qu'il tournait ses pas.
[9:54] «Seigneur, dirent les disciples présents, Jacques et Jean, veux-tu que nous disions au feu du ciel de descendre et de réduire en cendres ces gens-là!»
[9:55] Jésus se tourna vers eux et les réprimanda ;
[9:56] et ils allèrent dans un autre village.
[9:57] Pendant qu'ils étaient en chemin, quelqu'un lui dit : «Je te suivrai partout où tu iras.»
[9:58] Jésus lui répondit : «Les renards ont des tanières et les oiseaux du ciel ont des nids ; mais le Fils de l'homme n'a pas où reposer sa tête.»
[9:59] A un autre il dit : «Suis-moi.» Celui-ci lui répondit : «Permets-moi d'aller d'abord ensevelir mon père ;»
[9:60] mais Jésus reprit : «Laisse les morts ensevelir leurs morts. Pour toi, va annoncer le Règne de Dieu.»
[9:61] Un autre encore lui dit : «Je te suivrai, Seigneur ; mais permets-moi d'abord de prendre congé de ma famille.»
[9:62] A celui-là Jésus répondit : «Quiconque en posant la main sur la charrue regarde en arrière, n'est pas propre au Royaume de Dieu.»
[10:1] Le Seigneur, après cela, désigna encore soixante et dix autres disciples, et il leur donna mission de le précéder deux par deux dans toute ville, dans tout endroit où lui-même devait aller.
[10:2] Il leur disait : «La moisson est grande et les ouvriers en petit nombre ; priez donc le maître de la moisson d'envoyer des ouvriers dans sa moisson.»
[10:3] «Allez ; voici que je vous envoie comme des agneaux au milieu de loups.»
[10:4] «N'emportez ni bourse, ni sac, ni chaussures, et en chemin ne saluez personne.
[10:5] Dans toute maison où vous entrerez que votre première parole soit : «Paix à cette maison!»
[10:6] Et s'il s'y trouve quelque enfant de paix, sur lui reposera votre paix ; sinon elle reviendra à vous.
[10:7] Demeurez dans cette maison-là, mangeant et buvant ce qui s'y trouvera, car l'ouvrier est digne de son salaire.» «Ne pérégrinez pas de maison en maison.»
[10:8] «Dans toute ville où vous entrerez, et où l'on vous recevra, mangez ce qui vous sera offert ;
[10:9] guérissez les malades qui sont dans la ville, et dites-leur : «Le Règne de Dieu s'est approché de vous.»
[10:10] Dans toute ville où vous entrerez et où l'on ne vous recevra pas, sortez sur les places publiques et dites :
[10:11] «La poussière même de votre ville qui s'est attachée à nos pieds, nous la secouons pour vous la rendre ; sachez cependant ceci : «Le Règne de Dieu approche!»
[10:12] Je vous déclare qu'en ce jour-là! il y aura moins de rigueur pour Sodome que pour cette ville-là.
[10:13] Malheur à toi Chorazein, malheur à toi Bethsaïda, car, si les miracles faits au milieu de vous l'avaient été dans Tyr et dans Sidon, elles se seraient depuis longtemps repenties en se revêtant d'un sac et assises dans la cendre.
[10:14] Aussi y aura-t-il au jugement moins de rigueur pour Tyr et pour Sidon que pour vous.
[10:15] Et toi, Capharnaüm, crois-tu que tu seras élevée jusqu'au ciel? Tu seras abaissée jusqu'à la Demeure-des-morts.»
[10:16] «Qui vous écoute, m'écoute ; qui vous méprise, me méprise ; or qui me méprise, méprise Celui qui m'a envoyé.»
[10:17] Les soixante-dix revinrent pleins de joie ; ils disaient: «Seigneur, les démons mêmes se soumettent à nous en ton nom.»
[10:18] Il leur répondit : «Je voyais Satan tomber du ciel comme un éclair !
[10:19] Oui, je vous ai donné la puissance de fouler aux pieds et des serpents et des scorpions et toutes les forces de l'Ennemi, et aucun mal ne vous arrivera.
[10:20] Toutefois ne vous réjouissez pas de ce que les Esprits vous sont soumis ; réjouissez-vous de ce que vos noms sont écrits dans les cieux !»
[10:21] En ce moment même, il dit dans un transport de joie venu de l’Esprit saint : «Je te bénis, ô Père, ô Seigneur du ciel et de la terre, de ce que tu as caché ces choses à des sages et à des savants, et de ce que tu les as révélées à de petits enfants. Oui, Père, je te bénis de ce que tel a été ton bon plaisir.
[10:22] Tout m'a été confié par mon Père, et personne ne sait qui est le Fils excepté le Père, et qui est le Père excepté le Fils et celui à qui il plaît au Fils de le révéler.»
[10:23] Puis, se tournant vers les disciples, il leur dit en particulier: «Heureux les yeux qui voient ce que vous voyez!
[10:24] Je vous déclare, en effet, que nombre de prophètes et de rois ont voulu voir ce que vous, vous voyez, et ne l'ont pas vu, entendre ce que vous entendez, et ne l'ont pas entendu.»
[10:25] Voulant le mettre à l'épreuve, un légiste se leva et lui dit: «Maître, que dois-je faire pour acquérir la vie éternelle?» —
[10:26] «Qu'y a-t-il d'écrit dans la Loi? lui demanda Jésus ; qu'est-ce que tu y lis?»
[10:27] Le légiste lui fit cette réponse : «Tu aimeras le Seigneur ton Dieu de tout ton coeur, de toute ton âme, de toute ta force, de toute ta pensée et ton prochain comme toi-même.» —
[10:28] «Parfaitement répondu! dit Jésus ; fais cela et tu vivras.»
[10:29] Mais le légiste, voulant se justifier lui-même, dit à Jésus : «Qui donc est «mon prochain?» ;
[10:30] Jésus reprit alors : «Un homme descendait de Jérusalem à Jéricho ; il tomba entre les mains de brigands qui le dépouillèrent et partirent, le laissant couvert de blessures et à moitié mort.
[10:31] Or un prêtre descendait, par hasard, par la même route ; il vit l'homme, et il passa outre.
[10:32] Un Lévite fit de même ; arrivé à l'endroit, il vit, et il passa outre.
[10:33] Mais un certain Samaritain, qui était en voyage, arriva près de l'homme et fut, en le voyant, touché de compassion ;
[10:34] il s'approcha de lui, il banda ses plaies après y avoir versé de l'huile et du vin, puis il le plaça sur sa propre monture, l'amena dans une hôtellerie, et lui donna des soins.
[10:35] Le lendemain, il tira deux deniers, les remit à l'hôtelier et lui dit : «Tu prendras soin de cet homme ; et ce que tu dépenseras de plus, moi-même, à mon retour, je te le rembourserai.»
[10:36] Lequel de ces trois te paraît avoir été le prochain de celui qui était tombé entre les mains des brigands?» —
[10:37] «C'est celui qui a été compatissant envers lui», répondit le Légiste. Jésus lui dit alors : «Va et agis de même, toi aussi.»
[10:38] Dans un village où Jésus entra pendant qu'ils étaient en route, ce fut une femme nommée Marthe qui le reçut dans sa maison.
[10:39] Elle avait une soeur appelée Marie, qui, assise aux pieds du Seigneur, écoutait sa parole.
[10:40] Marthe cependant était absorbée par toutes sorte de soins ; elle s'arrêta pour dire : «Seigneur, n'as-tu aucun souci de ce que ma soeur m'a laissée servir toute seule? dis-lui donc de m'aider.»
[10:41] Mais le Seigneur lui fit cette réponse : «Marthe, Marthe, tu t'inquiètes, tu te troubles pour une multitude de choses ;
[10:42] une seule chose est nécessaire. Marie a choisi la bonne part qui ne lui sera point ôtée.»
[11:1] Quelque part, un jour, Jésus était en prière. Quand il eut fini, l'un de ses disciples lui dit : «Seigneur, enseigne-nous à prier, de même que Jean l'a enseigné à ses disciples.»
[11:2] Il leur répondit : «Quand vous priez, dites : «Père, que ton nom soit sanctifié!» «Que ton Règne vienne!»
[11:3] «Donne-nous chaque jour notre pain quotidien !»
[11:4] «Et remets-nous nos péchés, car nous-mêmes nous faisons remise à quiconque nous doit.» «Et ne nous induis pas en tentation.»
[11:5] Il leur dit encore : «Je suppose que l'un de vous ait un ami et qu'au milieu de la nuit il aille le trouver pour lui dire : «Ami, prête-moi trois pains,
[11:6] car voilà un de mes amis qui m'arrive de voyage, et je n'ai rien à lui offrir.»
[11:7] De l'intérieur, l'autre lui répond : «Ne m'importune pas, ma porte est déjà fermée, mes enfants sont couchés comme moi ; je ne puis me lever pour te donner quoi que ce soit.»
[11:8] Eh bien, je vous le déclare, — quand même il ne se lèverait ni ne lui donnerait rien en tant qu'ami, — il se lèvera du moins à cause de son insistance importune, et lui donnera ce dont il a besoin.
[11:9] Et moi aussi je vous dis : Demandez et il vous sera donné ; cherchez et vous trouverez ; frappez et il vous sera ouvert ;
[11:10] car quiconque demande reçoit ; et qui cherche trouve ; et à celui qui frappe on ouvrira.
[11:11] Est-il un père parmi vous, quand son fils lui demandera du pain, qui lui donnera une pierre! ou du poisson et qui, au lieu de poisson, lui donnera un serpent !
[11:12] Quand son fils lui demandera un oeuf, lui donnera-t-il un scorpion!
[11:13] Si donc, tout mauvais que vous êtes, vous savez donner de bonnes choses à vos enfants, combien plus votre Père, qui donne du ciel, donnera-t-il l'Esprit saint à ceux qui le lui demandent!»
[11:14] Un jour il chassait un démon, un démon muet. Il arriva que le démon étant sorti, l'homme muet parla ; et les multitudes étaient dans l'admiration.
[11:15] Cependant quelques-uns des assistants dirent : «C'est par Béelzeboul, le prince des démons, qu'il chasse les démons.»
[11:16] D'autres, pour le mettre à l'épreuve, lui demandèrent un signe qui vînt du ciel.
[11:17] Mais Jésus, connaissant leurs pensées, leur dit: «Tout royaume divisé contre lui-même tombe en ruines, et ses maisons s'écroulent l'une sur l'autre.
[11:18] Si donc Satan est divisé contre lui-même, comment son royaume subsistera-t-il? Vous dites que c'est par Beelzéboul que je chasse les démons :
[11:19] mais si, moi, je chasse les démons par Beelzeboul, par qui vos fils les chassent-ils? C'est pourquoi ils seront eux-mêmes vos juges!
[11:20] Si, au contraire, c'est par le doigt de Dieu que je chasse les démons, le Royaume de Dieu est donc venu jusqu'à vous.»
[11:21] «Lorsque le guerrier, armes en main, garde l'entrée de sa demeure, ce qu'il possède est en sûreté.
[11:22] Mais s'il survient un guerrier, supérieur en forces, qui le terrasse, il lui arrache cette armure dans laquelle il se confiait, et il jette çà et là ses dépouilles.»
[11:23] «Qui n'est point avec moi est contre moi, et qui n'amasse point avec moi, disperse.»
[11:24] Lorsque l'Esprit impur est sorti d'un homme, il erre par des lieux arides, cherchant du repos et n'en trouvant pas, il dit : «Je retournerai dans ma maison, d'où je suis parti.
[11:25] Il y revient et la trouve nettoyée et parée.
[11:26] Là-dessus il va prendre sept autres Esprits plus méchants que lui-même ; ils y pénètrent et y demeurent. Et le dernier état de cet homme devient pire que le premier.»
[11:27] Pendant qu'il parlait ainsi, du milieu de la foule, une femme éleva la voix : «Heureuses, dit-elle, les entrailles qui te portèrent, heureux le sein qui t'allaita!»
[11:28] Mais lui, il dit : «Heureux plutôt ceux qui écoutent la Parole de Dieu et qui la gardent!»
[11:29] Comme le peuple s'amassait en foule, il se mit à dire : «Cette génération est une mauvaise génération! elle demande un signe et nul signe ne lui sera donné, sinon le signe de Jonas.»
[11:30] «De même, en effet, que Jonas devint un signe pour les Ninivites, de même, pour cette génération-ci, en sera-t-il du Fils de l'homme.
[11:31] Lors du jugement, la reine du Midi se lèvera, avec les hommes de cette génération, et les condamnera, car cette reine vint des extrémités de la terre pour écouter la sagesse de Salomon ; et voici, sous vos yeux, plus que Salomon!
[11:32] Lors du jugement les hommes de Ninive se lèveront avec cette génération et la condamneront ; car eux, ils se repentirent à la prédication de Jonas ; et voici, sous vos yeux, plus que Jonas!»
[11:33] «Personne n'allume une lampe pour la cacher ou la mettre sous le boisseau, mais on la met sur le pied-de-lampe, afin que ceux qui entrent voient la lumière.
[11:34] «La lampe de ton corps, c'est ton oeil. Quand ton oeil n'a rien qui le trouble, ton corps entier est dans la lumière ; si ton oeil est en mauvais état, ton corps est dans les ténèbres.
[11:35] Veille en conséquence à ce que la lumière qui est en toi ne soit point ténèbres.
[11:36] Et si ton corps entier est dans la lumière, sans aucune partie dans les ténèbres, tout sera, pour toi, dans la lumière, comme lorsque rayonne sur toi la clarté d'une lampe.»
[11:37] Il parlait encore lorsqu'un Pharisien le pria de venir manger chez lui ; il entra et se mit à table.
[11:38] Le Pharisien remarqua avec surprise qu'il n'avait pratiqué aucune ablution avant le repas.
[11:39] Le Seigneur lui dit alors : «Aujourd'hui, vous autres Pharisiens, vous purifiez le dehors de la coupe et du plat, quand le dedans intime de vous-mêmes est plein de rapines et d'iniquités!
[11:40] Insensés! est-ce que celui qui a fait le dehors n'a pas fait aussi le dedans?
[11:41] Donnez plutôt en aumônes le contenu des coupes et des plats ; et aussitôt tout vous sera pur.»
[11:42] «Mais malheur à vous, les Pharisiens, parce que vous acquittez la dîme et de la menthe, et de la rue, et de toute espèce de légumes, et que vous négligez la justice et l'amour de Dieu. Ce qu'il fallait, c'est faire ces choses, sans omettre les autres !»
[11:43] «Malheur à vous, les Pharisiens, parce que vous aimez, dans les synagogues les premiers sièges, sur les places publiques les salutations!»
[11:44] «Malheur à vous, parce que vous êtes comme les sépulcres dissimulés aux regards, et sur lesquels on marche sans le savoir!»
[11:45] Là-dessus, un des légistes lui dit : «Maître, en parlant ainsi, tu nous fais injure à nous aussi.»
[11:46] Jésus reprit alors : «A vous aussi, les légistes, malheur! parce que vous chargez les hommes de fardeaux insupportables, et vous-mêmes vous ne touchez pas ces fardeaux du bout du doigt!»
[11:47] «Malheur à vous, parce que vous élevez des tombeaux aux prophètes que vos pères ont tués ;
[11:48] donc, vous êtes témoins, et vous approuvez les oeuvres de vos pères : eux, ils ont commis les meurtres, vous, vous élevez les tombeaux.
[11:49] Voilà aussi pourquoi la sagesse de Dieu a dit : Je leur enverrai prophètes et apôtres ; les uns ils les tueront, les autres ils les persécuteront,
[11:50] afin qu'à cette génération il soit demandé compte du sang de tous les prophètes, répandu depuis la création du monde,
[11:51] à partir du sang d'Abel jusqu'au sang de Zaccharie égorgé entre l'autel et le sanctuaire ; oui, je vous le déclare, c'est à cette génération qu’il en sera demandé compte.
[11:52] Malheur à vous, les légistes, parce que vous avez pris la clef de la science! Vous-mêmes vous n'êtes pas entrés, et ceux qui venaient pour entrer, vous les en avez empêchés!»
[11:53] Quand il fut sorti de là, les Scribes et les Pharisiens entreprirent de le harceler de toutes leurs forces, de le faire parler sur toutes sortes de sujets,
[11:54] en lui tendant des pièges et en cherchant à surprendre quelqu'une de ses paroles.
[12:1] Il se rassembla, cependant, une si énorme quantité de monde, qu'on se foulait les uns les autres. Il se mit alors à dire à ses disciples : «Avant tout gardez-vous du levain des Pharisiens qui est l'hypocrisie.
[12:2] Il n'y a rien de caché qui ne doive être révélé, ni de secret qui ne doive être connu.
[12:3] Aussi, tout ce que vous aurez dit dans les ténèbres sera répété dans la lumière, et ce que vous aurez dit à l'oreille en chambres closes sera prêché sur les toits!.»
[12:4] «Et alors je vous dis ceci, à vous, mes amis : «Ne craignez pas ceux qui tuent le corps, et qui, après cela, ne peuvent rien faire de plus.
[12:5] Je vais vous dire qui vous devez craindre : Vous devez craindre celui qui, après avoir envoyé la mort, a le pouvoir de jeter dans la Géhenne ; oui, je vous le déclare, c'est celui-là que vous devez craindre.»
[12:6] «Cinq passereaux ne se vendent-ils pas deux as? Et il n'en est pas un seul qui soit oublié devant Dieu!
[12:7] Jusqu'aux cheveux de votre tête, tous ils sont comptés! Ne craignez point ; vous, êtes de plus de valeur que bien des passereaux.»
[12:8] «Quiconque, je vous le déclare, me confessera devant les hommes, le Fils de l'homme le confessera aussi devant les anges de Dieu.
[12:9] Qui m'aura renié devant les hommes, sera renié devant les anges de Dieu.
[12:10] A quiconque prononcera un mot contre le Fils de l'homme, il sera pardonné ; mais à celui qui blasphémera contre le Saint-Esprit, il ne sera pas pardonné.»
[12:11] «Quand on vous traînera dans les synagogues, devant les magistrats, devant les autorités, ne vous inquiétez nullement ni de ce que vous direz pour votre défense ni comment vous parlerez.
[12:12] Car le saint Esprit vous enseignera, à l'heure même, ce qu'il faudra que vous disiez.»
[12:13] «Maître, lui dit quelqu'un de la foule, dis à mon frère de partager avec moi notre héritage.»
[12:14] Il lui répondit : «Qui m'a constitué juge entre vous, ou faiseur de partages?»
[12:15] Puis il s'adressa aux autres : «Soyez bien attentifs à vous garder de toute avarice, car, en quelque abondance qu'on soit, la vie ne dépend pas de ce qu'on possède.»
[12:16] Puis il leur raconta une parabole : «Le champ d'un homme riche avait beaucoup rapporté ;
[12:17] et il songeait en lui-même : Que ferai-je? car je n'ai pas où serrer ma récolte.
[12:18] Ce que je ferai, dit-il, le voici : J'abattrai mes greniers ; j'en construirai de plus grands ; et j'y ramasserai tous mes produits et tous mes biens.»
[12:19] Et puis je dirai à mon âme : «Mon âme, tu as là en réserve beaucoup de biens, pour beaucoup d'années ; repose-toi, mange, bois et te réjouis!»
[12:20] Mais Dieu lui dit : «Insensé! c'est cette nuit-ci que ton âme te sera redemandée. Et ce que tu t'es préparé, à qui sera-t-il?
[12:21] Ainsi en sera-t-il de celui qui thésaurise pour lui-même et qui n'est pas riche pour Dieu.»
[12:22] Voilà pourquoi, ajouta-t-il, s'adressant à ses disciples, je vous dis de ne pas vous inquiéter : — pour votre vie de ce que vous mangerez, — pour votre corps de quoi vous vous vêtirez.
[12:23] La vie est plus que la nourriture, et le corps plus que le vêtement.
[12:24] Observez les corbeaux ; ils ne sèment, ni ne moissonnent ;ils n'ont ni cellier, ni grenier ; et Dieu les nourrit. Combien ne valez-vous pas plus que les oiseaux?
[12:25] Qui de vous peut, par toutes ses préoccupations, ajouter une coudée à la durée de sa vie?
[12:26] Si donc vous ne pouvez même les moindres choses, pourquoi vous inquiéter des autres.
[12:27] Observez comment croissent les lis ; ils ne travaillent ni ne filent. Cependant, je vous le déclare, Salomon lui-même dans toute sa gloire n'était pas vêtu comme l'un d'eux.
[12:28] Si donc, dans un champ, l'herbe qui existe aujourd'hui et qui demain sera jetée au four, Dieu la revêt de la sorte, combien plutôt vous-mêmes, gens de petite foi !»
[12:29] «Ne vous préoccupez donc pas de ce que vous aurez à manger, ou de ce que vous aurez à boire, et ne vous en tourmentez pas l'esprit.
[12:30] Oui, tout cela les païens du monde s'en enquièrent ; mais, vous, votre Père sait que vous en avez besoin.
[12:31] Cherchez seulement son Royaume et ces choses vous seront données par surcroît.»
[12:32] Ne crains point, petit troupeau ; car il a plu à votre Père de vous donner le Royaume.
[12:33] Vendez ce que vous possédez et le donnez en aumônes. Faites-vous des bourses inusables ; faites-vous un trésor qui ne vous fasse point défaut dans les cieux, dont le voleur n'approche pas, que le ver ne détruise pas.
[12:34] Car là où est votre trésor, là sera aussi votre coeur.»
[12:35] «Que vos reins soient ceints et vos lampes allumées.
[12:36] Que vous soyez semblables à des hommes qui attendent leur maître revenant du festin de noce, afin de lui ouvrir aussitôt qu'il arrivera et dès qu'il frappera.
[12:37] Heureux ces serviteurs que le maître, en arrivant, trouvera veillant de la sorte ; je vous le dis en vérité, c'est lui qui se ceindra, qui les fera asseoir à table et qui, passant de l'un à l'autre, se mettra à les servir.
[12:38] Qu'il rentre à la seconde veille, qu'il rentre à la troisième, heureux seront ces serviteurs, s'il les trouve veillant ainsi!»
[12:39] Sachez ceci : Si le maître de la maison savait à quelle heure doit venir le voleur, il veillerait et ne laisserait pas forcer sa maison.
[12:40] Vous aussi, soyez prêts, parce que c'est à une heure où vous n'y penserez pas que le Fils de l'homme viendra.»
[12:41] Pierre lui demanda : «Est-ce pour nous, Seigneur, que tu dis cette parabole ou également pour tout le monde ?»
[12:42] Le Seigneur lui répondit : «Quel est l'administrateur. fidèle et prudent que le maître établira sur ses domestiques pour donner à chacun, au moment voulu, sa mesure de froment?
[12:43] C'est celui que le maître, à son arrivée, trouvera agissant ainsi ; heureux ce serviteur !
[12:44] En vérité, je vous le dis, le maître l'établira sur tous ses biens.
[12:45] Mais si ce serviteur dit en son coeur : «Mon maître tarde à venir», et qu'il se mette à battre valets et servantes, à manger et à boire, et à s'enivrer,
[12:46] son maître surviendra au jour où ce Serviteur ne s'y attend pas et à une heure qu'il ignore et il le déchirera à coups de verge, et lui donnera le même lot qu'aux infidèles.
[12:47] Ce serviteur qui connaissait la volonté de son maître et n'a rien préparé ni agi selon sa volonté, recevra plusieurs coups.
[12:48] Quant à celui qui n'a pas connu cette volonté et a fait des choses qui méritent des coups, il en recevra peu. A quiconque beaucoup a été donné, beaucoup sera demandé ; et de celui à qui on a beaucoup confié, il sera exigé davantage.»
[12:49] «Je suis venu mettre le feu sur la terre! Ah! que je voudrais qu’il fût déjà allumé!
[12:50] Il est un baptême dont je dois être baptisé, et dans quelle angoisse je suis jusqu'à ce qu'il soit accompli !
[12:51] Croyez-vous que je sois venu donner la paix à la terre? Non, vous dis-je, c'est la division.
[12:52] Car, désormais, cinq personnes étant dans une maison, elles seront partagées : trois contre deux et deux contre trois.
[12:53] Seront divisés : un père contre son fils et un fils contre son père ; une mère contre sa fille et une fille contre sa mère ; une belle-mère contre sa belle-fille et une belle-fille contre sa belle-mère.»
[12:54] Il disait aussi aux multitudes : «Lorsque vous voyez, au couchant, un nuage apparaître, vous dites aussitôt : la pluie arrive, et elle arrive en effet.
[12:55] Lorsque c'est le vent du midi qui souffle, vous dites : il fera chaud ; et il en est ainsi.
[12:56] Hypocrites, vous savez apprécier l'aspect de la terre et du ciel, comment ne savez? vous pas apprécier aussi le temps où vous êtes,
[12:57] et pourquoi ne jugez-vous pas aussi par vous-mêmes de ce qui est juste?»
[12:58] «Pendant que tu vas devant un magistrat avec ton adversaire, tâche, en chemin, de sortir d'affaire avec lui, de peur qu'il ne te traîne devant le juge, et que le juge ne te livre au réclamateur, et que le réclamateur ne te jette en prison.
[12:59] Tu n'en sortiras pas, je te le déclare, que tu n'aies payé jusqu'à la dernière obole.»
[13:1] Vers cette même époque, quelques-uns vinrent lui raconter ce qui s'était passé au sujet des Galiléens dont Pilate avait mêlé le sang à celui de leurs sacrifices.
[13:2] Voici ce qu'il leur répondit : «Croyez-vous que ces Galiléens fussent de plus grands pécheurs que tous leurs compatriotes, parce qu'il leur est arrivé ce malheur?
[13:3] Non, je vous le déclare ; mais si vous ne vous repentez pas, vous périrez tous semblablement.
[13:4] Comme ces dix-huit personnes sur qui s'écroula la tour près du Siloam, et qui furent tuées, croyez-vous que leur dette dépassât celle de tous les autres habitants de Jérusalem ?
[13:5] non, je vous le déclare, mais si vous ne vous repentez pas, vous périrez tous pareillement.»
[13:6] Il leur raconta cette parabole : «Un homme avait un figuier planté dans sa vigne ; il vint y chercher du fruit, mais n'en trouva point.
[13:7] Voilà trois ans, dit-il alors au vigneron, que je, viens chercher du fruit sur ce figuier, et que je n'en trouve point ; coupe-le ; pourquoi épuise-t-il la terre inutilement?» —
[13:8] «Seigneur, lui répondit le vigneron, laisse-le encore cette année ; je bêcherai tout autour, je mettrai du fumier ;
[13:9] peut-être portera-t-il du fruit dans l'avenir ; sinon, tu le couperas.»
[13:10] Un jour de sabbat, il enseignait dans une des synagogues.
[13:11] Une femme était là, possédée d'un Esprit qui la tenait infirme depuis dix-huit ans. Elle était toute courbée, et ne pouvait absolument pas se redresser.
[13:12] Quand Jésus la vit, il l'appela et lui dit : «Femme, tu es délivrée de ton infirmité», et il lui imposa les mains.
[13:13] Immédiatement elle redevint droite. Cette femme rendait gloire à Dieu,
[13:14] lorsque le chef de la synagogue se mit à parler avec indignation de ce que Jésus guérissait pendant le sabbat. Il y a six jours pendant lesquels on doit travailler, disait-il à la foule : «Venez, ces jours-là, vous faire guérir ; mais le jour du sabbat, non point.» —
[13:15] «Hypocrites, dit le Seigneur en lui répondant, est-ce que chacun de vous, le jour du sabbat, ne détache pas du râtelier son boeuf ou son âne pour les mener boire?
[13:16] Et cette femme, qui est une fille d'Abraham, que, depuis dix-huit années, Satan tenait garrottée, ne fallait-il pas, le jour du sabbat, la délivrer de sa chaîne?»
[13:17] Ces paroles couvrirent de confusion tous ses adversaires. Quant à la foule, elle était dans la joie de toutes les choses glorieuses qu'il accomplissait.
[13:18] Alors il disait : «A quoi est semblable le Royaume de Dieu, et à quoi le comparerai-je ?
[13:19] Il est semblable à un grain de sénevé qu'un homme a pris et a jeté dans son jardin ; il a crû, il est devenu un arbre et les oiseaux du ciel ont fait leurs nids dans ses branches.»
[13:20] Il dit encore: «A quoi comparerai-je le Royaume de Dieu?
[13:21] Il est semblable à du levain qu'une femme prend, et qu'elle cache dans trois mesures de farine, jusqu'à ce que le levain ait partout pénétré.»
[13:22] Il traversait villes et villages en enseignant, et s'avançait vers Jérusalem.
[13:23] Quelqu'un lui dit : «Seigneur, sera-ce un petit nombre seulement qui sera sauvé?» Il répondit à lui et aux autres :
[13:24] «Efforcez-vous d'entrer par la porte étroite, car beaucoup, je vous le déclare, chercheront à entrer et n'y parviendront pas.
[13:25] Quand le maître de maison se sera levé et aura fermé la porte, quand vous, restés dehors, vous vous mettrez à frapper et à dire : «Seigneur, ouvre-nous», quand il vous répondra : «Je ne sais d'où vous êtes»,
[13:26] alors vous vous mettrez à dire: «Nous avons mangé et bu devant toi, et c'est sur nos places publiques que tu as enseigné.»
[13:27] Et il dira : «Je vous déclare que je ne sais d'où vous êtes : Éloignez-vous de moi, vous tous, ouvriers d'iniquité.»
[13:28] «C'est là que seront les pleurs et le grincement des dents, alors que vous verrez dans le Royaume de Dieu et Abraham, et Isaac, et Jacob, et tous les prophètes, et que, vous-mêmes, vous vous verrez chassés dehors.
[13:29] De l'Orient, de l'Occident, du Nord, du Midi, on viendra et on se mettra à table dans le Royaume de Dieu.
[13:30] Et il se trouvera des derniers qui seront premiers, et il se trouvera des premiers qui seront derniers.»
[13:31] A ce moment-là quelques Pharisiens vinrent lui dire : «Éloigne-toi, pars d'ici, Hérode veut te mettre à mort.»
[13:32] Il leur répondit : «Allez dire à ce renard, qu'aujourd'hui et demain je chasserai des démons et guérirai des malades, et que le troisième jour tout pour moi se terminera.
[13:33] Mais il faut qu'aujourd'hui, demain et le jour suivant je sois en marche, car il n'est pas admissible qu'un prophète périsse hors de Jérusalem.»
[13:34] «Jérusalem! Jérusalem! qui tues les prophètes et qui lapides ceux qui te sont envoyés, combien de fois ai-je voulu rassembler tes enfants comme la poule rassemble sa couvée sous ses ailes, et tu ne l'as pas voulu !
[13:35] Eh bien, votre demeure vous est laissée! Je vous déclare que vous ne me verrez pas jusqu'à ce qu'il arrive que vous disiez : «Béni soit celui qui vient au nom du Seigneur !»
[14:1] Jésus était entré dans la maison d'un des principaux Pharisiens, pour y prendre un repas ; c'était un jour de sabbat. Aussi chacun l'observait-il,
[14:2] car il y avait là, devant lui, un homme hydropique.
[14:3] Jésus s'adressa aux légistes et aux Pharisiens. «Est-il permis, oui ou non, de guérir le jour du sabbat?» leur demanda-t-il. Ils gardèrent le silence.
[14:4] Alors il toucha de la main l'hydropique, le guérit et le congédia.
[14:5] Puis, s'adressant toujours à eux, il dit : «Lequel d'entre vous, si son fils ou son boeuf vient à tomber dans un puits, un jour de sabbat, ne l'en retire aussitôt?»
[14:6] A cela ils ne surent que répondre.
[14:7] Ayant remarqué que les convives choisissaient les premières places, il leur raconta une parabole :
[14:8] «Quand tu seras invité par quelqu'un à des noces, dit-il, ne va pas t'installer à la première place, de peur qu'un personnage plus considérable que toi, se trouvant parmi les invités,
[14:9] celui qui vous a conviés l'un et l'autre ne vienne te dire : «Donne-lui ta place» et que tu n'aies alors la confusion d'aller occuper la dernière place.
[14:10] Tout au contraire, quand tu seras invité, va te mettre à la dernière place, et alors, quand arrivera celui qui t'a invité, il te dira : «Mon ami, monte plus haut.» Ce sera pour toi un honneur devant tous les convives ;
[14:11] car quiconque s'élève lui-même sera abaissé, et quiconque s'abaisse lui-même sera élevé.»
[14:12] Il disait aussi à son hôte : «Quand tu donnes à déjeuner ou à dîner, ne convoque ni tes amis, ni tes frères, ni tes parents, ni tes riches voisins, de crainte qu'ils ne t'invitent à leur tour et ne te rendent ce qu'ils auront reçu de toi.
[14:13] Tout au contraire, quand tu fais un festin, appelles-y des pauvres, des infirmes, des estropiés, des aveugles.
[14:14] Heureux seras-tu, parce qu'ils n'ont pas de quoi te rendre ce festin ; et il te sera rendu à la résurrection des justes.»
[14:15] A ces mots, un des convives lui dit : «Heureux qui sera du banquet dans le Royaume de Dieu!» —
[14:16] «Un homme, lui dit Jésus, donna un grand dîner, et y convia beaucoup de monde.
[14:17] A l'heure du repas, il envoya son serviteur dire aux invités: «Venez, parce que tout est prêt.»
[14:18] Mais tous, comme de concert, commencèrent à s'excuser.
[14:19] «J'ai acheté un champ, dit le premier, il est de toute nécessité que j'aille le voir. Je t'en prie, tiens-moi pour excusé.» — «J'ai acheté cinq paires de boeufs, dit un autre, et je vais les essayer. Je t'en prie, tiens-moi pour excusé.» —
[14:20] «J'ai pris femme, dit un autre encore, donc je ne puis venir.»
[14:21] Le serviteur revint et raconta cela à son maître. Se mettant en colère, le maître de maison dit alors à son serviteur: «Parcours à la hâte les places publiques et les rues de la ville, et amène ici les pauvres, les infirmes, les aveugles, les estropiés.»
[14:22] Quand le serviteur lui dit : «Seigneur, on a fait ce que tu as ordonné», et il y a encore de la place,
[14:23] le maître lui répondit : «Va dans les chemins et le long des haies et contrains les gens d'entrer, afin que ma maison soit pleine.
[14:24] Je vous le déclare, en effet, aucun de ces hommes qui étaient «les invités» ne prendra part à mon festin.»
[14:25] Il était suivi de foules immenses ; il se tourna vers elles et leur dit :
[14:26] «Si quelqu'un vient à moi et ne hait pas et son père et sa mère, et sa femme et ses enfants, et ses frères et ses soeurs, plus encore : sa propre vie, il ne peut être mon disciple.»
[14:27] «Celui qui ne porte pas sa croix, et ne marche pas à ma suite, ne peut être mon disciple.»
[14:28] «Quel est celui d'entre vous qui, voulant bâtir une tour, ne réfléchisse d'abord, ne calcule la dépense, ne voie s'il a de quoi l'achever?
[14:29] Il craindrait, après avoir jeté les fondements, de ne pouvoir achever. Tous ceux qui verraient cela se moqueraient de lui.
[14:30] «Le voilà, diraient-ils, l'homme qui a commencé à bâtir et quia été dans l'impossibilité d'achever !»
[14:31] «Quel est encore le roi, sur le point de faire la guerre à un autre roi, qui ne réfléchisse d'abord, qui n'examine s'il est capable, avec dix mille hommes, de marcher à la rencontre de celui qui s'avance sur lui avec vingt mille?
[14:32] S'il en est incapable, alors que l'ennemi est encore loin, il lui envoie une ambassade avec des propositions de paix.»
[14:33] «Ainsi donc, quiconque ne renonce pas à tout ce qu'il possède ne peut être mon disciple.»
[14:34] «Le sel est bon ; mais si le sel s'affadit, avec quoi lui rendra-t-on sa saveur ?
[14:35] Il n'est plus propre à rien, ni pour la terre, ni pour le fumier. On le jette dehors. Que celui qui a des oreilles pour entendre, entende.»
[15:1] Les publicains et les pécheurs s'approchaient tous de lui pour l'entendre.
[15:2] Les Pharisiens et les Scribes en murmuraient : «Cet homme, disaient-ils, fait accueil à des pécheurs, et mange avec eux.»
[15:3] Alors il leur répondit par cette parabole:
[15:4] «Si l'un de vous a cent brebis et qu'il en égare une, ne laisse-t-il pas dans le déserta les quatre-vingt-dix-neuf autres, pour aller chercher celle qui s'est égarée, jusqu'à ce qu'il l'ait retrouvée?
[15:5] Et quand il l'a retrouvée, il la met, tout joyeux, sur ses épaules ;
[15:6] et s'en allant en sa maison, il appelle ses amis et ses voisins et leur dit : «Réjouissez-vous avec moi, car j'ai retrouvé ma brebis perdue.»
[15:7] C'est ainsi, je vous le déclare, qu'il y aura de la joie dans le ciel ; il y en aura davantage pour un seul pécheur repentant que pour quatre-vingt-dix-neuf justes qui n'ont pas besoin de repentance.»
[15:8] «Soit encore une femme qui possède dix drachmes. Si elle en perd une, est-ce qu'elle n'allume pas une lampe, ne balaye pas la maison, ne la cherche pas soigneusement jusqu'à ce qu'elle l'ait retrouvée?
[15:9] Et quand elle l'a retrouvée, elle appelle ses amies et ses voisines et leur dit: «Réjouissez-vous avec moi, car j'ai retrouvé la drachme que j'avais perdue.»
[15:10] C'est ainsi, je vous le déclare, qu'il y a de la joie en présence des anges de Dieu pour un seul pécheur repentant.»
[15:11] Il dit encore : «Un homme avait deux fils ;
[15:12] le plus jeune dit à son père : «Père, donne-moi la part de fortune qui me revient.» Et le père leur partagea son bien.»
[15:13] Peu de jours après, le plus jeune fils, rassemblant tout ce qu'il avait, partit pour un pays lointain, et là il dissipa sa fortune dans une vie de débauche.
[15:14] Il avait tout dépensé quand survint, en ce pays-là, une très rude famine. Il commença à être dans l'indigence,
[15:15] et il alla se mettre au service de l'un des habitants du pays, qui l'envoya dans ses champs pour paître des pourceaux.
[15:16] Là, il désirait avidement se rassasier des siliques que mangeaient les pourceaux, mais personne ne lui en donnait.
[15:17] Rentrant alors en lui-même, il dit : «Combien de gens à gages ont chez mon père en abondance de quoi se nourrir, tandis que moi, ici, je meurs de faim!
[15:18] Je me lèverai et j'irai vers mon père et je lui dirai: «Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi!
[15:19] Je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils! Traite-moi comme l'un de tes mercenaires.»
[15:20] Il se leva donc et retourna vers son père. Comme il était encore loin, son père le vit ; il fut ému de compassion ; il accourut et, se laissant tomber à son cou, il le baisa longuement.
[15:21] Le fils lui dit: «Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi! je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils!»
[15:22] Mais le père dit à ses serviteurs : «Apportez vite une robe de fête, la plus belle, et l'en revêtez ! mettez un anneau à sa main! des chaussures à ses pieds!
[15:23] et puis amenez le veau gras et le tuez! Faisons festin et réjouissance !
[15:24] parce que mon fils que voici était mort, et il est revenu à la vie ! il était perdu, et il est retrouvé!» Ils commencèrent à se réjouir.»
[15:25] Or le fils aîné était dans les champs ; comme il revenait et approchait de la maison, il entendit de la musique et des danses ;
[15:26] il appela un des domestiques et lui demanda ce que c'était.
[15:27] «Ton frère est de retour, lui répondit celui-ci, et ton père a tué le veau gras, parce qu'il l'a recouvré sain et sauf.»
[15:28] Alors il se mit en colère, et ne voulut pas entrer. Son père sortit, et se mit à l'en prier ;
[15:29] mais lui, répondant à son père, lui dit : «Voilà tant et tant d'années que je te sers ; je n'ai jamais désobéi à tes ordres, et tu ne m'as jamais donné un chevreau pour faire fête avec mes amis ;
[15:30] et quand est revenu ton autre fils, qui a dévoré son bien avec des femmes de mauvaise vie, pour lui tu as tué le veau gras!»
[15:31] «Mon enfant, lui dit le père, tu es toujours avec moi, et tout ce qui est à moi est à toi ;
[15:32] mais il fallait bien faire grande fête et réjouissance, parce que ton frère que voilà était mort, et il est revenu à la vie ! il était perdu, et il est retrouvé !»
[16:1] Il disait aussi aux disciples : «Un homme riche avait un économe ; cet économe lui fut dénoncé comme dissipant ses biens.
[16:2] Il l'appela et lui dit: «Qu'est-ce que j'entends dire de toi ? Rends compte de ton administration ; car il n'est plus possible que tu administres désormais.» —
[16:3] «Que ferai-je?» se dit en lui-même l'économe, «puisque mon maître me retire la gestion de ses biens. Travailler la terre, je n'en ai pas la force ; mendier, j'en aurais honte.
[16:4] Je vois ce que je ferai pour que, destitué de mes fonctions, il se trouve des gens qui me reçoivent dans leurs maisons.»
[16:5] Il convoqua l'un après l'autre chacun des débiteurs de son maître.»«Au premier il dit : «Combien dois-tu à mon maître ?»
[16:6] «Cent mesures d'huile», — «Voici ton billet, reprit l'économe, assieds-toi vite et écris : «cinquante».
[16:7] Ensuite il dit à un autre : «Et toi, combien dois-tu?» Celui-là répondit : «Cent mesures de froment.» «Voici ton billet, reprit encore l'économe, et écris: «quatre-vingts».
[16:8] «Le maître loua l'économe infidèle de ce qu'il avait agi avec, habileté ; parce que les enfants de ce siècle sont, dans leur monde, plus avisés que les enfants de la lumière.
[16:9] Et moi, je vous dis : Du Mamôn de l'iniquité faites-vous des amis qui, lorsqu'il viendra à manquer, vous reçoivent dans les éternels tabernacles.
[16:10] Qui est fidèle dans une très petite chose, l'est également dans une grande ; qui est injuste dans une très petite chose, l'est également dans une grande.
[16:11] Si donc vous n'avez pas été fidèles dans le Mamôn injuste, qui vous confiera le véritable?
[16:12] Et si vous n'avez pas été fidèles dans le bien d'un autre, qui vous donnera ce qui est à vous ?»
[16:13] «Aucun domestique ne peut servir deux maîtres ; ou bien, en effet, il haïra l'un et aimera l'autre ; ou bien il s'attachera au premier et méprisera le second. Vous ne pouvez servir Dieu et Mamôn.»
[16:14] Les Pharisiens qui aiment l'argent entendaient tout cela et tournaient Jésus en dérision.
[16:15] «Vous, leur dit-il, vous voulez vous faire passer pour justes devant les hommes, mais Dieu connaît vos coeurs. Ce qui, d'après les hommes, est élevé, est, devant Dieu, une abomination.»
[16:16] «Jusques à Jean, la Loi et les Prophètes ; depuis, l'Évangile du Royaume de Dieu est annoncé et tous s'efforcent de s'en emparer.»
[16:17] «Plus facilement passeront le ciel et la terre que ne tombera un seul petit trait de la Loi.»
[16:18] «Quiconque répudie sa femme et en épouse une autre commet un adultère ; et celui qui épouse une femme répudiée par son mari commet un adultère.»
[16:19] «Il y avait un riche qui était vêtu de pourpre et de lin, et qui menait tous les jours joyeuse et splendide vie.
[16:20] Un pauvre nommé Lazare gisait à sa porte, couvert d'ulcères.
[16:21] Il aurait bien voulu se rassasier de ce qui tombait de la table du riche ; mais les chiens eux-mêmes venaient lécher ses ulcères.
[16:22] Or il arriva que le pauvre mourut, et qu'il fut transporté par les anges dans le sein d'Abraham. Le riche mourut aussi, et fut enseveli.
[16:23] Étant dans la Demeure-des-morts, et en proie aux tourments, il leva les yeux ; il vit de loin Abraham et, dans son sein, Lazare.
[16:24] Alors il éleva la voix ; il dit : «Père Abraham, aie pitié de moi ; et envoie Lazare tremper dans l'eau le bout de son doigt pour rafraîchir ma langue, car je suis torturé dans ces flammes.»
[16:25] «Mon enfant, lui répondit Abraham, souviens-toi que, en ta vie, tu as reçu tes biens ; Lazare, dans la sienne, a eu des maux. Ici maintenant il est consolé, et toi tu es torturé.
[16:26] En outre, un abîme immense est établi entre nous et vous, de sorte qu'il serait impossible à qui le voudrait soit d'aller vers vous de là où nous sommes, soit de venir vers nous de là où vous êtes.»
[16:27] «Il reprit : «Père, envoie donc, je t'en supplie, Lazare dans la maison de mon père ;
[16:28] car j'ai cinq frères ; il leur attestera ces choses afin qu'ils ne viennent pas, eux aussi, dans ce lieu de tourments.»
[16:29] Mais Abraham lui répondit : «Ils ont «Moïse et les Prophètes» ; qu'ils les écoutent!» —
[16:30] «Non, père Abraham, continua l'autre, mais si, de chez les morts, quelqu'un va vers eux, ils se repentiront.»
[16:31] Abraham lui dit alors : «S'ils n'écoutent ni «Moïse,» ni «les Prophètes,» quand même quelqu'un ressusciterait d'entre les morts, ils ne seraient pas persuadés.»
[17:1] Il dit à ses disciples : «Qu'il n'arrive pas de scandales, la chose est impossible, mais malheur à celui par qui le scandale arrive!
[17:2] Il vaudrait mieux pour lui qu'on lui attachât au cou une meule de moulin, et qu'on le jetât à la mer, que de scandaliser un de ces petits.»
[17:3] «Prenez garde à vous : si ton frère a péché, reprends-le et s'il se repent, pardonne-lui.
[17:4] Et s'il a péché contre toi sept fois en un jour, et que sept fois en un jour, il se tourne vers toi et te dise : «Je me repens», pardonne-lui.» —
[17:5] «Augmente-nous la foi, dirent les apôtres au Seigneur,
[17:6] et le Seigneur leur répondit: «Si vous aviez de la foi gros comme un grain de sénevé, vous diriez à ce sycomore «Déracine-toi, et plante-toi dans la mer», il vous obéirait.»
[17:7] «Quand votre serviteur rentre des champs, après le labour ou le pâturage, lequel de vous lui dira : «Viens vite te mettre à table.»
[17:8] Ne lui dira-t-il pas au contraire: «Prépare-moi à dîner, ceins-toi, et me sers jusqu'à ce que j'aie mangé et bu ; après quoi,, tu mangeras et boiras toi-même.»
[17:9] Et parce que ce serviteur fait ce qui lui était commandé, son maître lui doit-il quelque reconnaissance?
[17:10] De vous, il en est de même: quand vous aurez fait tout ce qui vous est commandé, dites ceci : «Nous sommes des serviteurs inutiles ; ce que nous avons fait nous avions le devoir de le faire.»
[17:11] Dans son voyage à Jérusalem, Jésus traversa la Samarie et la Galilée.
[17:12] Comme il arrivait à l'entrée d'un village, se présentèrent à lui dix lépreux qui, restant à une certaine distance,
[17:13] élevèrent la voix : «Jésus! maître! dirent-ils, aie pitié de nous!»
[17:14] Il les vit et leur dit : «Allez vous montrer aux prêtres.» Et il arriva pendant qu'il y allaient, qu'ils furent guérie.
[17:15] L'un d'entre eux, se voyant guéri, revint sur ses pas, rendant à grands cris gloire à Dieu ;
[17:16] puis il se prosterna aux pieds de Jésus, la face contre terre, lui rendant grâces. C'était un Samaritain.
[17:17] Alors Jésus prononça ces paroles : «Est-ce que les dix n'ont pas été guéris? Les neuf autres où sont-ils?
[17:18] Il ne s'en est trouvé aucun qui soit revenu pour rendre gloire à Dieu, sinon celui-ci: un étranger!»
[17:19] Puis s'adressant à lui: «Lève-toi ; va, ta foi t'a sauvé»
[17:20] Les Pharisiens lui ayant demandé quand viendrait le Royaume de Dieu il leur répondit ainsi : «Le Royaume de Dieu ne vient pas avec des marques extérieures.
[17:21] On ne dira pas : il est ici! ou: il est là! car sachez-le : le Royaume de Dieu est au milieu de vous.»
[17:22] Puis il dit aux disciples : «Il viendra un temps où vous désirerez voir un des jours du Fils de l'homme, un seul, et vous ne le verrez pas.
[17:23] On vous dira : «Le voici!» — «le voilà!» N'y allez pas ; ne le cherchez pas.
[17:24] Tel, en effet, l'éclair resplendissant à une extrémité, du ciel brille jusqu'à l'autre, tel, en son jour, sera le Fils de l'homme.»
[17:25] «Mais il lui faut d'abord beaucoup souffrir, et être rejeté par cette génération-ci.»
[17:26] «Ainsi étaient les choses aux jours de Noé, ainsi seront-elles aux jours du Fils de l'homme.
[17:27] Les hommes mangeaient, buvaient, se mariaient ou mariaient leurs enfants, jusqu'au moment où Noé entra dans l'arche, et où le déluge survint et les extermina tous.
[17:28] C'est encore ce qui est arrivé aux jours de Lot: les hommes mangeaient, buvaient, achetaient, vendaient, plantaient, bâtissaient ;
[17:29] et au moment où Lot sortit de Sodome, une pluie de feu et de soufre tomba du ciel et les extermina tous.
[17:30] Ainsi en sera-t-il le jour où le Fils de l'homme sera révélé.»
[17:31] «Que celui qui sera, ce jour-là, sur le toit, et qui aura quelque objet dans la maison, ne descende pas pour l'emporter. Que celui qui sera aux champs fasse de même et ne revienne pas sur ses pas.
[17:32] Souvenez-vous de la femme de Lot!»
[17:33] «Qui cherchera à sauver sa vie la perdra, et qui la perdra, la rendra vraiment vivante.»
[17:34] «Cette nuit-là, je vous le déclare, de deux hommes qui seront dans un lit, l'un sera pris, et l'autre laissé.
[17:35] De deux femmes qui moudront ensemble, l'une sera prise, et l'autre laissée.» -
[17:36] (De deux hommes qui seront dans un champ, l’un sera pris et l’autre laissé).
[17:37] - «Où sera-ce Seigneur?» demandèrent les disciples. Il leur répondit : «Où sera le corps, là aussi les vautours se rassembleront.»
[18:1] Il leur raconta une parabole pour leur montrer qu'il faut prier toujours, et ne point se lasser:
[18:2] «Dans une certaine ville, dit-il, il y avait un juge qui n'avait ni crainte de Dieu, ni égards pour les hommes.
[18:3] Or, dans cette même ville, il y avait une veuve qui venait à lui et lui disait : «Fais-moi justice de mon adversaire.»
[18:4] Pendant longtemps, il ne le voulut pas.» «Enfin il se dit à lui-même : «Bien que je n'aie ni crainte de Dieu, ni égards pour les hommes,
[18:5] comme il est certain que cette veuve-là m'est à charge, je lui ferai justice, de peur qu'elle ne finisse par se livrer à quelque violence.»
[18:6] Vous entendez, ajouta le Seigneur, ce que dit ce juge inique.
[18:7] Et Dieu ne ferait point justice à ses élus qui crient à lui nuit et jour? Il tarderait à les secourir?
[18:8] Il leur fera prompte justice, je vous le déclare ; mais le Fils de l'homme, à son retour, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre?»
[18:9] Il raconta aussi la parabole suivante à quelques-uns très convaincus, à part eux, qu'ils étaient justes, et qui méprisaient les autres:
[18:10] «Deux hommes montèrent au Temple pour prier ; l'un Pharisien et l'autre publicain.
[18:11] Le Pharisien, debout, priait ainsi en lui-même: «O Dieu, je te rends grâces de ce que je ne suis pas comme le reste des hommes, gens rapaces, iniques, adultères, de ce que je ne suis pas comme ce publicain-là.
[18:12] Je jeûne deux fois par semaine ; je donne la dîme de tout ce que j'acquiers.»
[18:13] Quant au publicain, il se tenait à distance, il n'osait pas même lever les yeux vers le ciel, mais il se frappait la poitrine en disant : «Dieu, aie pitié de moi qui suis un pécheur!»
[18:14] Celui-ci, je vous le déclare, rentra dans sa maison justifié, plutôt que l'autre ; car quiconque s'élève lui-même sera abaissé, et quiconque s'abaisse lui-même sera élevé.»
[18:15] On lui apportait même les tout petits enfants pour qu'il les touchât. Voyant cela, les disciples blâmèrent ceux qui les lui apportaient.
[18:16] Mais Jésus appela ces enfants : «Laissez, leur dit-il, les enfants venir à moi, et ne les en empêchez pas, car c'est à ceux qui leur ressemblent qu'appartient le Royaume de Dieu.
[18:17] En vérité, je vous le dis, qui ne recevra pas, comme un enfant, le Royaume de Dieu, n'y entrera pas.»
[18:18] Un chef de synagogue lui posa une question : «Bon maître, lui dit-il, que dois-je faire pour acquérir la vie éternelle?»
[18:19] Jésus lui dit : «Pourquoi m'appelles-tu bon ? Nul n'est bon que Dieu seul!
[18:20] Tu connais les commandements: «Tu ne seras point adultère ; tu ne seras point meurtrier ; tu ne seras point voleur ; tu ne rendras point de faux témoignages ; honore ton père et ta mère.»
[18:21] Il répondit : «Tout cela je l'ai observé dès ma jeunesse.»
[18:22] Sur cette réponse, Jésus reprit : «Une chose te manque encore ;vends tout ce que tu as ; distribues-en le prix à des pauvres ; tu auras alors un trésor dans les cieux ; viens ensuite et suis-moi.»
[18:23] A ces mots, l'autre devint tout triste, car il était fort riche.
[18:24] Voyant sa tristesse, Jésus dit : «Combien difficilement entreront dans le Royaume de Dieu ceux qui ont des richesses !
[18:25] Il est plus facile à un chameau de passer par l'ouverture d'une aiguille qu'à un riche d'entrer dans le Royaume de Dieu.»
[18:26] «Qui donc pourra être sauvé ?» dirent-ils en l'entendant.
[18:27] Jésus répondit : «Ce qui est impossible aux hommes, est possible à Dieu.» —
[18:28] «Et nous, dit Pierre, c'est après avoir laissé tous nos biens, que nous t'avons suivi !»
[18:29] Il leur répondit: «Je vous le dis en vérité: personne, à cause du Royaume de Dieu, ne quittera une maison, une femme, des frères, des parents, des enfants,
[18:30] qu'il ne reçoive dès le temps présent bien davantage, et dans le siècle à venir la vie éternelle.»
[18:31] Prenant à part les douze, il leur dit: «Voilà que nous montons à Jérusalem et tout ce que les prophètes ont écrit du Fils de l'homme va s'accomplir :
[18:32] il sera livré aux païens, bafoué, outragé, couvert de crachats ;
[18:33] après l'avoir flagellé, ils le tueront, et le troisième jour il ressuscitera.»
[18:34] A cela les disciples ne comprirent rien ; le sens de ces paroles leur était caché ; ils ne saisissaient pas ce qui leur était dit.
[18:35] Il approchait de Jéricho. Un aveugle, assis au bord du chemin, mendiait.
[18:36] Entendant le bruit d'une foule en marche, il demanda ce que c'était.
[18:37] On lui répondit : «C'est Jésus de Nazareth qui passe.»
[18:38] Alors il s'écria : «Jésus, Fils de David, aie pitié de moi!»
[18:39] Ceux qui étaient en avant le menaçaient pour le faire taire, mais lui n'en criait que plus fort : «Fils de David, aie pitié de moi!»
[18:40] Jésus s'arrêta et donna l'ordre de le lui amener. Quand l'homme fut près de lui, il lui demanda :
[18:41] «Que veux-tu que je fasse pour toi ?» — «Seigneur, que j'y voie !» répondit l'aveugle.
[18:42] Alors Jésus lui dit : «Vois! ta foi t'a sauvé!» Immédiatement il vit, et il suivit Jésus en glorifiant Dieu. Tout le peuple, à ce spectacle, célébra les louanges de Dieu.
[18:43] 
[19:1] Entré dans Jéricho, Jésus traversait la ville.
[19:2] Il s'y trouvait un personnage du nom de Zacchée : c'était un chef de publicains, un homme riche.
[19:3] Il cherchait à voir qui était Jésus ; mais, étant de petite taille, cela lui était impossible, à cause de la foule.
[19:4] Alors il courut en avant et, pour voir Jésus, monta sur un sycomore au pied duquel il devait passer.
[19:5] Arrivé en cet endroit, Jésus leva les yeux sur lui : «Zacchée, dit-il, hâte-toi de descendre ; car aujourd'hui c'est dans ta maison qu'il faut que je m'arrête.»
[19:6] Cet homme descendit à la hâte et le reçut plein de joie.
[19:7] Mais tous ceux qui voyaient cela murmuraient. «Il va demeurer chez un pécheur !» disaient-ils.
[19:8] Quant à Zacchée, il se tenait devant le Seigneur et lui disait : «La moitié de mes biens, Seigneur, je la donne aux pauvres, et si j'ai fait tort à quelqu'un de quoi que ce soit, je lui en restitue quatre fois autant.»
[19:9] Alors Jésus dit, en se tournant vers Zacchée : «Cette maison a reçu aujourd'hui le salut, parce que cet homme est, lui aussi, un fils d'Abraham.
[19:10] Car le Fils de l'homme est venu chercher et sauver ce qui est perdu.»
[19:11] On l'écoutait ; alors il continua en racontant une parabole ; et il comme il était tout près de Jérusalem et qu'on croyait que le Royaume de Dieu allait tout à coup apparaître,
[19:12] voici ce qu'il dit : «Un homme de grande naissance avait à se rendre dans un pays éloigné pour recevoir l'investiture d'un royaume et revenir ensuite.
[19:13] Il appela dix de ses serviteurs, leur remit dix mines, en leur disant: «Faites valoir ceci jusqu'à mon retour.»
[19:14] «Les concitoyens de cet homme le haïssaient et, après son départ, ils envoyèrent des délégués pour dire en leur nom : «Nous ne voulons pas que cet homme règne sur nous.»
[19:15] «Cependant, quand il revint, il avait reçu le pouvoir royal ; alors il fit appeler ses serviteurs, ceux à qui il avait donné l'argent, pour savoir comment chacun l'avait fait valoir.
[19:16] Le premier se présenta et dit : «Seigneur, ta mine en a produit dix.» —
[19:17] «Bien, bon serviteur, lui répondit son maître, pour avoir, en si peu de choses, été fidèle, tu auras la puissance sur dix villes.»
[19:18] «Le second s'approcha et dit : «Ta mine, Seigneur, en a produit cinq.» —
[19:19] «Eh bien, toi, répondit le maître à celui-là, tu commanderas à cinq villes.»
[19:20] «Un autre encore s'approcha et dit : «Seigneur, voici ta mine que j'ai tenue enveloppée dans un linge.
[19:21] Je te craignais, en effet, car tu es un homme terrible ; tu t'empares de ce que tu n'as pas, fondé ; tu moissonnes ce que tu n'as pas semé.» —
[19:22] «De ta propre bouche je tire ton jugement, mauvais serviteur, répondit le maître ; ah ! tu savais que je suis un homme terrible, m'emparant de ce que je n'ai pas fondé, moissonnant ce que je n'ai pas semé!
[19:23] et pourquoi n'as-tu pas placé mon argent dans une banque ; à mon retour, je l'aurais retiré avec un intérêt.»
[19:24] Puis s'adressant à ceux qui étaient là : «Otez-lui la mine et donnez-la à celui qui en a dix.» —
[19:25] (Seigneur, lui dirent-ils, il a dix mines).
[19:26] «Je vous le déclare, à tout homme qui a, il sera donné ; mais à celui qui n'a pas, même ce qu'il a lui sera ôté.
[19:27] Quant à mes ennemis, à ceux qui n'ont pas voulu que je régnasse sur eux, amenez-les ici et égorgez-les devant moi.»
[19:28] Jésus parla ainsi, puis il partit devant, montant à Jérusalem.
[19:29] Quand ils furent près de Bethphagé et de Béthanie, du côté du mont appelé Bois d'oliviers, Jésus envoya deux des disciples,
[19:30] en leur disant : «Allez à ce village qui est devant vous ; à l'entrée, vous trouverez un ânon attaché, que personne n'a jamais monté. Détachez-le et l'amenez.
[19:31] Si l'on vous demande pourquoi vous le détachez, vous ferez cette réponse : «Le Seigneur en a besoin.»
[19:32] Les messagers partirent et trouvèrent l'ânon, ainsi qu'il le leur avait dit.
[19:33] Tandis qu'ils le détachaient, ses maîtres leur dirent : «Pourquoi détachez-vous cet ânon?» —
[19:34] «Parce que le Seigneur en a besoin», répondirent-ils.
[19:35] Ils conduisirent donc l'ânon, sur lequel ils jetèrent leurs manteaux, à Jésus, qu'ils firent monter sur lui.
[19:36] Quand il fut en marche, ils étendirent leurs vêtements sur la route,
[19:37] et lorsqu'il s'approcha de la descente du mont des Oliviers, la multitude des disciples se mit tout entière à jeter des cris de joie et à louer Dieu au sujet de tous les miracles qu'ils avaient vus.
[19:38] Ils disaient : «Béni soit le Roi qui vient au nom du Seigneur!» «Paix dans le ciel et gloire au plus haut des cieux!»
[19:39] Quelques Pharisiens qui étaient dans la foule lui dirent : «Maître, réprime tes disciples.»
[19:40] Il leur répondit par ces paroles : «Je vous déclare que si ceux-ci se taisent, les pierres crieront !»
[19:41] Il approcha de la ville ; quand il la vit, il pleura sur elle, en disant :
[19:42] «Si tu avais reconnu, toi aussi, du moins en ce jour, ce qui te pourrait apporter la paix ; mais, à l'heure présente, tout cela est voilé à tes regards.
[19:43] Des jours viendront sur toi où tes ennemis t'entoureront d'une palissade, t'enfermeront comme dans un cercle et te serreront de toutes parts ;
[19:44] ils te briseront contre le sol, toi et tes enfants qui sont dans ton sein, et ils ne laisseront pas en toi pierre sur pierre, parce que tu n'as pas reconnu le temps de ta visitation.»
[19:45] Jésus entra dans le Temple et se mit à en chasser les vendeurs.
[19:46] Il est écrit, leur dit-il : «Ma maison est une maison de prières» Et vous en avez fait une caverne de brigands.
[19:47] Chaque jour, dans le Temple, il enseignait. Les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes cherchaient à le faire périr, ainsi que les principaux personnages de la nation.
[19:48] Mais ils ne trouvaient pas le moyen de le faire, à cause du peuple, qui, tout entier, était suspendu à ses lèvres.
[20:1] Un de ces jours-là, comme il instruisait le peuple dans le Temple et lui annonçait l'Évangile, survinrent les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes, réunis aux Anciens,
[20:2] qui lui tinrent ce langage : «Dis-nous en vertu de quelle autorité tu fais ces choses, ou qui est celui qui t'a donné cette autorité?»
[20:3] Il leur fit cette réponse : «Je vous poserai, moi aussi, une question : répondez-moi ;
[20:4] le baptême de Jean venait-il du ciel ou des hommes?»
[20:5] Or ils faisaient, à part eux, ce raisonnement : «Si nous disons : du ciel, il répliquera : «Pourquoi alors ne l'avez-vous pas cru ?»
[20:6] Si nous disons : des hommes, tout le peuple nous lapidera ; car il est convaincu que Jean était un prophète.»
[20:7] Ils répondirent donc qu'ils ne savaient d'où venait ce baptême.
[20:8] Et Jésus leur répondit à son tour : «Je ne vous dis pas, moi non plus, en vertu de quelle autorité je fais ces choses.»
[20:9] Puis il se mit à raconter au peuple cette parabole : «Un homme planta une vigne, la loua à des vignerons et fit une longue absence.
[20:10] La saison venue, il envoya un serviteur aux vignerons, chargé de recevoir le produit de la vigne. Les vignerons, après l'avoir battu, le renvoyèrent les mains vides.
[20:11] Le maître alors leur envoya un autre serviteur. Celui-là, ils le battirent aussi, le traitèrent avec mépris et le renvoyèrent les mains vides.
[20:12] Il leur en envoya un troisième. Celui-là ils le couvrirent de blessures et le jetèrent dehors.
[20:13] — «Que dois-je faire?» dit alors le maître de la vigne. «Je leur enverrai mon fils, mon bien-aimé ; sans doute, ils le respecteront.»
[20:14] Mais quand les vignerons le virent, ils firent entre eux ce raisonnement : Celui-là c'est l'héritier ; tuons-le pour que l'héritage soit à nous.»
[20:15] Alors ils le jetèrent hors de la vigne et le tuèrent. Que leur fera donc le maître de la vigne?
[20:16] Il viendra, il fera périr ces vignerons et donnera la vigne, à d'autres.» — «Que cela n'arrive pas!» dirent-ils à ces paroles.
[20:17] Mais lui, les regardant en face, ajouta : «Qu'est-ce donc que ce passage de l'Écriture: «La pierre qu'ont rejetée ceux qui bâtissaient ; Celle-là même est devenue la tête de l'angle.»
[20:18] «Quiconque tombera sur cette pierre s'y brisera ; et celui sur qui elle tombera, elle le mettra en poussière.»
[20:19] Les Scribes et les chefs des prêtres cherchèrent à mettre immédiatement la main sur lui ; car ils comprenaient bien que c'était eux qu'il avait en vue dans cette parabole ; mais ils redoutaient le peuple.
[20:20] Ils le surveillèrent et lui envoyèrent d'habiles espions qui faisaient semblant d'être de bonne foi ; leur but était de surprendre une parole de lui qui leur permît de le livrer aux autorités et au pouvoir du procurateur.
[20:21] Ils lui posèrent une question:«Maître, nous savons que tu es droit dans ta parole et dans ton enseignement, que tu ne fais acception de personne, que, tout au contraire, tu enseignes en toute vérité la voie de Dieu.
[20:22] Nous est-il permis, oui ou non, de payer un tribut à César?»
[20:23] Devinant leur ruse, Jésus leur dit :
[20:24] «Montrez-moi un denier... De qui porte-t-il l'image et l'inscription?» — «De César», répondirent-ils. —
[20:25] «Eh bien, leur dit-il alors, rendez à César ce qui est à César et à Dieu ce qui est à Dieu.»
[20:26] Il leur fut ainsi impossible de surprendre une parole de lui en présence du peuple, et tout étonnés de cette réponse, ils gardèrent le silence.
[20:27] Survinrent ensuite quelques Saducéens (ceux qui affirment qu’il n’y a point de résurrection) ; ils lui posèrent aussi une question :
[20:28] «Maître, dirent-ils, voici ce que Moïse nous a prescrit : «Si le frère de quelqu'un meurt laissant une femme sans enfants, celui-ci devra épouser la veuve, pour susciter à son frère une postérité.»
[20:29] Or, il y a eu sept frères. Le premier a pris femme et est mort sans enfants.
[20:30] Le second a épousé la veuve ;
[20:31] puis le troisième ; tous les sept ; aucun n'a laissé d'enfants ; et tous sont morts.
[20:32] Enfin, la femme aussi est morte.
[20:33] Eh bien, à la résurrection, duquel d'entre eux cette femme sera-t-elle l'épouse? Les sept, en effet, l'ont eue pour femme.»
[20:34] Jésus leur répondit : «Les enfants de ce monde se marient et donnent en mariage ;
[20:35] mais ceux qui ont été jugés dignes de participer au monde à venir et à la résurrection d'entre les morts, ne se marient, ni ne sont donnés en mariage ;
[20:36] car ils ne peuvent plus mourir : ils sont semblables aux anges, et ils sont fils de Dieu étant fils de la résurrection.
[20:37] Or que les morts ressuscitent, Moïse l'a montré au passage du buisson, quand il appelle le Seigneur, le Dieu d'Abraham, le Dieu d'Isaac, le Dieu de Jacob.
[20:38] Or ce n'est point de morts, c'est de vivants qu'il est Dieu. Pour lui ils vivent tous.»
[20:39] Quelques Scribes intervinrent pour dire: «Maître, tu as parfaitement répondu.»
[20:40] Personne n'osait plus lui poser une seule question.
[20:41] Il leur demanda alors: «Comment dit-on que le Christ est Fils de David,
[20:42] quand David dit lui-même au livre des Psaumes : «Le Seigneur a dit à mon Seigneur : Siège à ma droite ;
[20:43] Jusqu'à ce que j'aie mis tes ennemis sous tes pieds.»
[20:44] Ainsi David l'appelle Seigneur, comment donc est-il son fils?»
[20:45] Devant tout le peuple qui entendait, il dit aux disciples :
[20:46] «Soyez sur vos gardes avec les Scribes qui se complaisent à se promener en robes solennelles, qui aiment à recevoir des salutations sur les places publiques, à occuper les premiers sièges dans les synagogues, les premières places dans les festins,
[20:47] qui dévorent, les ressources des veuves, et qui affectent de prier longuement. C'est pour ces hommes-là que le jugement aura le plus de rigueur.»
[21:1] Tout en regardant, il vit des riches qui mettaient leurs offrandes, dans le tronc.
[21:2] Il vit aussi une veuve indigente qui y mit deux leptes,
[21:3] et il dit : «En vérité, je vous le déclare, cette veuve pauvre a donné plus que tous.
[21:4] Car tous ceux-là, pour leurs offrandes, ont puisé dans leur superflu ; mais celle-ci a pris sur son indigence, elle a donné tout ce qu'elle possédait, tout ce qu'elle avait pour vivre.»
[21:5] Quelques-uns faisaient remarquer, à propos du Temple, les pierres magnifiques et les offrandes dont il était orné.
[21:6] «Des jours viendront, dit-il, où de ce que vous voyez, il ne restera pas ici pierre sur pierre ; tout sera renversé.»
[21:7] Alors ils le questionnèrent: «Maître, lui dirent-ils, quand donc ces choses arriveront-elles? et quel sera le signe qu'elles vont avoir lieu?»
[21:8] Il répondit : «Prenez garde de vous laisser séduire ; car plusieurs viendront en prenant mon nom, disant : «C'est moi !» et : «Le moment approche!». Ne marchez pas à leur suite.
[21:9] Quand vous entendrez parler de guerres et de révolutions, n'en soyez pas effrayés. Il faut, en effet, que cela arrive d'abord ; mais ce ne sera pas tout de suite la fin.»
[21:10] Il continua ainsi : «Se soulèvera nation contre nation, royaume contre royaume ;
[21:11] il y aura de vastes tremblements de terre ; ici et là des famines, des pestes, d'effrayantes choses et de grands prodiges au ciel.»
[21:12] «Mais, avant tout, on mettra la main sur vous, et l'on vous persécutera. Vous serez livrés aux synagogues, jetés en prison ; et, à cause de mon nom, traînés devant des rois et des procurateurs.
[21:13] Cela vous arrivera pour que vous rendiez témoignage.
[21:14] Gravez bien dans vos coeurs que vous n'aurez pas à vous préoccuper de votre défense,
[21:15] car je vous donnerai, moi, un langage et une sagesse auxquels tous vos adversaires ne pourront ni résister ni répliquer.
[21:16] Vous serez livrés par vos pères et vos mères, par vos frères, par vos parents, par vos amis ; ils feront mourir nombre d'entre vous ;
[21:17] et vous serez en haine à tout le monde à cause de mon nom.
[21:18] Et cependant pas un cheveu de votre tête ne doit périr ;
[21:19] c'est par votre patience que vous sauverez vos vies.»
[21:20] Lorsque vous verrez des armées camper autour de Jérusalem et l'investir, sachez alors qu'approche sa désolation.
[21:21] Que ceux qui seront dans la Judée fuient dans les montagnes, que ceux qui seront au milieu du pays en sortent, que ceux qui seront dans les contrées voisines n'y rentrent pas.
[21:22] Ces jours-là, en effet, seront des jours vengeurs où s'accomplira tout ce qui est écrit.
[21:23] Malheur aux femmes qui seront enceintes et à celles qui allaiteront en ces jours-là! car il y aura sur la terre une calamité immense et une colère contre ce peuple ;
[21:24] les hommes tomberont sous le tranchant du glaive, ils seront emmenés captifs dans toutes les nations, Jérusalem sera foulée aux pieds par les païens, jusqu'à ce que les temps des païens soient aussi accomplis.»
[21:25] «Il y aura des prodiges dans le soleil, dans la lune et dans les étoiles ; il y en aura sur la terre : angoisse des peuples jetés dans l'incertitude par le mugissement de la mer et des flots ;
[21:26] des hommes expirant de terreur dans l'attente de ce qui va arriver au monde, car les puissances des cieux seront ébranlées.
[21:27] Et c'est alors qu'on verra le Fils de l'homme arrivant, au sein d'une nuée, en puissance et grande gloire.
[21:28] Quand ces choses commenceront à arriver, regardez en haut, levez la tête, parce qu'approchera votre délivrance.»
[21:29] Il se servit d'une comparaison : «Voyez le figuier, et tous les arbres.
[21:30] Dès qu'ils commencent à pousser, vous savez de vous-mêmes, en les voyant, que l'été est proche.
[21:31] De même quand vous verrez arriver ces choses sachez que le royaume de Dieu est proche.
[21:32] En vérité, je vous le dis, cette génération ne passera pas que tout cela n'arrive.
[21:33] Le ciel et la terre passeront, mais mes paroles ne passeront point.»
[21:34] «Veillez sur vous-mêmes, de peur que vos coeurs ne s'appesantissent dans la bonne chère, dans les excès de boisson, dans les soucis de ce monde, et que ce jour-là ne vous surprenne inopinément.
[21:35] Car il surviendra comme un filet sur tous ceux qui habitent la surface de la terre.
[21:36] Soyez donc vigilants en tout temps, et priez afin que vous soyez rendus dignes d'échapper à toutes ces choses qui vont arriver et de subsister en présence du Fils de l'homme.»
[21:37] Le jour, il restait au Temple et y enseignait. Mais il allait passer les nuits hors de la ville sur la montagne appelée «Bois d'Oliviers»,
[21:38] et tout le peuple, de grand matin, venait au Temple pour l'entendre.
[22:1] La fête des Azymes, que l'on appelle la Pâque, approchait.
[22:2] Les chefs des prêtres et les Scribes cherchaient un moyen de se défaire de Jésus ; car ils redoutaient le peuple.
[22:3] Ce fut alors que Satan entra en Judas surnommé l'Iskariôte, qui était du nombre des douze ;
[22:4] il alla s'entendre avec les chefs des prêtres et avec les chefs des gardes sur ce qu'il y avait à faire pour le leur livrer.
[22:5] Pleins de joie, ils convinrent de lui donner de l'argent.
[22:6] Il s'engagea, et dès lors chercha une occasion de le leur livrer à l'insu de la multitude.
[22:7] Vint le jour de la fête où il fallait sacrifier la Pâque.
[22:8] Jésus envoya Pierre et Jean en leur disant : «Allez préparer ce qui nous est nécessaire pour le repas pascal.» —
[22:9] «Où veux-tu, lui dirent-ils, que nous le préparions?»
[22:10] Il leur répondit : «En entrant dans la ville, vous rencontrerez un homme portant une cruche d'eau. Vous le suivrez dans la maison où il entrera ;
[22:11] et voici ce que vous direz au propriétaire de cette maison : «Le maître te fait dire : Où est la chambre où je mangerai la Pâque avec mes disciples.»
[22:12] Cet homme alors vous montrera une chambre haute, grande, garnie de tapis. C'est là que vous ferez les préparatifs.»
[22:13] Ils partirent et trouvèrent toutes choses comme il les leur avait dites et préparèrent la Pâque.
[22:14] Quand vint l'heure, il se mit à table, et les apôtres avec lui.
[22:15] Il leur dit : «J'ai désiré — d'un grand désir — manger cette Pâque avec vous avant de souffrir.
[22:16] Je vous le déclare, en effet, je ne mangerai plus semblable Pâque, jusqu'à ce qu'elle s'accomplisse dans le Royaume de Dieu.»
[22:17] Tenant une coupe, il rendit grâces. «Prenez-la, dit-il, et partagez-la entre vous ;
[22:18] car désormais, je vous le déclare, je ne boirai plus du fruit de la vigne jusqu'à ce que vienne le Royaume de Dieu.»
[22:19] Prenant du pain, il rendit grâces, il le rompit et le leur donna, en disant : «Ceci est mon corps qui est donné pour vous ; faites ceci en mémoire de moi.»
[22:20] Après le repas, il prit de même la coupe, en disant : «Cette coupe est la nouvelle alliance en mon sang qui est répandu pour vous.
[22:21] Et voilà cependant avec moi, à cette table, la main de celui qui me livre!
[22:22] car le Fils de l'homme s'en va selon ce qui a été déterminé, mais malheur à cet homme par qui il est livré!»
[22:23] Ils se mirent à se demander de l'un à l'autre lequel d'entre eux devait faire cela.
[22:24] Il s'éleva aussi un débat sur celui d'entre eux qui devait être estimé le plus grand.
[22:25] «Les rois des nations, leur dit Jésus, en sont les dominateurs ; et ceux qui exercent sur elles un pouvoir impérieux sont appelés «leurs bienfaiteurs».
[22:26] Pour vous, n'agissez point ainsi : au contraire, que le plus grand d'entre vous se fasse comme le plus jeune, et que celui qui est le chef se considère comme le serviteur.
[22:27] Lequel passe pour le plus grand? Celui qui est à table ou celui qui sert? N'est-ce pas celui qui est à table? Moi, pourtant, je suis, au milieu de vous, comme celui qui sert.»
[22:28] «Quant à vous, vous m'êtes demeurés fidèles dans mes épreuves.»
[22:29] «Mon Père m'a adjugé un Royaume ; eh bien, moi, je vous l'adjuge à mon tour,
[22:30] afin que, dans ce Royaume qui sera le mien, vous mangiez et buviez à ma table, afin aussi que vous y siégiez sur des trônes jugeant les douze tribus d'Israël.»
[22:31] «Simon! Simon! voilà que Satan vous a réclamés pour vous passer tous au crible comme du froment.
[22:32] Moi, cependant, j'ai prié pour toi, afin que ta foi ne défaille pas. Et toi, quand tu seras un jour changé, fortifie tes frères.» —
[22:33] «Avec toi, Seigneur, lui dit Pierre, je suis prêt à aller en prison, à la mort!» —
[22:34] «Pierre, lui répondit Jésus, je te déclare qu'aujourd'hui même un coq n'aura pas achevé de chanter que, trois fois, tu n'aies nié me connaître.»
[22:35] Il continua : «Lorsque je vous ai envoyés sans bourse, sans sac, sans chaussures, vous a-t-il manqué quelque chose?» — «Rien, répondirent-ils.» —
[22:36] «Mais à présent, leur dit-il, que celui qui a une bourse la prenne ; et un sac, de même ; que celui qui n'a pas d'épée vende son manteau pour en acheter une ;
[22:37] car, je vous le déclare, il faut que cette parole de l'Écriture s'accomplisse en mois : «... Et il a été compté parmi les impies.» «En effet, ce qui me concerne tire à sa fin.» —
[22:38] «Seigneur, dirent-ils, voici deux épées.» — «Cela suffit,» leur répondit Jésus.
[22:39] Il sortit, et, selon sa coutume, il se dirigea vers le mont des Oliviers. Les disciples le suivirent.
[22:40] Arrivé en ce lieu, il leur dit : «Priez pour ne pas succomber à l'épreuve.»
[22:41] Il s'éloigna d'eux, à la distance d'un jet de pierre environ ; il se mit à genoux, et voici ce qu'il disait dans sa prière :
[22:42] «Père, si tu voulais écarter loin de moi cette coupe! toutefois que ce ne soit pas ma volonté qui se fasse, mais la tienne.»
[22:43] Alors il lui apparut un ange venu du ciel, qui le fortifia.
[22:44] Étant en agonie, plus ardente était sa prière. Sa sueur était comme de grosses gouttes de sang et tombait jusqu'à terre.
[22:45] Après avoir prié, il se releva et vint à ses disciples. Il les trouva qui s'étaient endormis dans l'accablement de leur douleur.
[22:46] «Pourquoi dormez-vous, leur dit-il, levez-vous, priez pour ne pas succomber à l'épreuve.»
[22:47] Il parlait encore, lorsqu'arriva toute une foule, en avant de laquelle marchait le nommé Judas, un des douze. Il s'approcha de Jésus pour lui donner un baiser.
[22:48] «Judas! lui dit Jésus, c'est par un baiser que tu livres le Fils de l'homme!»
[22:49] Voyant ce qui allait se passer, ceux qui entouraient Jésus lui dirent : «Seigneur, si nous frappions de l'épée?»
[22:50] Et l'un d'entre eux frappa le serviteur du grand-prêtre et lui coupa l'oreille droite.
[22:51] Mais Jésus prit la parole : «Restez-en là!» dit-il, et touchant l'oreille de l'homme blessé, il le guérit.
[22:52] Jésus dit ensuite à ceux qui étaient venus à lui, chefs des prêtres, chefs des gardes du Temple et Anciens : «Vous êtes venus comme contre un brigand, avec des épées et des bâtons.
[22:53] Tous les jours j'étais avec vous dans le Temple, et vous n'avez pas mis la main sur moi. Mais cette heure-ci est vôtre, cette heure où les ténèbres règnent.»
[22:54] Ils s'emparèrent de lui, l'emmenèrent et le conduisirent à la demeure du grand-prêtre. Pierre suivait de loin.
[22:55] Au milieu de la cour ils allumèrent du feu, ils s'assirent tout autour, et Pierre aussi s'assit parmi eux.
[22:56] Une servante le vit assis à la clarté du foyer, et, le regardant attentivement elle lui dit : «Et celui-là, il était avec lui!»
[22:57] Et Pierre, reniant Jésus, dit à cette femme : «Je ne le connais pas.»
[22:58] Un instant après, un autre dit en le voyant: «Toi aussi, tu en es!» — «Non, je n'en suis pas», dit Pierre à cet homme.
[22:59] Après un intervalle d'une heure environ, un autre devint tout à fait affirmatif : «Il est certain, dit-il, que celui-ci était avec lui, car c'est également un Galiléen.»
[22:60] Mais Pierre dit à cet homme : «Je ne comprends pas ce que tu dis. A l'instant même, pendant qu'il parlait encore, un coq chanta.
[22:61] Le Seigneur se retourna et regarda Pierre. Alors Pierre se souvint de la parole du Seigneur ; il se rappela comment il lui avait dit : «Avant qu'un coq chante aujourd'hui, tu me renieras, trois fois.»
[22:62] Il sortit, et, dehors, il pleura amèrement.
[22:63] Ceux qui gardaient Jésus se faisaient un jeu de lui donner des coups ;
[22:64] ils lui avaient couvert le visage d'un voile et puis ils l'interrogeaient : «Fais le prophète! quel est celui qui t'a frappé?»
[22:65] et ils proféraient beaucoup d'autres injures contre lui.
[22:66] Quand il fit jour, s'assembla le corps des Anciens du peuple avec des chefs des prêtres et des Scribes. Ils firent comparaître Jésus par devant leur Sanhédrin et lui parlèrent ainsi : «Si tu es le Christ, dis-le-nous.»
[22:67] Il leur répondit : «Quand même je vous le dirais, vous ne me croiriez pas.
[22:68] Et si je vous interrogeais, vous ne me répondriez pas.
[22:69] A partir de maintenant le Fils de l'homme siégera à la droite de la puissance de Dieu.»
[22:70] Ils dirent tous : «C'est donc toi qui es le Fils de Dieu?» — «Vous dites vous-mêmes que je le suis», leur répondit Jésus. —
[22:71] «Qu'avons-nous encore besoin de témoignage, dirent-ils ; le témoignage, nous venons nous-mêmes de l'entendre de sa propre bouche.»
[23:1] Tous alors se levèrent en foule et le conduisirent à Pilate!
[23:2] Leur premier chef d'accusation fut : «Nous avons trouvé cet homme excitant notre peuple à la révolte, l'empêchant de payer le tribut à César, et se disant le Christ-roi.»
[23:3] Pilate l'interrogea : «C'est toi qui es le roi des Juifs?» lui demanda-t-il. Jésus répondit ainsi : «Tu le dis.»
[23:4] Pilate, s'adressant aux chefs des prêtres et à la foule : «Chez cet homme je ne trouve rien de coupable», leur dit-il.
[23:5] Eux pourtant insistaient avec force, disant : «Il agitait le peuple, il parcourait toute la Judée, en enseignant ; et c'est après avoir commencé par la Galilée qu'il est arrivé jusqu'ici.»
[23:6] A ces paroles, Pilate demande si l'homme était Galiléen ;
[23:7] et, apprenant qu'il, était sujet d'Hérode, il l'envoya à celui-ci, lequel se trouvait à Jérusalem ces jours-là.
[23:8] Pour Hérode, voir Jésus, fut une grande joie. Il y avait longtemps qu'il souhaitait de le connaître ; il avait entendu parler de lui ; et il espérait lui voir faire un miracle.
[23:9] Aussi l'interrogea-t-il longuement ; mais Jésus ne lui répondit rien. —
[23:10] Quant aux chefs des prêtres et aux Scribes, ils étaient là debout l'accusant sans relâche. —
[23:11] Alors Hérode ne fit plus aucun cas de Jésus ; ses soldats et lui le raillèrent, et il le renvoya à Pilate après l'avoir affublé d'une robe blanche.
[23:12] Hérode et Pilate, qui avaient vécu jusque-là en inimitié, devinrent amis, à dater de ce jour.
[23:13] Réunissant les chefs des prêtres, les magistrats et le peuple,
[23:14] Pilate leur dit : «Vous m'avez présenté cet homme comme excitant le peuple à la révolte, et voilà qu'après enquête faite en votre présence, je ne l'ai trouvé en rien coupable de ce dont vous l'accusez.
[23:15] Hérode, non plus, car il nous l'a renvoyé. Ainsi il n'a rien fait qui mérite la mort.
[23:16] Je vais donc, après l'avoir fait frapper de verges, lui rendre la liberté.»
[23:17] (A chaque fête, il était obligé de leur relâcher un prisonnier).
[23:18] Alors tous, d'une seule voix, se mirent à crier «A mort celui-là! délivre-nous Bar-Abbas!»
[23:19] (C'était un homme qui avait été incarcéré pour avoir commis un meurtre à la suite d'une émeute qui avait eu lieu dans la ville.)
[23:20] Pilate, qui désirait délivrer Jésus, leur parla de nouveau.
[23:21] Ils lui répondirent par des cris : «Crucifie-le! crucifie-le!»
[23:22] Pour la troisième fois, il leur demanda : «Mais quel mal a-t-il fait, cet homme? Je ne le trouve coupable de rien qui mérite la mort. Je vais donc, après l'avoir fait frapper de verges, lui rendre la liberté.»
[23:23] Mais ils insistaient, ils demandaient à grands cris qu'on le crucifiât, et ce furent leurs cris qui l'emportèrent.
[23:24] Pilate prononça une sentence conforme à leur demande.
[23:25] Il mit en liberté, à leur requête, celui qui avait été incarcéré pour émeute et pour meurtre, et il abandonna Jésus à leur volonté.
[23:26] Comme ils l'emmenaient, ils rencontrèrent un certain Simon de Cyrène qui revenait des champs, et ils le chargèrent de porter la croix derrière Jésus.
[23:27] Une immense multitude de peuple le suivait, ainsi que des femmes qui se lamentaient et le pleuraient.
[23:28] Se tournant vers elles, Jésus dit : «Filles de Jérusalem, ne pleurez pas sur moi, mais pleurez sur vous et sur vos enfants ;
[23:29] voici, en effet, que viennent des jours où l'on dira : «Heureuses les stériles ; heureuses les entrailles qui n'ont point enfanté, et les mamelles qui n'ont point allaité!»
[23:30] On se mettra alors à dire aux montagnes : Tombez sur nous! Et aux collines : Recouvrez-nous!»
[23:31] Car si le bois vert est ainsi traité, qu'arrivera-t-il au bois sec?»
[23:32] On emmenait aussi deux autres hommes, des malfaiteurs, pour les mettre à mort avec lui.
[23:33] Ils arrivèrent à l'endroit qui porte le nom de Crâne. Là on le crucifia, ainsi que les deux malfaiteurs, l'un à sa droite, l'autre à sa gauche.
[23:34] Jésus disait : «Père! pardonne-leur, car ils ne savent ce qu'ils font!» Ses vêtements furent partagés après avoir été tirés au sort.
[23:35] Le peuple se tenait tout autour et regardait. Quant à ceux qui étaient les chefs de la nation, ils se moquaient, disant : «Il en a sauvé d'autres ; qu'il se sauve lui-même s'il est le Christ, l'Élu de Dieu.»
[23:36] Les soldats aussi le raillaient ; ils, s'approchaient, ils lui offraient du vinaigre,
[23:37] ils lui disaient : «Si tu es le Roi des Juifs, sauve-toi!»
[23:38] Au-dessus de lui, il y avait une inscription : CELUI-CI EST LE ROI DES JUIFS.
[23:39] Un des malfaiteurs suspendus en croix l'injuriait : «N'es-tu pas le Christ? Sauve-toi et nous avec toi!»
[23:40] Mais l'autre éleva la voix pour le reprendre : «Est-ce que, toi non plus, tu ne crains pas Dieu, lui dit-il ; toi qui subis le même supplice ;
[23:41] et pour nous ce n'est que justice ; nous recevons ce qu'ont mérité nos actes ; mais celui-ci n'a rien fait de mal.»
[23:42] Et il disait : «Jésus, souviens-toi de moi quand tu viendras en ton Royaume!.» —
[23:43] «En vérité, je te le dis, lui répondit Jésus, aujourd'hui tu seras avec moi dans le Paradis.»
[23:44] Il était déjà la sixième heure environ et, le soleil s'étant éclipsé, des ténèbres se firent sur tout le pays jusqu'à la neuvième heure.
[23:45] Le rideau du Temple se déchira par le milieu ;
[23:46] et Jésus dit, en jetant un grand cri : «Père, Je remets mon esprit entre tes mains.» En disant cela, il expira.
[23:47] Voyant ce qui se passait, le centurion glorifia Dieu, disant : «Certainement cet homme était juste!»
[23:48] Et tous ceux qui avaient assisté en foule à ce spectacle et avaient été témoins de ce qui était arrivé, s'en retournaient en se frappant la poitrine.
[23:49] Quant à ceux qui l'avaient connu, ils se tenaient tous à distance, ainsi que des femmes qui l'avaient suivi depuis la Galilée, et ils regardaient.
[23:50] Survint un membre du Grand-Conseil appelé Joseph. C'était un homme juste et bon,
[23:51] qui ne s'était associé ni aux projets ni aux actes des autres. (Il était d'Arimathée, ville des Juifs.) Lui aussi attendait le Royaume de Dieu.
[23:52] Il alla trouver Pilate et demanda le corps de Jésus.
[23:53] Puis il le descendit de la croix, l'ensevelit dans un linceul, et le déposa dans un sépulcre taillé dans le roc, où personne encore n'avait été placé.
[23:54] C'était un jour de Préparation et un sabbat allait commencera.
[23:55] Des femmes, celles qui étaient venues avec Jésus de Galilée, ayant accompagné Joseph, virent le tombeau et comment y fut placé le corps ;
[23:56] puis elles s'en retournèrent préparer des aromates et des parfums. Selon le commandement, elles se tinrent en repos le jour du, sabbat.
[24:1] Mais le premier jour de la semaine, de très grand matin, elles se rendirent au tombeau, portant avec elles les aromates qu'elles avaient préparés.
[24:2] Elles s'aperçurent que la pierre avait été éloignée de l'ouverture du sépulcre.
[24:3] Elles entrèrent et ne trouvèrent pas le corps du Seigneur Jésus.
[24:4] Elles en étaient consternées ; mais voilà que deux hommes se présentèrent à elles, vêtus de robes resplendissantes.
[24:5] Et comme, tout effrayées, elles inclinaient leurs visages vers la terre, ils leur dirent : «Pourquoi cherchez-vous parmi les morts celui qui est vivant?
[24:6] Il n'est pas ici ; tout au contraire, il est ressuscité. Souvenez-vous comment il vous a parlé quand il était encore en Galilée.
[24:7] Il faut, disait-il, que le Fils de l'homme soit livré entre les mains des pécheurs, qu'il soit crucifié et qu'il ressuscite le troisième jour.»
[24:8] Elles se souvinrent alors de ses paroles.
[24:9] De retour du tombeau, elles annoncèrent tout cela aux onze et à tous les autres.
[24:10] C'étaient Marie Magdeleine, Jeanne, Marie mère de Jacques, et quelques autres avec elles qui racontèrent cela aux apôtres.
[24:11] Et leurs dires leur firent l'effet d'une absurdité et ils ne les crurent pas.
[24:12] (Pierre, cependant, se leva et courut au sépulcre. S’étant baissé, il ne vit que des linges qui étaient à terre, puis il retourna chez lui, surpris de ce qui était arrivé.)
[24:13] Ce même jour, deux d'entre les disciples s'en allaient à un village situé à soixante stades de Jérusalem, nommé Emmaüs,
[24:14] et ils s'entretenaient ensemble de tout ce qui venait de se passer.
[24:15] Tandis qu'ils s'entretenaient ainsi et discutaient, Jésus lui-même s'approcha et se mit à marcher avec eux.
[24:16] Mais une force empêchait leurs yeux de le reconnaître.
[24:17] «Quelles sont, leur dit-il, ces paroles que vous échangez l'un et l'autre tout en marchant?» Ils étaient pleins de tristesse
[24:18] et l'un d'eux, appelé Cléopas, lui répondit. «Tu es bien seul, lui dit-il, et bien étranger à Jérusalem si tu ne sais pas ce qui y est arrivé ces jours-ci.» —
[24:19] «Quoi donc?», leur demanda-t-il. Ils lui répondirent: «L'affaire de Jésus de Nazareth qui fut un prophète puissant en oeuvres et en paroles devant Dieu et devant tout le peuple.
[24:20] Les chefs des prêtres et nos magistrats l'ont livré pour le faire condamner à mort et l'ont crucifié.
[24:21] Nous, nous espérions qu'il était celui qui doit délivrer Israël. Mais, avec tout cela, voici le troisième jour que ces choses sont arrivées!»
[24:22] «De plus, certaines femmes qui sont des nôtres nous ont fort effrayés. Elles sont allées de grand matin au tombeau
[24:23] et n'y ont pas trouvé son corps ; et elles sont venues nous dire qu'elles ont même vu une apparition d'anges. Ces anges leur ont dit qu'il est vivant.
[24:24] Alors quelques-uns des nôtres sont allés au tombeau ; ils ont trouvé toutes choses comme les femmes avaient dit ; mais, lui, ils ne l'ont pas vu.»
[24:25] «Ô insensés! leur dit-il alors, coeurs lents à croire tout ce qu'ont dit les prophètes?
[24:26] Ne fallait-il pas que le Christ souffrît ces choses et entrât dans sa gloire?
[24:27] Et commençant par Moïse et par tous les Prophètes, il leur expliquait dans toutes les Écritures ce qui le concernait.
[24:28] Ils approchaient du village où ils se rendaient et lui faisait semblant d'aller plus loin.
[24:29] Mais ils le retinrent. «Demeure avec nous, lui dirent-ils, car il se fait tard ; le jour est déjà sur son déclin.» entra pour demeurer avec eux.
[24:30] Comme ils étaient ensemble à table, il prit le pain, prononça la bénédiction, le rompit et le leur donna.
[24:31] Leurs yeux s'ouvrirent, et ils le reconnurent, mais lui-même avait disparu de devant eux.
[24:32] «N'est-ce pas, se dirent-ils l'un à l'autre, que notre coeur était tout enflammé en nous-mêmes, lorsqu'il nous parlait dans le chemin et qu'il nous ouvrait le sens des Écritures.»
[24:33] Ils se levèrent à l'heure même, retournèrent à Jérusalem et trouvèrent réunis les onze et ceux qui étaient des leurs ;
[24:34] ceux-ci leur dirent : «Le Seigneur est vraiment ressuscité et il est apparu à Simon.»
[24:35] Quant à eux, ils racontèrent ce qui s'était passé dans le chemin, et comment ils l'avaient reconnu à la fraction du pain.
[24:36] Pendant qu'ils parlaient, Jésus parut au milieu d'eux et leur dit : «La paix soit avec vous !»
[24:37] Troublés, épouvantés, ils croyaient voir un Esprit.
[24:38] «Pourquoi vous troublez-vous, leur dit-il, et pourquoi ces hésitations qui montent dans vos coeurs?
[24:39] Voyez mes mains et mes pieds, c'est bien moi. Touchez-moi ; regardez-moi ; un Esprit n'a ni chair ni os comme vous voyez que j'en ai».
[24:40] (En leur disant cela, il leur montra ses mains et ses pieds.)
[24:41] Comme dans leur stupéfaction et leur joie ils ne croyaient point encore, il leur demanda : «Avez-vous ici quelque chose à manger?»
[24:42] Ils lui présentèrent un morceau de poisson grillé.
[24:43] Il le prit et le mangea devant eux.
[24:44] Il ajouta: «Voilà ce que je vous disais quand j'étais encore avec vous et vous parlais. Je vous disais qu'il fallait que fût accompli tout ce qui est écrit de moi dans la Loi de Moïse, dans les Prophètes et dans les Psaumes.»
[24:45] Et là-dessus il leur ouvrit l'intelligence pour qu'ils comprissent les Écritures.
[24:46] «C'est ainsi, leur dit-il, qu'il est écrit que le Christ souffrira et ressuscitera d'entre les morts le troisième jour,
[24:47] et que la repentance et la rémission des péchés seront prêchées en son nom parmi toutes les nations, à commencer par Jérusalem.
[24:48] Vous, vous êtes témoins de ces choses.
[24:49] Et moi, j'enverrai sur vous ce que mon Père a promis. Vous demeurerez donc dans la ville, jusqu'à ce que vous ayez été revêtus d'une force d'en haut.»
[24:50] Puis il les emmena jusque vers Béthanie et, levant les mains, il les bénit.
[24:51] Et, tandis qu'il les bénissait, il se sépara d'eux et fut élevé au ciel.
[24:52] Ils tombèrent en adoration, puis, le coeur plein de joie, ils retournèrent à Jérusalem,
[24:53] où ils étaient constamment dans le Temple, bénissant Dieu. 

### John

[1:1] Au commencement était la Parole ; et la Parole était avec Dieu ; et la Parole était Dieu.
[1:2] Cette Parole était au commencement avec Dieu.
[1:3] Toutes choses sont nées par elle, et absolument rien de ce qui existe n'a pris naissance sans elle.
[1:4] En elle il y avait vie, et la vie était la lumière des hommes.
[1:5] Et la lumière éclaire dans les ténèbres ; et les ténèbres ne l'ont pas acceptée.
[1:6] Il a paru un homme, envoyé de la part de Dieu ; il s'appelait Jean ;
[1:7] cet homme est venu pour être témoin. Il est venu témoigner en faveur de la lumière, pour que tous devinssent croyants par lui.
[1:8] Il n'était pas lui-même la lumière ; mais il était là pour témoigner en faveur de la lumière.
[1:9] Elle existait, cette parfaite lumière qui éclaire tout homme venant au monde.
[1:10] Elle existait dans le monde ; et le monde avait pris naissance par elle et le monde ne l'avait pas connue.
[1:11] Elle est venue dans sa propre demeure, et les siens ne l'ont pas accueillie ;
[1:12] mais à tous ceux qui l'ont accueillie, elle a accordé le privilège de devenir enfants de Dieu ; elle l'a accordé à ceux qui ont cru en son nom.
[1:13] Ceux-là ne sont pas nés au sens physique par la volonté de la chair et de l'homme, mais ils sont nés de Dieu.
[1:14] Oui, la Parole est devenue chair, et elle a dressé sa tente au milieu de nous, et nous avons contemplé sa gloire, la gloire parfaite d'un Fils unique envoyé par son Père, tout rempli de grâce et de vérité.
[1:15] Jean lui rend son témoignage dans ce cri qu'il a jeté : «C'était de lui que je disais : Celui qui doit venir après moi, m'a devancé, parce qu'il a été avant moi.»
[1:16] En effet, de sa plénitude nous avons tous reçu, et grâce après grâce.
[1:17] Car la Loi a été donnée par Moïse ; la grâce et la vérité sont venues par Jésus-Christ.
[1:18] Personne n'a jamais vu Dieu ; le Fils unique qui est dans le sein du Père, voilà celui qui l'a expliqué.
[1:19] Voici quel fut le témoignage de Jean lorsque les Juifs envoyèrent de Jérusalem des prêtres et des lévites lui poser cette question : «Qui es-tu?»
[1:20] Il s'expliqua formellement et sans réserve ; il s'expliqua ainsi : «Je ne suis pas, moi, le Christ.» —
[1:21] «Qui donc?» lui demandèrent-ils alors. «Serais-tu Élie?» — Il répondit : «Je ne le suis pas.» — «Es-tu le Prophète?» — Et il répondit : «Non.» —
[1:22] Ils lui dirent alors : «Qui es-tu? pour que nous rendions réponse à ceux qui nous ont envoyés. Que dis-tu de toi-même?» —
[1:23] «Moi, répondit-il, je suis «Une voix qui crie dans le désert : Aplanissez la voie du Seigneur comme l'a dit le prophète Ésaïe.»
[1:24] Les envoyés étaient des Pharisiens.
[1:25] Ils continuèrent à l'interroger : «Pourquoi donc, lui dirent-ils, baptises-tu, si tu n'es ni le Christ, ni Élie, ni le Prophète?»
[1:26] La réponse de Jean fut celle-ci : «Moi, je baptise avec l'eau ; mais, au milieu de vous, se tient quelqu'un que vous ne connaissez pas.
[1:27] C'est celui qui doit venir après moi ; je ne suis pas digne de défier la courroie de sa sandale!»
[1:28] Ceci se passait à Béthanie, au delà du Jourdain, là où Jean baptisait.
[1:29] Le lendemain, Jean voit Jésus qui s'avance vers lui, et il dit : «Voici l'agneau de Dieu qui ôte le péché du monde!
[1:30] c'est de lui que j'ai dit : «Après moi vient un homme qui m'a devancé, parce qu'il a été avant moi.»
[1:31] Moi, je ne le connaissais pas, mais c'est pour qu'il fût manifesté à Israël que je suis venu baptiser avec l'eau»
[1:32] Jean rendit encore ce témoignage : «J'ai vu, dit-il, l'Esprit descendre du ciel sous la figure d'une colombe et demeurer sur lui.
[1:33] Moi, je ne le connaissais pas, mais celui qui m'a envoyé baptiser avec l'eau m'a dit lui-même : «C'est l'homme sur lequel tu verras l'Esprit descendre et demeurer, qui baptise avec l'Esprit saint.»
[1:34] Or je l'ai vu et j'ai rendu ce témoignage : «C'est lui qui est le Fils de Dieu.»
[1:35] Le lendemain Jean était de nouveau au même endroit avec deux de ses disciples
[1:36] et, arrêtant son regard sur Jésus qui passait, il dit : «Voici l'agneau de Dieu!»
[1:37] Les deux disciples entendirent ces paroles et suivirent Jésus.
[1:38] Celui-ci, s'étant retourné et s'étant aperçu qu'ils le suivaient, leur dit : «Qui cherchez-vous?» — Ils lui répondirent : «Rabbi (ce mot veut dire : maître), où demeures-tu?» —
[1:39] «Venez, leur dit-il, et vous le verrez.» Alors ils allèrent avec lui, virent où il demeurait et restèrent auprès de lui ce jour-là ; c'était vers la dixième heure.
[1:40] André, le frère de Simon Pierre, était l'un de ces deux qui, sur le mot de Jean, s'étaient mis à suivre Jésus.
[1:41] Il fut le premier à trouver son propre frère Simon et lui dit : «Nous avons trouvé le Messie (ce mot se traduit : Christ).»
[1:42] Il l'amena à Jésus qui, arrêtant sur lui son regard, lui dit : «Tu es Simon, le fils de Jean, tu seras appelé Képhas (ce qui veut dire Pierre).»
[1:43] Le lendemain, Jésus résolut de partir pour la Galilée. Il trouva Philippe et lui dit : «Suis-moi!»
[1:44] Philippe était de Bethsaida, de la même ville qu'André et Pierre.
[1:45] Il trouva Nathanaël et lui dit : «Celui dont a parlé Moïse dans «la Loin, dont ont parlé «les Prophètes», nous l'avons trouvé! C'est Jésus de Nazareth, le fils de Joseph.»
[1:46] Nathanaël lui répondit : «Peut-il venir quelque chose de bon de Nazareth?» — «Viens et vois», lui répliqua Philippe.
[1:47] Apercevant Nathanaël qui s'avançait vers lui, Jésus dit de lui : «Voici un véritable Israélite, un homme qui est sans fraude!» —
[1:48] «D'où me connais-tu?» lui demanda Nathanaël. Jésus lui répondit, par ces paroles : «Avant que Philippe t'appelât, quand tu étais sous le figuier, je t'ai vu.» —
[1:49] «Rabbi, répliqua Nathanaël, tu es le Fils de Dieu! tu es le Roi d'Israël!»
[1:50] Jésus reprit en ces termes : «Parce que je t'ai dit que je t'ai vu sous le figuier, voilà que tu crois! Tu verras de plus grandes choses que celles-là.»
[1:51] Et il ajouta : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, vous verrez le ciel ouvert et les anges de Dieu montant et descendant sur le Fils de l'homme.»
[2:1] Le troisième jour, il y avait un repas de noce à Cana en Galilée. La mère de Jésus s'y trouvait,
[2:2] et Jésus également avait été invité avec ses disciples.
[2:3] Le vin étant venu à manquer, la mère de Jésus dit à celui-ci : «Ils n'ont plus de vin.» —
[2:4] «Femme, lui répondit Jésus, qu'y a-t-il entre toi et moi? mon heure n'est pas encore venue.»
[2:5] Sa mère dit à ceux qui servaient : «Faites ce qu'il vous dira.»
[2:6] Or, il y avait là six urnes de pierre disposées pour les ablutions qui sont en usage parmi les Juifs. Chacune d'elles contenait deux ou trois mesures.
[2:7] «Remplissez d'eau les urnes», dit Jésus aux serviteurs. Ils les remplirent jusqu'au bord.
[2:8] «Puisez-y maintenant, leur dit Jésus, et portez-en à l'ordonnateur du repas.» Ils lui en portèrent.
[2:9] Quand celui-ci eut goûté l'eau devenue vin, — n'en sachant point la provenance, comme la savaient les serviteurs qui avaient puisé l'eau, — il appelle l'époux
[2:10] et lui dit : «Tout le monde offre d'abord le bon vin à ses convives et, quand ils sont en ébriété, il leur en donne de qualité inférieure ; quant à toi, tu as réservé le bon vin jusqu'à maintenant.»
[2:11] Tel fut, à Cana en Galilée, le commencement des miracles faits par Jésus. Ainsi il manifesta sa gloire et ses disciples crurent en lui.
[2:12] Après cela, il descendit à Capharnaüm, avec sa mère, ses frères et ses disciples. Il n'y demeura que peu de jours.
[2:13] La Pâque des Juifs était proche et il monta à Jérusalem.
[2:14] Dans le Temple, il trouva les marchands de boeufs, de brebis, de colombes, les changeurs installés.
[2:15] Se faisant alors un fouet avec des cordes, il les chassa tous du Temple ainsi que les brebis et les boeufs ; il répandit sur le sol la monnaie des changeurs et renversa leurs tables
[2:16] et, quant aux marchands de colombes, il leur dit: «Emportez tout cela et ne faites pas de la maison de mon Père une maison de trafic.»
[2:17] Ses disciples se souvinrent qu'il est écrit : «Le zèle de ta maison me dévore.»
[2:18] Cependant les Juifs s'adressèrent à lui ; ils lui dirent : «Quel miracle nous montres-tu pour agir de la sorte?»
[2:19] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «Renversez ce Temple et en trois jours je le relèverai!» —
[2:20] «Il a fallu, reprirent les Juifs, quarante-six ans pour bâtir ce Temple et toi tu le relèverais en trois jours!»
[2:21] Mais lui, il parlait du Temple de son corps ;
[2:22] et lorsqu'il fut ressuscité d'entre les morts, ses disciples se souvinrent de ce langage, et ils crurent alors à l'Écriture et à la parole dite par Jésus.
[2:23] Pendant qu'il était à Jérusalem, à la fête de Pâque, un grand nombre, à la vue des miracles qu'il faisait, crurent en son nom.
[2:24] Mais lui, Jésus, ne se fiait pas à eux, parce qu'il les connaissait tous. Il n'avait pas besoin en effet que tel ou tel témoignage vînt le renseigner sur qui que ce soit ;
[2:25] il savait par-lui-même ce qu'il y avait en chacun.
[3:1] Parmi les Pharisiens se trouvait un homme du nom de Nicodème. C'était l'un des chefs des Juifs.
[3:2] Il vint à Jésus pendant la nuit. «Rabbi, lui dit-il, nous savons que tu es venu de la part de Dieu comme docteur, car nul ne peut faire les miracles que tu fais, si Dieu n'est avec lui.»
[3:3] Jésus alors lui adressa ces paroles : «En vérité, en vérité, je te le dis, personne, s'il ne naît de nouveau, ne peut voir le Royaume de Dieu.»
[3:4] Nicodème lui dit : «Comment un homme qui est vieux peut-il naître! peut-il retourner dans le sein de sa mère et naître une seconde fois?»
[3:5] Jésus répondit : «En vérité, en vérité, je te le dis, personne, ne naît d'eau et d'Esprit, ne peut entrer dans le Royaume de Dieu.
[3:6] Ce qui est né de la chair est chair ; ce qui est né de l'Esprit est Esprit.
[3:7] Ne t'étonne pas de ce que je t'aie dit: il faut que vous naissiez de nouveau.
[3:8] Le vent souffle où il veut ; tu en entends le bruit, mais tu ne sais ni d'où il vient, ni où il va. Ainsi en est-il de tout homme né de l'Esprit.»
[3:9] Nicodème l'interrogea : «Comment, dit-il, cela se peut-il faire?»
[3:10] Jésus alors lui adressa ces paroles : «Tu es le docteur d'Israël » et tu ne sais pas ces choses!
[3:11] En vérité, en vérité, je te le dis, ce que nous savons, nous le disons ; ce que nous avons vu, nous l'attestons ; et vous n'acceptez pas notre témoignage.
[3:12] Si, quand je vous ai parlé des choses de la terre, vous ne croyez pas, comment croiriez-vous si je vous parlais des choses du ciel?
[3:13] Nul n'est monté au ciel, sinon celui qui est descendu du ciel, le Fils de l'homme qui est au ciel.
[3:14] Et de même que, dans le désert, Moïse a élevé le serpent, de même il faut que le Fils de l'homme soit élevé,
[3:15] afin que quiconque croit en lui ait la vie éternelle.»
[3:16] «Dieu, en effet, a tant aimé le monde qu'il a donné son Fils unique afin que quiconque croit en lui ne périsse point, mais qu'il ait la vie éternelle.
[3:17] Car Dieu n'a pas envoyé son Fils dans le monde pour juger le monde, mais pour que le monde soit sauvé par lui.»
[3:18] «Qui croit en lui n'est point jugé ; qui ne croit point est déjà jugé parce qu'il n'a pas cru au nom du Fils unique de Dieu.
[3:19] Voici quel est le jugement : la lumière est venue dans le monde et les hommes ont mieux aimé les ténèbres que la lumière, parce que leurs oeuvres étaient mauvaises.
[3:20] Quiconque, en effet, commet le mal hait la lumière et ne vient pas vers la lumière, de crainte que ses oeuvres ne soient découvertes et condamnées.
[3:21] Quant à celui qui pratique la vérité, il vient vers la lumière, afin que ses oeuvres deviennent manifestes, parce que c'est en Dieu qu'elles sont accomplies.»
[3:22] Après cela, Jésus et ses disciples se rendirent en Judée. Il y demeurait avec eux et il baptisait.
[3:23] Jean baptisait également à Ainon, près de Salim, parce qu'il y avait là beaucoup d'eau. On y venait alors recevoir le baptême.
[3:24] En effet, Jean n'avait pas encore été mis en prison.
[3:25] Or, à la suite d'une discussion des disciples de Jean et d'un Juif à propos de la purification,
[3:26] ceux-ci vinrent à Jean et lui dirent: «Rabbi, celui qui était avec toi au delà du Jourdain, celui dont tu as été le témoin, voici qu'il baptise et que tout le monde vient à lui.»
[3:27] Jean répondit par ces paroles : «Un homme ne peut rien prendre qui ne lui soit donné du ciel.
[3:28] Vous-mêmes vous me rendez le témoignage que j'ai dit : «Je ne suis pas, moi, le Christ ; mais je suis envoyé devant lui.»
[3:29] L'époux c'est celui qui a l'épouse ; l'ami de l'époux qui se tient près de lui et l'écoute, est réjoui d'une grande joie par la voix de l'époux. Cette joie-là est pleinement mienne.
[3:30] Lui, il faut qu'il croisse ; moi, que je diminue.»
[3:31] «Celui qui vient d'en haut est au-dessus de tous. Celui qui vient de la terre est de la terre et parle de la terre ; celui qui vient du ciel est au-dessus de tous ;
[3:32] il atteste ce qu'il a vu et entendu et personne n'accepte son témoignage.
[3:33] Celui qui accepte son témoignage confirme que Dieu est véridique.
[3:34] Car ce sont les paroles de Dieu que prononce celui que Dieu a envoyé, parce que ce n'est pas avec mesure que Dieu donne l'Esprit.
[3:35] Le Père aime le Fils, et a tout remis entre ses mains.
[3:36] Qui croit au Fils a la vie éternelle ; qui refuse de croire au Fils ne verra pas la vie ; mais la colère de Dieu demeure sur lui.»
[4:1] Ayant su que les Pharisiens avaient ouï dire qu'il faisait plus de disciples et baptisait plus que Jean
[4:2] (quoiqu'il ne baptisât pas lui-même ; c'étaient ses disciples qui baptisaient),
[4:3] le Seigneur quitta la Judée et repartit pour la Galilée.
[4:4] Il lui fallait alors traverser la Samarie.
[4:5] Il arriva donc à une ville de ce pays nommé Sychar, près de la terre que Jacob avait donnée à son fils Joseph.
[4:6] Là se trouvait le puits de Jacob. Fatigué par le voyage, Jésus s'assit sur le puits ; il était environ la sixième heure.
[4:7] Survint pour puiser de l'eau une femme de la Samarie.«Donne-moi à boire», lui dit Jésus.
[4:8] (Ses disciples étaient allés à la ville pour acheter des vivres.)
[4:9] La femme samaritaine lui répondit : Comment me demandes-tu à boire, toi, qui es Juif, à moi qui suis Samaritaine?» (Les Juifs, en effet, n'ont point de rapports avec les Samaritains.)
[4:10] Jésus alors lui adressa ces paroles : «Si tu savais le don de Dieu, et quel est celui qui te dit : «Donne-moi à boire», tu lui ferais toi-même une telle demande, et il te donnerait de l'eau vive.»
[4:11] «Seigneur, lui dit la femme, tu n'as rien pour puiser, et le puits est profond. D'où as-tu cette eau vive?
[4:12] Es-tu plus grand que notre père Jacob, lequel nous a donné ce puits, et qui y a bu lui-même ainsi que ses fils et ses troupeaux?»
[4:13] Jésus lui répondit par ces paroles : «Quiconque boit de l'eau que voici aura soif de nouveau ;
[4:14] mais celui qui boira de l'eau que je lui donnerai n'aura plus jamais soif ; au contraire, l'eau que je lui donnerai deviendra en lui une source d'eau jaillissant en vie éternelle.»
[4:15] «Seigneur, reprit la femme, donne-moi cette eau-là, pour que je n'aie plus soif, et que je ne vienne plus ici pour puiser.»
[4:16] «Va appeler ton mari, lui dit Jésus, et reviens ici.»
[4:17] La femme répondit ainsi: «Je n'ai pas de mari.» Jésus repartit: «Tu as raison de dire : «je n'ai pas de mari» ;
[4:18] en effet, tu as eu cinq maris et celui que tu as maintenant n'est pas ton mari ; en cela, tu as dit vrai.»
[4:19] «Seigneur, lui dit la femme, je vois que tu es prophète.
[4:20] Nos pères ont adoré sur cette montagne-ci ; et vous dites, vous, qu'à Jérusalem est le lieu où il faut adorer.»
[4:21] «Femme, crois-moi, lui dit Jésus, il vient une heure où ni sur cette montagne-ci, ni à Jérusalem vous n'adorerez le Père.
[4:22] Vous adorez, vous, ce que vous ne connaissez pas ; nous, nous adorons ce que nous connaissons, parce que le salut vient des Juifs.
[4:23] Mais il vient une heure, et elle est déjà venue, où les vrais adorateurs adoreront le Père en esprit et en vérité ; car ce sont de tels adorateurs que demande le Père ;
[4:24] Dieu est esprit, et il faut que ceux qui l'adorent, l'adorent en esprit et en vérité.»
[4:25] «Je sais, repartit la femme, qu'il va venir un Messie» — (ce mot signifie Christ). — «Quand il viendra, il nous apprendra tout.»
[4:26] Jésus lui dit : «Je le suis, moi qui te parle.»
[4:27] En ce moment, arrivèrent ses disciples ; ils furent surpris de ce qu'il parlait à une femme. Aucun d'eux pourtant ne lui dit : «Que lui demandes-tu?» ou : «Pourquoi t'entretiens-tu avec elle?»
[4:28] Quant à celle-ci, laissant là sa cruche, elle partit pour la ville et dit aux uns et aux autres :
[4:29] «Venez voir un homme qui m'a dit tout ce que j'ai fait ; ne serait-ce pas le Christ?»
[4:30] Ils sortirent de la ville, et ils allaient vers Jésus.
[4:31] Dans l'intervalle, les disciples insistaient auprès de lui et lui disaient : «Rabbi, mange.»
[4:32] «J'ai pour me nourrir, leur répondit-il, un aliment que vous ne connaissez pas.»
[4:33] Les disciples s'interrogeaient l'un l'autre : «Quelqu'un lui a-t-il apporté à manger ?»
[4:34] «Ma nourriture, reprit Jésus, c'est de faire la volonté de Celui qui m'a envoyé, c'est d'accomplir son oeuvre.
[4:35] Vous dites, n'est-ce pas, qu'il y a encore quatre mois avant la moisson. Eh bien! moi, je vous dis : levez les yeux et regardez ces campagnes, elles sont blanches pour la moisson.
[4:36] Déjà le moissonneur reçoit son salaire, et ramasse du fruit pour la vie éternelle, afin que le semeur se réjouisse en même temps que le moissonneur.
[4:37] Ici se vérifie cette parole : autre est le semeur, autre le moissonneur.
[4:38] Je vous ai envoyé moissonner là où vous n'aviez point travaillé. D'autres ont travaillé et vous, vous êtes entrés dans leur travails.»
[4:39] Beaucoup de Samaritains de cette ville crurent en lui d'après le témoignage porté par cette femme : «Il m'a dit tout ce que j'ai fait.»
[4:40] Aussi ces Samaritains vinrent-ils le prier de s'arrêter chez eux. Jésus y passa deux jours ;
[4:41] et un bien plus grand nombre encore crurent en lui, après avoir écouté sa parole.
[4:42] «Ce n'est plus sur ton récit que nous croyons, disaient-ils à la femme ; car nous l'avons entendu nous-mêmes, et nous savons qu'il est vraiment le Sauveur du monde.»
[4:43] Après ces deux jours, Jésus partit de là et s'en alla en Galilée.
[4:44] Il est vrai qu'il avait lui-même déclaré que «dans sa propre patrie un prophète est sans honneur».
[4:45] Cependant quand il y arriva, les Galiléens l'accueillirent à cause de tout ce qu'ils lui avaient vu faire à Jérusalem pendant la fête à laquelle eux aussi avaient assisté.
[4:46] Jésus se rendit aussi de nouveau à Cana de Galilée, où il avait changé l'eau en vin. Or, il y avait à Capharnaüm un officier royal dont le fils était malade.
[4:47] Cet officier ayant appris que Jésus, venant de Judée, était arrivé dans le pays, alla le trouver et le pria de descendre à Capharnaüm pour guérir son fils, qui était mourant.
[4:48] Jésus lui dit: «A moins d'avoir sous vos yeux des miracles et des prodiges vous ne croyez pas!» —
[4:49] «Viens, Seigneur, reprit cet officier du roi, avant que mon enfant meure!» —
[4:50] Jésus lui répondit : «Va, ton fils vit.» Cet homme crut à la parole que lui avait dite Jésus et s'en alla.
[4:51] Il était déjà en route lorsqu'il rencontra ses serviteurs qui lui annoncèrent que son enfant était vivant.
[4:52] Il leur demanda à quelle heure l'enfant s'était senti mieux. «Hier, répondirent-ils, à la septième heure la fièvre l'a quitté.»
[4:53] Le père constata que c'était à cette heure même que Jésus lui avait dit : «Ton fils vit.» Dès lors il devint croyant, ainsi que tous ceux de sa maison.
[4:54] C'était un nouveau miracle, le second que fit Jésus à son retour de Judée en Galilée.
[5:1] Après cela, vint une fête des Juifs et Jésus monta à Jérusalem.
[5:2] Or, il s'y trouve près de la Porte-des-Brebis une piscine (le mot hébreu est Bethzatha) ; elle a cinq portiques
[5:3] sous lesquels étaient étendus une multitude de malades : aveugles, estropiés, perclus. (Ils attendaient l'agitation de l'eau ;)
[5:4] (à certains moments, en effet, un ange descendait dans la piscine et mettait l'eau en mouvement, et le premier qui entrait dans la piscine après ce bouillonnement de l'eau était guéri, quelle que fût sa maladie.)
[5:5] Il y avait là un homme dont la maladie remontait à trente-huit ans.
[5:6] Le voyant couché et sachant qu'il était là depuis longtemps, Jésus lui dit : «Veux-tu être guéri?» —
[5:7] «Seigneur, lui répondit le malade, je n'ai personne pour me jeter dans la piscine lorsque l'eau vient à bouillonner. Pendant que j'y vais, un autre y descend avant moi.»
[5:8] Jésus lui dit : «Lève-toi, prends ton grabat et marche.»
[5:9] Cet homme fut immédiatement guéri ; il prit son grabat ; il marchait. Or ceci se passait en un jour de sabbat.
[5:10] Alors les Juifs s'adressèrent à l'homme guéri : «C'est le jour du sabbat ; il ne t'est point permis d'emporter ce grabat.»
[5:11] Il leur répliqua : «Celui-là même qui m'a guéri m'a dit : «Prends ton grabat et marche.» —
[5:12] «Quel est cet homme, lui demandèrent-ils, qui t'a dit de le prendre et de marcher?»
[5:13] Mais l'homme guéri ne savait pas qui c'était ; Jésus, d'ailleurs, s'était retiré parce qu'il y avait foule en ce lieu.
[5:14] Quelque temps après Jésus rencontra cet homme dans le Temple et lui dit : «Te voilà guéri ; ne pèche plus de peur qu'il ne t'arrive quelque chose de pire.»
[5:15] Cet homme s'en alla dire aux Juifs que c'était Jésus qui l'avait guéri.
[5:16] Et c'est parce que Jésus agissait de la sorte le jour du sabbat, c'est pour cela même que les Juifs le poursuivaient.
[5:17] Mais lui, il leur dit : «Mon Père jusqu'à présent agit, et moi aussi j'agis.»
[5:18] Là-dessus, les Juifs cherchaient d'autant plus à le faire mourir ; non seulement parce qu'il annulait le sabbat, mais parce qu'en outre il disait que Dieu était son propre Père, se faisant l'égal de Dieu.
[5:19] Jésus alors leur adressa ces paroles : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, le Fils ne peut rien faire de lui-même ; il ne fait que ce qu'il voit faire au Père. En effet, tout ce que le Père fait, le Fils aussi le fait également ;
[5:20] car le Père aime le Fils et lui montre tout ce qu'il fait ; et il lui montrera des oeuvres plus grandes que celles-ci, pour que vous soyez remplis d'admiration.
[5:21] De même, en effet, que le Père ressuscite les morts et vivifie, de, même le Fils vivifie qui il veut.
[5:22] Car le Père ne juge qui que ce soit ; mais il a remis au Fils tout le jugement
[5:23] afin que tous honorent le Fils comme ils honorent le Père. Celui qui n'honore pas le Fils n'honore pas le Père qui l'a envoyé.»
[5:24] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, celui qui écoute ma parole et croit à Celui qui m'a envoyé, possède une vie éternelle et ne comparaît point en jugement : de la mort il est passé à la vie.
[5:25] En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, il vient une heure, et elle est déjà venue, où les morts entendront la voix du Fils de Dieu, et ceux qui l'auront entendue vivront.
[5:26] Car, comme le Père a la vie en soi, ainsi il a donné au Fils d'avoir la vie en soi,
[5:27] et il lui a donné la puissance d'exercer un jugement, parce qu'il est fils d'homme.
[5:28] Ne vous étonnez pas de cela ; car il vient une heure où tous ceux qui sont dans les sépulcres entendront sa voix,
[5:29] et en sortiront ; ceux qui auront fait le bien ressusciteront pour vivre, et ceux qui auront fait le mal ressusciteront pour être jugés.»
[5:30] «Je ne puis, moi, rien faire de moi-même ; comme j'entends, je juge, et mon jugement est juste, parce que je ne cherche pas ma volonté, mais la volonté de Celui qui m'a envoyé.»
[5:31] «Si c'est moi qui me rends témoignage à moi-même, mon témoignage n'est pas véridique.
[5:32] Il en est un autre qui me rend témoignage, et le témoignage qu'il me rend est, je le sais, véridique.»
[5:33] «Vous vous êtes adressés à Jean, et il a rendu témoignage à la vérité.
[5:34] Quant à moi, ce n'est pas le témoignage qui vient d'un homme que j'accepte, mais j'en parle afin que vous soyez sauvés.
[5:35] Il était lui le flambeau qui brûle et qui brille et, à sa clarté, vous vous êtes plu un moment à vous réjouir.»
[5:36] «Quant à moi, j'ai le témoignage qui est plus grand que celui de Jean ; car j'ai les oeuvres que le Père m'a donné d'accomplir ; ce sont ces oeuvres mêmes, celles que je fais, qui rendent témoignage de moi et attestent que le Père m'a envoyé.»
[5:37] «De plus, le Père qui m'a envoyé a, lui aussi, rendu témoignage de moi. Vous n'avez jamais ni écouté sa voix ni contemplé sa face,
[5:38] et sa parole vous ne l'avez pas demeurant en vous, puisque vous ne croyez pas à celui qu'Il a envoyé.»
[5:39] «Vous scrutez les Écritures, parce que vous pensez y trouver la vie éternelle, et elles aussi, elles me rendent témoignage.»
[5:40] «Et vous ne voulez pas venir à moi pour avoir la vie !»
[5:41] «La gloire qui vient des hommes, je ne l'accepte pas ;
[5:42] mais je vous connais pour n'avoir pas l'amour de Dieu en vous :
[5:43] moi, qui suis venu au nom de mon Père, vous ne me recevez pas! Qu'un autre se présente en son propre nom, et vous le recevrez!»
[5:44] «Comment pourriez-vous croire, vous qui recevez votre gloire les uns des autres et ne recherchez pas la gloire qui vient de Dieu seul?
[5:45] Ne pensez pas que, devant le Père, ce soit moi qui vous accuserai. Votre accusateur c'est Moïse en qui vous mettez votre espoir.
[5:46] Car si vous croyiez à Moïse, vous croiriez à moi-même ; en effet, c'est de moi que parlent ses écrits ;
[5:47] mais si vous ne croyez pas à ce qu'il a écrit, comment croirez-vous à mes paroles ?»
[6:1] Ensuite Jésus passa de l'autre côté de la mer de Galilée (ou de Tibériade).
[6:2] Il était suivi d'une foule immense, attirée par les miracles qu'il opérait sur les malades.
[6:3] Il gravit la montagne et y fit sa demeure ainsi que ses disciples.
[6:4] C'était aux approches de la fête juive de la Pâque.
[6:5] Ayant levé les yeux, Jésus aperçut l'immense foule qui venait à lui, et dit à Philippe : «Où achèterons-nous des pains pour leur donner à manger?»
[6:6] (Il lui parlait ainsi pour le mettre à l'épreuve ; car, lui, il savait ce qu'il allait faire.)
[6:7] «Pour que chacun en eût tant soit peu, lui répondit Philippe, deux cents deniers de pains seraient insuffisants.»
[6:8] L'un des disciples (c'était. André, le, frère de Simon Pierre) dit à Jésus :
[6:9] «Il y a ici un petit garçon qui a cinq pains d'orge et deux poissons ; mais pour une pareille foule qu'est-ce que cela?» —
[6:10] «Faites asseoir ces gens», dit Jésus. En ce lieu-là, l'herbe était abondante. Les hommes s'assirent au nombre d'environ cinq mille.
[6:11] Jésus prit alors les pains, prononça l'action de grâces et les distribua à ceux qui étaient assis ; il fit de même avec les poissons ; ils en eurent autant qu'ils en voulaient.
[6:12] Quand tous furent rassasiés, il dit à ses disciples : «Ramassez, pour que rien ne se perde, les morceaux qui sont restés.»
[6:13] Ils les ramassèrent donc ; et, avec ces morceaux des cinq pains d'orge, avec ce superflu du repas, ils remplirent douze paniers.
[6:14] Tous ces gens, s'apercevant qu'il avait fait un miracle, disaient : «C'est vraiment là le prophète qui doit venir dans le monde.»
[6:15] Sachant alors qu'ils allaient l'enlever de force pour le faire roi, Jésus se retiras de nouveau, lui seul, dans la montagne.
[6:16] Quand vint le soir, ses disciples redescendirent vers la mer ;
[6:17] ils montèrent dans une barque et entreprirent la traversée dans la direction de Capharnaüm. Il faisait déjà nuit, Jésus ne les avait pas encore rejoints,
[6:18] et la mer s'enflait au souffle d'un grand vent.
[6:19] Les disciples avaient parcouru environ vingt-cinq ou trente stades, quand ils aperçurent Jésus, marchant sur la mer et s'approchant de la barque. L'épouvante les saisit,
[6:20] mais Jésus leur dit : «C'est moi, soyez sans crainte.»
[6:21] Ils voulurent alors le recevoir dans la barque, et tout aussitôt elle se trouva à terre, là où ils allaient.
[6:22] Le lendemain, les multitudes, restées de l'autre côté de la mer, remarquèrent que Jésus n'était pas entré avec ses disciples dans la seule et unique barque qui fût là, et que ceux-ci étaient partis seuls.
[6:23] D'autres bateaux cependant arrivèrent de Tibériade près de l'endroit où, à la suite de l'action de grâces du Seigneur, tous avaient été nourris.
[6:24] Les multitudes, qui finirent par se convaincre que, de même que ses disciples, Jésus n'était plus là, montèrent dans ces embarcations pour aller le chercher à Capharnaüm.
[6:25] Et l'ayant en effet trouvé sur l'autre rive, elles lui demandèrent : «Rabbi, quand es-tu venu ici?»
[6:26] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles: «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, vous me cherchez non pas à cause des miracles que vous avez vus, mais à cause des pains dont vous avez été nourris et rassasiés.
[6:27] Travaillez à acquérir, non l'aliment qui périt, mais l'aliment qui subsiste en vie éternelle, et que le Fils de l'homme vous donnera, le Fils de l'homme que le Père, que Dieu a marqué de son sceau.»
[6:28] «Que devons-nous faire, lui dirent-ils, pour travailler aux oeuvres de Dieu?»
[6:29] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «L'oeuvre de Dieu est d'avoir foi en celui qu'Il a envoyé.»
[6:30] Alors ils lui demandèrent: «Quel est le miracle que tu fais afin que nous le voyions et que nous ayons foi en toi? Quelle est l'oeuvre que tu accomplis?
[6:31] Nos pères ont mangé la manne dans le désert comme cela est écrit: «Il leur donna à manger un pain qui vient du ciel.»
[6:32] «Le pain qui vient du ciel, leur répondit Jésus, en vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, Moïse ne vous l'a pas donné ; mais c'est mon Père qui vous donne le pain qui vient du ciel, le pain véritable.
[6:33] Le pain de Dieu est, en effet, celui qui descend du ciel et qui donne la vie au monde.»
[6:34] «Seigneur, lui demandèrent-ils, donne-nous toujours ce pain-là.»
[6:35] Jésus leur dit alors : «C'est moi qui suis le pain de la vie. Celui qui vient à moi n'aura jamais faim ; celui qui croit en moi n'aura jamais soif.
[6:36] Mais je vous l'ai dit: Bien que vous m'ayez vu, vous ne croyez pas.»
[6:37] «A moi viendra tout ce que le Père me donne, et celui qui vient à moi je ne le repousserai point au dehors ;
[6:38] car je suis descendu du ciel, non pour faire ma volonté, mais la volonté de Celui qui m'a envoyé.
[6:39] Or, la volonté de Celui qui m'a envoyé, c'est que je ne perde rien de ce qu'il m'a donné, mais que je ressuscite tout au dernier jour.
[6:40] Oui, la volonté de mon Père c'est que quiconque contemple le Fils et croit en lui ait la vie éternelle, et moi-même je le ressusciterai au dernier jour.»
[6:41] Cependant les Juifs murmuraient contre cette parole de lui : «C'est moi qui suis le pain descendu du ciel.» —
[6:42] «Est-ce que ce n'est pas là Jésus, le fils de Joseph, disaient-ils, Jésus dont nous connaissons le père et la mère? Comment cet homme peut-il dire: «je suis descendu du ciel?»
[6:43] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles: «Ne murmurez pas entre vous ;
[6:44] nul ne peut venir à moi, sans être attiré par le Père qui m'a envoyé, et c'est moi qui ressusciterai celui-là au dernier jour.
[6:45] Il est écrit dans les prophètes : «Ils seront tous enseignés de Dieu.» «Quiconque a entendu le Père et a appris, vient à moi.
[6:46] Non que quelqu'un ait vu le Père, sauf celui qui est de la part de Dieu, lui, il a vu le Père.»
[6:47] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, celui qui croit a la vie éternelle.
[6:48] Je suis, moi, le pain de la vie.
[6:49] Vos pères ont mangé la manne dans le désert ; puis ils sont morts.
[6:50] Voici le pain descendant du ciel, afin qu'on en mange et qu'on ne meure points.
[6:51] Je suis, moi, le pain vivant descendu du ciel. Si quelqu'un mange de ce pain, il vivra éternellement. Et le pain que je donnerai pour la vie du monde, c'est ma chair.»
[6:52] Il y eut alors un débat entre les Juifs ; ils disaient : «Comment cet homme peut-il nous donner à manger sa chair?»
[6:53] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, reprit Jésus, si vous ne mangez la chair du Fils de l'homme, et si vous ne buvez son sang, vous n'avez pas la vie en vous-mêmes.
[6:54] Qui mange ma chair et boit mon sang a la vie éternelle, et je le ressusciterai au dernier jour.
[6:55] Car ma chair est une vraie nourriture, et mon sang est un vrai breuvage.
[6:56] Celui qui mange ma chair et boit mon sang demeure en moi et moi en lui.
[6:57] De même que Celui qui est vivant, le Père, m'a envoyé et que, moi, je vis par le Père, de même aussi celui qui me mange vivra par moi.
[6:58] Tel est le pain descendu du ciel. Il n'en est pas de lui comme de la manne dont se nourrirent vos pères, lesquels sont morts ensuite. Celui qui mange ce pain-ci vivra éternellement.»
[6:59] Telles furent les paroles de Jésus enseignant dans la synagogue à Capharnaüm.
[6:60] Après les avoir entendues, plusieurs de ses disciples dirent: «C'est dur à accepter ce qu'il dit là! Qui peut écouter ces paroles?»
[6:61] Sachant en lui-même les murmures de ses disciples à ce sujet, Jésus leur dit : «Cela vous scandalise!
[6:62] Et si vous voyiez le Fils de l'homme montant là où il était auparavant!
[6:63] C'est l'Esprit qui vivifie ; la chair ne sert de rien. Les paroles que je vous ai dites sont esprit et sont vie.
[6:64] Mais il en est parmi vous quelques-uns qui, ne croient pas!» (Dès le commencement, en effet, Jésus savait quels étaient ceux qui ne croyaient point, et quel était l'homme qui le livrerait.)
[6:65] «Voilà pourquoi, ajoutait-il, je vous ai dit que nul ne peut venir à moi, à moins que cela ne lui soit donné par le Père.»
[6:66] Ce fut alors qu'un grand nombre de ses disciples se retirèrent ; ils ne furent plus de sa suite ; ils ne marchaient plus avec lui.
[6:67] «Et vous, voulez-vous aussi vous en aller?» dit Jésus aux douze.
[6:68] Simon Pierre lui répondit : «Seigneur, à qui irions-nous? tu as des paroles de vie éternelle,
[6:69] et nous, nous avons cru et nous avons reconnu que tu es le Saint de Dieu.»
[6:70] Jésus reprit : «N'est-ce pas moi qui vous ai choisis tous les douze? eh bien, l'un de vous est un démon !»
[6:71] Il parlait de Judas, fils de Simon, l'Iskariôte. C'était lui, en effet, qui devait le livrer, lui, l'un des douze.
[7:1] Jésus, après ces choses, parcourait la Galilée, ne voulant pas, voyager en Judée, où les Juifs cherchaient à le faire périr.
[7:2] La fête juive dite des Tabernacles approchait cependant,
[7:3] et ses frères lui dirent : «Pars de ce pays-ci, transporte-toi en Judée, afin que les disciples que tu y comptes voient, eux aussi, les oeuvres que tu accomplis.
[7:4] On n'agit pas en cachette quand on veut se faire connaître ; si réellement tu fais ces choses, manifeste-toi toi-même au monde!»
[7:5] (En effet, ses frères non plus ne croyaient pas en lui.)
[7:6] Jésus leur répondit : «Mon temps, à moi, n'est pas encore venu ;
[7:7] pour vous, que le monde ne peut haïr, le moment est toujours opportun ; mais le monde me hait, moi, parce que je rends de lui le témoignage que ses oeuvres sont mauvaises.
[7:8] Rendez vous à la fête ; quant à moi, je ne vais pas à cette fête, parce que mon temps n'est pas encore accompli.»
[7:9] Cela dit, il demeura en Galilée.
[7:10] Puis, lorsque ses frères furent partis pour la fête, lui-même s'y rendit aussi, mais ce n'était pas d'une façon ostensible, c'était comme en cachettes.
[7:11] Pendant la fête, cependant, les Juifs s'informaient de lui: «Où donc est-il», demandait-on.
[7:12] Dans la foule, une quantité de bruits couraient sur lui : «C'est un homme de bien», disaient ceux-ci. «Nullement, c'est tout le contraire», disaient ceux-là, «il égare la foule» ;
[7:13] mais personne, par crainte des Juifs, n'osait s'exprimer tout haut sur son compte.
[7:14] On était déjà au milieu de la fête, lorsque Jésus monta au Temple ;
[7:15] il se mit à enseigner au grand étonnement des Juifs. «Comment, disaient-ils, cet homme est-il si instruit, lui qui n'a pas étudié?»
[7:16] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «Mon enseignement n'est pas de moi s, mais de Celui qui m'a envoyé.
[7:17] Si quelqu'un veut faire sa volonté, il saura si mon enseignement est de Dieu s ou si je parle de mon chef.
[7:18] L'homme qui parle de son chef poursuit sa gloire propre ; mais l'homme qui poursuit la gloire de celui qui l'a envoyé, est véridique, lui, et il n'y a en lui aucun manque de droiture.
[7:19] N'est-ce pas Moïse qui vous a donné la Loi? Et aucun de vous ne la met en pratique! Pourquoi cherchez-vous à me tuer?»
[7:20] La foule répondit: «Tu es possédé d'un démon ; qui est-ce qui, cherche à te tuer ?»
[7:21] Jésus répliqua par ces paroles : «Une seule oeuvre accomplie par moi, vous a tous surpris.
[7:22] Moïse vous a donné la circoncision (elle n'a pas été instituée par Moïse, elle vient des patriarches), cette circoncision vous la pratiquez le jour du sabbat.
[7:23] Eh bien, si on peut, pour ne pas violer la loi de Moïse, pratiquer la circoncision le jour du sabbat, pourquoi vous irriter contre moi pour avoir, ce même jour de sabbat, rendu un homme entièrement sain?
[7:24] Ne jugez pas sur l'apparence ; jugez au contraire suivant la justice.»
[7:25] Parmi les habitants de Jérusalem quelques-uns disaient : «N'est-ce point cet homme que l'on cherche à faire périr?
[7:26] Le voici qui parle en toute liberté, et on ne lui dit rien! Les autorités auraient-elles vraiment reconnu qu'il est le Christ?
[7:27] Nous savons pourtant d'où est celui-ci ; or quand le Christ vient, personne ne sait d'où il est.»
[7:28] Alors Jésus, qui enseignait dans le Temple, s'écria : «Vous me connaissez! vous savez d'où je suis! mais je ne suis pas venu de moi-même. Il y en a un qui réellement m'a envoyé, et Celui-là vous ne le connaissez pas!
[7:29] Moi je le connais, parce que je viens de lui et que c'est lui qui m'a envoyé.»
[7:30] Là-dessus, ils cherchèrent à l'arrêter ; personne toutefois ne porta la main sur lui, parce que son heure n'était pas encore venue.
[7:31] Dans la foule un grand nombre crurent en lui. «Lorsque le Christ viendra, disaient-ils, fera-t-il plus de miracles que n'en a fait cet homme-là?»
[7:32] Les Pharisiens entendirent ces rumeurs de la foule ; aussi, de concert avec les chefs des prêtres, envoyèrent-ils des agents pour l'arrêter.
[7:33] Jésus dit alors : «Je suis encore avec vous pour un peu de temps ; après quoi je retourne à Celui qui m'a envoyé.
[7:34] Vous me chercherez et vous ne me trouverez pas et, au lieu où je suis, vous ne pouvez venir.»
[7:35] Les Juifs se demandaient entre eux : «Où donc va-t-il aller, que nous ne le trouverons pas? Va-t-il aller chez les disséminés, parmi les païens et instruire les païens?
[7:36] Qu'est-ce que ce mot qu'il a prononcé : «vous me chercherez et vous ne me trouverez pas ; et au lieu où je suis vous ne pouvez venir.»
[7:37] Durant le dernier jour de la fête, qui en est le plus solennel, Jésus, se tenant debout, s'écria : «Si quelqu'un a soif, qu'il vienne à moi et qu'il boive!
[7:38] Comme dit l'Écriture: «Du sein de celui qui croit en moi jailliront des fleuves d'eau vives. »
[7:39] Il disait cela de l'Esprit que devaient recevoir ceux qui avaient cru en lui. En effet, il n'y avait pas encore d'Esprit, parce que Jésus n'était pas encore glorifié.
[7:40] Dans la multitude, ceux qui avaient entendu ces paroles disaient: «C'est vraiment le prophète!»
[7:41] d'autres : «C'est le Christ !» d'autres encore :
[7:42] «Est-ce que le Christ doit sortir de la Gaulée? Est-ce que l'Écriture ne dit pas que le Christ sortira de la famille de David et du village de Bethléem d'où était David?»
[7:43] On était donc dans le peuple fort divisé à son sujet.
[7:44] Un certain nombre d'entre eux voulaient l'arrêter ; mais aucun ne porta la main sur lui.
[7:45] Les agents retournèrent auprès des chefs des prêtres et des Pharisiens. «Pourquoi ne l'avez-vous pas amené!» demandèrent ceux-ci.»
[7:46] A quoi les agents répondirent : «Jamais homme n'a parlé comme parle cet homme.» -
[7:47] «Vous êtes-vous aussi laissé séduire?» leur dirent les Pharisiens.
[7:48] «Est-ce qu'il y a un seul personnage ayant autorité qui ait cru en lui? Est-ce qu'il y a un seul Pharisien?
[7:49] Il n'y a que cette maudite populace qui n'entend rien à la Loi !»
[7:50] Nicodème, un des leurs, celui qui était venu à Jésus tout d'abord, leur dit :
[7:51] «Est-ce que notre Loi juge un homme sans qu'il soit entendu et sans qu'on se soit rendu compte de ses actes?»
[7:52] Ils lui répondirent ainsi : «Serais-tu, toi aussi, de la Galilée? informe-toi, et tu verras que de la Galilée ne surgit pas de prophète.»
[7:53] (Après quoi, chacun d’eux retourna à sa maison.)
[8:1] (Quant à Jésus, il alla au mont des Oliviers.)
[8:2] Au point du jour, il revint au Temple. Tout le peuple accourait à lui. Jésus s'était assis et enseignait,
[8:3] lorsque les Scribes et les Pharisiens lui amenèrent une femme qu'on avait surprise en adultère et la placèrent au milieu de tout le monde.
[8:4] «Maître, dirent-ils à Jésus, cette femme a été saisie en flagrant délit d'adultère.
[8:5] Or, dans la Loi, Moïse [nous] a ordonné de lapider ces femmes-là. Et toi, quel est ton avis?»
[8:6] Ils parlaient ainsi pour le mettre à l'épreuve et avoir un prétexte à accusation.] Quant à Jésus, il s'était baissé et il écrivait sur le sol avec son doigt.
[8:7] Ceux qui l'interrogeaient ayant persisté, il se releva et [leur] dit : «Que celui d'entre vous qui est sans péché lui jette la pierre le premier.»
[8:8] Puis se penchant de nouveau, il continua d'écrire sur le sol.
[8:9] Mais, en entendant cette réponse, ils sortirent un à un, à commencer par les plus âgés. Et [Jésus] resta seul avec la femme, toujours là, au milieu.
[8:10] Alors il se leva et lui dit : «Femme, où sont-ils [tes accusateurs]? Est-ce qu'aucun ne t'a condamnée?» — «Aucun. Seigneur», répondit-elle.
[8:11] Jésus lui dit: «Moi non plus je ne te condamne pas. Va et [désormais] ne pèche plus !»)
[8:12] Jésus leur parla de nouveau disant : «Je suis la lumière du, monde. Qui me suit ne marchera pas dans les ténèbres ; mais il aura la lumière de la vie.»
[8:13] Alors les Pharisiens lui dirent : «C'est toi-même qui témoignes de toi-même, ton témoignage n'est pas valable.»
[8:14] Jésus leur répondit par ces paroles : «Bien que je sois à moi-même mon propre témoin, mon témoignage est valable, parce que je sais d'où je suis venu et où je vais. Vous, vous ne savez ni d'où je viens, ni où je vais.
[8:15] Vous, vous jugez selon la chair, moi, je ne juge personne.
[8:16] Et s'il m'arrive de juger, mon jugement est véritable, parce que je ne suis pas seul, mais avec moi est le Père qui m'a envoyé,
[8:17] et il est écrit dans votre Loi que le témoignage de deux personnes est valable.
[8:18] Or il y a moi qui me rends témoignage à moi-même, et il y a le Père qui m'a envoyé, et qui, lui aussi, me rend témoignage.» —
[8:19] «Ton père, lui disaient-ils alors, où est-il?» — «Vous ne connaissez ni moi, ni mon Père, répondit Jésus ; si vous me connaissiez, vous connaîtriez également mon Père.»
[8:20] Il prononça ces paroles dans le Trésor, lorsqu'il enseignait au Temple. Personne ne l'arrêta, parce que son heure n'était pas encore venue.
[8:21] Il leur dit encore : «Je m'en vais ; vous me chercherez et vous, mourrez dans votre péché. Au lieu où je vais, vous ne pouvez venir.» —
[8:22] «Est-ce qu'il se donnera la mort ; se demandaient les Juifs, puisqu'il dit : «Au lieu où je vais, vous ne pouvez venir!»
[8:23] Jésus reprit : «Vous, vous êtes d'en bas ; moi, je suis d'en haut ; Vous, vous êtes de ce monde ; moi, je ne suis pas de ce monde.
[8:24] Aussi vous ai-je dit que vous mourrez dans vos péchés ; car si vous ne croyez pas que c'est moi vous mourrez dans vos péchés.»
[8:25] «Qui donc es-tu?» demandèrent-ils. Jésus leur répondit : «Avant tout, je suis ce que je vous dis.
[8:26] J'ai, sur vous, beaucoup à dire, j'ai beaucoup à juger, mais Celui qui m'a envoyé est véridique, et ce que j'ai entendu auprès de lui, je le proclame dans le monde.»
[8:27] Comme ils ne comprenaient pas qu'il leur parlait du Père,
[8:28] il ajouta : «Quand vous aurez élevé le Fils de l'homme, alors vous reconnaîtrez que c'est moi vous reconnaîtrez que je ne fais rien de moi-même, mais que je parle d'après les enseignements du Père.
[8:29] Celui qui m'a envoyé est avec moi ; il ne m'a pas laissé seul, parce que je fais toujours ce qui lui est agréable.»
[8:30] Pendant qu'il parlait ainsi, plusieurs crurent en lui.
[8:31] Or, à ces Juifs qui avaient eu foi en lui, Jésus disait : «Si vous demeurez dans ma parole, vous êtes véritablement mes disciples ;
[8:32] vous connaîtrez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres.»
[8:33] Ils lui répliquèrent: «Nous sommes du sang d'Abraham et nous n'avons jamais été les esclaves de qui que ce soit. Comment dis-tu : «Vous deviendrez libres.»
[8:34] Jésus leur répondit : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, quiconque commet le péché est l'esclave du péché ;
[8:35] or ce n'est pas pour toujours que l'esclave demeure dans la maison, le Fils y demeure toujours ;
[8:36] si donc le Fils vous affranchit, vous serez véritablement libres.
[8:37] Je sais que vous êtes de la descendance d'Abraham ; mais, parce que ma parole n'a pas prise sur vous, vous cherchez à me faire périr.
[8:38] Ce que j'ai vu auprès du Père, moi, je le dis ; ce que vous avez appris de votre père, vous, vous le faites.»
[8:39] Ils répondirent par ces paroles : «Notre père à nous, c'est Abraham.» «Si vous étiez enfants d'Abraham, leur dit Jésus, vous feriez les oeuvres d'Abraham ;
[8:40] au lieu de cela, vous cherchez à me mettre à mort, moi, un homme qui vous ai dit la vérité, que j'ai entendue auprès de Dieu. Cela, Abraham ne l'a pas fait.
[8:41] Vous, vous faites les oeuvres de votre père.» «Nous ne sommes pas le produit de quelque fornication, répliquèrent-ils, nous avons un seul Père : Dieu.»
[8:42] «Si Dieu était votre Père, reprit Jésus, vous m'aimeriez! car de Dieu je suis sorti et je viens ; ce n'est pas, en effet, de moi-même que je suis venu ; mais c'est lui qui m'a envoyé.
[8:43] Pourquoi ne reconnaissez-vous pas mon langage? parce que vous ne pouvez entendre s ma parole.
[8:44] Vous avez le diable pour père, et c'est aux convoitises de votre père que vous voulez obéir. Dès le commencement, celui-là fut homicide, et il ne se tient pas dans la vérité, parce qu'il n'y a point de vérité en lui. Quand il profère le mensonge, il parle de son propre fond, étant menteur et père du mensonge.
[8:45] Quant à moi, c'est parce que je dis la vérité que vous ne me croyez pas.
[8:46] Qui de vous me convaincra de péché? Si je dis la vérité, pourquoi ne me croyez-vous pas?
[8:47] Celui qui est de Dieu, entend les paroles de Dieu. Voici pourquoi vous, vous n'entendez pas: c'est que vous n'êtes pas de Dieu.»
[8:48] Les Juifs lui répondirent par ces paroles : «N'avons-nous pas raison de dire que tu es un Samaritain et un possédé du démon?»
[8:49] «Je ne suis pas un possédé du démon, répliqua Jésus, mais j'honore mon Père, et vous, vous me déshonorez.
[8:50] Pour moi, je ne cherche pas ma gloire ; il est quelqu'un qui la cherche et qui juge.
[8:51] En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, si quelqu'un garde ma parole, il ne verra jamais la mort.»
[8:52] Nous sommes maintenant convaincus, lui dirent les Juifs, que tu es possédé du démon. Abraham est mort ainsi que les prophètes, et toi, tu dis : «Si quelqu'un garde ma parole, il ne goûtera jamais la mort.»
[8:53] Es-tu plus grand que notre père Abraham qui est mort? que les prophètes, qui sont morts? Qui prétends-tu être ?»
[8:54] Jésus répondit : «Si je me glorifie moi-même, ma gloire n'est rien. C'est mon Père qui me glorifie, mon Père dont vous dites qu'il est votre Dieu
[8:55] et que vous ne connaissez pas ; pour moi, je le connais entièrement. Et si je disais que je ne le connais pas entièrement, je serais comme vous, un menteur ; mais je le connais entièrement et je garde sa parole.
[8:56] Abraham votre père a tressailli de joie dans l'espoir de voir mon jour ; il l'a vu et il a été dans la joie.»
[8:57] «Tu n'as pas encore cinquante ans, repartirent les Juifs, et tu as vu Abraham !»
[8:58] Jésus leur dit : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, avant qu'Abraham fût, moi, je suis.»
[8:59] Alors ils prirent des pierres pour les lui jeter ; mais Jésus se cacha et sortit du Temple.
[9:1] Il vit, en passant, un aveugle de naissance.
[9:2] Ses disciples l'interrogèrent : «Rabbi, lui dirent-ils, est-ce le péché de cet homme, ou celui de ses parents, qui l'a fait naître aveugle?»
[9:3] Jésus répondit : «Ni lui, ni ses parents n'ont péché, mais il est aveugle pour que les oeuvres de Dieu soient manifestées en lui.
[9:4] Il faut, pendant qu'il est jour, que j'accomplisse les oeuvres de Celui qui m'a envoyé. La nuit arrive, où personne ne peut travailler.
[9:5] Pendant que je suis dans le monde, je suis la lumière du monde.»
[9:6] Ayant ainsi parlé, il cracha à terre ; et, formant de la boue avec sa salive, il étendit cette boue sur les yeux de l'aveugle ;
[9:7] puis il lui dit : «Va te laver à la piscine de Siloam (mot qui signifie : Envoyé).» L'aveugle alla se laver et revint voyant clair.
[9:8] Les voisins et les gens qui auparavant l'avaient remarqué, quand il demandait l'aumône, disaient : «N'est-ce pas là l'homme qui était assis et mendiait?» —
[9:9] «C'est bien lui», répondaient les uns. — «Nullement! affirmaient les autres, c'est quelqu'un qui lui ressemble.» Lui, il disait : «C'est bien moi.»
[9:10] On lui demanda il alors: «Comment tes yeux se sont-ils donc ouverts?»
[9:11] Il répondit: «Celui que l'on nomme Jésus a fait de la boue ; il l'a étendue sur mes yeux ; puis il m'a dit : «Va te laver à Siloam.» J'y suis allé ; je me suis lavé et j'y vois.»
[9:12] Ils lui demandèrent : «Et lui, où est-il?» — «Je n'en sais rien», répondit-il.
[9:13] On conduisit aux Pharisiens cet aveugle guéri.
[9:14] Or c'était un jour de sabbat que Jésus avait fait de la boue et lui avait ouvert les yeux.
[9:15] Les Pharisiens lui demandèrent à leur tour comment il avait recouvré la vue. «Il m'a mis de la boue sur les yeux, leur répondit-il ; je me suis lavé et j'y vois.»
[9:16] Là-dessus quelques-uns de ces Pharisiens dirent : «Cet homme, n'est pas de Dieu, puisqu'il n'observe pas le sabbat.» Mais d'autres : «Comment un pécheur peut-il faire de tels miracles?» Ils étaient en désaccord.
[9:17] Alors ils s'adressèrent de nouveau à l'aveugle: «Et toi, que dis-tu de lui, puisqu'il t'a ouvert les yeux?» — «C'est un prophète», répondit-il.
[9:18] Ne croyant pas que cet homme avait été aveugle et qu'il avait recouvré la vue, les Juifs mandèrent son père et sa mère,
[9:19] et ils leur posèrent ces questions : «Est-ce bien là votre fils que vous dites être aveugle de naissance? Comment se fait-il qu'il y voie maintenant?»
[9:20] Ses parents répondirent par ces paroles : «Nous savons que c'est là notre fils ; nous savons qu'il est né aveugle ;
[9:21] mais comment il se fait qu'il y voie maintenant, nous ne le savons pas ; quel est celui qui lui a ouvert les yeux, nous ne le savons pas. Interrogez-le ; il est d'âge à s'expliquer lui-même.»
[9:22] Les parents parlèrent ainsi par crainte des Juifs. Ceux-ci, en effet, avaient déjà décidé que quiconque reconnaîtrait que Jésus était le Christ, serait chassé de la synagogue.
[9:23] C'est pour cela que les parents dirent : « Il est d'âge à répondre, interrogez-le.»
[9:24] Alors les Pharisiens appelèrent pour la seconde fois l'homme qui avait été aveugle. «Rends gloire à Dieu! lui dirent-ils, nous savons que cet homme est un pécheur!»
[9:25] Et lui, il répondit : «S'il est un pécheur, je ne sais ; je sais une chose : j'étais aveugle et maintenant je vois !» —
[9:26] «Que t'a-t-il fait? reprirent-ils ; comment t'a-t-il ouvert les yeux?»
[9:27] Il répondit : «Je vous l'ai déjà dit, et vous n'avez pas écouté. Pourquoi voulez-vous l'entendre encore? Voulez-vous, vous aussi, devenir ses disciples?»
[9:28] Alors ils l'accablèrent d'injures, disant «C'est toi qui es son disciple ; nous sommes, nous, disciples de Moïse ;
[9:29] nous savons que Dieu a parlé à Moïse ; quant à cet homme, nous ne savons d'où il est.» —
[9:30] «Voici qui est fort étonnant, reprit l’aveugle guéri, vous ne savez d'où il est, alors qu'il m'a ouvert les yeux!
[9:31] Nous savons que Dieu n'écoute pas les pécheurs ; si, au contraire, quelqu'un craint Dieu et fait sa volonté, c'est celui-là que Dieu écoute.
[9:32] Jamais on n'a entendu dire que quelqu'un ait ouvert les yeux d'un aveugle-né.
[9:33] Si cet homme n'était pas de Dieu, il ne pourrait rien faire.» —
[9:34] «Tu es né dans le péché des pieds à la tête, lui répliquèrent-ils, et tu nous fais la leçon !» Et ils le jetèrent dehors.
[9:35] Jésus apprit qu'ils l'avaient ainsi chassé, et l'ayant rencontré, il lui dit : «Crois-tu au Fils de l'homme ?»
[9:36] Il lui répondit par ces paroles : «Qui est-il, Seigneur, pour que je croie en lui?»
[9:37] Jésus lui dit : «Tu l'as vu ; celui qui te parle, c'est lui.» —
[9:38] «Je crois, Seigneur», dit alors cet homme en se prosternant devant lui.
[9:39] Et Jésus dit : «C'est pour un jugement que je suis venu dans ce monde ; c'est pour que les aveugles voient et que ceux qui voient deviennent aveugles.»
[9:40] Ceux des Pharisiens qui étaient présents entendirent ce mot : «Et nous, demandèrent-ils, sommes nous aussi des aveugles?»
[9:41] Jésus leur répondit : «Si vous étiez aveugles, vous ne seriez point coupables ; mais comme vous dites à l'heure présente : «nous voyons», votre culpabilité reste entière.»
[10:1] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, celui qui n'entre pas par la porte dans le bercail des brebis, mais y monte de quelque autre côté, est un voleur et un brigand.
[10:2] Celui qui entre par la porte est berger des brebis.
[10:3] A celui-ci le portier ouvre, et les brebis entendent sa voix. Il appelle par leur nom les brebis qui lui appartiennent et les fait sortir.
[10:4] Quand il a fait sortir toutes les siennes, il marche devant elles et ses brebis le suivent parce qu'elles connaissent sa voix.
[10:5] Elles ne suivront point un étranger ; au contraire, elles fuiront loin de lui, car elles ne connaissent point la voix des étrangers.»
[10:6] Telle est la parabole que leur dit Jésus ; mais eux, ils ne comprirent pas de quoi il leur parlait.
[10:7] Jésus reprit donc : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, je suis la porte des brebis.
[10:8] Tous ceux qui sont venus avant moi sont des voleurs et des brigands, mais les brebis ne les ont pas écoutés.
[10:9] C'est moi qui suis la porte ; si quelqu'un entre par moi, il sera sauvé. Il entrera, il sortira, il trouvera sa pâture.
[10:10] Le voleur ne vient que pour dérober, égorger et détruire. Moi, je suis venu afin que les brebis aient la vis et qu'elles aient l'abondance.»
[10:11] «Je suis le bon berger. Le bon berger donne sa vie pour les brebis.
[10:12] Quant au mercenaire, quant à celui qui n'est pas berger, à qui les brebis n'appartiennent pas, s'il voit venir le loup, il abandonne les brebis et prend la fuite ; alors le loup les ravit et les disperse.
[10:13] Il agit ainsi parce qu'il est mercenaire et qu'il n'a nul soin des brebis.
[10:14] C'est moi qui suis le bon berger. Je connais mes brebis et mes brebis me connaissent,
[10:15] de la même façon que le Père me connaît et que, moi, je connais le Père ; et je donne ma vie pour les brebis.»
[10:16] «J'ai d'autres brebis, qui ne sont pas de ce bercail. Celles-là aussi il faut que je les amène. Elles entendront ma voix, et il y aura un seul troupeau, un seul berger.
[10:17] Voici pourquoi le Père m'aime : il m'aime parce que je donne ma vie pour la reprendre de nouveau.
[10:18] Personne ne me l'ôte, mais c'est moi qui la donne de moi-même ; j'ai le pouvoir de la donner ; j'ai le pouvoir de la reprendre ; tel est l'ordre que j'ai reçu de mon Père.»
[10:19] Ces paroles furent l'occasion de nouvelles divisions entre les Juifs.
[10:20] «C'est un possédé, disaient-ils pour la plupart, c'est un fou ; pourquoi l'écoutez-vous?»
[10:21] D'autres disaient : «Ce ne sont pas les paroles d'un possédé ; est-ce qu'un démon peut rendre ta vue aux aveugles?».
[10:22] C'était l'hiver et l'on célébrait à Jérusalem la fête de la Dédicace!
[10:23] Dans le Temple, sous le portique de Salomon, Jésus se promenait!
[10:24] Les Juifs firent cercle autour de lui et lui dirent: «Jusqu'à quand nous tiendras-tu l'esprit en suspens? Si tu es le Christ, dis-le-nous franchement.»
[10:25] «Je vous l'ai dit, et vous ne croyez pas, répondit Jésus. Les oeuvres que je fais au nom de mon Père, rendent témoignage de moi,
[10:26] mais vous ne croyez pas parce que vous n'êtes pas de mes brebis.
[10:27] Mes brebis à moi entendent ma voix ; je les connais, et elles me suivent.
[10:28] Je leur donne la vie éternelle ; elles ne périront jamais, et nul ne les ravira de nia main.
[10:29] Mon Père qui me les a données est plus grand que tous les hommes, et nul ne peut ravir ce qui est dans la main du Père.
[10:30] Moi et le Père nous sommes uns.»
[10:31] De nouveau les Juifs apportèrent des pierres pour le lapider.
[10:32] Jésus leur dit: «J'ai fait devant vous, de par le Père, beaucoup d'oeuvres excellentes ; pour laquelle de ces oeuvres me lapidez vous?» —
[10:33] «Ce n'est pour aucune oeuvre excellente que nous te lapidons, répliquèrent les Juifs, mais parce que tu blasphèmes, et que, toi qui n'es qu'un homme, tu te fais Dieu.»
[10:34] Jésus leur répondit : «N'est-il pas écrit dans votre Loi : «Moi, j'ai dit : vous êtes dieux.»
[10:35] «Eh bien, votre Loi a appelé «dieux» ceux auxquels s'adressait la parole de Dieu (et l'Écriture est indiscutable),
[10:36] et moi que le Père a consacré et a envoyé dans le monde, vous m'accusez de blasphème, parce que j'ai dit : je suis Fils de Dieu!»
[10:37] «Si je ne fais pas les oeuvres de mon Père, ne me croyez point.
[10:38] Mais si je les fais (quand même vous n'auriez aucune foi en mes paroles), croyez du moins à mes oeuvres ; qu'elles vous fassent savoir, qu'elles vous fassent reconnaître que le Père est en moi, et que moi je suis dans le Père.»
[10:39] (Encore une fois ils s'efforcèrent de mettre la main sur lui, mais il leur échappa
[10:40] et retourna sur l'autre rive du Jourdain, à l'endroit où Jean avait baptisé tout d'abord, et il y séjourna.
[10:41] Des multitudes vinrent à lui et l'on disait : «Jean, il est vrai, n'a fait aucun miracle ; mais tout ce qu'il a dit de celui-ci était vrai.»
[10:42] Là, un grand nombre eurent foi en lui.
[11:1] Il y avait un malade, nommé Lazare, qui était de Béthanie, le village de Marie et de Marthe, sa soeur.
[11:2] Ce fut cette Marie qui répandit un parfum sur le Seigneur, et qui lui essuya les pieds avec ses cheveux. Lazare, qui était malade, était son frère.
[11:3] Les soeurs envoyèrent dire à Jésus : «Seigneur, voilà celui que tu aimes qui est malade.» —
[11:4] «Cette maladie n'est pas à la mort, a dit Jésus en l'apprenant, mais elle est pour la gloire de Dieu, et afin que le Fils de Dieu soit glorifié par elle.»
[11:5] Or, Jésus aimait Marthe et sa soeur et Lazare.
[11:6] Lors donc qu'il eut appris la maladie de celui-ci, il demeura deux jours encore dans le lieu où il se trouvait.
[11:7] Après quoi, il dit aux disciples : «Retournons en Judée.» —
[11:8] «Rabbi, lui répondirent-ils, les Juifs te cherchaient tout dernièrement pour te lapider, et tu veux aller de nouveau vers eux!» —
[11:9] «N'y a-t-il pas douze heures à la journée, répliqua Jésus ; si quelqu'un marche pendant le jour, il ne trébuche pas, parce qu'il voit la lumière de ce monde ;
[11:10] mais s'il marche pendant la nuit, il trébuche, parce que la lumière n'est pas en lui.»
[11:11] Il parla ainsi ; puis il ajouta : «Notre ami Lazare s'est endormi, mais je pars pour le réveiller.» —
[11:12] «S'il dort, Seigneur, il sera sauvé», dirent les disciples.
[11:13] Or Jésus avait parlé de sa mort ; mais ils avaient cru, eux, qu'il parlait du sommeil ordinaire.
[11:14] Il leur dit alors nettement: «Lazare est mort.
[11:15] Et je me réjouis, à cause de vous, et afin que vous croyiez, de ce que je n'étais pas là. Mais allons auprès de lui.»
[11:16] Sur ce mot, Thomas (celui qu'on appelle Didyme), s'adressant à ses condisciples : «Et nous aussi, dit-il, allons-y afin de périr avec lui!»
[11:17] Lorsque Jésus arriva, Lazare, depuis quatre jours, était enseveli dans le tombeau.
[11:18] Comme Béthanie n'était éloignée de Jérusalem que d'environ quinze stades,
[11:19] beaucoup de Juifs s'étaient rendus auprès de Marthe et de Marie pour les consoler de la mort de leur frère.
[11:20] Marthe, cependant, dès qu'elle eut appris que Jésus approchait, t alla au-devant de lui. Marie resta assise à la maison.
[11:21] «Seigneur, dit Marthe à Jésus, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort ;
[11:22] et, je sais, encore en ce moment, que tout ce que tu demanderas à Dieu, Dieu te le donnera.»
[11:23] Jésus lui répondit : «Ton frère ressuscitera.» —
[11:24] «Je le sais, lui dit Marthe, il ressuscitera à la résurrection, au dernier jour.»
[11:25] Jésus lui dit : «Je suis, moi, la résurrection et la vie. Qui croit en moi, fût-il mort, vivra,
[11:26] et quiconque vit et croit en moi ne mourra jamais. Crois-tu cela?» —
[11:27] «Oui, Seigneur, répondit-elle, je crois que tu es le Christ, le Fils de Dieu, celui qui doit venir au monde.»
[11:28] Après ces paroles, elle s'éloigna et alla appeler sa soeur. «Le maître est là et il t'appelle», lui dit-elle en secret.
[11:29] A ces mots, Marie se lève à la hâte et se rend vers Jésus.
[11:30] Celui-ci n'était pas encore entré dans le bourg ; il était à l'endroit où Marthe l'avait rencontré.
[11:31] Voyant Marie se lever si vite et partir, les Juifs qui étaient ave celle dans la maison et cherchaient à la consoler, la suivirent. Ils croyaient qu'elle allait au tombeau pour y pleurer.
[11:32] Parvenue au lieu où était Jésus, Marie, en l'apercevant, se jeta à ses pieds : «Seigneur, lui dit-elle, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.»
[11:33] La voyant pleurer, et voyant pleurer les Juifs qui l'accompagnaient, Jésus frémit en lui-même et se troubla.
[11:34] «Où l'avez-vous déposé? demanda-t-il. On lui répondit : «Seigneur, viens et vois.»
[11:35] Jésus pleura.
[11:36] «Voyez comme il l'aimait!» dirent alors les Juifs.
[11:37] Il y en avait cependant quelques-uns qui disaient: «Ne pouvait-il pas empêcher qu'il mourût, lui, qui a ouvert les yeux de l'aveugle?»
[11:38] Frémissant de nouveau en lui-même, Jésus s'approche du sépulcre. C'était une caverne, sur l'entrée de laquelle une pierre était placée.
[11:39] «Otez la pierre», dit Jésus. — «Seigneur, dit Marthe, la soeur du mort, il sent déjà mauvais! c'est le quatrième jour!»
[11:40] Jésus lui répond : «Ne t'ai-je pas dit que si tu crois, tu verras la gloire de Dieu!»,Donc, on enleva la pierre.
[11:41] Alors Jésus, tournant son regard vers le ciel, dit : «Père! je te rends grâces de ce que tu m'as écouté!
[11:42] Pour moi, je savais que tu m'écoutes toujours ; mais je parle ainsi à cause de ce peuple qui m'environne, pour qu'il croie que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé.»
[11:43] Et quand il eut dit ces mots, il cria d'une voix forte : «Lazare! sors et viens !»
[11:44] Le mort sortit, les pieds et les mains liés par des bandelettes, et le visage enveloppé d'un suaire. «Déliez-le, dit Jésus, et laissez-le aller.»
[11:45] A la vue de ce qu'il avait fait, plusieurs des Juifs qui étaient venus voir Marie, crurent en lui.
[11:46] Mais quelques autres s'en allèrent trouver les Pharisiens et leur racontèrent ce qu'avait fait Jésus.
[11:47] Les chefs des prêtres et les Pharisiens convoquèrent alors une assemblée. «Que faire? disaient-ils, cet homme opère de nombreux miracles ;
[11:48] si nous le laissons continuer, tout le monde croira en lui ; puis viendront les Romains qui en finiront et avec notre vit le et avec notre nation.»
[11:49] L'un d'entre eux, Kaïphe qui, en cette année, était le grand-prêtre, leur dit : «Vous n'y entendez rien ;
[11:50] vous ne réfléchissez pas qu'il vaut mieux pour vous qu'un seul homme meure pour le peuple et que toute la nation ne périsse pas.»
[11:51] Il parlait de la sorte, non de lui-même, mais parce que, grand-prêtre cette année-là, il prophétisait que Jésus allait mourir pour la nation
[11:52] et non seulement pour la nation, mais afin de rassembler dans l'unité les enfants de Dieu dispersés.
[11:53] Donc, dès ce jour, ils arrêtèrent la résolution de mettre Jésus à mort.
[11:54] Aussi celui-ci ne se montrait-il plus en public parmi les Juifs. Il s'en alla même dans le pays voisin du désert, à une ville nommée Éphraïm ; et il y séjourna avec les disciples.
[11:55] Cependant la Pâque des Juifs approchait et, dans la contrée, un grand nombre montaient, avant la fête, à Jérusalem, pour y procéder à des purifications.
[11:56] Aussi cherchaient-ils Jésus et, se rencontrant au Temple, ils se demandaient les uns aux autres : «Pensez-vous qu'il s'abstiendra de venir à la fête?»
[11:57] Or les chefs des prêtres et les Pharisiens avaient donné cet ordre : «Que si quelqu'un savait où était Jésus, il le déclarât, afin qu'on le fit arrêter.»
[12:1] Six jours avant la Pâque, Jésus vint à Béthanie, où était Lazare, qu'il avait ressuscité des morts.
[12:2] On lui fit là un festin et Marthe servait ; Lazare était un de ceux qui étaient à table avec lui.
[12:3] Quant à Marie, elle prit une livre d'un parfum de nard pur, de très haut prix, et elle en oignit les pieds de Jésus, les essuyant avec ses cheveux. La maison fut remplie de l'odeur de ce parfum.
[12:4] L'un des disciples, Judas l'Iskariôte, celui qui devait le livrer,
[12:5] dit: «Pourquoi ne pas avoir vendu ce parfum? Il vaut trois cents deniers qu'on aurait donnés à des pauvres.»
[12:6] Il ne parlait pas ainsi, parce qu'il se souciait des pauvres, mais parce qu'il était un voleur, et que, tenant la bourse commune, il se chargeait de ce qu'on y mettait.
[12:7] Jésus répondit : «Laisse-la, afin qu'elle réserve ce parfum pour le jour de ma sépulture.
[12:8] Les pauvres, vous les avez toujours avec vous ; tandis que moi vous ne m'avez pas pour toujours.»
[12:9] Une foule énorme de Juifs avaient appris la présence de Jésus, et ils arrivèrent non seulement à cause de lui, mais aussi pour voir Lazare qu'il avait ressuscité des morts.
[12:10] Aussi les chefs des prêtres songèrent-ils à faire périr Lazare lui-même,
[12:11] parce qu'une quantité de Juifs les abandonnaient à cause de cet homme, et croyaient en Jésus.
[12:12] Le lendemain une multitude immense, venue pour la fête, ayant appris que Jésus venait à Jérusalem
[12:13] prit en main des branches de palmier et sortit au-devant de lui. «Hosanna !«» criait-on, «Béni soit celui qui vient au nom du Seigneur» Béni soit le roi d'Israël!»
[12:14] Jésus trouva un ânon et s'assit dessus, accomplissant cette parole de l'Écriture :
[12:15] «Sois sans crainte, fille de Sion, Voici ton Roi qui t'arrive Assis sur le petit d'une ânesse.»
[12:16] Ses disciples, tout d'abord, ne s'en rendirent point compte. Mais quand Jésus eut été glorifié, ils se souvinrent que ces choses avaient été écrites de lui, et qu'ils les lui avaient faites.
[12:17] La multitude qui était avec lui attestait donc qu'il avait appelé Lazare du tombeau et l'avait ressuscité des morts ;
[12:18] et c'était la rumeur d'un tel miracle, opéré par lui, qui faisait aussi accourir la foule à sa rencontre.
[12:19] Quant aux Pharisiens, ils se disaient entre eux : «Vous le voyez! Vous n'y gagnez rien! Voilà que tout le monde court après lui !»
[12:20] Parmi ceux qui étaient venus pour adorer Dieu pendant la fête, se trouvaient quelques Grecs.
[12:21] Ils abordèrent Philippe qui était de Bethsaïde en Galilée, et lui firent cette demande : «Seigneur, nous désirons voir Jésus.»
[12:22] Philippe alla en parler à André ; et tous deux ensemble allèrent le dire à Jésus.
[12:23] Celui-ci leur adressa alors ces paroles : «L'heure est venue où le Fils de l'homme doit être glorifié.»
[12:24] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, si le grain de froment tombant en terre ne passe par la mort, il demeure seul ; mais qu'il vienne à mourir, il porte beaucoup de fruits.»
[12:25] «Qui aime sa vie la perdra ; et qui hait sa vie en ce monde, la conservera en vie éternelle.»
[12:26] «Qu'il me suive, celui qui veut me servir! et là où je suis mon serviteur sera aussi. Si quelqu'un me sert, mon Père l'honorera.»
[12:27] «Maintenant mon âme est troublée ; et que dirai-je? Dirai-je : «Père, préserve-moi de cette heure?» mais, c'est pour cela que je suis arrivé à cette heure!
[12:28] Père, glorifie ton nom!» Du ciel il vint alors une voix : «Je l'ai glorifié et je le glorifierai encore!» —
[12:29] «C'est le tonnerre», dit la foule qui était présente et qui entendait. Il y en avait qui disaient : «C'est un ange qui lui a parlé.»
[12:30] Jésus reprit ainsi : «Ce n'est pas pour moi, mais pour vous que cette voix a retenti.
[12:31] Maintenant a lieu le jugement de ce monde ; maintenant le prince de ce monde va être chassé dehors ;
[12:32] et moi, quand j'aurai été élevé de terre, j'attirerai tous les hommes à moi.»
[12:33] Il disait cela pour indiquer de quelle mort il allait mourir.
[12:34] «La Loi nous apprend que le Christ demeure éternellement, lui répondit la foule ; comment donc dis-tu : «Il faut que le Fils de l'homme soit élevé de terre?» Quel est ce «Fils de l'homme»?
[12:35] Jésus leur répondit : «Pour un peu de temps encore la lumière est avec vous. Marchez pendant que vous avez la lumière, de peur que les ténèbres ne vous surprennent. Celui qui marche dans les ténèbres ne sait où il va.
[12:36] Pendant que vous avez la lumière, ayez foi en la lumière, afin de devenir des fils de lumière.» Ainsi parla Jésus, puis il s'éloigna et se cacha d'eux.
[12:37] Ils ne croyaient pas en lui qui avait fait tant de miracles en leur présence ;
[12:38] c'était afin que fût accomplie la parole du prophète Ésaïe qui a dit : «Seigneur, qui a cru à ce que nous faisons entendre? Et à qui le bras du Seigneur a-t-il été révélé?»
[12:39] Aussi bien, croire leur était impossible, puisque Ésaïe a dit encore :
[12:40] «Il a aveuglé leurs yeux Et il a endurci leur coeur, Afin qu'ils ne voient pas de leurs yeux ; Et qu'ils ne comprennent pas de leur coeur ; Qu'ils ne se convertissent pas Et que je ne les guérisse pas.»
[12:41] Voilà ce qu'a dit Ésaïe quand il a vu sa gloire et qu'il a parlé de lui.
[12:42] Et pourtant, même parmi ceux qui exerçaient l'autorité, beaucoup avaient foi en lui ; mais, à cause des Pharisiens, ils n'en convenaient pas, pour ne pas être chassés de la synagogue,
[12:43] préférant en cela la gloire humaine à la gloire de Dieu.
[12:44] Jésus éleva la voix : «Qui croit en moi, s'écria-t-il, ne croit pas en moi, mais en Celui qui m'a envoyé,
[12:45] et qui me voit, voit Celui qui m'a envoyé.
[12:46] Moi, qui suis lumière, je suis venu dans le monde afin que quiconque croit en moi ne demeure point dans les ténèbres.
[12:47] Quant à celui qui entend mes paroles et ne les garde point, ce n'est pas moi qui le juge ; car je ne suis pas venu pour juger le monde ; mais pour sauver le monde.
[12:48] Qui me rejette et ne reçoit pas mes paroles a déjà son juge ; ce juge, c'est la parole même que j'ai dite, elle le jugera au dernier jour.
[12:49] Ce n'est pas, en effet, de moi-même que j'ai parlé ; mais c'est le Père, dont je suis l'envoyé, qui m'a lui-même commandé de parler et qui m'a prescrit ce que j'avais à dire.
[12:50] Et je sais que son commandement c'est la vie éternelle. Les choses donc que je dis, je les dis comme le Père me les a dites.»
[13:1] Avant la fête de Pâque, sachant que pour lui l'heure était venue, de passer de ce monde au Père, Jésus, après avoir aimé ceux qui étaient siens dans le monde, mit le comble à son amour pour eux.
[13:2] Pendant un repas, alors que le diable avait déjà jeté dans le coeur de Judas, fils de Simon, l'Iskariôte, de le livrer,
[13:3] sachant que le Père avait tout remis entre ses mains, sachant qu'il était issu de Dieu et qu'il retournait à Dieu,
[13:4] Jésus se leva de table, ôta ses vêtements, prit un linge et se ceignit.
[13:5] Après quoi, versant de l'eau dans le bassin, il se mit à laver les pieds de ses disciples et à les essuyer avec le linge dont il était ceint.
[13:6] Il vint donc à Simon Pierre qui lui dit : «Toi, Seigneur, à moi? me laver les pieds?»
[13:7] Jésus lui répondit par ces paroles : «Ce que je fais tu ne le sais pas maintenant, tu le sauras plus tard.» —
[13:8] «Jamais, lui dit Pierre, non, jamais, tu ne me laveras les pieds !» — «Si je ne te lave, répliqua Jésus, tu n'as point de part avec moi.» -
[13:9] Simon Pierre dit alors : «Seigneur! non seulement tes pieds, mais aussi les mains et la tête !» —
[13:10] «Celui qui s'est baigné, ajouta Jésus, n'a plus besoin que de se laver les pieds ; dans tout le reste il est entièrement pur ; et vous, vous êtes purs ; non pas tous cependant.»
[13:11] Il connaissait, en effet, celui qui allait le livrer ; voilà pourquoi il dit : «Vous n'êtes pas tous purs.»
[13:12] Après leur avoir lavé les pieds il reprit ses vêtements, se remit à table et leur dit : «Comprenez-vous ce que je vous ai fait?
[13:13] Vous m'appelez Maître, Seigneur, et vous dites bien, car je le suis.
[13:14] Si donc je vous ai lavé les pieds, moi, le Seigneur, moi, le Maître, vous devez, vous aussi, vous laver les pieds les uns aux autres.
[13:15] Car je vous ai donné un exemple pour que, vous aussi, vous fassiez comme je vous ai fait.»
[13:16] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, un serviteur n'est pas plus grand que son Seigneur, ni un apôtre plus grand que celui qui l'envoie.
[13:17] Si vous savez ces choses, vous êtes heureux, pourvu que vous les mettiez en pratique. —
[13:18] (Je ne parle pas de vous tous. Ceux que j'ai choisis, je les connais ; mais il faut que cette parole de l'Écriture s'accomplisse : «Celui qui mangeait à ma table a levé le talon contre moi.»
[13:19] «Je vous le dis dès aujourd'hui et avant l'événement, afin, quand il aura lieu, que vous croyiez que c'est moi...) —
[13:20] En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, recevoir quelqu'un que j'aurai envoyé, c'est me recevoir ; et me recevoir, c'est recevoir Celui qui m'a envoyé.»
[13:21] Après qu'il eut dit ces paroles, Jésus fut troublé en son esprit et il fit cette déclaration : «En vérité, en vérité, je vous lé dis, l'un d'entre vous me livrera.»
[13:22] Les disciples se regardaient les uns les autres, ne sachant duquel il parlait.
[13:23] L'un d'eux était couché sur le sein de Jésus — c'était celui qu'aimait Jésus.
[13:24] Simon Pierre lui fait signe et lui dit : «Demande-lui de qui il parle.»
[13:25] L'autre, se penchant aussitôt sur la poitrine de Jésus, lui demande : «Seigneur, lequel est-ce?»
[13:26] Jésus répond : «Celui pour lequel je vais tremper ce morceau de pain et auquel je le donnerai.» Et Jésus, trempant un morceau de pain, le donne à Judas, fils de Simon, l'Iskariôte.
[13:27] Quand cet homme eut pris ce morceau, Satan entra en lui, Jésus lui dit alors : «Ce que tu fais, fais-le au plus tôt.»
[13:28] Aucun de ceux qui étaient à table ne comprit pour quel objet il lui parlait ainsi.
[13:29] Comme Judas était porteur de la bourse commune, quelques-uns pensèrent que Jésus lui disait soit d'acheter ce qu'il fallait pour la fête, soit de donner telle ou telle chose aux pauvres.
[13:30] Donc, à peine Judas eut-il pris ce morceau de pain, qu'il sortit brusquement. Il faisait nuit.
[13:31] Quand il fut parti, Jésus dit : «C'est maintenant que le Fils de l'homme est glorifié et que Dieu est glorifié en lui.
[13:32] Dieu le glorifiera lui aussi, en lui-même, et c'est bientôt qu'il le glorifiera.
[13:33] Mes enfants, je ne suis plus que pour peu de temps avec vous ! vous me chercherez ; et ce que j'ai dit aux Juifs, je vous le dis aussi à vous-mêmes à l'heure présente : où je vais vous ne pouvez venir.»
[13:34] «Je vous donne un commandement nouveau: vous aimer les uns les autres. Oui, aimez-vous les uns les autres, comme je vous ai aimés.
[13:35] Tous reconnaîtront que vous êtes mes disciples à l'amour que vous aurez les uns pour les autres.»
[13:36] «Seigneur, lui demanda Simon Pierre, où vas-tu ?» — «Au lieu où je vais, répondit Jésus, tu ne peux me suivre présentement ; tu me suivras plus tard.» —
[13:37] «Et pourquoi donc, Seigneur, lui dit Pierre, ne puis-je te suivre dès maintenant. Je donnerai ma vie pour toi!» —
[13:38] «Tu donneras ta vie pour moi!» répliqua Jésus, «en vérité, en vérité, je te le dis, un coq ne chantera pas avant que trois fois tu ne m'aies renié !»
[14:1] «Que votre coeur ne se trouble point ; ayez foi en Dieu, ayez, aussi foi en moi ;
[14:2] il y a plusieurs demeures dans la maison de mon Père, sinon je vous l'aurais dit ; je vais vous préparer une place ;
[14:3] et quand je m'en serai allé et vous aurai préparé une place, je reviendrai et vous prendrai avec moi, afin que là où je suis, vous y soyez aussi.
[14:4] Et vous savez le chemin de l'endroit où je vais.»
[14:5] Thomas lui dit : «Seigneur, nous ne savons où tu vas, comment saurions-nous le chemin?»
[14:6] Jésus lui dit : «Je suis, moi, le chemin, la vérité et la vie. Personne ne vient au Père que par moi.
[14:7] Si vous m'avez connu, vous connaîtrez aussi mon Père et dès à présent vous le connaissez et vous l'avez vu.»
[14:8] Philippe lui dit : «Seigneur, montre-nous le Père, cela nous suffit.»
[14:9] Jésus lui dit : «Il y a si longtemps que je suis avec vous et tu ne m'as pas connu, Philippe! Qui m'a vu a vu le Père. Comment peux-tu dire: Montre-nous le Père?
[14:10] Ne crois-tu pas que je suis, moi, dans le Père, et que le Père est en moi. Les paroles que je vous dis, ce n'est pas de moi-même que je les prononce. C'est le Père, demeurant en moi, qui fait ces oeuvres.
[14:11] Croyez-moi, croyez parce que je suis, moi, dans le Père et que le Père est en moi ; sinon, croyez à cause de ces oeuvres.»
[14:12] «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, les oeuvres que je fais, qui croit en moi les fera, lui aussi, et en fera de plus grandes, parce que je m'en vais auprès du Père
[14:13] et que tout ce que vous demanderez en mon nom, je le ferai, afin que le Père soit glorifié dans le Fils.
[14:14] Si vous me demandez quelque chose en mon nom, moi, je le ferai.
[14:15] Si vous m'aimez, gardez mes commandements ;
[14:16] et moi, je prierai le Père et il vous donnera un autre Conseiller, afin qu'il soit pour toujours avec vous,
[14:17] l'Esprit de vérité, que le monde ne peut recevoir parce qu'il ne le voit ni ne le connaît ; mais vous, vous le connaissez parce qu'il demeure avec vous, et il sera en vous.
[14:18] Je ne vous laisserai pas orphelins ; je reviens à vous.
[14:19] Encore un peu de temps, et le monde ne me verra plus ; mais vous, vous me verrez, car je vis, moi, et vous aussi, vous vivrez.
[14:20] En ce jour-là, vous reconnaîtrez que je suis en mon Père, que vous êtes en moi, et que je suis en vous.
[14:21] Qui retient mes commandements et les garde, celui-là est celui qui m'aime. Et celui qui m'aime sera aimé de mon Père, et moi je l'aimerai et je me manifesterai à lui.»
[14:22] Judas (qu'il ne faut pas confondre avec l'Iskariôte) lui dit : «Seigneur, qu'est-il arrivé pour que tu veuilles te manifester à nous et non pas au monde?»
[14:23] Jésus lui répondit par ces paroles : Si quelqu'un m'aime, il gardera ma parole et mon Père l'aimera et nous viendrons à lui et nous ferons chez lui notre demeure.
[14:24] Celui qui ne m'aime pas ne garde pas mes paroles ; et la parole que vous entendez n'est pas mienne, mais de Celui qui m'a envoyé, du Père.»
[14:25] «Je vous ai parlé de ces choses pendant que je demeurais avec vous ;
[14:26] mais le Conseiller, l’Esprit saint que le Père enverra en mon nom, vous enseignera toutes choses et vous rappellera tout ce que je vous ai dit.»
[14:27] «Je vous laisse la paix, je vous donne ma paix ; ce n'est pas comme le monde la donne, que, moi, je vous la donne ; que votre coeur ne se trouble pas, qu'il ne faiblisse pas.»
[14:28] «Vous avez entendu que je vous ai dit : «Je m'en vais et je reviens à vous. Si vous m'aimiez, vous vous réjouiriez de ce que je vais auprès du Père, parce que le Père est plus grand que moi.
[14:29] Et je vous ai parlé maintenant, avant l'événement, afin que vous croyiez lorsqu'il arrivera.
[14:30] Je ne vous parlerai plus guère, car le Prince du monde vient, et en moi il n'a rien ;
[14:31] mais il vient afin que le monde sache que j'aime le Père et que j'agis suivant les ordres du Père. Levez-vous, sortons d'ici.»
[15:1] «Moi, je suis le véritable cep de vigne et. mon Père est le vigneron.
[15:2] Tout sarment qui ne porte pas de fruit en moi, il le retranche et tout sarment qui en porte il l'émonde, afin qu'il en porte davantage.
[15:3] Vous, vous êtes déjà émondés, à cause de la parole que je vous ai annoncée.»
[15:4] «Demeurez-en moi et moi je demeurerai en vous. De même que le sarment ne peut porter de fruit de lui-même, et qu'il lui faut demeurer uni au cep de vigne, de même vous n'en pourrez porter si vous ne demeurez pas en moi.»
[15:5] «Moi, je suis le cep de vigne ; vous, vous êtes les sarments. Qui demeure en moi, et moi en lui, porte, lui, beaucoup de fruit, parce que, sans moi, vous ne pouvez rien faire.
[15:6] Si quelqu'un ne demeure pas en moi, il est jeté dehors comme le sarment, et il se dessèche, et on ramasse ce sarment, et on le jette au feu et il brûle.»
[15:7] «Si vous demeurez-en moi, et que mes paroles demeurent en vous, ce que vous voudrez, demandez-le, et vous l'aurez.»
[15:8] «En ceci mon Père est glorifié que vous portiez beaucoup de fruits, et alors vous deviendrez mes disciples.»
[15:9] «De même que le Père m'a aimé, de même je vous ai aimés. Demeurez dans mon amour.
[15:10] Si vous gardez mes commandements, vous demeurerez dans mon amour, comme moi j'ai gardé les commandements de mon Père, et je demeure dans son amour.
[15:11] «Je vous ai parlé ainsi afin que ma joie soit la vôtre, et que il votre joie soit dans sa plénitude.»
[15:12] «Voici mon commandement : Aimez-vous les uns les autres, comme je vous ai aimés.
[15:13] Nul amour n'est plus grand que l'amour de celui qui donne sa vie pour ses amis.
[15:14] Vous êtes mes amis si vous faites ce que je vous commande.
[15:15] Je ne vous appelle plus serviteurs, parce que le serviteur ne sait pas ce que fait son maître ; je vous ai dit : «mes amis», parce que tout ce que j'ai appris de mon Père, je vous l'ai fait connaître.»
[15:16] «Ce n'est pas vous qui m'avez choisi ; c'est moi qui vous ai choisis et vous ai mis à votre place afin que vous alliez porter du fruit, et que votre fruit demeure, et afin que tout ce que vous demanderez au Père en mon nom, il vous le donne.
[15:17] Voilà ce que je vous commande, et c'est pour que vous vous aimiez les uns les autres.»
[15:18] «Si le monde vous hait, sachez qu'il m'a haï avant vous.
[15:19] Si vous étiez du monde, le monde aimerait ce qui lui appartient ; comme vous n'êtes pas du monde, mais que je vous ai choisis du monde, à cause de cela le monde vous hait.
[15:20] Souvenez-vous de la parole que je vous ai dite : «Le serviteur n'est pas plus grand que son maître.» S'ils m'ont persécuté, ils vous persécuteront aussi. S'ils ont gardé ma parole, ils garderont aussi la vôtre.
[15:21] Mais toutes ces choses ils vous les feront à cause de mon nom, parce qu'ils ne connaissent pas Celui qui m'a envoyé.»
[15:22] «Si je n'étais point venu et ne leur eusse point parlé, ils ne seraient point coupables ; mais maintenant leur culpabilité est sans excuse.
[15:23] Qui me hait, hait aussi mon Père.
[15:24] Si je n'avais pas fait au milieu d'eux des oeuvres que nul autre n'a faites, ils ne seraient pas coupables ; mais maintenant leurs yeux ont vu et néanmoins ils ont haï et moi et mon Père ;
[15:25] mais c'est afin que s'accomplisse la parole écrite dans leur Loi : «Ils me haïrent sans sujet.»
[15:26] «Quand sera venu le Conseiller que je vous enverrai de la part du Père, l'Esprit de vérité qui procède du Père, lui, rendra témoignage de moi ;
[15:27] et vous aussi, vous me rendez témoignage, parce que, depuis le commencement, vous êtes avec moi.»
[16:1] «Je vous parle ainsi pour vous préserver de toute chute.
[16:2] On vous expulsera des synagogues ; et même elle approche, l'heure où tous ceux qui vous mettront à mort croiront rendre un culte à Dieu.
[16:3] Ils feront cela parce qu'ils n'auront connu ni le Père, ni moi.
[16:4] Je vous parle ainsi pour que, leur moment venu, vous vous souveniez que je vous ai dit ces choses ; je ne vous les ai pas dites dès le commencement parce que j'étais avec vous.»
[16:5] «Maintenant je m'en vais auprès de Celui qui m'a envoyé et aucun de vous ne me demande : «Où vas-tu?»
[16:6] mais parce que je vous ai ainsi parlé votre coeur s'est rempli de tristesse.
[16:7] Cependant, c'est la vérité que je dis, il est bon pour vous que je m'en aille ; car, si je ne m'en vais, le Conseiller ne viendra pas vers vous. Si je m'en vais, je vous l'enverrai.
[16:8] Et quand il sera venu, il convaincra le monde en ce qui concerne le péché, la justice et le jugement :
[16:9] le péché en tant qu'ils ne croient pas en moi ;
[16:10] la justice en tant que je m'en vais auprès du Père, et que vous ne me verrez plus ;
[16:11] le jugement en tant que le Prince de ce monde est il jugé.»
[16:12] «J'ai encore beaucoup de choses à vous dire ; mais vous ne les pouvez pas encore porter ;
[16:13] quand il sera venu, lui, l'Esprit de vérité, il vous dirigera dans toute la vérité, car il ne parlera pas de son propre fonds, mais tout ce qu'il aura entendu il le dira et il vous annoncera l'avenir.
[16:14] C'est lui qui me glorifiera, parce qu'il prendra de ce qui est à moi et il vous l'annoncera.
[16:15] Tout ce qu'a le Père est aussi à moi ; voilà pourquoi je vous dis : «Il prend de ce qui est à moi, et il vous l'annoncera.»
[16:16] «Encore un peu de temps, et vous ne me verrez plus, puis encore un peu de temps, et vous me verrez.»
[16:17] Alors quelques-uns de ses disciples se demandèrent l'un à l'autre : «Qu'est-ce qu'il nous dit : «Encore un peu de temps, et vous ne me verrez pas, puis encore un peu de temps, et vous me verrez» ; et : «je m'en vais auprès du Père». —
[16:18] Que signifient, disaient-ils, ces mots : «Un peu de temps». Nous ne savons de quoi il parle.»
[16:19] Jésus comprit qu'ils désiraient l'interroger, et il leur dit : «Vous vous demandez l'un à l'autre ce que j'ai voulu dire par ces mots : «Encore un peu de temps, et vous ne me verrez pas, puis encore un peu de temps, et vous me verrez.»
[16:20] En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, vous, vous pleurerez et vous gémirez ; quant au monde, il se réjouira. Vous, vous serez dans la douleur ; mais votre douleur sera changée en joie.
[16:21] La femme passe par la douleur pendant qu'elle enfante, parce que, pour elle, l'heure est venue. Mais quand l'enfant est né, elle oublie son angoisse, tant est grande sa joie d'avoir mis un homme au monde.
[16:22] Vous, de même, vous passez maintenant par la douleur ; mais je vous reverrai, et votre coeur se réjouira, et nul ne vous ravira votre joie.
[16:23] Et, en ce jour-là, vous ne m'interrogerez plus sur rien.» «En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, si vous demandez quelque chose au Père en mon nom, il vous le donnera.
[16:24] Jusqu'ici vous n'avez rien demandé en mon nom. Demandez et vous recevrez afin que votre joie soit dans sa plénitude.»
[16:25] Je vous ai parlé de ces choses en termes figurés ; il vient une heure où je ne vous parlerai plus en termes figurés, mais où je vous communiquerai clairement ce qui concerne le Père.
[16:26] En ce jour-là vous demanderez en mon nom, et je ne vous dis pas que je prierai le Père pour vous,
[16:27] car le Père lui-même vous aime, parce que vous m'avez aimé, et que vous avez cru que je suis issu du Père.
[16:28] Je suis issu du Père, et je suis venu dans le monde ; maintenant je quitte le monde, et je vais auprès du Père.»
[16:29] C'est maintenant, dirent les disciples, que tu parles clairement, que tu n'emploies pas de termes figurés.
[16:30] C'est maintenant que nous voyons que tu sais toutes choses, et que tu n'as besoin d'être interrogé par personne. Voilà pourquoi nous croyons que tu es issu de Dieu.»
[16:31] «Vous croyez pour le moment, leur répondit Jésus ;
[16:32] mais il vient une heure, elle est même déjà venue, où vous vous disperserez chacun de son côté, et où vous me laisserez seul. Mais je ne suis pas seul parce que le Père est avec moi.
[16:33] Je vous ai ainsi parlé afin que vous ayez la paix en moi ; dans le monde, vous passez par l'angoisse ; mais prenez courage, j'ai vaincu le monde.»
[17:1] Ainsi parla Jésus. Puis, levant les yeux au ciel, il dit : «Père, l'heure est venue ; glorifie ton Fils, afin que le Fils te glorifie en donnant,
[17:2] selon le pouvoir que tu lui as donné sur toute chair, la vie éternelle, à tous ceux que tu lui as donnés.
[17:3] Or voici l'éternelle vie : Te connaître, toi, le seul vrai Dieu et celui que tu as envoyé, Jésus-Christ.»
[17:4] «Moi, je t'ai glorifié sur la terre ; j'ai accompli l'oeuvre que tu m'avais donnée à faire.
[17:5] Et maintenant, glorifie-moi, toi, Père, auprès de toi-même, de la gloire que j'avais, avant que le monde fût, auprès de toi.»
[17:6] «J'ai révélé ton nom aux hommes que tu m'as donnés du monde. Ils étaient à toi, et tu me les as donnés ; et ils ont gardé ta parole.
[17:7] Maintenant ils ont reconnu que tout ce que tu m'as donné vient de toi,
[17:8] parce que les paroles que tu m'as données, je les leur ai données, et ils les ont reçues, et ils ont reconnu véritablement que je suis issu de toi, et ils ont cru que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé.»
[17:9] «C'est pour eux que je prie ; ce n'est pas pour le monde que je prie, mais pour ceux que tu m'as donnés parce qu'ils sont à toi —
[17:10] (or tout ce qui est à moi est à toi, et tout ce qui est à toi est à moi) — et que j'ai été glorifié en eux.
[17:11] Je ne suis plus dans le monde, mais eux sont dans le monde, et moi je viens à toi. Père saint! garde-les en ton nom, le nom que tu m'as donné, afin qu'ils soient uns comme nous.
[17:12] Quand j'étais avec eux, c'est moi qui les gardais en ton nom, le nom que tu m'as donné, et je les ai préservés et aucun d'eux ne s'est perdu, excepté le fils de la perdition, afin que l'Écriture fût accomplie.
[17:13] Maintenant je viens à toi, et je parle ainsi, étant encore dans le monde, afin qu'ils aient en eux la plénitude de ma joie.»
[17:14] «Je leur ai donné ta parole, et le monde les a pris en haine, parce qu'ils ne sont pas du monde, comme moi je ne suis pas du monde.
[17:15] Je ne demande pas que tu les retires du monde, mais que tu les préserves du mal.
[17:16] Ils ne sont pas du monde, comme moi je ne suis pas du monde.
[17:17] Consacre-les dans la vérité. Ta parole est la vérité.»
[17:18] «De même que tu m'as envoyé dans le monde, je les ai, moi aussi, envoyés dans le monde,
[17:19] et je me consacre moi-même pour eux afin qu'ils soient, eux aussi, consacrés en vérité.»
[17:20] «Ce n'est pas seulement pour eux que je prie, mais aussi pour ceux qui croient en moi par leur parole,
[17:21] afin que tous ils soient un, comme toi, Père, es en moi, et moi en toi, qu'eux aussi soient en nous, pour que le monde croie que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé.»
[17:22] «Et moi, la gloire que tu m'as donnée, je la leur ai donnée, afin qu'ils soient un comme nous sommes un,
[17:23] moi en eux et toi en moi, que cette unité soit parfaite, et que le monde reconnaisse que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé, et que tu les as aimés comme tu m'as aimé.»
[17:24] «Père! ceux que tu m'as donnés, je veux que là où je suis, moi, ils y soient avec moi, afin qu'ils voient la gloire que tu m'as donnée, parce que tu m'as aimé avant la création du monde.»
[17:25] «Père juste! le monde ne t'a pas connu ; mais moi je t'ai connu, et ceux-ci ont reconnu que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé.
[17:26] Et je leur ai fait connaître ton nom ; et je le leur ferai connaître, afin que l'amour dont tu m'as aimé soit en eux, et que je sois moi aussi en eux.»
[18:1] Après avoir ainsi parlé, Jésus sortit avec ses disciples et traversa le torrent de Kédron. Là se trouvait un jardin dans lequel il entra, et eux avec lui.
[18:2] Judas, celui qui le livrait, connaissait cet ' endroit, parce que Jésus y était souvent venu avec ses disciples.
[18:3] Ayant pris une escouade de soldats et accompagné d'agents fournis par les chefs des prêtres et les Pharisiens, Judas arriva donc en cet endroit avec des lanternes, des torches et des armes.
[18:4] Jésus, sachant tout ce qui allait lui arriver, s'avança et leur dit : «Qui cherchez-vous?» —
[18:5] «Jésus de Nazareth», lui répondirent ils. — Jésus leur dit : «C'est moi.» Au milieu d'eux se tenait Judas, celui qui le livrait.
[18:6] Mais à peine Jésus avait-il dit : «C'est moi», qu'ils firent un mouvement en arrière et tombèrent sur le sol.
[18:7] Il leur demanda une seconde fois: «Qui cherchez-vous?» — «Jésus de Nazareth», dirent-ils.
[18:8] — Jésus reprit : «Je vous ai dit que c'est moi ; si donc c'est moi que vous cherchez, laissez ceux-ci s'en aller.»
[18:9] (C'était afin que fût accomplie la parole qu'il avait dite : «De ceux que tu m'as donnés, je n'en ai perdu aucun.»)
[18:10] Simon Pierre, cependant, avait une épée, et la tira. Il en frappa le serviteur du grand-prêtre et lui coupa l'oreille droite. — Ce serviteur s se nommait Malchus. —
[18:11] «Remets ton épée dans le fourreau», dit alors Jésus à Pierre ; «la coupe que m'a donnée le Père, ne la boirai-je pas?»
[18:12] Cependant la cohorte, le tribun et les agents des Juifs se saisirent de Jésus et le garrottèrent.
[18:13] Ils commencèrent par le mener chez Hanne, beau-père de Kaïphe.
[18:14] (Kaïphe était le grand-prêtre de l'année, et c'était lui qui avait ouvert aux Juifs cet avis : Il vaut mieux qu'un seul homme meure pour le peuple.»)
[18:15] Simon Pierre et un autre disciple avaient suivi Jésus. Cet autre disciple, étant de la connaissance du grand-prêtre, entra en même temps que Jésus dans la cour.
[18:16] Quant à Pierre, il était resté dehors contre la porte. L'autre disciple, qui était de la connaissance du grand-prêtre, sortit pour parler à la portière et le fit entrer.
[18:17] Cette servante, qui gardait la porte, dit alors à Pierre : «N'es-tu pas toi aussi des disciples de cet homme?» —
[18:18] «Non ; pas moi», répondit-il. Il faisait froid ; les esclaves et les hommes de service, groupés autour d'un brasier allumé par eux, se chauffaient ; et Pierre, se tenant au milieu d'eux, se chauffait aussi.
[18:19] Le grand-prêtre cependant interrogea Jésus sur ses disciples et sur son enseignement.
[18:20] Jésus lui répondit : «C'est ouvertement que j'ai parlé au monde ; j'ai toujours enseigné dans la synagogue et dans le Temple, là où se réunissent tous les Juifs, et je n'ai rien dit en cachette.
[18:21] Pourquoi m'interroges-tu? demande à mes auditeurs de quoi je leur ai parlé. Eux savent bien ce que j'ai dit.»
[18:22] A ces mots, un des hommes de service qui se tenait à côté de Jésus, lui donna un coup de bâton en lui disant : «Est-ce de la sorte que tu réponds au grand-prêtre.»
[18:23] Jésus s'adressa à cet homme : «Si j'ai mal parlé, prouve ce que j'ai dit de mal ; si j'ai bien parlé, pourquoi me frappes-tu?»
[18:24] Hanne l'envoya, tout garrotté, à Kaïphe, le grand-prêtre.
[18:25] Cependant Simon Pierre se tenait là et se chauffait. «N'es-tu pas, toi aussi, de ses disciples?» lui dit-on. Il le nia. «Moi? dit-il, non pas.»
[18:26] Un des serviteurs du grand-prêtre, parent de celui à qui Pierre avait coupé l'oreille, lui dit : «Est-ce que, moi-même, je ne t'ai pas vu, avec lui, dans le jardin?»
[18:27] Encore une fois Pierre nia, et à ce moment un coq chanta.
[18:28] De chez Kaïphe, ils menèrent Jésus au prétoire ; le jour se levait. Eux-mêmes n'entrèrent pas dans le prétoire afin de ne pas contracter de souillure et de pouvoir manger la Pâque.
[18:29] Pilate vint donc à eux dehors. «Quelle accusation, dit-il, portez-vous contre cet homme?»
[18:30] Ils lui répondirent par ces paroles : «Si ce n'était pas un malfaiteur, nous ne te l'aurions pas livré.»
[18:31] Pilate leur répliqua : «Prenez-le, et jugez-le vous-mêmes, suivant votre Loi.» — «Nous n'avons pas le droit, répondirent les Juifs, de mettre personne à mort.»
[18:32] (C'était afin que fût accomplie la parole que Jésus avait dite pour indiquer de quelle mort il allait mourir.)
[18:33] Pilate rentra donc dans le prétoire, fit venir Jésus et lui dit : «Tu es le Roi des Juifs?» —
[18:34] «Est-ce de toi-même que tu dis cela, répondit Jésus, ou d'autres te l'ont-ils dit de moi?» —
[18:35] «Est-ce que je suis Juif, moi !» répliqua Pilate, «c'est ta nation, ce sont les chefs des prêtres qui t'ont livré à moi ; qu'as-tu fait?»
[18:36] Jésus répondit : «Ma Royauté n'est pas de ce monde. Si ma Royauté était de ce monde, mes sujets combattraient pour moi, pour que je ne fusse pas livré aux Juifs ; mais ma Royauté n'est pas d'ici.»
[18:37] Alors Pilate lui dit : «Ainsi donc tu es Roi!» Jésus répondit : «Tu le dis, je suis Roi. Voici pourquoi je suis né, voici pourquoi je suis venu dans le monde : pour rendre témoignage à la vérité. Quiconque est de la vérité écoute ma voix.» —
[18:38] «Qu'est-ce que la vérité?» lui dit Pilate. Sur ce mot, il revint dehors vers les Juifs et leur dit : «Moi, je ne trouve en lui aucune matière à condamnation.
[18:39] Il est d'usage que je vous délivre quelqu'un à la fête de Pâque, voulez-vous que je vous délivre le «Roi des Juifs?»
[18:40] Ils recommencèrent à crier : «Pas celui-là, disaient-ils, mais Bar-Abbas.» Ce Bar-Abbas était un brigand.
[19:1] Pilate ordonna alors de saisir Jésus et de le flageller.
[19:2] Les soldats, ayant tressé une couronne avec des épines, la lui posèrent sur la tête et l'affublèrent d'un manteau couleur pourpre ;
[19:3] puis ils s'avançaient vers lui et disaient : «Salut! le Roi des Juifs!» Et il lui donnaient des coups de bâton.
[19:4] Encore une fois, Pilate revint dehors. «Je vais vous l'amener, leur dit-il, pour que vous sachiez que je ne trouve aucun motif de le condamner.»
[19:5] Et Jésus parut dehors, portant la couronne d'épines et le manteau couleur pourpre. «Voilà l'homme», leur dit Pilate.
[19:6] Dès qu'ils le virent, les chefs des prêtres et leurs gens se mirent à crier : «Crucifie-le ! crucifie-le!» — «Prenez-le vous-mêmes, leur dit Pilate, et crucifiez-le! Quant à moi je ne trouve en lui nulle matière à condamnation.» —
[19:7] «Nous avons une Loi, répliquèrent les Juifs, et de par cette Loi, il faut qu'il meure pour s'être fait Fils de Dieu.»
[19:8] Pilate, entendant ces paroles, fut de plus en plus effrayé,
[19:9] Rentrant encore une fois dans le prétoire, il dit à Jésus : «D'où es-tu?» Mais Jésus ne lui fit point de réponse.
[19:10] «Tu ne me parles pas ? reprit Pilate, ignores-tu que j'ai le pouvoir de te délivrer et le pouvoir de te crucifier.» —
[19:11] «Tu n'aurais contre moi aucun pouvoir, répondit Jésus, s'il ne t'était donné d'en haut. Voilà pourquoi celui qui me livre à toi est coupable d'un plus grand péché.»
[19:12] Là-dessus, Pilate cherchait à le délivrer ; mais les Juifs lui criaient ces paroles : «Si tu délivres cet homme, tu n'es pas partisan de César, car quiconque se fait Roi se pose en adversaire de César.»
[19:13] Pilate, entendant un tel langage, fit venir Jésus au dehors, et prit siège au tribunal, à l'endroit appelé «Pavé en mosaïque» (en hébreu Gabbatha).
[19:14] C'était le jour de la Préparation de la Pâque, et vers la sixième heure. Pilate dit aux Juifs : «Voilà votre Roi.»
[19:15] Ceux-ci se mirent à crier : «A mort! à mort! crucifie-le!» — «Votre Roi! leur dit Pilate, je le crucifierais!» — «Nous n'avons d'autre Roi que César», répondirent les chefs des prêtres.
[19:16] Ce fut alors que Pilate le leur abandonna pour être crucifié. Ils s'emparèrent de Jésus
[19:17] et lui, portant lui-même la croix, vint au lieu qu'on appelle Crâne (en hébreu Golgotha).
[19:18] C'est là qu'ils le crucifièrent et avec lui deux autres, un de chaque côté, et au milieu, Jésus.
[19:19] Pilate rédigea aussi une inscription et la fit placer sur la croix ; il y était écrit : JESUS DE NAZARETH, LE ROI DES JUIFS.
[19:20] Cette inscription, beaucoup de Juifs la lurent parce que le lieu où Jésus fut crucifié était près de la ville. Elle était rédigée en hébreu, en latin et en grec.
[19:21] Alors les chefs des prêtres Juifs dirent à Pilate : «N'inscris pas : «LE ROI DES JUIFS» ; mais : «CET HOMME A DIT : «JE SUIS LE ROI DES JUIFS.» —
[19:22] «Ce que j'ai écrit, je l'ai écrit», répondit Pilate.
[19:23] Après avoir mis Jésus en croix, les soldats s'emparèrent de ses vêtements dont ils firent quatre parts ; une pour chaque soldat. Restait la tonique, une tunique sans couture, tout entière d'un seul tissu depuis le haut.
[19:24] «Ne la déchirons pas, se dirent-ils, mais tirons au sort à qui l'aura». (C'était afin que fût accomplie l'Écriture : «Ils ont partagé mes vêtements entre eux Et sur ma robe ils ont jeté le sort.») Donc, les soldats firent ainsi.
[19:25] Près de la croix de Jésus se tenaient sa mère, la soeur de sa mère, Marie, femme de Clopas, et Marie Magdeleine.
[19:26] Jésus, voyant sa mère et, près d'elle, le disciple qu'il aimait, dit à sa mère : «Femme, voilà ton fils.»
[19:27] Puis il dit au disciple : «Voilà ta mère.» A partir de ce moment le disciple la prit chez lui.
[19:28] Après cela, Jésus sachant que désormais tout était achevé d'accomplir, dit, afin de parfaire cet accomplissement de l'Écriture : «J'ai soif.»
[19:29] Il y avait là un vase plein de vinaigre. On y trempa une éponge qui fut fixée à une tige d'hysope, et on l'approcha de sa bouche.
[19:30] Quand il eut pris le vinaigre, il dit: «Tout est accompli» et, ayant baissé la tète, il rendit l'esprit.
[19:31] C'était le jour de la Préparation et pour que les corps ne restassent pas en croix pendant le sabbat, — un sabbat qui devait être très solennel, — les Juifs demandèrent à Pilate de faire briser les jambes des suppliciés et de les faire enlever.
[19:32] Les soldats vinrent donc et brisèrent les jambes du premier crucifié, puis du second.
[19:33] Arrivant à Jésus, ils s'aperçurent qu'il était déjà mort, et alors ils ne lui brisèrent pas les jambes.
[19:34] Seulement un des soldats lui perça le côté d'un coup de lance, et il en sortit immédiatement du sang et de l'eau.
[19:35] Celui qui l'a vu l'a attesté et son attestation est véridique. Lui, il sait qu'il dit vrai, afin que, vous aussi, vous croyiez.
[19:36] (Car cela arriva afin que fût accomplie l'Écriture : Aucun de ses os ne sera brisé»
[19:37] et un autre passage dit encore : «Ils regarderont celui qu'ils ont percé.»)
[19:38] Après cela, Joseph (celui qui est d'Arimathée), — il était disciple de Jésus, mais en secret par crainte des Juifs, — demanda à Pilate la permission d'enlever le corps de Jésus. Pilate la lui donna. Il vint donc enlever le corps.
[19:39] Avec lui se trouvait aussi Nicodème (celui qui était allé trouver Jésus pendant la nuit au commencement) ; il apportait une composition de myrrhe et d'aloès, une centaine de livres.
[19:40] Ils prirent donc le corps de Jésus et l'enveloppèrent dans des bandes de linge avec les parfums, suivant le mode d'ensevelissement usité chez les Juifs.
[19:41] Il y avait dans le lieu où il avait été crucifié un jardin et, dans ce jardin, un sépulcre neuf, où personne n'avait encore été placé.
[19:42] Ce fut donc là, à cause de la Préparation des Juifs, et parce que ce sépulcre était tout proche, qu'ils déposèrent Jésus.
[20:1] Le premier jour de la semaine, Marie Magdeleine se rend de grand matin, avant le jour, au sépulcre et voit la pierre enlevée.
[20:2] Alors elle court trouver Simon Pierre et l'autre disciple (celui que Jésus aimait) et leur dit : «On a enlevé le Seigneur de son tombeau, et nous ne savons où on l'a placé.»
[20:3] Pierre sort alors avec l'autre disciple,
[20:4] et tous deux ensemble se mettent à courir pour aller au sépulcre ; mais l'autre disciple courait devant et plus vite que Pierre. Il arrive le premier ;
[20:5] il se penche, voit les linges posés à terre (toutefois il n'entra point).
[20:6] Arrive alors Simon Pierre qui le suivait : lui, il entre dans le tombeau. Il regarde ; les linges étaient là ;
[20:7] le suaire, qui avait été sur la tête, n'était pas placé avec les linges, mais roulé à part à un autre endroit.
[20:8] Alors l'autre disciple, celui qui était arrivé le premier au tombeau, y entra aussi ; et il vit, et il crut.
[20:9] Jusque-là, en effet, ils ne comprenaient pas l'Écriture où il est dit : «Qu'il faut qu'il ressuscite d'entre les morts.»
[20:10] Les disciples retournèrent chez eux.
[20:11] Mais Marie était restée près du tombeau, à l'entrée, et pleurait. Tout en pleurant, elle se pencha et regarda dans le sépulcre.
[20:12] Elle y voit deux anges en vêtements blancs, s'asseyant à la place où était le corps de Jésus, l'un du côté de la tête, l'autre du côté des pieds.
[20:13] Ils lui disent : «Femme, pourquoi pleures-tu?» Et elle leur répond : «Parce qu'on a enlevé mon Seigneur, et que je ne sais où on l'a placé.»
[20:14] Ayant dit cela, elle se retourne et, derrière elle, elle voit Jésus qui était là, debout. (Elle ne savait pas que c'était Jésus.)
[20:15] Jésus lui dit : «Femme, pourquoi pleures-tu? Qui cherches-tu?» Elle, le prenant pour le jardinier, lui répond : «Seigneur, si c'est toi qui l'as emporté, dis-moi où tu l'as placé, et j'irai le chercher.»
[20:16] Jésus lui dit : «Marie!» Elle se retourne et lui dit en hébreu : «Rabbouni !» (ce qui veut dire : Maître!).
[20:17] Jésus lui dit : «Ne me touche point! car je ne suis pas encore monté vers le Père, mais va vers mes frères et dis-leur: «Je monte vers mon Père et votre Père, vers mon Dieu et votre Dieu.»
[20:18] Marie Madeleine va porter la nouvelle aux disciples : «J'ai vu le Seigneur, et voilà ce qu'il m'a dit.»
[20:19] Le soir de ce même jour, le premier de la semaine, les portes du lieu où les disciples étaient rassemblés étant fermées, par crainte des Juifs, Jésus vint et se tint au milieu d'eux, et leur dit : «La paix soit avec vous!»
[20:20] et, en disant cela, il leur montra ses mains et son côté. Les disciples se réjouirent, voyant le Seigneur.
[20:21] Il leur dit encore une fois : «La paix soit avec vous! Comme le Père m'a envoyé, moi aussi, je vous envoie.»
[20:22] En disant cela, il souffla sur eux et leur dit : «Recevez l'Esprit saint.
[20:23] A ceux auxquels vous remettrez les péchés, ils seront remis ; à ceux auxquels vous les retiendrez, ils seront retenus.»
[20:24] Un des douze, Thomas, appelé Didyme, n'était pas avec eux lorsque vint Jésus.
[20:25] Les autres disciples lui dirent : «Nous avons vu le Seigneur.» Il leur répondit : «Si je ne vois pas dans ses mains la marque des clous, si je ne mets pas le doigt à la place des clous, si je ne mets pas la main dans son côté, je n'en croirai rien.»
[20:26] Huit jours après, les disciples étaient réunis dans la même chambre, Thomas avec eux ; Jésus vint, les portes étant fermées. Il se tint au milieu d'eux et dit : «La paix soit avec vous.»
[20:27] Ensuite il dit à Thomas: «Porte ici ton doigt et regarde mes mains ; avance aussi ta main, mets-la dans mon côté, et ne deviens pas incrédule, mais croyant!»
[20:28] Thomas lui répondit par ces paroles : «Mon Seigneur et mon Dieu!» —
[20:29] «Parce que tu m'as vu, tu as cru!» lui dit Jésus ; «Heureux ceux qui, sans avoir vu, sont croyants!»
[20:30] Jésus a fait encore, en présence des disciples, beaucoup d'autres miracles qui ne sont pas consignés dans ce livre.
[20:31] Ceux-ci le sont, afin que vous croyiez que Jésus est le Christ, le Fils de Dieu, et que, le croyant, vous ayez la vie en son nom.
[21:1] Après cela, sur le bord de la mer de Tibériade, Jésus se manifesta encore aux disciples. Voici comment :
[21:2] Simon Pierre, Thomas appelé Didyme, Nathanaël de Cana en Galilée, les fils de Zébédée et deux autres disciples étaient ensemble.
[21:3] «Je vais pêcher», leur dit Simon Pierre. «Nous y allons avec toi» répondirent les autres. Ils partirent et montèrent dans la barque. Cette nuit-là ils ne prirent rien.
[21:4] Le matin venu, Jésus était là debout sur le rivage. Les disciples cependant ne savaient pas que c'était Jésus.
[21:5] «Enfants, leur dit-il, n'avez-vous rien à manger?» — Ils lui répondirent : «Non.» —
[21:6] «Jetez le filet, dit Jésus, à droite de la barque, vous trouverez.» Ils le jetèrent et ils n'avaient plus la force de le retirer tellement il était plein de poissons.
[21:7] Alors le disciple que Jésus aimait dit à Pierre : «C'est le Seigneur !» A cette parole : «C'est le Seigneur», Simon Pierre qui n'était pas vêtu remit sa tunique et se jeta à l'eau.
[21:8] Quant aux autres disciples ils vinrent avec la barque, et comme ils étaient peu éloignés de terre, — environ de deux cents coudées, — ils traînaient le filet plein de poissons.
[21:9] Une fois descendus à terre, ils voient du charbon préparé, du, poisson dessus et du pain.
[21:10] Jésus leur dit : «Apportez quelques-uns des poissons que vous venez de prendre.»
[21:11] Simon Pierre monta alors dans la barque et tira à terre le filet. Il était plein de gros poissons ; il y en avait cent cinquante-trois et malgré ce grand nombre le filet ne se déchira pas.
[21:12] «Venez manger», dit Jésus aux disciples. Aucun d'eux n'osait lui poser cette question : «Qui es-tu?» Ils savaient que c'était le Seigneur.
[21:13] Jésus s'approche ; prend le pain et le leur donne, ainsi que le poisson.
[21:14] C'était la troisième fois, depuis sa résurrection d'entre les morts, que Jésus se manifestait à ses disciples.
[21:15] Quand ils eurent mangé, Jésus dit à Simon Pierre : «Simon, fils de Jean, m'aimes-tu plus que ceux-ci?» —Il lui répondit : «Oui, Seigneur, tu sais que je t'aime.» Jésus lui dit : «Fais paître mes agneaux.»
[21:16] Il lui dit une seconde fois : «Simon, fils de Jean, m'aimes-tu?» Il lui répondit : «Oui, Seigneur, tu sais que je t'aime.» Jésus lui dit : «Sois le pasteur de mes brebis.»
[21:17] Il lui dit pour la troisième fois : «Simon, fils de Jean, M'aimes-tu?» Pierre fut attristé de ce qu'il lui disait pour la troisième fois: «M'aimes-tu?» et lui répondit : «Seigneur, tu sais tout ; tu sais que je t'aime. Jésus lui dit: «Fais paître mes brebis.
[21:18] En vérité, en vérité, je te le dis, lorsque tu étais plus jeune, tu te ceignais toi-même et tu allais où tu voulais ; mais quand tu seras vieux, tu étendras les mains, un autre te ceindra, et te mènera où tu ne voudras pas.
[21:19] (Il dit cela pour indiquer par quel genre de mort Pierre devait glorifier Dieu) ; et après avoir ainsi parlé, il ajouta : «Suis-moi.»
[21:20] Pierre, se retournant, voit le suivre le disciple que Jésus aimait, celui qui, pendant le repas, s'était penché sur sa poitrine et lui avait dit : «Seigneur qui est celui qui te livrera?»
[21:21] Le voyant, Pierre dit à Jésus : «Seigneur, et celui-ci, que lui arrivera-t-il ?»
[21:22] Jésus lui répond : «Si je veux qu'il attende jusqu'à ce que je vienne, que t'importe? Toi, suis-moi.»
[21:23] Alors le bruit se répandit parmi les frères que ce disciple-là ne mourrait pas. Cependant Jésus n'a pas dit à Pierre : «Il ne mourra pas ;» mais : «Si je veux qu'il attende jusqu'à ce que je vienne, que t'importe.»
[21:24] C'est ce disciple-là même qui atteste ces choses et qui les a écrites, et nous savons que son témoignage est véridique.
[21:25] Il y a encore beaucoup d'autres choses que Jésus a faites. Si on les écrivait l'une après l'autre, je crois que le monde entier ne pourrait contenir les livres qu'on écrirait. 

### Acts

[1:1] Dans mon premier récit, Théophile, j'ai raconté depuis le commencement tout ce que Jésus a fait et enseigné
[1:2] jusqu'au jour où, après avoir donné, par l'Esprit saint, ses ordres aux apôtres qu'il avait choisis, il fut enlevé au ciel.
[1:3] Déjà, après sa passion, il s'était montré à eux vivant, leur avait donné de nombreuses preuves de sa résurrection, leur était apparu pendant quarante jours, leur avait parlé des choses du Royaume de Dieu.
[1:4] Un jour qu'ils étaient réunis, il leur ordonna de ne pas quitter Jérusalem, mais d'y attendre ce que le Père avait promis... «Ce dont vous m'avez entendu parler, leur dit-il ;
[1:5] car Jean baptisait d'eau, mais vous, vous serez baptisés d'Esprit saint dans peu de jours.»
[1:6] Les apôtres, tout en l'accompagnant, lui posaient des questions : «Seigneur, lui demandèrent-ils, est-ce maintenant que tu vas rétablir la royauté en Israël ?»
[1:7] Il leur répondit : «Vous n'avez pas à savoir les époques ou les moments que le Père a fixés de sa propre autorité ;
[1:8] mais vous recevrez une grande force quand le saint Esprit descendra sur vous, et vous serez mes témoins à Jérusalem, dans toute la Judée, en Samarie et jusqu'au bout du monde.»
[1:9] Pendant qu'il prononçait ces paroles et pendant qu'ils le regardaient, il fut enlevé et une nuée vint le dérober à leurs yeux.
[1:10] Comme ils considéraient attentivement le ciel pendant qu'il s'en allait, deux hommes en vêtements blancs se présentèrent à eux :
[1:11] «Galiléens, leur dirent-ils, pourquoi restez-vous là à regarder au ciel ? Ce Jésus qui vient d'être enlevé au ciel du milieu de vous, en reviendra de la même manière que vous l'avez vu y monter.»
[1:12] Ils retournèrent alors de la montagne appelée Bois d'Oliviers à Jérusalem, qui est tout près, à la distance d'un chemin de sabbat.
[1:13] Rentrés dans la ville, ils montèrent à la chambre haute, où ils se tenaient d'ordinaire. C'étaient : Pierre, Jean, Jacques et André, — Philippe et Thomas, — Barthélemy et Matthieu, — Jacques, fils d'Alphée, Simon le Zélote et Judas, fils de Jacques.
[1:14] Eux tous, avec persévérance et d'un seul coeur, s'y adonnaient à la prière avec les femmes, avec Marie, mère de Jésus, et avec les frères de celui-ci.
[1:15] Un de ces jours-là, Pierre se leva au milieu des frères (cent vingt personnes environ étaient ensemble réunies) et voici ce qu'il dit :
[1:16] «Mes frères, il fallait que s'accomplît l'Écriture, la prédiction de l'Esprit saint faite par la bouche de David sur Judas (celui qui s'est chargé de conduire ceux qui ont arrêté Jésus),
[1:17] parce qu'il était au nombre des nôtres et qu'il avait reçu sa part de notre ministère
[1:18] — (cet homme, après avoir acheté un champ avec le salaire de son crime, s'est jeté, la tête la première ; son corps s'est brisé par le milieu ; ses entrailles se sont répandues ;
[1:19] ce fait est si bien, connu de tous les habitants de Jérusalem, que dans leur langue ils appellent ce champ Acheldamach, c'est-à-dire champ du sang)
[1:20] en effet, il est écrit au livre des Psaumes : «Que sa demeure devienne un désert! Que personne n'y habite !» et : «Qu'un autre obtienne sa charge.»
[1:21] Donc, il faut qu'un des hommes qui nous ont accompagnés pendant tout le temps, depuis que le Seigneur Jésus a commencé jusqu'à ce qu'il ait cessé d'être avec nous,
[1:22] en prenant depuis le baptême de Jean jusqu'au jour où il nous a été enlevé, devienne avec nous témoin de sa résurrection.»
[1:23] Ils en proposèrent deux : Joseph dit Bar-Sabbas, surnommé Justus, et Matthias ;
[1:24] puis ils firent cette prière : «Toi, Seigneur, qui connais tous les coeurs, montre-nous lequel de ces deux frères tu as choisi
[1:25] pour qu'il occupe la place de ministre et d'apôtre que Judas a quittée pour aller à la place qui est la sienne.»
[1:26] Ensuite on tira au sort. Le sort tomba sur Matthias, qui fut alors associé aux onze apôtres.
[2:1] Quand arriva le jour de la Pentecôte, ils étaient tous ensemble, réunis,
[2:2] et tout à coup il se produisit, venant du ciel, un bruit semblable à un violent coup de vent, bruit qui remplit toute la maison où ils se trouvaient ;
[2:3] il leur apparut alors, séparées les unes des autres, des langues ressemblant à des flammes ; il s'en posa une sur chacun d'eux ;
[2:4] et ils furent tous remplis d'Esprit saint et commencèrent à parler en langues étrangères, selon que l'Esprit leur donnait de s'exprimer.
[2:5] A Jérusalem se trouvaient alors en séjour des Juifs, des hommes pieux venus de tous les pays qui sont sous le ciel.
[2:6] Quand ce bruit se fit entendre, ils accoururent en foule et chacun fut stupéfait d'entendre parler sa propre langue.
[2:7] Ils étaient tous confondus d'étonnement et disaient : «Tous ces hommes qui sont là et qui parlent, ne sont-ils pas Galiléens?
[2:8] Comment donc chacun de nous les entend-il s'exprimer dans sa langue maternelle?
[2:9] Parthes, Mèdes, Élamites, habitants de la Mésopotamie, de la Judée et de la Cappadoce, du Pont et de l'Asie,
[2:10] de la Phrygie et de la Pamphylie, de l'Égypte et du territoire de la Lybie cyrénaïque, étrangers de passage, venus de Rome! tant Juifs que prosélytes!...
[2:11] Crétois!... Arabes!... nous les entendons parler dans nos langues des grandes choses que Dieu a faites !»
[2:12] Ils étaient tous confondus, ne savaient que penser ; les uns se demandaient : «Qu'en adviendra-t-il?»
[2:13] D'autres se moquaient, en disant qu'ils étaient pris de vin.
[2:14] Pierre alors s'avança avec les onze, éleva la voix et s'exprima ainsi : «Habitants de Judée et vous qui êtes en séjour à Jérusalem, Sachez bien ceci, prêtez l'oreille à mes paroles :
[2:15] ces hommes ne sont point ivres, comme vous le supposez, car il n'est que la troisième heure du jour,
[2:16] mais il arrive ce dont a parlé le prophète Joël :
[2:17] «Il arrivera pendant les derniers jours, dit Dieu, Que je répandrai de mon Esprit sur toute chair ; Et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront ; Vos jeunes gens auront des visions Et vos vieillards auront des songes ;
[2:18] Oui, sur mes serviteurs et sur mes servantes, en ces jours-là, Je répandrai de mon Esprit et ils prophétiseront.
[2:19] Je ferai paraître des prodiges là-haut dans le ciel, Et des miracles ici-bas sur la terre, Du sang, du feu et des tourbillons de fumée,
[2:20] Le soleil se changera en ténèbres - Et la lune en sang, Lorsque approchera le grand et glorieux jour du Seigneur ;
[2:21] Et quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé.»
[2:22] «Hommes d'Israël, écoutez ces paroles : Jésus de Nazareth, cet homme dont Dieu a légitimé la mission devant vous, en faisant par ses mains et sous vos yeux des miracles, des prodiges et des signes, comme vous le savez parfaitement,
[2:23] cet homme qui a été trahi — (et c'était un dessein arrêté par Dieu, une détermination prise d'avance par lui) — que des mains impies ont crucifié, que vous avez mis à mort,
[2:24] Dieu l'a ressuscité en anéantissant les horreurs de la mort, puisqu'il ne pouvait pas rester en sa puissance.
[2:25] Et, en effet, David dit de lui : «Je voyais toujours le Seigneur devant mois, Car il est à ma droite pour que je ne sois pas ébranlé ;
[2:26] Voilà pourquoi mon coeur a été dans la joie Et ma langue a chanté mon bonheur ; Aussi mon corps reposera-t-il plein d'espérance ;
[2:27] Car tu ne laisseras pas mon âme dans la Demeure-des-morts ; Et tu ne permettras pas que ton Saint voie la corruption ;
[2:28] Tu m'as fait connaître les sentiers de la vie, Tu me rempliras de joie par ta présence.»
[2:29] «Mes frères, permettez-moi de vous dire en toute liberté que, lui, le patriarche David, est mort, qu'il a été enseveli, que son tombeau est encore aujourd'hui au milieu de nous.
[2:30] Mais il était prophète, il savait que Dieu lui avait juré, sous la foi du serment, qu'un de ses descendants occuperait son trône ;
[2:31] c'est donc la résurrection du Christ qu'il a prévue et annoncée, disant: «Il n'a pas été laissé au séjour des morts Et son corps n'a pas vu la corruption.»
[2:32] «Eh bien, ce Christ, c'est le Jésus que Dieu a ressuscité et nous en sommes tous témoins.
[2:33] Puis il a été élevé à la droite de Dieu, il a reçu du Père la promesse de l'Esprit saint, et alors il l'a répandu comme vous le voyez et l'entendez.
[2:34] David, lui, n'est pas monté au ciel, il dit même : «Le Seigneur a dit à mon Seigneur Assieds-toi à ma droite
[2:35] Jusqu'à ce que je te donne tes ennemis pour marchepied. »
[2:36] «Sois donc bien convaincue, maison d'Israël tout entière, que Dieu a fait Seigneur et Christ ce Jésus que vous, vous avez crucifié.»
[2:37] Touchés jusqu'au fond du coeur par ces paroles, ils dirent à Pierre et aux autres apôtres : «Frères, que devons-nous faire?»
[2:38] Et alors Pierre : «Repentez-vous ; que chacun de vous se fasse baptiser au nom de Jésus-Christ pour la rémission de ses péchés, et vous recevrez le don du saint Esprit,
[2:39] car la promesse est pour vous, pour vos enfants, pour tous ceux qui sont au loin en aussi grand nombre que le Seigneur notre Dieu les appellera.»
[2:40] Il les conjurait par beaucoup d'autres paroles encore, et il les exhortait en disant : «Échappez à cette génération perverse!»
[2:41] Ceux donc qui accueillirent sa prédication reçurent le baptême, et, ce jour-là, trois mille âmes environ furent admises.
[2:42] Ils étaient assidus à suivre l'enseignement des apôtres et à vivre en communion fraternelle quand ils rompaient le pain et quand ils priaient.
[2:43] Ils étaient respectés de tout le monde ; les apôtres faisaient en grand nombre des prodiges et des miracles,
[2:44] et tous les croyants vivaient ensemble. Ils mettaient tout en commun ;
[2:45] ils vendaient leurs propriétés et leurs biens, et en partageaient le produit entre tous, en proportion des besoins de chacun.
[2:46] Tous ensemble, chaque jour, étaient assidus au Temple et, dans leur maison, ils rompaient le pain, ils prenaient leurs repas d'un coeur pur et joyeux,
[2:47] louant Dieu et se faisant aimer de tout le peuple. Le Seigneur ajoutait chaque jour à l'église ceux qui étaient sauvés.
[3:1] Pierre et Jean montaient un jour au Temple pour la prière de la neuvième heure ;
[3:2] or, il y avait un homme estropié de naissance que, tous les jours, on apportait et on déposait à la porte du Temple dite «La Belle», pour demander l'aumône à ceux qui entraient.
[3:3] Voyant Pierre et Jean qui allaient pénétrer dans le Temple, il s'adressa à eux pour recevoir une aumône.
[3:4] Pierre arrêta sur lui son regard, ainsi que Jean : «Regarde-nous, lui dit-il.»
[3:5] Lui les fixait attentivement, s'attendant à recevoir quelque chose.
[3:6] Mais Pierre continua : «Je n'ai ni argent ni or, mais ce que j'ai, je te le donne ; au nom de Jésus-Christ de Nazareth, marche!»
[3:7] En même temps il lui prenait la main droite et le levait ; immédiatement ses pieds et ses chevilles devinrent fermes ;
[3:8] d'un saut il se mit debout ; il marchait! et il entra avec eux dans le Temple, marchant, sautant et louant Dieu.
[3:9] Tout le peuple le vit marcher et louer Dieu,
[3:10] chacun le reconnaissait ; c'était bien lui, l'homme qui demandait l'aumône assis à «La Belle Porte» du Temple ; complète était la stupéfaction comme l'enthousiasme de ce qui lui était arrivé.
[3:11] Cet homme ne quittant pas Pierre et Jean, c'est vers eux, au portique dit de Salomon, qu'accourut tout le peuple, confondu de surprise.
[3:12] Voyant cela, Pierre s'adressa ainsi à la foule : «Hommes d'Israël, Pourquoi vous étonnez-vous de ce qui vient de se passer? Pourquoi nous regardez-vous avec cette insistance, comme si c'était nous, par nos propres forces ou par notre piété, qui avions fait, marcher cet homme?
[3:13] Le Dieu d'Abraham, d'Isaac et de Jacob, le Dieu de nos pères a glorifié son serviteur Jésus que vous, vous avez livré et que vous avez renié devant Pilate, et cela, quand lui, il voulait le relâcher!
[3:14] Oui, vous avez renié le Saint et le Juste, et vous avez demandé la grâce d'un meurtrier,
[3:15] vous avez tué l'auteur de la vie, que Dieu a ressuscité d'entre les morts, et nous, nous sommes ses témoins.
[3:16] C'est par la foi en son nom que ce nom a guéri l'homme que vous voyez et connaissez ; la foi qui agit par lui a donné à cet homme, et en votre présence à tous, une guérison complète.»
[3:17] «Je sais d'ailleurs, frères, que vous avez fait tout cela dans votre ignorance et vos magistrats aussi.
[3:18] Dieu a accompli de cette manière ce qu'il avait prédit d'avance par la bouche de tous les prophètes, savoir que son Christ devait souffrir.
[3:19] Repentez-vous donc et convertissez-vous pour que vos péchés soient effacés et alors pourront venir de la part du Seigneur des temps de rafraîchissement,
[3:20] et il vous enverra celui qu'il vous a destiné, Jésus-Christ,
[3:21] que le ciel doit recevoir jusqu'à l'époque du rétablissement universel dont Dieu a parlé autrefois par la bouche de ses saints prophètes.»
[3:22] «D'une part, Moïse a dit : «Le Seigneur notre Dieu vous suscitera d'entre vos frères un prophète semblable à moi, vous l'écouterez dans tout ce qu'il vous dira,
[3:23] et quiconque n'écoutera pas ce prophète, sera exterminé du milieu du peuple.»
[3:24] D'autre part, tous les prophètes, depuis Samuel et ses successeurs, ont parlé et ont annoncé ces jours-là.
[3:25] Vous êtes les fils des prophètes et les héritiers de l'alliance que Dieu, a conclue avec nos pères, disant à Abraham : «Toutes les familles de la terre seront bénies en ta postérité.»
[3:26] Pour vous, les premiers, Dieu a suscité son serviteur et l'a envoyé vous bénir en détournant chacun de vous de ses iniquités.»
[4:1] Pendant qu'ils parlaient au peuple, survinrent les prêtres, le capitaine du Temple et les Sadducéens,
[4:2] fort ennuyés de ce qu'ils enseignaient le peuple et lui annonçaient la résurrection d'entre les morts en lui parlant de Jésus.
[4:3] Ils les firent arrêter et jeter en prison, et comme il était déjà tard, ils les y laissèrent jusqu'au lendemain.
[4:4] Cependant plusieurs de ceux qui avaient entendu le discours de Pierre devinrent croyants, et le nombre des frères fut porté à cinq mille environ.
[4:5] Le lendemain se réunirent, à Jérusalem, les magistrats, les Anciens, les Scribes,
[4:6] le grand-prêtre Anne, Kaïphe, Jean, Alexandre, tous ceux qui étaient des grandes familles sacerdotales.
[4:7] Ils firent comparaître Pierre et Jean et leur posèrent cette question : «Par quelle autorité ou au nom de qui avez-vous agi ?»
[4:8] Alors Pierre, plein d'Esprit saint, leur dit : «Magistrats du peuple et Anciens,
[4:9] Puisque nous sommes interrogés aujourd'hui à propos du bien que nous avons fait à un homme malade, puisque vous voulez savoir comment il a été guéri,
[4:10] sachez vous tous, et que le peuple d'Israël tout entier sache aussi, que c'est au nom de Jésus-Christ de Nazareth, crucifié par vous, ressuscité d'entre les morts par Dieu ; oui, c'est par lui que cet homme est là devant vous en bonne santé.
[4:11] Ce Jésus est «La pierre rejetée par vous, les constructeurs, Et devenue la pierre angulaire.»
[4:12] «Il n'y a de salut en aucun autre ; car, sous le ciel, il n'a pas été donné d'autre nom aux hommes par lequel nous devions être sauvés.»
[4:13] Quand ils virent l'assurance de Pierre et de Jean, qu'ils savaient être des gens du peuple, sans instruction aucune, ils furent très surpris. Ils les reconnaissaient pour avoir été avec Jésus,
[4:14] et voyant debout à côté d'eux l'homme qu'ils avaient guéri, ils n'avaient rien à répliquer.
[4:15] Alors ils leur ordonnèrent de sortir du Sanhédrin, puis ils délibérèrent :
[4:16] «Que faire à ces gens? se disaient-ils, car pour tous les habitants de Jérusalem il est évident qu'ils ont fait un miracle remarquable et il nous est impossible de le nier.
[4:17] Cependant, pour que l'affaire ne se répande pas davantage dans le peuple, interdisons-leur avec menaces de jamais parler à homme quelconque en ce nom-là.»
[4:18] Ils les firent rappeler et leur défendirent absolument de parler et d'enseigner au nom de Jésus.
[4:19] Mais Pierre et Jean leur répondirent ainsi : «S'il est juste devant Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-le ;
[4:20] quant à nous, nous ne pouvons pas ne pas parler de ce que nous avons vu et entendu.»
[4:21] Ils les relâchèrent néanmoins, après avoir réitéré leurs menaces, ne trouvant aucun moyen de les punir, à cause du peuple, car tout le monde glorifiait Dieu de ce qui était arrivé :
[4:22] en effet, l'homme qui avait été guéri par ce miracle était âgé de plus de quarante ans.
[4:23] Lorsqu'ils furent libres, ils se rendirent auprès des leurs et leur racontèrent tout ce que les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens leur avaient dit.
[4:24] Quand ils l'eurent appris, ils élevèrent unanimes leurs voix à Dieu : «O Maître, dirent-ils, Toi qui as fait le ciel, la terre, la mer et tout ce qui s'y trouve!
[4:25] Toi qui as dit par l'Esprit saint, par la bouche de notre père, ton serviteur David : «Pourquoi les nations ont-elles tremblé de colère, Et les peuples ont-ils formé des desseins inutiles?
[4:26] Les rois de la terre se sont soulevés Et les magistrats se sont ligués ensemble Contre le Seigneur et contre son Oint,»
[4:27] — (en effet, Hérode et Ponce-Pilate avec les païens et le peuple d'Israël se sont véritablement ligués dans cette ville même contre ton saint serviteur Jésus, que tu as oint
[4:28] pour faire tout ce que ta main et ta volonté avaient décidé d'avance),
[4:29] — à présent, «Seigneur, aie l'oeil ouvert sur leurs menaces et donne à tes serviteurs d'annoncer ta Parole en toute assurance,
[4:30] lorsque tu «étendras ta main pour opérer des guérisons, des miracles et des prodiges par le nom de ton saint serviteur Jésus.»
[4:31] Quand ils eurent prié, le lieu où ils étaient rassemblés trembla, tous furent remplis du saint Esprit et annonçaient avec assurance la Parole de Dieu.
[4:32] La multitude des croyants n'avaient qu'un coeur et qu'une âme ; personne ne disait rien posséder qui lui fût propre, mais ils mettaient tout en commun.
[4:33] Les apôtres rendaient avec une grande énergie leur témoignage de la résurrection du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, et une grande grâce reposait sur eux tous ;
[4:34] car ils n'avaient pas un seul indigent : tous ceux qui étaient propriétaires de terres ou de maisons les vendaient, apportaient le prix de leur vente et le déposaient aux pieds des apôtres.
[4:35] On le distribuait ensuite à chacun selon ses besoins.
[4:36] C'est ainsi qu'un lévite, Chypriote de naissance, Joseph, surnommé par les apôtres Bar-Nabas (ce qu'on peut traduire fils de la prédication), possédait un champ
[4:37] qu'il vendit ; il en apporta l'argent et le déposa aux pieds des apôtres.
[5:1] Mais un homme nommé Ananias, d'accord avec sa femme Sapphira, vendit une propriété,
[5:2] mit de côté une partie du prix de vente, sa femme le sachant, et apportant le reste, le déposa aux pieds des apôtres.
[5:3] Ananias, lui dit Pierre, pourquoi Satan s'est-il emparé de ton coeur, jusqu'à te faire mentir à l'Esprit saint, et te faire mettre de côté une partie du prix de ton champ?
[5:4] Si tu ne l'avais pas vendu, ne te serait-il pas resté? et, si tu le vendais, ne pouvais-tu pas à ton gré disposer de sa valeur? comment as-tu pu former un pareil projet dans ton coeur? ce n'est pas à des hommes que tu as menti, c'est à Dieu.»
[5:5] A l'ouïe de ces paroles, Ananias tomba et expira. Tous les auditeurs furent frappés d'épouvante ;
[5:6] cependant les plus jeunes, s'étant levés, l'arrangèrent pour l'ensevelir, puis ils l'emportèrent et l'enterrèrent.
[5:7] Il s'était écoulé trois heures environ, lorsque sa femme entra, ne sachant pas ce qui était arrivé.
[5:8] Pierre s'adressa à elle : «Dis-moi si c'est à ce prix-là que vous avez vendu votre champ?» Elle répondit : «C'est à ce prix-là.»
[5:9] Mais Pierre: «Eh quoi! vous vous êtes concertés pour tenter l'Esprit du Seigneur ! Voici les pas de ceux qui ont enseveli ton mari s'approchent de cette porte ; ils vont t'emporter!»
[5:10] A l'instant même elle tomba à ses pieds et expira ; les jeunes gens qui rentraient la trouvèrent morte, ils l'emportèrent et l'enterrèrent à côté de son mari.
[5:11] L'Église tout entière et tous ceux qui apprirent ces faits furent frappés d'épouvante.
[5:12] Cependant il se faisait, dans le peuple, par les mains des apôtres, des miracles et des prodiges en grand nombre. Ceux-ci se tenaient d'habitude tous ensemble sous le portique de Salomon.
[5:13] Aucun des autres n'osait entrer en rapport avec eux, mais le peuple leur montrait une grande admiration ;
[5:14] des croyants toujours plus nombreux, des hommes et des femmes en foule s'attachaient au Seigneur ;
[5:15] c'était au point qu'on portait les malades jusque dans les rues, qu'on les déposait sur de petits lits et sur des grabats afin que, Pierre venant à passer, son ombre au moins couvrît quelqu'un d'eux.
[5:16] Même des villes voisines, la foule accourait à Jérusalem, amenant des malades et des personnes tourmentées par des Esprits impurs : tous étaient guéris.
[5:17] Cependant le grand-prêtre et tous ceux de son parti (le parti des Sadducéens) se mirent en mouvement. Poussés par la jalousie,
[5:18] ils firent arrêter les apôtres et les jetèrent dans la prison publique.
[5:19] Mais un ange du Seigneur ouvrit, pendant la nuit, les portes de la prison, les fit sortir et leur dit :
[5:20] «Allez vous montrer au Temple et annoncez au peuple toutes ces paroles de vie.»
[5:21] A ces mots, ils entrèrent au Temple dès le point du jour et reprirent leur enseignement. Cependant le grand-prêtre et ses partisans convoquèrent le Sanhédrin et tout le sénat des Israélites, puis ils envoyèrent chercher les apôtres à la prison.
[5:22] Leurs agents s'y rendirent donc et ne les y trouvèrent pas ; ils revinrent et rapportèrent le fait en ces termes :
[5:23] «Nous avons trouvé la prison fermée avec grand soin et les sentinelles se tenant aux portes ; nous avons ouvert et, dedans, nous n'avons trouvé personne.»
[5:24] A l'ouïe de ces paroles, le capitaine du Temple et les chefs des prêtres se demandèrent avec inquiétude où étaient les apôtres et ce que tout cela deviendrait.
[5:25] Là-dessus, quelqu'un vint leur dire : «Les hommes que vous avez fait mettre en prison sont installés au Temple et enseignent le peuple.»
[5:26] Le capitaine du Temple partit alors avec ses agents et les amena, mais sans employer la force, car ils avaient peur du peuple qui aurait pu les lapider.
[5:27] Ils les amenèrent donc et les introduisirent dans le Sanhédrin.
[5:28] Le grand-prêtre les interrogea «Ne vous avons-nous pas expressément interdit, leur dit-il, d'enseigner en ce nom-là, et voilà que vous avez rempli Jérusalem de votre enseignement et que vous voulez faire retomber sur nous le sang de cet homme!»
[5:29] Mais Pierre et les apôtres répondirent par ces paroles : «Il faut obéir à Dieu plutôt qu'aux hommes ;»
[5:30] le Dieu de nos pères a ressuscité Jésus que vous, vous avez fait mourir en le pendant à une croix.
[5:31] Dieu, par sa droite, l'a élevé à la dignité de Chef et de Sauveur, pour donner à Israël la repentance et le pardon des péchés,
[5:32] et nous, nous sommes témoins de ces choses, ainsi que le saint Esprit donné par Dieu à ceux qui lui obéissent.»
[5:33] Ce langage les exaspéra ; ils voulaient les faire mettre à mort ;
[5:34] mais un des membres du Sanhédrin, un des Pharisiens, appelé Gamaliel, un légiste qui était estimé de tout le peuple, se leva et demanda qu'on fît sortir un instant les apôtres,
[5:35] puis il dit : «Israélites, prenez bien garde à ce que vous allez faire à ces hommes ;
[5:36] il y a quelque temps s'est levé Theudas qui prétendait aussi être quelque chose, et quatre cents hommes environ se joignirent à lui ; il fut tué et tous ceux qui s'étaient ralliés à lui ont été mis en déroute et réduits à rien.
[5:37] Après lui, à l'époque du recensement, s'est levé Judas le Galiléen, et il a attiré bien des gens à lui ; celui-là aussi a péri, et tous ceux qu'il avait ralliés à lui ont été dispersés.
[5:38] Eh bien, je vous dis ceci : Cessez vos poursuites et laissez aller ces hommes ; car si cette entreprise ou cette oeuvre vient des hommes, elle tombera d'elle-même ;
[5:39] si, au contraire, elle vient de Dieu, vous ne pourrez l'arrêter et vous risquez de vous trouver avoir combattu contre Dieu.»
[5:40] Ils se rangèrent à son avis et, ayant rappelé les apôtres, ils leur firent donner la bastonnade, puis leur défendirent de prêcher au nom de Jésus et les relâchèrent.
[5:41] Les apôtres se retirèrent de devant le Sanhédrin pleins de joie d'avoir été jugés dignes de subir des outrages pour le nom de Dieu ;
[5:42] et tous les jours, dans le Temple et dans leur maison, ils ne cessaient d'enseigner et d'annoncer l'Évangile de Jésus-Christ.
[6:1] En ce temps-là, le nombre des disciples augmentant toujours, les Hellénistes se plaignirent de ce que leurs veuves étaient moins bien traitées dans les distributions quotidiennes que celles des Hébreux.
[6:2] Les douze convoquèrent alors une réunion de tous les disciples et leur dirent : «Il n'est pas convenable que nous négligions la prédication de la parole de Dieu pour faire le service des tables.
[6:3] Choisissez donc parmi vous, frères, sept hommes, pleins d'Esprit saint, sages et considérés, que nous chargerons de ce service
[6:4] et, quant à nous, nous nous occuperons exclusivement de la prière et du ministère de la parole.»
[6:5] Cette proposition plut à tout le monde et les élus furent Étienne, homme plein de foi et d'Esprit saint, Philippe, Procore, Nicanor, Timon, Parménas et Nicolas d'Antioche, un prosélyte.
[6:6] On les présenta aux apôtres qui prièrent en leur imposant les mains.
[6:7] La parole de Dieu se répandait de plus en plus, le nombre des disciples augmentait considérablement à Jérusalem ; une foule de prêtres, entre autres, embrassèrent la foi.
[6:8] Étienne, plein de grâce et plein de force, faisait dans le peuple des prodiges et de grands miracles.
[6:9] Cependant quelques membres de la synagogue dite des Affranchis, des gens de Cyrène et d'Alexandrie, et d'autres venus de Cilicie et d'Asie s'émurent et commencèrent à discuter avec lui,
[6:10] mais sans pouvoir résister à sa sagesse et à l'Esprit par lequel il parlait.
[6:11] Alors ils subornèrent des individus qui dirent : «Nous l'avons entendu prononcer des paroles blasphématoires contre Moïse et contre Dieu.»
[6:12] Ils soulevèrent le peuple, les Anciens et les Scribes, et, survenant à l'improviste, ils s'emparèrent de lui et l'amenèrent au Sanhédrin.
[6:13] Là ils produisirent de faux témoins qui dirent: «Cet homme ne cesse de tenir des discours contre le Lieu saint et contre la Loi.
[6:14] Nous l'avons entendu dire que Jésus, cet homme de Nazareth, détruira ce lieu et changera les institutions que nous tenons de Moïse.»
[6:15] Tous ceux qui siégeaient au Sanhédrin avaient les yeux fixés sur Étienne, et, quand ils le regardaient ainsi, il leur semblait voir un ange.
[7:1] «Tout cela est-il vrai?» lui demanda le grand-prêtre.
[7:2] Étienne dit alors : «Mes frères et mes pères, écoutez ! Le Dieu de gloire apparut à notre père Abraham, en Mésopotamie, avant son établissement à Charran,
[7:3] et lui dit : «Sors de ton pays et de ta famille et va dans le pays que je te montrerai.»
[7:4] Il sortit alors du pays des Chaldéens et s'établit à Charran. De là, après la mort de son père, Dieu le fit passer dans ce pays-ci que vous habitez maintenant.»
[7:5] «Il ne lui donna aucune propriété dans ce pays, pas même de quoi poser le pied, mais il promit de le mettre, lui et ses descendants, en sa possession, quoiqu'il n'eût pas d'enfant.
[7:6] Voici comment Dieu parla : «Ses descendants demeureront dans un pays étranger, on les fera esclaves et on les persécutera pendant quatre cents ans
[7:7] et la nation qui les fera esclaves c'est moi qui la jugerai, dit Dieu, et ensuite ils partiront et me rendront un culte dans ce lieu-ci.»
[7:8] «Puis Dieu fit avec Abraham l'alliance de la circoncision. C'est ainsi qu'ayant engendré Isaac, Abraham le circoncit le huitième jour, de même Isaac Jacob, et Jacob les douze patriarches.»
[7:9] «Les patriarches, jaloux de Joseph, le vendirent pour le faire emmener en Égypte.»
[7:10] «Mais Dieu était avec lui, il le tira de toutes ses épreuves, il lui donna de la sagesse et lui fit trouver grâce devant Pharaon, roi d'Égypte, qui l'établit gouverneur d'Égypte et de toute sa maison.»
[7:11] «Il survint une famine dans toute l'Égypte et en Chanaan, la détresse était grande, et nos pères ne trouvaient pas de quoi se nourrir.
[7:12] Mais Jacob apprit qu'il y avait du blé en Égypte et il y envoya nos pères une première fois.
[7:13] Au second voyage, Joseph se fit reconnaître par ses frères et Pharaon apprit quelle était l'origine de Joseph.»
[7:14] «Alors Joseph envoya chercher son père Jacob et toute sa famille, en tout soixante-quinze personnes.
[7:15] Jacob descendit en Égypte et y mourut ; nos pères aussi ;
[7:16] on les transporta à Sichem et on les déposa dans le tombeau qu'Abraham, à prix d'argent, y avait acheté des fils d'Emmor.»
[7:17] «Lorsque approcha le moment où devait s'accomplir la promesse solennellement faite par Dieu à Abraham, le peuple s'accrut et se multiplia en Égypte
[7:18] jusqu'au règne d'un autre roi qui n'avait pas connu Joseph.»
[7:19] Celui-ci traita notre peuple par la ruse et persécuta nos pères jusqu'à leur faire exposer leurs enfants pour leur ôter la vie.»
[7:20] «C'est alors que naquit Moïse ; il était d'une divine beauté ; trois mois il fut élevé dans la maison de son père.
[7:21] Quand il fut exposé, la fille de Pharaon le recueillit et l'éleva comme son propre fils.
[7:22] Moïse fut instruit dans toute la sagesse des Égyptiens ; il était puissant en paroles et en oeuvres.»
[7:23] «Quand il eut quarante ans accomplis, il lui monta au coeur le désir de visiter ses frères les enfants d'Israël.
[7:24] Il en vit maltraiter un et, prenant son parti, il vengea le tort qui lui était fait en frappant l'Égyptien.
[7:25] Il pensait faire comprendre à ses frères que Dieu, par ses mains, voulait les délivrer ; mais ils ne comprirent pas.
[7:26] Le lendemain il se présenta à eux pendant qu'ils se querellaient et comme il les exhortait à se réconcilier en leur disant : «Vous êtes frères, pourquoi vous maltraitez-vous?»
[7:27] celui qui faisait tort à son prochain le repoussa par ces mots : «Qui donc t'a nommé notre chef et notre juge?
[7:28] Voudrais-tu me tuer, moi aussi, comme l'Égyptien que tu as tué hier ?»
[7:29] A cette parole, Moïse prit la fuite et alla vivre en étranger dans le pays de Madian, où il engendra deux fils.»
[7:30] «Quarante ans plus tard, un ange lui apparut au désert du mont Sinaï dans la flamme d'un buisson en feu.
[7:31] Moïse le vit et, tout surpris de cette apparition, il s'approchait pour la considérer de plus près, lorsque la voix du Seigneur se fit entendre :
[7:32] «Je suis le Dieu de tes pères, le Dieu d'Abraham et d'Isaac et de Jacob.
[7:33] Tremblant de peur, Moïse n'osa pas regarder davantage. Alors le Seigneur lui dit : «Ote de tes pieds tes chaussures, car le lieu où tu te trouves est une terre sainte ;
[7:34] j'ai regardé et j'ai vu la misère de mon peuple en Égypte, et j'ai entendu ses gémissements et je suis descendu pour le délivrer. Viens maintenant pour que je t'envoie en Égypte.»
[7:35] «C'est ce Moïse qu'ils avaient renié en disant : «Qui donc t'a nommé notre chef et notre juges?» que Dieu a envoyé comme chef et comme libérateur avec l'aide de l'ange qui lui était apparu dans le buisson.
[7:36] C'est lui qui les a délivrés en faisant des prodiges et des miracles en Égypte, sur la mer Rouge et au désert pendant quarante ans.
[7:37] C'est ce Moïse qui a dit aux enfants d'Israël : «Dieu vous suscitera d'entre vos frères un prophète semblable à moi.»
[7:38] C'est lui qui était au milieu de l'assemblée au désert avec l'ange qui lui parlait sur le mont Sinaï et avec nos pères. C'est lui qui reçut, pour vous les transmettre, des oracles de vie.
[7:39] C'est à lui que nos pères n'ont pas voulu obéir. C'est lui qu'ils repoussèrent pour tourner leurs coeurs vers l'Égypte,
[7:40] disant à Aaron : «Fais-nous des dieux qui nous conduisent ; car ce Moïse, qui nous a fait sortir du pays d'Égypte, nous ne savons ce qui lui est arrivé.»
[7:41] «En ces jours-là, ils fabriquèrent un veau et ils offrirent un sacrifice à cette idole et célébrèrent une joyeuse fête à ces oeuvres de leurs mains.
[7:42] Alors Dieu les abandonna et les livra au culte de l'armée du ciel, comme il est écrit dans le livre des Prophètes : «M'avez-vous offert des victimes et des sacrifices Au désert pendant quarante ans, ô maison d' Israël,
[7:43] Quand vous transportiez le tabernacle de Moloch et l'étoile de votre dieu Romphan, Ces idoles que vous avez fabriquées pour vous prosterner devant elles ? Eh bien, je vous déporterai au delà de Babylone.»
[7:44] «Nos pères avaient au désert le tabernacle du témoignage, comme l'avait ordonné celui qui avait dit à Moïse de le faire sur le modèle qu'il avait vu.
[7:45] Nos pères, l'ayant reçu à leur tour, l'introduisirent avec Josué dans le pays conquis sur les peuples chassés par Dieu devant eux. Il en fut ainsi jusqu'au jour de David
[7:46] qui trouva grâce devant Dieu et demanda à élever une demeure à la maison de Jacob.
[7:47] Ce fut Salomon qui lui bâtit une maison.»
[7:48] «Mais le Très Haut n'habite point dans ce qui est fait de mains d'hommes, comme le dit le prophète :
[7:49] «Le ciel est mon trône, La terre est mon marchepied ; Quelle maison m'édifierez-vous, dit le Seigneur, Ou quel sera mon lieu de repos?
[7:50] N'est-ce pas ma main qui a fait toutes ces choses ?»
[7:51] «Têtes dures! coeurs et oreilles incirconcis! vous résistez toujours à l'Esprit saint, comme l'ont fait vos pères!
[7:52] Lequel des prophètes vos pères n'ont-ils pas persécuté! Ils ont tué ceux qui annonçaient la venue du Juste, que vous avez trahi et dont vous avez été les meurtriers!
[7:53] Cette Loi que vous aviez reçue sur les ordres des anges, vous ne l'avez pas gardée...»
[7:54] Ces paroles leur mirent la rage au coeur et ils grincèrent des dents contre Étienne ;
[7:55] mais lui, plein d'Esprit saint, les yeux fixés au ciel, vit la gloire de Dieu et Jésus debout à la droite de Dieu,
[7:56] et il dit : «Voilà que je vois les cieux ouverts et le Fils de l'homme debout à la droite de Dieu!»
[7:57] Alors ils poussèrent de grands cris, se bouchèrent les oreilles, se précipitèrent tous ensemble sur lui
[7:58] et l'entraînèrent hors de la ville, où ils le lapidèrent. Les témoins déposèrent leurs vêtements aux pieds d'un jeune homme nommé Saul
[7:59] et, pendant qu'ils le lapidaient, Étienne priait et disait: «Seigneur Jésus, reçois mon esprit.»
[7:60] Puis il se mit à genoux et s'écria à haute voix : «Seigneur ne leur demande pas compte de ce péché!» En prononçant les paroles, il s'endormit.
[8:1] Saul avait approuvé ce meurtre. Ce même jour, une cruelle persécution sévit sur l'Église de Jérusalem ; tous les frères, sauf les apôtres, se répandirent dans toutes les parties de la Judée et de la Samarie.
[8:2] Cependant quelques pieux prosélytes ensevelirent Étienne et célébrèrent ses funérailles avec éclat.
[8:3] Quant à Saul il ravageait l'Église, il pénétrait dans les maisons, il en arrachait hommes et femmes et les faisait jeter en prison.
[8:4] Ceux qui avaient été dispersés allèrent çà et là annoncer la Bonne Nouvelle de la parole.
[8:5] Ainsi Philippe, qui s'était rendu dans la ville de Samarie, y prêcha le Christ.
[8:6] La population fut unanime à subir l'influence des paroles de Philippe, lorsqu'elle l'entendit et qu'elle vit les miracles qu'il faisait :
[8:7] des Esprits impurs sortirent du corps d'un grand nombre de possédés, en jetant de grands cris ; plusieurs paralytiques et plusieurs estropiés furent guéris.
[8:8] Ce fut une grande joie dans cette ville.
[8:9] Or, il y avait auparavant dans cette ville un homme nommé Simon, magicien de profession, qui en imposait au peuple de Samarie et se faisait passer pour un grand personnage.
[8:10] Tous, petits et grands, s'étaient attachés à lui et disaient: «C'est lui qui est la Puissance de Dieu, «la Grande», comme on l'appelle.»
[8:11] S'ils s'étaient ainsi attachés à lui, c'est que depuis longtemps ses sorcelleries leur en imposaient.
[8:12] Mais quand ils eurent été amenés à la foi par Philippe, qui leur annonçait l'Évangile du Royaume de Dieu et de la personne de Jésus-Christ, tous, hommes et femmes, se firent baptiser.
[8:13] Simon, lui-même, devint croyant, et, quand il fut baptisé, il ne quitta plus Philippe ; le spectacle des miracles et des prodiges étonnants qu'il opérait le remplissait d'admiration.
[8:14] A Jérusalem, les apôtres apprirent que la Samarie avait accueilli la Parole de Dieu, et Pierre et Jean y furent délégués.
[8:15] S'y étant rendus, ils prièrent pour les croyants, afin qu'ils reçussent l'Esprit saint.
[8:16] (en effet, il n'était encore descendu sur aucun d'eux, ils n'avaient été que baptisés au nom du Seigneur Jésus) ;
[8:17] alors Pierre et Jean leur imposèrent les mains, et ils reçurent l'Esprit saint.
[8:18] Quand Simon vit que l'imposition des mains des apôtres conférait l'Esprit, il leur offrit de l'argent :
[8:19] «Donnez-moi ce pouvoir, à moi aussi, dit-il, afin que ceux à qui j'imposerai les mains reçoivent l'Esprit saint.»
[8:20] — Périsse ton argent avec toi, lui répliqua Pierre, puisque tu as cru que le don de Dieu s'achète!
[8:21] Tu n'as ni part ni héritage dans tout ceci, car ton coeur n'est pas droit devant Dieu.
[8:22] Repens-toi donc de cette mauvaise pensée, et prie le Seigneur de, te pardonner ce dessein de ton coeur.
[8:23] Car, je le vois, tu es tout rempli de venin, tu es esclave de l'iniquité.»
[8:24] — «Priez vous-mêmes le Seigneur pour moi, répondit Simon, afin qu'il ne m'arrive rien de ce que vous avez dit.»
[8:25] Pierre et Jean, après avoir ainsi rendu leur témoignage et annoncé la Parole du Seigneur, regagnèrent Jérusalem, en évangélisant plusieurs villages du pays des Samaritains.
[8:26] Cependant un ange du Seigneur parla à Philippe : «Lève-toi, lui dit-il, et rends-toi vers le sud sur la route qui descend de Jérusalem à Gaza ; cette route est déserte.»
[8:27] Il se leva et il partit. Or, un Éthiopien, un eunuque, officier de la candace, reine d'Éthiopie, et gardien de tous ses trésors, venu adorer à Jérusalem,
[8:28] s'en retournait, et, assis sur son char, il lisait le prophète Ésaïe.
[8:29] L'Esprit dit à Philippe : «Approche-toi de ce char ; rejoins-le.»
[8:30] Philippe s'empressa de le faire, et entendant l'Éthiopien lire le prophète Ésaïe, il lui dit: «Comprends-tu ce que tu lis?» —
[8:31] «Comment le pourrai-je, répondit celui-ci, si quelqu'un ne me dirige?» Puis il invita Philippe à monter et à s'asseoir à côté de lui.
[8:32] Or voici quel était le passage de l'Écriture qu'il lisait : «Il a été conduit comme une brebis à la mort ; Comme un agneau muet devant celui qui le tond, Il n'a pas ouvert la bouche!
[8:33] Dans son humiliation son jugement a été levé ; Mais qui racontera sa génération? Car sa vie a été retranchée de la terre.»
[8:34] L'eunuque, s'adressant à Philippe : «Je te prie de me dire, lui demanda-t-il, qui le prophète désigne ici ? Est-ce lui-même? Est-ce quelqu'un d'autre?»
[8:35] Philippe prit alors la parole et, commençant par ce passage, il lui annonça l'Évangile de Jésus.
[8:36] Chemin faisant, ils rencontrèrent de l'eau. «Voilà de l'eau, dit l'eunuque, qui empêche que je ne sois baptisé?»
[8:37] (Philippe dit: Si tu crois de tout ton coeur, cela est possible. L'eunuque répondit : je crois que Jésus-Christ est le Fils de Dieu.)
[8:38] Il fit arrêter le char: Philippe et l'eunuque descendirent tous deux dans l'eau et celui-ci fut baptisé.
[8:39] Lorsqu'ils furent sortis de l'eau, l'Esprit du Seigneur enleva Philippe, l'eunuque ne le vit plus, et poursuivit son chemin plein de joie.
[8:40] Philippe, en effet, se trouvait être à Azot, d'où il partit, évangélisant toutes les villes qu'il rencontra jusqu'à son arrivée à Césarée.
[9:1] Saul, ne respirant toujours que menaces et carnage contre les disciples du Seigneur, s'adressa au grand-prêtre
[9:2] et lui demanda des lettres pour les synagogues de Damas, afin de pouvoir, s'il y trouvait des membres de la secte, hommes et femmes, les amener garrottés à Jérusalem.
[9:3] Pendant ce voyage, comme il approchait de Damas, tout à coup, autour de lui, brilla une lumière venue du ciel ;
[9:4] il tomba par terre et entendit une voix, lui disant: «Saul! Saul! pourquoi me persécutes-tu?»
[9:5] — «Qui es-tu, Seigneur?» répondit-il, et lui: «Je suis Jésus que tu persécutes,
[9:6] mais relève-toi, entre dans la ville, et on te dira ce que tu dois faire.»
[9:7] Ses compagnons de voyage restaient là, stupéfaits, entendant bien la voir, mais ne voyant personne.
[9:8] Saul se releva de terre, rouvrit les yeux, mais ne vit rien. On dut le tenir par la main pour le mener à Damas,
[9:9] et, pendant trois jours, il resta aveugle et ne prit aucune nourriture.
[9:10] Or il y avait à Damas un disciple du nom d'Hananias, à qui le Seigneur dit en vision : «Hananias!» — «Me voici, Seigneur», répondit-il.
[9:11] — «Lève-toi, lui dit le Seigneur, va dans la rue dite la rue Droite, et cherche dans la maison de Juda un nommé Saul de Tarse, car il est en prières,
[9:12] et il a vu un homme du nom d'Hananias entrer auprès de lui et lui imposer les mains pour lui rendre la vue.»
[9:13] Hananias répondit: «Seigneur, j'ai entendu dire à bien des personnes quel mal cet homme a fait à tes fidèles à Jérusalem,
[9:14] et il vient ici avec pleins pouvoirs, reçus des chefs des prêtres, d'enchainer tous ceux qui invoquent ton nom.»
[9:15] Mais le Seigneur lui dit : «Va, car cet homme est un instrument que je me suis choisi pour porter mon nom devant les païens, les rois et les enfants d'Israël.
[9:16] Je lui ferai connaître tout ce qu'il devra souffrir pour mon nom.»
[9:17] Alors Hananias alla ; il entra dans la maison et, imposant les mains à Saul, il lui dit : «Saul, mon frère, le Seigneur m'a envoyé, Jésus, qui t'est apparu sur le chemin par lequel tu es venu, pour que tu recouvres la vue et que tu sois rempli d'Esprit saint.»
[9:18] Aussitôt il tomba de ses yeux des sortes d'écailles ; il recouvra la vue,
[9:19] se leva et fut baptisé, puis il mangea, et il reprit des forces. Il passa quelques jours avec les disciples de Damas,
[9:20] et il prêcha immédiatement dans les synagogues, disant que Jésus est le Fils de Dieu.
[9:21] Tous ses auditeurs étaient confondus. «N'est-ce pas, disaient-ils, l'homme qui persécutait à Jérusalem ceux qui invoquaient ce nom et qui est venu ici pour les conduire garrottés aux chefs des prêtres ?»
[9:22] Quant à Saul, il mettait chaque jour plus de force à confondre les Juifs résidant à Damas, et à prouver que Jésus est le Christ.
[9:23] Il se passa plusieurs jours, au bout desquels les Juifs s'entendirent entre eux pour le mettre à mort.
[9:24] Saul eut connaissance de ce complot ; on gardait les portes jour et nuit pour parvenir à le tuer.
[9:25] Alors les disciples, le prenant une nuit, le descendirent par-dessus le mur dans un panier.
[9:26] Arrivé à Jérusalem, il essaya d'entrer en rapport avec les disciples ; mais tous le craignaient, ne croyant pas qu'il fût lui-même un disciple.
[9:27] Ce fut Barnabas qui le prit avec lui, le mena aux apôtres et leur raconta comment, dans le chemin, il avait vu le Seigneur, que celui-ci lui avait parlé, et enfin comment, à Damas, il avait franchement prêché au nom de Jésus.
[9:28] Dès lors il allait et venait avec eux dans Jérusalem
[9:29] et parlait avec assurance au nom du Seigneur. Il avait aussi des entretiens et des discussions avec les Hellénistes ; mais ceux-ci cherchaient à lui ôter la vie.
[9:30] Les frères, l'apprenant, le conduisirent à Césarée et le firent partir pour Tarse.
[9:31] L'Église, dans toute la Judée, toute la Galilée, toute la Samarie, était en paix, s'édifiait, marchait dans la crainte du Seigneur et, par l'assistance du saint Esprit, le nombre de ses membres augmentait.
[9:32] Il arriva que Pierre, dans une visite à tous les fidèles, se rendit aussi auprès de ceux qui habitaient Lydda.
[9:33] Il y trouva un homme nommé Enée, qui depuis huit ans n'avait pas quitté son lit ; il était paralysé.
[9:34] «Enée, lui dit Pierre, Jésus-Christ te guérit ; lève-toi et arrange ton lit toi-même», et immédiatement il se leva.
[9:35] Tous les habitants de Lydda et de la plaine de Saron le virent, et ils se convertirent au Seigneur.
[9:36] A Joppé, il y avait parmi les disciples une femme nommée Tabitha (mot qui signifie Dorcas). Elle se consacrait aux bonnes oeuvres et faisait beaucoup d'aumônes ;
[9:37] et il arriva, ces jours-là, qu'elle tomba malade et mourut. On fit sur elle les ablutions d'usage, puis on la déposa dans la chambre haute.
[9:38] Les disciples, ayant appris que Pierre était à Lydda, Lydda est dans le voisinage de Joppé, — lui envoyèrent deux hommes pour le prier de se rendre auprès d'eux sans tarder.
[9:39] Pierre se mit en route et partit avec eux. Quand il arriva, on le conduisit à la chambre haute ; là toutes les veuves l'entourèrent et lui montrèrent en pleurant des vêtements et des manteaux que faisait Dorcas quand elle était encore avec elles.
[9:40] Pierre fit sortir tout le monde, se mit à genoux et pria ; puis, se tournant vers le corps, il dit : «Tabitha, lève-toi!» Celle-ci ouvrit les yeux et, voyant Pierre, elle s'assit.
[9:41] Il lui tendit alors la main et la fit lever ; puis il appela les fidèles et les veuves et la leur rendit vivante.
[9:42] Ce fait fut connu dans toute la ville de Joppé et plusieurs personnes crurent au Seigneur.
[9:43] Quant à Pierre, il resta plusieurs jours à Joppé chez un tanneur nommé Simon.
[10:1] Il y avait à Césarée un homme nommé Cornélius, centurion d'une cohorte appelée Italica ;
[10:2] il était pieux, vivait dans la crainte de Dieu, ainsi que tous les siens, faisait beaucoup d'aumônes au peuple et priait Dieu sans cesse.
[10:3] Cet homme eut une vision ; il vit distinctement vers la neuvième heure du jour un ange de Dieu qui entrait chez lui et lui disait : «Cornélius !»
[10:4] Il le regarda tout effrayé. «Qu'y a-t-il, Seigneur?» lui répondit-il. «Tes prières et tes aumônes, lui dit l'ange, sont montées jusqu'à Dieu, et il en a été fait mention devant lui.
[10:5] Et maintenant envoie des hommes à Joppé, et fais venir ici un certain Simon, surnommé Pierre ;
[10:6] il demeure chez Simon le tanneur, dont la maison est près de la mer.»
[10:7] Quand l'ange qui lui avait parlé fut parti, Cornélius appela deux de ses domestiques et un soldat pieux de ceux qui étaient attachés à sa personne ;
[10:8] il leur raconta tout et les envoya à Joppé.
[10:9] Le lendemain, comme ils étaient en route et s'approchaient de la ville, Pierre monta sur la terrasse de la maison vers la sixième heure, pour y prier.
[10:10] Il eut faim et demanda à manger. Pendant qu'on lui préparait quelque chose, il eut une extase,
[10:11] il, vit le ciel ouvert et un objet ressemblant à une grande nappe nouée aux quatre coins en descendre et s'abaisser vers la terre ;
[10:12] à l'intérieur de la nappe il y avait des quadrupèdes de toute espèce, des reptiles de la terre et des oiseaux du ciel.
[10:13] «Lève-toi, Pierre, lui dit une voix, tue et mange.»
[10:14] Mais Pierre répondit: «Nullement, Seigneur, car jamais je n'ai rien mangé de souillé ni d'impur.»
[10:15] Alors une voix s'adressa à lui une seconde fois: «N'appelle pas souillé ce que Dieu a purifié.»
[10:16] Cela se répéta par trois fois et aussitôt après l'objet remonta au ciel.
[10:17] Pendant que Pierre méditait, incertain du sens de la vision qu'il venait d'avoir, les hommes envoyés par Cornélius et qui s'étaient informés de la maison de Simon se présentèrent à la porte d'entrée
[10:18] et appelèrent pour savoir si : «Simon, surnommé Pierre, demeurait là.»
[10:19] A ce moment même l'Esprit dit à Pierre, qui était à réfléchir sur la vision : «Voici trois hommes qui te demandent,
[10:20] lève-toi, descends, et pars avec eux sans scrupule, car c'est moi qui les ai envoyés.»
[10:21] Alors Pierre descendit : «Me voici, dit-il à ces hommes, je suis la personne que vous demandez ; quel motif vous amène?»
[10:22] Ils répondirent : «Cornélius, centurion, homme juste et craignant Dieu, auquel toute la population juive rend un bon témoignage, a reçu d'un saint ange l'ordre divin de te faire venir dans sa maison et d'écouter tes paroles.»
[10:23] Alors Pierre les fit entrer et leur donna l'hospitalité. Le lendemain, il se mit en route et partit avec eux, et quelques-uns des frères de Joppé l'accompagnèrent.
[10:24] Le jour suivant, ils arrivèrent à Césarée. Cornélius les attendait et avait réuni ses parents et ses amis intimes.
[10:25] Au moment où Pierre entra, Cornélius, qui était allé à sa rencontre, tomba à ses pieds et se prosterna.
[10:26] Mais Pierre le releva. «Lève-toi, lui dit-il, comme toi, je ne suis qu'un homme»,
[10:27] et il entra en s'entretenant avec lui. Trouvant un grand nombre de personnes réunies,
[10:28] il leur dit : «Vous savez, qu'il est défendu à un Juif de se mettre en rapport personnel avec un homme d'une autre nation ou d'entrer chez lui ; mais, pour ce qui me concerne, Dieu m'a appris à ne regarder aucun homme comme souillé ou impur.
[10:29] Voilà pourquoi, étant appelé, je suis venu ici sans objection ; je demande donc pour quel motif vous m'avez fait appeler.»
[10:30] Cornélius répondit : «il y a quatre jours, j'avais jeûné jusqu'à cette heure-ci, et, à la neuvième heure, j'étais chez moi à prier, quand tout à coup un homme portant un vêtement éblouissant se présenta à moi
[10:31] et me dit: «Cornélius, ta prière a été exaucée et il a été fait mention devant Dieu de tes aumônes.
[10:32] Envoie donc à Joppé et fais venir Simon surnommé Pierre, il demeure dans la maison de Simon le tanneur, près de la mer.»
[10:33] Immédiatement j'ai envoyé vers toi ; tu as eu la bonté de venir, et maintenant nous sommes tous en présence de Dieu, prêts à entendre tout ce que le Seigneur t'a ordonné de nous dire.»
[10:34] Pierre prit alors la parole : «En vérité, dit-il, je reconnais que Dieu ne fait point acception de personnes,
[10:35] mais que, chez tous les peuples, celui qui le craint et qui pratique la justice lui est agréable.
[10:36] Il a envoyé sa Parole aux enfants d'Israël, en leur faisant prêcher l'Évangile de paix par Jésus-Christ, le Seigneur de tous ;
[10:37] vous savez ce qui s'est passé dans toute la Judée, ce qui avait d'abord commencé en Galilée à la suite du baptême prêché par Jean ;
[10:38] vous savez comment Jésus de Nazareth, oint par Dieu d'Esprit saint et de puissance, allait de lieu en lieu en faisant le bien, en guérissant tous ceux qui étaient sous l'empire du diable, parce que Dieu était avec lui
[10:39] (nous avons été témoins de tout ce, qu'il a fait dans le pays des Juifs et à Jérusalem) ; ceux-ci l'ont mis à mort, ils l'ont pendu à une croix.
[10:40] Mais Dieu l'a ressuscité le troisième jour et a permis qu’il se montrât
[10:41] non à tout le peuple, mais aux témoins qu'il avait choisis d'avance, c'est-à-dire à nous qui avons mangé et bu avec lui après sa résurrection d'entre les morts.
[10:42] Et il nous a ordonné de prêcher au peuple et d'attester que c'est lui qui a été désigné par Dieu pour juger les vivants et les morts.
[10:43] C'est de lui que tous les prophètes rendent ce témoignage : le pardon des péchés sera accordé par son nom à quiconque croit en lui.»
[10:44] Pendant que Pierre parlait encore de ces choses, l'Esprit saint descendit sur tous ceux qui écoutaient la Parole,
[10:45] et les croyants circoncis qui avaient accompagné Pierre étaient confondus de voir que le don du saint Esprit s'étendait aussi aux païens.
[10:46] En effet, ils les entendaient parler en langues étrangères et glorifier Dieu.
[10:47] Pierre dit alors : «Peut-on interdire l'eau du baptême à ceux qui ont reçu l'Esprit saint aussi bien que nous?...»
[10:48] et il ordonna qu'ils fussent baptisés au nom de Jésus-Christ. Ceux-ci le prièrent de rester quelques jours avec eux.
[11:1] Les apôtres et les frères de Judée apprirent que les païens aussi avaient accepté la Parole de Dieu,
[11:2] et Pierre, à son retour à Jérusalem, fut blâmé par les fidèles circoncis :
[11:3] «Tu es entré chez des incirconcis, lui dirent-ils, et tu as mangé avec eux !»
[11:4] Mais Pierre leur raconta, en suivant l'ordre des faits, tout ce qui s'était passé:
[11:5] «J'étais, leur dit-il, dans la ville de Joppé, et pendant que je priais j'eus une extase et une vision m'apparut ; c'était un objet descendant du ciel, ressemblant à une grande nappe nouée aux quatre coins et qui vint jusqu'à moi.
[11:6] Ayant regardé à l'intérieur, l'ayant bien examinée, j'y vis les quadrupèdes de la terre, les animaux sauvages, les reptiles et les oiseaux du ciel,
[11:7] et j'entendis une voix qui me disait : «Lève-toi, Pierre, tue et mange» ;
[11:8] je répondis : «Nullement, Seigneur, parce que jamais rien de souillés ni d'impur n'est entré dans ma bouche».
[11:9] Une voix, venant du ciel, s'adressa à moi pour la seconde fois: «N'appelle pas souillés ce que Dieu a purifié.»
[11:10] Cela se répéta par trois fois, puis tout remonta au ciel.»
[11:11] «Et voilà qu'à ce moment même trois hommes se présentèrent à la porte de la maison où j'étais ; ils m'étaient envoyés de Césarée.
[11:12] L'Esprit me dit d'aller avec eux sans aucun scrupule. Les six frères que voici m'accompagnèrent et nous entrâmes dans la maison de Cornélius.»
[11:13] «Celui-ci nous raconta comment il avait vu dans sa maison l'ange se tenant devant lui et lui disant : «Envoie à Joppé et fais venir Simon, surnommé Pierre,
[11:14] il te dira des choses par lesquelles tu obtiendras le salut, toi et tous les tiens.»
[11:15] Lorsque je commençai à leur parler, l'Esprit saint descendit sur eux, comme sur nous à l'origine ;
[11:16] et je me souvins de ce mot du Seigneur, quand il disait : «Jean baptisait d'eau, mais vous, vous serez baptisés d'Esprit saint.»
[11:17] Si donc Dieu leur a accordé le même don qu'à nous, pour avoir cru au Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui étais-je moi pour oser m'opposer à Dieu?»
[11:18] A l'ouïe de ces paroles, ils se calmèrent, et ils rendirent gloire à Dieu : «Ainsi, disaient-ils, Dieu a aussi accordé aux païens la repentance pour qu'ils aient la vie.»
[11:19] Ceux qui avaient été dispersés par la persécution, à la suite de la mort d'Étienne, allèrent jusqu'en Phénicie et atteignirent Chypre et Antioche, n'annonçant la parole à personne qu'aux Juifs.
[11:20] Mais quelques-uns d'eux qui étaient Chypriotes et Cyrénéens, arrivés à Antioche, parlèrent aussi aux Hellénistes et leur annoncèrent l'Évangile du Seigneur Jésus.
[11:21] La main du Seigneur fut avec eux et grand fut le nombre de ceux qui crurent et se convertirent au Seigneur.
[11:22] Le bruit en parvint aux oreilles des membres de l'Église de Jérusalem et ils envoyèrent Barnabas jusqu'à Antioche.
[11:23] Lorsque, à son arrivée, il vit la grâce de Dieu, il s'en réjouit et il les exhorta tous à rester, d'un coeur convaincu, fidèles au Seigneur,
[11:24] parce qu'il était homme de bien, plein d'Esprit saint et de foi ; et un grand nombre de personnes s'unirent au Seigneur.
[11:25] Barnabas se rendit ensuite à Tarse, y chercha Saul, le trouva et l'amena à Antioche.
[11:26] Durant une année entière ils restèrent ensemble dans l'Église et instruisirent un grand nombre de personnes. Ce fut à Antioche qu'on donna pour la première fois aux disciples le nom de chrétiens.
[11:27] En ce temps-là, des prophètes se rendirent de Jérusalem à Antioche.
[11:28] L'un d'eux, nommé Agabus, se leva et annonça par l'Esprit qu'une grande famine régnerait sur toute la terre ; elle arriva, en effet, sous Claude.
[11:29] Les disciples décidèrent d'envoyer, chacun selon son pouvoir, un secours aux frères demeurant en Judée ;
[11:30] ce qu'ils firent en le remettant aux Anciens par l'entremise de Barnabas et de Saul.
[12:1] Vers la même époque, le roi Hérode e se mit à persécuter quelques-uns des membres de l'Église.
[12:2] Il fit trancher la tête à Jacques, frère de Jean.
[12:3] Voyant le bon effet qu'il produisait ainsi sur les Juifs, il ordonna aussi d'enfermer Pierre. On était à la semaine des Azymes.
[12:4] Il le fit arrêter et mettre en prison, et chargea quatre escouades, de quatre soldats chacune, de le surveiller. Son intention était de le juger après la Pâque et en présence de tout le peuple.
[12:5] Pierre était donc gardé dans la prison et l'Église adressait à Dieu de ferventes prières pour lui.
[12:6] Or, la nuit qui précéda le moment fixé par Hérode pour sa comparution, Pierre dormait entre deux soldats, retenu par une double chaîne et, devant la porte, des sentinelles gardaient la prison.
[12:7] Tout à coup apparut un ange du Seigneur ; le cachot devint resplendissant de lumière. Cet ange, touchant Pierre au côté, le réveilla et lui dit : «Lève-toi vite!»
[12:8] et les chaînes tombèrent de ses mains. «Mets ta ceinture, lui dit ensuite l'ange, et chausse tes sandales.» Pierre le fit. Il ajouta : «Enveloppe-toi de ton manteau et suis-moi.»
[12:9] Pierre sortit et le suivit sans croire à la réalité de ce que l'ange lui faisait faire ; il s'imaginait avoir une vision.
[12:10] Cependant ils passèrent la première garde, puis la seconde et arrivèrent à la porte de fer qui donne sur la ville. Cette porte s'ouvrit d'elle-même devant eux ; ils sortirent ; ils marchèrent dans une rue et, à cet instant, l'ange s'éloigna de Pierre,
[12:11] qui revint à lui et se dit : «Je vois maintenant que le Seigneur m'a réellement envoyé son ange, qu'il m'a arraché aux mains d'Hérode et à l'avide impatience du peuple juif.»
[12:12] Après réflexion, il se rendit à la maison de Marie, mère de Jean surnommé Marc, où plusieurs personnes étaient assemblées et priaient.
[12:13] Il frappa à la porte d'entrée ; une servante, nommée Rhode, alla écouter.
[12:14] Elle reconnut la voix de Pierre ; transportée de joie, au lieu d'ouvrir, elle rentra en courant et annonça que Pierre était là, devant la porte.
[12:15] On la traita de «folle». Elle affirma qu'elle disait vrai. «C'est son ange», dit-on alors.
[12:16] Pierre cependant continuait à frapper ; on ouvrit enfin ; on le vit ; la joie fut immense.
[12:17] Il leur fit de la main signe de se taire et leur raconta comment le Seigneur l'avait tiré de prison, puis il ajouta : «Annoncez ces choses à Jacques et aux autres frères.» Ensuite il sortit et s'en alla dans un autre endroit.
[12:18] Le jour venu, l'inquiétude fut grande parmi les soldats ; ils ne savaient ce que Pierre était devenu.
[12:19] Hérode le fit rechercher et, ne le trouvant pas, il mit les gardes à la question et ordonna leur exécution ; puis il quitta la Judée et alla demeurer à Césarée.
[12:20] Les gens de Tyr et de Sidon avaient des difficultés avec lui ; ils vinrent ensemble le trouver et, ayant gagné à leur cause Blastus, son chambellan, ils sollicitèrent un arrangement parce que leur pays tirait sa subsistance de celui du roi.
[12:21] Un jour fut fixé et Hérode, revêtu d'une tunique royale, siégea sur son trône et harangua le peuple avec une grande solennité.
[12:22] Le peuple s'écria : «C'est un dieu qui parle et non un homme.»
[12:23] A l'instant même un ange du Seigneur frappa Hérode parce qu'il n'avait pas donné gloire à Dieu ; et, rongé par les vers, il expira.
[12:24] Cependant la parole de Dieu se répandait de plus en plus.
[12:25] Barnabas et Saul, leur mission remplie, revinrent de Jérusalem, ramenant avec eux Jean surnommé Marc.
[13:1] Il y avait alors à Antioche, dans l'église de cette ville, comme prophètes et docteurs, Barnabas, Syméon dit Niger, Lucius de Cyrène, Menahem, frère de lait du tétrarque Hérode, et Saul.
[13:2] Un jour qu'ils célébraient le culte du Seigneur et qu'ils jeûnaient l'Esprit saint leur dit: «Mettez-moi à part Barnabas et Saul pour l'oeuvre à laquelle je les ai appelés.»
[13:3] Alors, après avoir jeûné et prié, ils leur imposèrent les mains et les laissèrent partir.
[13:4] Paul et Barnabas, ainsi envoyés par le saint Esprit, descendirent à Séleucie, où ils s'embarquèrent pour l'île de Chypre.
[13:5] Arrivés à Salamis, ils annoncèrent la parole de Dieu dans les synagogues des Juifs. Ils avaient Jean pour les aider.
[13:6] Ayant traversé toute l’île jusqu'à Paphos, ils rencontrèrent un certain personnage, un Juif, magicien et faux prophète dont le nom était Bar-Jésus.
[13:7] Il était auprès du proconsul Sergius Paulus qui, lui, était un homme sensé. Celui-ci fit appeler Barnabas et Saul et demanda à entendre la parole de Dieu.
[13:8] Mais le magicien Elymas (c'est ainsi que se traduit son nom), leur fit opposition et chercha à détourner le proconsul de la foi.
[13:9] Alors Saul, nommé aussi Paul, plein d'Esprit saint, le regarda en face et lui dit :
[13:10] «Être tout rempli d'astuce et de fraude, fils du diable, ennemi de toute justice, ne cesseras-tu pas de pervertir les droites voies du Seigneur?
[13:11] La main du Seigneur va maintenant te frapper ; tu seras aveugle ; pendant quelque temps tu ne verras pas le soleil.» Immédiatement il se trouva enveloppé d'épaisses ténèbres et, marchant çà et là, il cherchait quelqu'un pour le conduire.
[13:12] Alors le proconsul, voyant ce qui était arrivé, devint croyant ; il était très frappé de la doctrine du Seigneur.
[13:13] Embarqués à Paphos, Paul et ses compagnons arrivèrent à Perge en Pamphylie ;
[13:14] là, Jean se sépara d'eux et revint à Jérusalem. Mais eux traversèrent le pays depuis Perge et arrivèrent à Antioche de Pisidie. Ils se rendirent à la synagogue le jour du sabbat et y prirent place.
[13:15] Après la lecture de «la Loi» et des «Prophètes», les présidents envoyèrent leur dire : «Frères, si vous avez quelques paroles d'exhortation à adresser au peuple, parlez !»
[13:16] Alors Paul se leva, fit un signe de la main et dit : «Hommes d'Israël, et vous qui craignez Dieu! Écoutez :
[13:17] «Le Dieu de notre nation a élu nos pères, il a relevé le peuple pendant son séjour à l'étranger en Égypte ; il l'en a fait sortir à bras levé ;
[13:18] pendant environ quarante ans, il s'est accommodé à eux dans le désert,
[13:19] il a anéanti sept peuples dans le pays de Chanaan, et a mis leur territoire en sa possession.»
[13:20] «Ensuite, pendant quatre cent cinquante ans environ, il leur a donné des Juges jusqu'au prophète Samuel.»
[13:21] «C'est alors qu'ils ont demandé un roi et Dieu leur a donné pour quarante ans Saül, fils de Kis, de la tribu de Benjamin.
[13:22] L'ayant détrôné, il a élevé à la royauté David, dont il a fait l'éloge en disant : «J'ai trouvé David, fils de Jessé, il est selon mon coeur, et il fera toutes mes volontés.»
[13:23] «C'est de sa famille que Dieu, comme il l'avait promis, a fait sortir Jésus, un Sauveur pour Israël.
[13:24] Jean avait prêché d'avance, avant sa venue, un baptême de repentance à tout le peuple d'Israël.
[13:25] Jean disait pendant qu'il remplissait sa carrière : «Je ne suis pas, moi, celui pour lequel vous me prenez. Mais, voici, il vient après moi celui dont je ne suis pas digne de détacher les sandales.»
[13:26] «Mes frères, vous qui descendez de la famille d'Abraham, et vous qui êtes ici et qui craignez Dieu, c'est à nous qu'un message de salut a été adressé.
[13:27] Car les habitants de Jérusalem et leurs magistrats, ayant méconnu ce Jésus, ont accompli par là même, en le jugeant, les paroles des prophètes lues chaque sabbat ;
[13:28] ils ne trouvaient aucun motif de le faire mourir, et ils ont demandé à Pilate de le mettre à mort.
[13:29] Quand ils eurent accompli tout ce qui avait été écrit sur lui, ils le descendirent de la croix et le mirent dans un tombeau.»
[13:30] «Mais Dieu l'a ressuscité d'entre les morts.
[13:31] Il est apparu pendant plusieurs jours à ceux qui étaient montés avec lui de la Galilée à Jérusalem et qui sont maintenant ses témoins auprès du peuple.
[13:32] Voici donc la Bonne Nouvelle que nous vous annonçons: La promesse faite à nos pères,
[13:33] Dieu l'a tenue pour nous, leurs enfants, en ressuscitant Jésus. Voilà pourquoi il est écrit dans le Psaume second : «Tu es mon fils Et moi, je t'ai engendré aujourd'hui.»
[13:34] «Et sur sa résurrection d'entre les morts, sur ce fait qu'il ne tombera pas en corruption, voici ce qui est dit : «Je vous donnerai les grâces saintes et certaines promises à David.»
[13:35] Voilà encore pourquoi il est dit ailleurs : «Tu ne permettras point que ton Saint voie la corruption.»
[13:36] «Eh bien, David, après avoir servi à son époque aux desseins de Dieu, est mort, a été réuni à ses pères et a vu la corruption.
[13:37] C'est celui que Dieu a ressuscité qui n'a pas vit la corruption.
[13:38] Sachez donc, mes frères, que, par lui, la rémission des péchés vous est annoncée.
[13:39] Tout croyant trouve en lui la justification de tout ce dont la Loi de Moïse n'a pu vous justifier.
[13:40] Prenez donc garde qu'il ne vous arrive ce qui est dit dans les prophètes :
[13:41] «Regardez, contempteurs, soyez étonnés et disparaissez, Parce que je ferai une oeuvre, de vos jours, Une oeuvre que vous ne croiriez pas si on vous la racontait».
[13:42] Lorsqu'ils sortirent, on les pria de recommencer leur prédication le sabbat suivant.
[13:43] A l'issue de la réunion, une grande foule de Juifs et de prosélytes pieux suivirent Paul et Barnabas qui s'entretinrent avec eux et les exhortèrent à rester attachés à la grâce de Dieu.
[13:44] Le sabbat suivant presque toute la ville se réunit pour entendre la parole du Seigneur.
[13:45] Mais les Juifs, voyant cette foule, furent pleins de jalousie ; ils s'opposèrent à tout ce que disait Paul et se mirent à le contredire et à l'injurier.
[13:46] Paul et Barnabas leur dirent alors en toute franchise : «Nous devions commencer par vous prêcher la parole de Dieu, mais puisque vous la repoussez et que vous vous jugez vous-mêmes indignes de la vie éternelle, nous allons nous tourner vers les païens,
[13:47] car voici ce que le Seigneur nous a commandé : «Je t'ai établi pour être la lumière des païens, Pour répandre le salut jusqu'aux extrémités de la terre.»
[13:48] Les païens furent dans la joie de les entendre parler ainsi ; ils glorifièrent la parole du Seigneur, et tous ceux qui étaient destinés à la vie éternelle devinrent croyants.
[13:49] La parole du Seigneur se répandit dans tout le pays ;
[13:50] mais les Juifs excitèrent les dames les plus considérables de la ville rattachées au Judaïsme et les principaux habitants ; ils provoquèrent une persécution contre Paul et Barnabas, et ils les bannirent de leur territoire.
[13:51] Ceux-ci secouèrent sur eux la poussière de leurs pieds et se rendirent à Iconium ;
[13:52] quant aux disciples, ils étaient pleins de joie et d'Esprit saint.
[14:1] Il arriva qu'à Iconium, ils se rendirent ensemble à la synagogue, juive et y parlèrent de telle sorte que Juifs et Grecs devinrent croyants en grand nombre.
[14:2] Mais les Juifs restés incrédules excitèrent et indisposèrent la population païenne contre les frères.
[14:3] Ceux-ci prolongèrent alors leur séjour, pleins de courage et se confiant au Seigneur qui rendait témoignage à la prédication de sa grâce en leur donnant de faire des miracles et des prodiges.
[14:4] Cependant la population de la ville se divisa, les uns furent pour les Juifs, les autres pour les apôtres ;
[14:5] et comme les Juifs et les païens, d'accord avec les autorités, parlaient de les maltraiter et de les lapider,
[14:6] les apôtres, l'ayant appris, se réfugièrent dans les villes de Lycaonie, à Lystre, à Derbé et aux environs,
[14:7] et ils y annoncèrent l'Évangile.
[14:8] Or, il y avait à Lystre un homme paralysé des jambes, estropié de naissance ; toujours assis, il n'avait jamais marché.
[14:9] Cet homme écoutait Paul parler et lui, arrêtant sur lui son regard, vit qu'il avait la foi pour être guéri. Il lui dit alors à haute voix :
[14:10] «Lève-toi droit sur tes pieds ;» il se leva d'un saut ; il marchait!
[14:11] Le peuple, voyant ce que Paul avait fait, se mit à pousser des acclamations, et à s'écrier en langue lycaonienne : «Les dieux sous forme humaine sont descendus vers nous» !
[14:12] Barnabas fut appelé Zeus, et Paul Hermès, parce que c'était lui qui portait la parole.
[14:13] Le prêtre de Zeus, qui avait un temple à l'entrée de la ville, amena des taureaux et apporta des guirlandes devant les portes, et, d'accord avec le peuple, il allait offrir un sacrifice.
[14:14] Mais les apôtres Barnabas et Paul, apprenant cela, déchirèrent leurs vêtements, et se jetèrent au milieu de la foule en s'écriant :
[14:15] Lycaoniens «Pourquoi faites-vous cela ? Nous sommes de même nature que vous, nous ne sommes que des hommes, nous vous prêchons l'Évangile qui vous dit de renoncer à ces idoles inutiles, de vous tourner vers le Dieu vivant, créateur du ciel, de la terre, de la mer,
[14:16] et de tout ce qu'ils renferment. Il a laissé, dans les siècles passés, toutes les nations païennes suivre leurs propres voies ;
[14:17] et cependant il s'est fait connaître à vous par ses bienfaits ; c'est lui qui vous donne la pluie du ciel, les saisons avec leurs fruits, la nourriture et toutes les joies du coeur dont vous êtes comblés.»
[14:18] Malgré ces paroles, ce ne fut pas sans peine qu'ils empêchèrent le peuple de leur offrir un sacrifice.
[14:19] Cependant, survinrent d'Antioche et d'Iconium des Juifs qui gagnèrent le peuple et Paul fut lapidé, traîné hors de la ville et laissé pour mort.
[14:20] Quand les disciples vinrent l'entourer, il se releva et rentra dans la ville. Le lendemain, il partit avec Barnabas pour Derbé.
[14:21] Ils y annoncèrent l'Évangile et y firent de nombreux disciples, puis retournèrent à Lystre, à Iconium et à Antioche,
[14:22] affermissant l'esprit des disciples, les exhortant à persévérer dans la foi et leur apprenant que c'est par beaucoup de tribulations qu'on entre dans le Royaume de Dieu.
[14:23] Ils firent nommer des Anciens dans chaque Église, puis ils les recommandèrent par des jeûnes et des prières au Seigneur en qui ils avaient cru.
[14:24] Ils traversèrent ensuite la Pisidie, vinrent en Pamphylie
[14:25] et, après avoir annoncé la parole à Perge, ils descendirent à Attalie.
[14:26] De là ils firent voile pour Antioche, où ils avaient été livrés à la grâce de Dieu pour l'oeuvre qu'ils venaient d'accomplir.
[14:27] A leur arrivée, ils convoquèrent l'Église et racontèrent les choses que Dieu avait faites par eux. «Il a ouvert aux païens, dirent-ils, la porte de la foi.»
[14:28] Ils faisaient un assez long séjour auprès des disciples
[15:1] lorsqu'arrivèrent de Judée des gens qui donnaient aux frères cet enseignement : «Vous ne pouvez être sauvés, si vous ne vous faites pas circoncire selon les rites du Mosaïsme.»
[15:2] Il s'ensuivit entre Paul et Barnabas d'une part, et ces gens de l'autre, une discussion, une altercation très vive. Il fut décidé que Paul et Barnabas iraient à Jérusalem avec quelques-uns des leurs s'entendre avec les apôtres et les Anciens sur ce sujet.
[15:3] Délégués par l'Église, ils traversèrent la Phénicie et la Samarie, racontant la conversion des païens, et causant ainsi une grande joie à tous les frères.
[15:4] A leur arrivée à Jérusalem, ils furent accueillis par l'Église, les apôtres et les Anciens et leur racontèrent les choses que Dieu avait faites par eux.
[15:5] Mais quelques membres du parti des Pharisiens, devenus croyants, protestèrent et dirent qu'il fallait faire circoncire les païens et leur enjoindre d'observer la loi de Moïse.
[15:6] Les apôtres et les Anciens se réunirent pour étudier la question.
[15:7] La discussion fut longue ; Pierre enfin se leva et dit ceci : «Mes frères, vous savez que, depuis longtemps déjà, Dieu m'a choisi parmi vous pour que les païens entendissent de ma bouche la prédication de l'Évangile et devinssent croyants.
[15:8] Ce Dieu qui lit dans les coeurs leur a rendu témoignage et leur a donné l'Esprit saint comme à nous.
[15:9] Il n'a fait aucune différence entre eux et nous, il a purifié leurs coeurs par la foi.
[15:10] Pourquoi donc maintenant tentez-vous Dieu, pourquoi mettez-vous sur les épaules des disciples un joug que nos pères ni nous-mêmes n'avons pu porter?
[15:11] C'est par la grâce du Seigneur Jésus que nous croyons être sauvés et c'est exactement ce qu'ils croient aussi.»
[15:12] Alors tout le monde se tut et on écouta Barnabas et Paul faisant le récit des miracles et des prodiges que Dieu avait faits par eux auprès des païens.
[15:13] Quand ils eurent cessé de parler, Jacques s'exprima ainsi : «Mes frères, écoutez-moi :
[15:14] Siméon vous a raconté comment Dieu, une première fois, a pris soin de choisir parmi les païens un peuple qui portât son nom ;
[15:15] et cela s'accorde avec les paroles des prophètes, car il est écrit :
[15:16] «Après cela je reviendrai, et je dresserai de nouveau la tente de David qui est tombée ; «Oui, je la redresserai et je réparerai ses ruines,
[15:17] «Pour que le reste des hommes cherchent le Seigneur, «Ainsi que tous les païens sur lesquels mon nom est invoqué, Dit le Seigneur qui fait ces choses,
[15:18] et elles lui sont connues de toute éternité.»
[15:19] «Mon avis est donc de ne pas créer de difficultés aux païens qui se convertissent à Dieu,
[15:20] mais écrivons-leur de s'abstenir des souillures des idoles, de la fornications, des animaux morts par suffocation et du sang.
[15:21] Car Moïse a, de temps immémorial, ses prédicateurs dans chaque ville, et il est lu dans les synagogues tous les jours du sabbat.»
[15:22] Alors les apôtres et les Anciens, d'accord avec toute l'Église, décidèrent de choisir quelques-uns d'entre eux et de les envoyer à Antioche avec Paul et Barnabas ce furent Judas surnommé BarSabbas et Silas, tous deux fort estimés de leurs frères.
[15:23] Voici la lettre qu'ils leur remirent : Les apôtres et les frères les anciens aux frères d'Antioche de Syrie et de Cilicie, autrefois païens. salut.
[15:24] Ayant appris que certains des nôtres, sans aucun mandat de notre part, vous ont troublés par leurs paroles et vous ont bouleversé l'esprit,
[15:25] nous avons décidé à l'unanimité de vous envoyer des délégués qui accompagneront nos bien-aimés Barnabas et Paul,
[15:26] ces hommes qui ont risqué leurs vies pour le nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[15:27] Nous vous avons donc envoyé Judas et Silas qui vous diront la même chose de vive voix ;
[15:28] savoir qu'il a semblé bon à l'Esprit saint et à nous, de ne pas vous imposer d'autres charges que celles qui sont indispensables,
[15:29] c'est-à-dire vous abstenir des viandes offertes en sacrifice aux dieux, du sang, des animaux morts par suffocation et de la fornication, toutes choses dont vous ferez bien de vous garder. Adieu.
[15:30] Les délégués prirent donc congé de l'Église et se rendirent à Antioche. Ils rassemblèrent tous les frères et leur remirent la lettre.
[15:31] Sa lecture les remplit de joie et de courage.
[15:32] Judas et Silas, prophètes eux-mêmes, encouragèrent les frères dans de longs discours et les affermirent.
[15:33] Quelque temps après, ils retournèrent avec les voeux des frères auprès de ceux qui les avaient envoyés.
[15:34] Cependant Paul et Barnabas restaient à Antioche,
[15:35] prêchant l'Évangile et enseignant avec plusieurs autres la Parole du Seigneur.
[15:36] Quelque temps plus tard, Paul dit à Barnabas : «Retournons visiter les frères dans toutes les villes où nous avons annoncé la Parole du Seigneur pour voir en quel état ils se trouvent.»
[15:37] Barnabas proposa d'emmener aussi Jean, surnommé Marc.
[15:38] Mais Paul n'était pas d'avis d'emmener celui qui les avait quittés en Pamphylie et ne les avait pas accompagnés dans leur oeuvre.
[15:39] Ce dissentiment fut si grave qu'il se séparèrent, et Barnabas, emmenant Marc, s'embarqua pour l'île de Chypre.
[15:40] Quant à Paul, il choisit Silas et partit, recommandé par les frères à la grâce du Seigneur ;
[15:41] il parcourut la Syrie et la Cilicie, en fortifiant les Églises.
[16:1] Il arriva aussi à Derbé et à Lystres et y trouva un disciple appelé Timothée, fils d'une Juive devenue croyante, mais dont le père était Grec.
[16:2] Les frères de Lystres et d'Iconium avaient bonne opinion de lui.
[16:3] Paul voulut l'emmener avec lui ; il le prit donc et le circoncit, à cause des Juifs de l'endroit ; car tout le monde savait que son père était Grec.
[16:4] Dans toutes les villes où ils passaient, ils faisaient connaître et recommandaient d'observer les décisions prises par les apôtres et les Anciens de Jérusalem.
[16:5] C'est ainsi que la foi des Églises s'affermissait et que leur nombre augmentait tous les jours.
[16:6] Ils traversèrent la Phrygie et le pays des Galates (le saint Esprit les avait empêchés de prêcher la Parole en Asie)..
[16:7] Arrivés du côté de la Mysie, ils se proposaient d'entrer en Bithynie, mais l'Esprit de Jésus ne le leur permit pas.
[16:8] Ils traversèrent alors rapidement la Mysie et descendirent à Troas ;
[16:9] Paul y eut une vision pendant la nuit ; un Macédonien se présentait à lui et lui disait en le suppliant : «Passe en Macédoine et viens à notre aide.»
[16:10] Immédiatement après que cette vision lui eut apparu, nous cherchâmes à partir pour la Macédoine ; nous comprenions que Dieu nous appelait à y prêcher l'Évangile.
[16:11] Embarqués à Troas, nous marchâmes, vent arrière, sur l'île de Samothrace ; le lendemain sur Néapolis
[16:12] et, de là, nous nous rendîmes à Philippes, la première ville de la province de Macédoine et une colonie. Nous restâmes quelques jours dans cette ville.
[16:13] Le jour du sabbat nous sortîmes des portes et nous nous rendîmes au bord de la rivière, où nous supposions qu'on se réunissait pour la Prière. Nous prîmes notre place, et nous nous entretînmes avec les femmes qui y étaient rassemblées.
[16:14] Il y en avait une appelée Lydie, marchande d'étoffes de pourpre de Thyatire, une prosélyte, qui nous écouta. Le Seigneur lui toucha le coeur, de sorte qu'elle fit attention à ce que disait Paul.
[16:15] Quand elle eut été baptisée avec sa famille, elle nous invita en disant : «Si vous me croyez fidèle au Seigneur, entrez dans ma maison ; demeurez-y ;» et elle nous en pria instamment.
[16:16] Il arriva, comme nous allions à la Prière, qu'une esclave, possédée d'un Esprit devin, se présenta à nous. Elle faisait gagner beaucoup d'argent à ses maîtres en annonçant l'avenir.
[16:17] Elle se mit à nous suivre, Paul et nous. «Ces hommes-là, criait-elle, sont des serviteurs du Dieu suprême, ils vous annoncent le chemin du salut.»
[16:18] Elle fit cela plusieurs jours ; enfin Paul, impatienté, se retourna et dit à l'Esprit : «Je t'ordonne, au nom de Jésus-Christ, de sortir de cette femme.» A l'instant même, il sortit.
[16:19] Cependant les maîtres de cette esclave, se voyant enlever le gain sur lequel ils comptaient, se saisirent de Paul et de Silas, les traînèrent sur la place publique devant les magistrats
[16:20] et les amenèrent aux préteurs. «Ces hommes-là, dirent-ils, troublent notre ville ; ce sont des Juifs,
[16:21] et ils prêchent des coutumes qu'il ne nous est permis ni d'accepter ni de suivre, puisque nous sommes Romains!»
[16:22] La populace se souleva aussi contre eux, et les préteurs leur firent arracher leurs vêtements et les condamnèrent à recevoir la bastonnade.
[16:23] On les frappa cruellement, puis on les jeta en prison, et il fut recommandé au geôlier de les garder en lieu sûr.
[16:24] Celui-ci, pour obéir à cet ordre, les mit dans le cachot le plus reculé et engagea leurs pieds dans les ceps.
[16:25] Vers le milieu de la nuit, Paul et Silas priaient, chantaient les louanges de Dieu, et les prisonniers les écoutaient,
[16:26] quand tout à coup se produisit un tremblement de terre si violent que la prison fut ébranlée jusque dans ses fondements ; toutes les portes s'ouvrirent instantanément, et les liens de tous les prisonniers se relâchèrent.
[16:27] Le geôlier, réveillé en sursaut et voyant ouvertes les portes de la prison, tira son épée et voulut se donner la mort, croyant que les prisonniers s'étaient échappés.
[16:28] Mais Paul lui parla: «Ne te fais point de mal, lui cria-t-il, nous sommes tous ici.»
[16:29] Alors le geôlier demanda de la lumière, entra précipitamment dans le cachot et se jeta tout tremblant aux pieds de Paul et de Silas ;
[16:30] puis il les fit sortir et leur dit : «Seigneurs, que faut-il que je fasse pour être sauvé?»
[16:31] Ils lui répondirent : «Crois au Seigneur Jésus et tu seras sauvé, toi et ta maison.»
[16:32] Et ils lui annoncèrent la Parole de Dieu, à lui et à tous ceux de sa famille.
[16:33] Le geôlier les prenant avec lui à l'heure même, pendant la nuit, lava leurs plaies et se fit immédiatement baptiser, lui et tous les siens.
[16:34] Puis il les conduisit dans son logement et leur donna à manger ; il était transporté de joie, et tous les siens l'étaient avec lui, d'avoir cru en Dieu.
[16:35] Le jour venu, les préteurs envoyèrent les licteurs dire au geôlier : «Relâche ces hommes!»
[16:36] Le geôlier rapporta ces paroles à Paul : Les préteurs me font dire de vous relâcher ; partez donc et allez en paix.»
[16:37] Mais Paul répondit aux licteurs : «Ils nous ont fait frapper en public et sans jugement, nous, des citoyens romains, puis ils nous ont jetés en prison, et maintenant ils nous font sortir en cachette! Non, non, il faut qu'ils viennent eux-mêmes et nous raccompagnent!»
[16:38] Les licteurs répétèrent ces paroles aux préteurs. Ceux-ci, apprenant qu'ils étaient romains, prirent peur ;
[16:39] ils vinrent les apaiser, les raccompagnèrent et les prièrent de quitter la ville.
[16:40] Quant à eux, à leur sortie de prison, ils se rendirent chez Lydie, ils y virent les frères, leur adressèrent quelques exhortations et partirent.
[17:1] Ils traversèrent Amphipolis et Apollonie et arrivèrent à Thessalonique, où les Juifs avaient une synagogue.
[17:2] Selon sa coutume, Paul s'y rendit et, durant trois sabbats, il discuta avec eux, expliquant et démontrant, d'après les Écritures,
[17:3] que le Christ devait souffrir et ressusciter d'entre les morts, «et ce Christ, disait-il, c'est le Jésus que je vous annonce.»
[17:4] Paul et Silas gagnèrent quelques Juifs qui se rallièrent à eux, un grand nombre de Grecs «craignant Dieu» et beaucoup de femmes de la meilleure société.
[17:5] Mais les Juifs, pleins de jalousie, recrutèrent une bande de vagabonds, de ces vauriens toujours prêts à faire du bruit, et mirent le trouble dans la ville. Ils assaillirent la maison de Jasons et y cherchèrent Paul et Silas pour les mener à l'assemblée populaire.
[17:6] Ne les trouvant pas, ils traînèrent Jason et quelques frères devant les politarques, en criant : «Ceux qui ont bouleversé le monde entier sont dans la ville,
[17:7] Jason les a reçus: tous ces gens-là sont en révolte contre les édits de l'Empereur ; ils ont un autre roi qu'ils appellent Jésus.»
[17:8] La foule et les politarques qui entendaient ces paroles en furent fort émus,
[17:9] et ils ne laissèrent aller Jason et les autres qu'après avoir exigé d'eux une caution.
[17:10] Sans tarder, la nuit suivante, les frères firent partir Paul et Silas pour Bérée ; en y arrivant, ils se rendirent à la synagogue des Juifs.
[17:11] Ceux-ci étaient mieux élevés que ceux de Thessalonique ; ils accueillirent très volontiers la prédication de la Parole, et tous les jours ils étudiaient les Écritures pour y vérifier ce qu'on leur disait.
[17:12] Beaucoup devinrent croyants, ainsi que des femmes grecques du meilleur monde et un grand nombre d'hommes.
[17:13] Mais quand les Juifs de Thessalonique apprirent que Paul avait annoncé la Parole de Dieu à Bérée, ils y vinrent pour mettre le trouble dans le peuple.
[17:14] Alors les frères firent immédiatement partir Paul dans la direction de la mer: Silas et Timothée restèrent à Bérée.
[17:15] Ceux qui accompagnèrent Paul le menèrent jusqu'à Athènes, et ils s'en retournèrent, chargés par lui de mander à Silas et à Timothée de venir le rejoindre le plus tôt possible.
[17:16] Paul, qui les attendait à Athènes, se sentait indigné jusqu'au fond de l'âme de voir la ville remplie d'idoles.
[17:17] Cependant il s'entretenait dans la synagogue avec les Juifs et les prosélytes, et sur la place publique, tous les jours, avec les premiers venus.
[17:18] Entre autres, il fut entrepris par quelques philosophes épicuriens et stoïciens. «Que veut donc dire ce radoteur?» disaient les uns. «C'est, paraît-il, un prêcheur de nouveaux dieux», disaient les autres, parce que Paul leur annonçait l'Évangile de Jésus et la résurrection.
[17:19] Ils le prirent avec eux et le conduisirent à l'Aréopage, en lui disant : «Pouvons-nous savoir quelle est cette nouvelle doctrine que tu enseignes?
[17:20] car tu nous racontes là des choses étranges ; nous désirons bien savoir ce que tout cela signifie.»
[17:21] (Tous les Athéniens et les étrangers domiciliés dans la ville ne s'occupaient qu'à dire ou à apprendre des nouvelles).
[17:22] Alors Paul, debout au milieu de l'Aréopage, s'exprima ainsi : «Athéniens, «En tout, je vous trouve le plus religieux des peuples.
[17:23] Comme, en effet, je regardais, en passant, vos objets sacrés, j'ai trouvé un autel sur lequel était écrit : A UN DIEU INCONNU. Ce que vous honorez sans le connaître, moi, je viens vous le révéler.»
[17:24] «Le Dieu qui a fait le monde et tout ce qu'il renferme, étant maître du ciel et de la terre, n'habite point dans des temples faits de main d'homme,
[17:25] et il ne saurait être servi par des mains humaines comme s'il avait besoin de rien, lui qui donne à tous la vie, le souffle et toutes choses.
[17:26] C'est lui qui a fait naître d'un seul homme toutes les nations, et les a fait habiter sur la surface de la terre, fixant à chacune la durée de son existence et les limites de son domaine.
[17:27] C'est lui qui leur a donné de le chercher pour voir si elles parviendraient à le trouver et à le toucher quoiqu'il ne soit pas loin de chacun de nous.
[17:28] Car c'est en lui que nous vivons, que nous nous mouvons, que nous existons, comme l'ont dit quelques-uns de vos poètes : «De sa race nous sommes!»
[17:29] «Étant de la race de Dieu nous ne devons pas croire que la Divinité ressemble à l'or, à l'argent, à la pierre sculptés par l'art et le génie de l'homme.
[17:30] Oubliant donc des siècles d'ignorance, Dieu maintenant invite partout tous les hommes à se repentir,
[17:31] car il a fixé un jour où il doit juger le monde avec justice, par un homme qu'il a désigné pour cela, et qu'il a accrédité auprès de tous en le ressuscitant d'entre les morts.»
[17:32] Quand ils entendirent parler de «résurrection des morts», les uns se mirent à plaisanter, les autres dirent : «Nous t'écouterons là-dessus une autre fois.»
[17:33] C'est ainsi que Paul sortit de leur assemblée.
[17:34] Quelques hommes cependant se joignirent à lui et devinrent croyants, entre autres Denys, membre de l'Aréopage ; il y eut aussi une femme du nom de Damaris et d'autres avec eux.
[18:1] Après cela, Paul partit d'Athènes et vint à Corinthe.
[18:2] Il y trouva un Juif nommé Aquilas, originaire du Pont, et récemment arrivé d'Italie avec sa femme Priscille, chassé de Rome comme tous les Juifs par un édit de Claude. Il se réunit à eux
[18:3] et comme ils étaient du même métier que lui, il demeura chez eux pour y travailler. Ils étaient, de leur état, fabricants de tentes.
[18:4] Chaque sabbat il parlait à la synagogue, et il gagnait des Juifs et des Grecs.
[18:5] Quand Silas et Timothée arrivèrent de Macédoine, Paul se consacrait uniquement à la prédication, affirmant aux Juifs que Jésus était le Christ.
[18:6] Mais ceux-ci s'opposaient à lui et l'insultaient ; alors, secouant sur eux la poussière de ses vêtements, il leur dit : «Que votre sang retombe sur votre tête! J'en suis innocent et désormais je m'adresserai aux païens.»
[18:7] Il sortit de la salle et se rendit chez un certain Titius Justus, homme «craignant Dieu», dont la maison était contiguë à la synagogue.
[18:8] Crispus, le chef de la synagogue, crut au Seigneur avec toute sa maison, et plusieurs des Corinthiens qui entendaient Paul devenaient croyants et se faisaient baptiser.
[18:9] Une nuit, le Seigneur dit à Paul dans une vision : «Sois sans crainte, parle au contraire, ne cesse de parler, car je suis avec toi ;
[18:10] personne ne mettra la main sur toi pour te faire du mal, parce que j'ai un grand peuple dans cette ville.»
[18:11] Paul alors s'établit à Corinthe pendant un an et demi, et il y prêcha la parole de Dieu.
[18:12] Pendant le proconsulat de Gallion en Achaïe, les Juifs, tous d'accord, se soulevèrent contre Paul et l'amenèrent devant le tribunal :
[18:13] «Cet homme, dirent-ils, excite les gens à rendre à Dieu un culte contraire à la Loi.»
[18:14] Paul ouvrait la bouche pour répondre, quand Gallion, s'adressant aux Juifs: «S'il s'agissait de quelque crime ou de quelque méfait, leur dit-il, j'accueillerais vos plaintes comme il convient, ô Juifs!
[18:15] mais s'il s'agit de vos discussions sur une doctrine, sur des noms propres, sur votre Loi particulière, regardez-y vous-mêmes ; je ne veux pas juger ces questions-là.»
[18:16] Et il les renvoya du tribunal.
[18:17] Tout le monde alors tomba sur Sosthènes, le chef de la synagogue, et l'on se mit à le battre devant le tribunal. Gallion ne s'en soucia nullement.
[18:18] Paul resta encore longtemps à Corinthe ; puis il prit congé des frères et s'embarqua pour la Syrie avec Priscille et Aquilas, après s'être fait raser la tête à Kenchrées ; car il avait fait un voeu.
[18:19] On débarqua à Éphèse ; Paul y laissa ses compagnons et se rendit à la synagogue, où il s'entretint avec les Juifs.
[18:20] Mais quand ils lui demandèrent de prolonger son séjour, il n'y consentit pas
[18:21] et leur dit en prenant congé d'eux : «Je reviendrai une autre fois chez vous, s'il plaît à Dieu.» Il partit d'Éphèse,
[18:22] débarqua à Césarée et, après être monté à Jérusalem pour saluer l'Église, il descendit à Antioche.
[18:23] Il en repartit après un court séjour et traversa successivement le pays des Galates et la Phrygie pour fortifier tous les disciples.
[18:24] Cependant un certain Juif, du nom d'Apollos, né à Alexandrie, un homme éloquent, arriva à Éphèse ;
[18:25] il connaissait à fond les Écritures. On l'avait instruit dans la doctrine du Seigneur ; c'était une âme ardente qui prêchait et enseignait avec soin ce qui concerne Jésus, bien qu'il ne connût que le baptême de Jean.
[18:26] Quand il commença à parler librement dans la synagogue, Priscilla et Aquilas qui l'entendirent l'emmenèrent avec eux et lui exposèrent plus exactement la doctrine de Dieu.
[18:27] Lorsqu'il se proposa de passer en Achaïe, les frères l'y encouragèrent et écrivirent aux disciples de lui faire bon accueil. Une fois arrivé, il se rendit, par la grâce de Dieu, très utile aux croyants ;
[18:28] car il réfutait vigoureusement les Juifs en public, leur démontrant par les Écritures que Jésus est le Christ.
[19:1] Pendant qu'Apollos était à Corinthe, Paul, qui venait de parcourir les parties les plus élevées du pays, descendit à Éphèse et y trouva quelques disciples. Il leur demanda : «Avez-vous reçu l'Esprit saint, quand vous êtes devenus croyants?»
[19:2] — «Nous n'avons pas entendu parler d'un Esprit saint,» lui répondirent-ils.
[19:3] Il reprit alors : «Quel baptême avez-vous donc reçu?» — «Le baptême de Jean,» répliquèrent-ils.
[19:4] Mais Paul : «Jean a baptisé ; c'était un baptême de repentance, et il disait au peuple de croire en celui qui devait venir après lui, c'est-à-dire en Jésus.»
[19:5] Apprenant cela, ils furent baptisés au nom du Seigneur Jésus ;
[19:6] Paul leur imposa les mains, et l'Esprit saint descendit sur eux ; ils se mirent à parler en langues étrangères et à prophétiser.
[19:7] Ils étaient douze en tout environ.
[19:8] Paul se rendit à la synagogue, et il y prêcha en toute franchise sur le Royaume de Dieu. Pendant trois mois il s'efforça, par ses discours, de convaincre les Juifs.
[19:9] Mais quelques-uns restèrent endurcis, incrédules, et se mirent à décrier l'enseignement de Paul devant la foule ; alors il se sépara d'eux, et tous les jours il réunit à part ses disciples dans un endroit qu'on appelait : «École de Tyrannus».
[19:10] Cela dura deux ans, de sorte que tous les habitants de l'Asie, Juifs et Grecs, entendirent la parole du Seigneur.
[19:11] Dieu faisait par les mains de Paul des miracles extraordinaires ;
[19:12] au point qu'on mettait sur les malades le linge ou les vêtements qu'il avait portés, et ils étaient guéris de leurs maladies et délivrés des mauvais Esprits.
[19:13] Alors quelques exorcistes juifs ambulants essayèrent d'invoquer le nom du Seigneur Jésus sur ceux qui étaient au pouvoir des mauvais Esprits. Ils disaient : «Je vous adjure par ce Jésus que prêche Paul.»
[19:14] (C'étaient les sept fils d'un archiprêtre juif, Skevas, qui faisaient cela.)
[19:15] Mais le mauvais Esprit leur répondit : «Je connais Jésus, et je sais qui est Paul ; et vous, qui êtes-vous?»
[19:16] Et puis, sautant sur eux, l'homme qui était possédé du mauvais Esprit en terrassa deux et eut si bien le dessus qu'ils durent s'enfuir de la maison sans vêtements et tout blessés.
[19:17] Le fait fut connu de tous les Juifs et de tous les Grecs qui habitaient Éphèse, et tous furent frappés de stupeur ; on magnifiait le nom du Seigneur Jésus.
[19:18] Plusieurs de ceux qui étaient devenus croyants venaient confesser et reconnaître leurs pratiques.
[19:19] Ceux qui s'étaient livrés à la magie vinrent en foule, apportèrent leurs livres et les brûlèrent publiquement. On en estima la valeur ; elle se trouva être de cinquante mille pièces d'argent.
[19:20] C'était ainsi que la parole du Seigneur gagnait en force et en autorité.
[19:21] Après ces événements, Paul forma le projet de se rendre à Jérusalem en traversant la Macédoine et l'Achaïe. — «Quand j'aurai fait cela, disait-il, il faudra aussi que je voie Rome.»
[19:22] Puis il envoya en Macédoine deux de ses aides, Timothée et Éraste, mais lui-même resta encore quelque temps en Asie.
[19:23] Ce fut vers cette époque que la diffusion de l'Évangile fut l'occasion de troubles assez sérieux.
[19:24] Un orfèvre, du nom de Démétrius, fabriquait des réductions en argent du Temple d'Artémis. Ses ouvriers trouvaient à ce travail un profit considérable.
[19:25] Il les réunit un jour, avec tous les ouvriers du même état, et leur dit : «Éphésiens, «Vous savez que cette industrie fait notre fortune,
[19:26] et vous voyez et entendez dire que non seulement à Éphèse, mais dans presque toute l'Asie, ce Paul a gagné et entraîné une foule de gens, en disant que les dieux faits de main d'homme ne sont pas de vrais dieux.
[19:27] Ce ne sont pas seulement nos intérêts qui vont être en souffrance, c'est le Temple même de notre grande déesse Artémis qui ne compte plus pour rien, et bientôt il ne sera plus question de la majesté de celle que toute l'Asie, que le monde entier adore.
[19:28] Ces paroles les rendirent furieux et ils se mirent à crier: «Vive la grande Artémis d'Éphèse!»
[19:29] L'agitation gagna la ville entière. Toute la foule se porta au théâtre en y entraînant Caïus et Aristarque, les Macédoniens qui accompagnaient Paul.
[19:30] Lui-même voulait se montrer au peuple, mais les disciples le retinrent.
[19:31] Il y eut même des Asiarques de ses amis qui le firent prier de ne pas se présenter au théâtre.
[19:32] Chacun criait de son côté ; aussi l'assemblée était-elle très confuse et le plus grand nombre ne savait pas même pourquoi on s'était réuni.
[19:33] Enfin, on fit sortir de la foule un certain Alexandre que les Juifs voulaient mettre en avant. Cet Alexandre, ayant fait signe de la main, se préparait à prendre devant le peuple la défense des siens.
[19:34] Mais la foule s'aperçut qu'il était juif, et alors elle se mit à crier d'une seule voix pendant près de deux heures : «Vive la grande Artémis d'Éphèse !»
[19:35] Le chancelier de la ville parvint enfin à l'apaiser, et prononça ces paroles : Habitants d'Éphèse, «Quel homme au monde ignore que votre ville d'Éphèse ne soit la gardienne du Temple de la grande Artémis et de sa statue tombée du ciel?
[19:36] Cela est incontestable ; il faut donc que vous restiez calmes et ne fassiez rien avec précipitation.
[19:37] Vous avez amené là ces hommes, mais ils ne sont coupables ni de sacrilège ni de blasphème envers votre déesse.
[19:38] Si Démétrius et ses ouvriers ont à se plaindre de quelqu'un, il y a des tribunaux, il y a des proconsuls, qu'on se fasse assigner!
[19:39] S'il s'agit d'autres choses, on peut les examiner dans une assemblée légalement convoquée.
[19:40] Autrement nous risquons d'être accusés de sédition pour ce qui s'est passé aujourd'hui, car nous n'avons aucune bonne raison à donner pour expliquer notre rassemblement.»
[19:41] Là-dessus, il congédia l'assemblée.
[20:1] Quand la tranquillité fut rétablie, Paul convoqua les disciples, leur fit ses adieux et partit pour la Macédoine.
[20:2] Il parcourut cette province et, après avoir longuement exhorté les fidèles, il passa en Grèce et s'y arrêta trois mois.
[20:3] Les Juifs lui tendirent un guet-apens au moment où il allait s'embarquer pour la Syrie ; il se décida alors à retourner par la Macédoine,
[20:4] et il fut accompagné jusqu'en Asie par Sopater, fils de Pyrrhus de Bérée, par les Thessaloniciens Aristarque et Secundus, par Caïus de Derbé et Timothée et par les Asiates Tychique et Trophime.
[20:5] Ces frères prirent les devants et nous attendirent à Troas.
[20:6] Nous-mêmes nous partîmes de Philippes après les fêtes de Pâques et, après une traversée de cinq jours, nous les rejoignîmes à Troas, où nous passâmes sept jours.
[20:7] Le premier jour de la semaine, comme nous étions réunis pour rompre ensemble le pain, Paul, qui voulait partir le lendemain, s'entretint avec l'assemblée et prolongea son discours jusqu'à près de minuit.
[20:8] Il y avait plusieurs lampes dans la chambre haute où nous étions réunis.
[20:9] Un jeune homme, nommé Eutychus, assis sur le bord de la fenêtre, s'endormit profondément pendant le long discours de Paul, et, emporté par le sommeil, il se laissa tomber du haut du troisième étage en bas. Quand on le releva, il était mort.
[20:10] Mais Paul descendit, se pencha sur lui, le prit dans ses bras : «N'ayez aucune inquiétude, dit-il, son âme est encore en lui.»
[20:11] Ensuite il remonta, il rompit le pain et il mangea, puis il reprit longuement la parole jusqu'au point du jour, où il partit.
[20:12] Quant au jeune garçon, on le ramena plein de vie ; ce fut pour tous une immense joie.
[20:13] Quant à nous, nous avions pris les devants ; nous nous étions embarqués pour Assos, où nous devions reprendre Paul ; c'est lui qui l'avait ainsi décidé ; il préférait faire la route à pied.
[20:14] Quand il nous eut rejoints à Assos, nous le prîmes à notre bord, et nous nous rendîmes à Mitylène.
[20:15] Partis de là, toujours par mer, nous passions le lendemain en vue de Chios, le surlendemain nous touchions à Samos, et enfin, le jour suivant, nous abordions à Milet.
[20:16] Car Paul avait résolu de dépasser Éphèse sans s'y arrêter, afin de ne pas perdre de temps en Asie. Il se hâtait pour être à Jérusalem, si possible, le jour de la Pentecôte.
[20:17] Cependant, de Milet il envoya à Éphèse et fit appeler les Anciens de l'Église ;
[20:18] quand ils furent réunis auprès de lui, il leur dit : Vous savez, depuis le premier jour de mon arrivée en Asie, ce que j'ai sans cesse été pour vous ;
[20:19] vous m'avez vu servir le Seigneur avec une grande humilité, dans les larmes, et au milieu des épreuves qui me venaient des Juifs et de leurs embûches ;
[20:20] vous savez que je ne vous ai rien caché de ce qui pouvait vous être utile, que je vous ai prêché, que je vous ai instruits en public et en particulier,
[20:21] conjurant Juifs et Grecs de se convertir à Dieu et de croire en notre Seigneur Jésus.»
[20:22] «Et maintenant voilà que, lié par l'Esprit, je vais à Jérusalem ; je ne sais ce qui m'y arrivera ;
[20:23] je sais seulement que, de ville en ville, l'Esprit saint m'avertit et me déclare que des chaînes et des tribulations m'y attendent.
[20:24] Mais peu m'importe ; je fais volontiers le sacrifice de ma vie, pourvu que j'achève ma course, que je termine le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus : rendre témoignage à l'Évangile de la grâce de Dieu.»
[20:25] «O vous tous, au milieu de qui j'ai vécu, annonçant le Royaume, je sais que vous ne verrez plus mon visage.
[20:26] Je proteste donc aujourd'hui que je suis innocent de la perte de ceux qui périront.
[20:27] Car je n'ai rien négligé pour vous faire connaître tout le conseil de Dieu.»
[20:28] «Veillez sur vous-mêmes et sur tout le troupeau, au sein duquel l'Esprit saint vous a placés comme Surveillants ; paissez l'Église de Dieu qu’il a acquise par son sang.
[20:29] Je sais qu'après mon départ des loups rapaces se glisseront parmi vous et n'épargneront pas le troupeau.
[20:30] Du milieu de vous se lèveront des hommes prononçant des discours pervers pour entraîner les disciples à leur suite.
[20:31] Veillez donc, vous souvenant que pendant trois années, nuit et jour, je n'ai cessé d'exhorter chacun avec larmes.»
[20:32] «Et maintenant je vous recommande à Dieu et à la parole de sa grâce, à lui qui peut vous édifier et vous assurer un héritage parmi tous ceux qui lui sont consacrés.»
[20:33] «Je n'ai désiré ni l'argent, ni l'or, ni le vêtement de personne.
[20:34] Vous savez que ces mains ont pourvu à mes besoins et à ceux de mes compagnons.
[20:35] Je vous ai toujours montré comment il faut, par le travail, avoir encore de quoi secourir les indigents, et se souvenir des paroles du Seigneur Jésus quand il a dit : «Il y a plus de bonheur à donner qu'à recevoir.»
[20:36] Il parla ainsi, puis il se mit à genoux, et il pria avec eux tous.
[20:37] On n'entendait qu'un long sanglot.
[20:38] Ils se jetaient à son cou et l'embrassaient. C'était la parole de Paul : «Vous ne verrez plus mon visage», qui les avait le plus affligés. Ils le conduisirent au bateau.
[21:1] Nous étant enfin séparés, nous reprîmes la mer et marchant, vent arrière, nous arrivions bientôt à Cos ; le lendemain nous étions à Rhodes, le troisième jour à Patare.
[21:2] Là nous trouvions un navire qui faisait voile pour la Phénicie et qui nous prit à son bord.
[21:3] Bientôt l'île de Chypre était en vue, mais, la laissant sur notre gauche, nous marchions sur la Syrie et nous arrivions à Tyr. C'était là que le navire devait laisser son chargement.
[21:4] Nous allâmes voir les disciples et restâmes sept jours avec eux. Dirigés par l'Esprit, ils disaient à Paul de ne pas monter à Jérusalem ;
[21:5] mais, notre séjour achevé, nous nous mîmes en route pour le départ. Tous, avec leurs femmes et leurs enfants, nous conduisirent hors de la ville ; et là, agenouillés sur le sable du rivage, nous priâmes ensemble
[21:6] et nous nous dîmes adieu. Nous montâmes ensuite à bord et les frères retournèrent chez eux.
[21:7] Notre traversée se termina par le trajet de Tyr à Ptolémaïde ; nous allâmes y saluer les frères et restâmes un jour avec eux ;
[21:8] le lendemain nous partions pour Césarée. A notre arrivée, nous nous rendîmes chez l'évangéliste Philippe, qui était l'un des sept diacres. C'est chez lui que nous demeurâmes.
[21:9] Il avait quatre filles non mariées, qui étaient prophétesses.
[21:10] Nous y étions depuis plusieurs jours lorsque arriva de Judée un prophète du nom d'Agabus.
[21:11] Il vint à nous, prit la ceinture de Paul et, s'attachant les pieds et les mains, il dit : «Voici ce que déclare l'Esprit saint : L'homme à qui appartient cette ceinture sera ainsi lié à Jérusalem par les Juifs et livré par eux aux mains des païens.»
[21:12] A ces paroles les gens de l'endroit et nous, suppliâmes Paul de ne pas monter à Jérusalem.
[21:13] Mais il nous répondit : «Que faites-vous là à pleurer et à me fendre le coeur? Je suis prêt, quant à moi, non seulement à me laisser enchaîner, mais à mourir à Jérusalem pour le nom du Seigneur Jésus.»
[21:14] Comme nous ne pouvions le persuader, nous n'insistâmes pas davantage et nous dîmes : «Que la volonté du Seigneur se fasse!»
[21:15] Ces quelques jours passés, nous fîmes nos préparatifs de départ, et nous montâmes à Jérusalem.
[21:16] Quelques-uns des disciples de Césarée nous y accompagnèrent et nous conduisirent chez un ancien disciple, un Chypriote, nommé Mnason, qui devait nous donner l'hospitalité.
[21:17] Les frères, à notre arrivée à Jérusalem, nous firent un fort bon accueil.
[21:18] Le lendemain, Paul se rendit avec nous chez Jacques ; tous les Anciens s'y étaient rassemblés.
[21:19] On se donna le salut de paix, et Paul raconta en détail ce que Dieu avait fait dans le monde païen par son ministère.
[21:20] Les Anciens, l'entendant, rendaient gloire à Dieu. Cependant ils lui dirent : «Tu vois, frère, que les Juifs devenus croyants se comptent par milliers, et tous sont d'ardents zélateurs de la Loi.
[21:21] Or, on leur a raconté que tu prêches l'apostasie de la Loi de Moïse à tous les Juifs disséminés parmi les païens, les détournant de circoncire leurs enfants et de marcher selon les rites d'Israël.
[21:22] Qu'y a-t-il donc à faire? Il est de toute évidence qu'une foule énorme se rassemblera, car on apprendra ton arrivée.
[21:23] Fais ce que nous allons te dire : Nous avons ici quatre hommes qui ont contracté un voeu.
[21:24] Prends-les, purifie-toi avec eux, supporte les frais pour qu'ils puissent se faire raser la tête ; chacun saura alors que ce qu'on a raconté de toi n'est rien et que toi aussi tu pratiques la Loi et l'observes.»
[21:25] «Quant aux païens devenus croyants, nous avons décidé (et nous le leur avons fait dire) qu'ils devaient s'abstenir des viandes offertes en sacrifice aux dieux, du sang, des animaux morts par suffocation, et de la fornication.»
[21:26] Paul alors se mit en la compagnie de ces hommes et dès le lendemain il se purifia avec eux, puis il entra dans le Temple pour indiquer d'avance le jour où les rites de purification seraient achevés et où chacun d'eux ferait offrir le sacrifice.
[21:27] Les sept jours allaient expirer, quand les Juifs d'Asie l'aperçurent dans le Temple, ameutèrent toute la foule et mirent la main sur lui :
[21:28] «Au secours! enfants d'Israël! crièrent-ils, le voilà, l'homme qui déclame partout, devant tout le monde, contre le peuple, contre la Loi, contre ce saint Lieu! Il vient de plus d'introduire des païens dans le Temple ; c'est un profanateur du sanctuaire!»
[21:29] — On avait vu, en effet, Trophime d'Éphèse dans la ville avec lui, et on croyait que Paul l'avait introduit dans le Temple. —
[21:30] Toute la ville fut bientôt en émoi ; le peuple accourut de tous, côtés, on s'empara de Paul, on l'entraîna hors du Temple, dont les portes furent immédiatement fermées,
[21:31] et on se mettait en devoir de le tuer, lorsque le tribun de la cohorte fut informé que Jérusalem tout entière était en émeute.
[21:32] Il prit immédiatement quelques soldats et centurions et descendit en courant vers les Juifs, qui, voyant le tribun et les soldats, cessèrent de frapper Paul.
[21:33] Le tribun s'approcha, le fit saisir, donna ordre de le lier de deux chaînes et demanda qui il était et ce qu'il faisait.
[21:34] Mais les bruits les plus divers se croisaient dans la foule et le tumulte l'empêchant de rien savoir de positif, il donna ordre de mener Paul à la Forteresse.
[21:35] Quand ils furent sur l'escalier, la presse était telle que les soldats furent obligés de le porter.
[21:36] Une foule énorme le suivait en criant : «A mort !»
[21:37] Au moment d'entrer dans la Forteresse, Paul dit au tribun : «M'est-il permis de te parler?»
[21:38] — «Tu sais le grec? lui répondit-il, tu n'es donc pas le Juif d'Égypte qui a dernièrement soulevé et entraîné avec lui au désert quatre mille sicaires?»
[21:39] Paul repartit : «Je suis un Juif de Tarse, je suis citoyen d'une ville importante de Cilicie, permets-moi, je te prie, de parler au peuple.»
[21:40] Le tribun le lui permit. Paul alors, debout sur les marches de l'escalier», fit signe au peuple de la main. Un grand silence s'établit et il prononça en langue hébraïque les paroles suivantes:
[22:1] «Mes frères et mes pères,, «Écoutez ce que j'ai maintenant à vous dire pour me justifier»
[22:2] — (quand on l'entendit parler en hébreu, on redoubla d'attention) —
[22:3] il continua : «Je suis un Juif, né à Tarse, en Cilicie, mais j'ai été élevé dans cette ville-ci, j'ai fait mes études aux pieds de Gamaliel, dans toute la rigueur de la Loi de nos pères ; j'ai été plein de zèle pour la cause de Dieu, comme vous l'êtes tous aujourd'hui.
[22:4] Cette secte, je l'ai persécutée à mort ; j'ai chargé de chaînes, j'ai jeté en prison hommes et femmes,
[22:5] comme peuvent l'attester le grand-prêtre et le Sanhédrin tout entier. Car c'est d'eux que j'ai reçu des lettres pour nos frères de Damas, et j'y allai pour amener prisonniers à Jérusalem ceux que j'y trouverais et les faire punir.
[22:6] J'étais en chemin et j'approchais de Damas, quand tout à coup, vers midi, une vive lumière venue du ciel brilla autour de moi,
[22:7] je tombai par terre et j'entendis une voix qui me disait : «Saul, Saul, pourquoi me persécutes-tu?»
[22:8] — Je répondis : «Qui es-tu, Seigneur?» — La voix me dit : «Je suis Jésus de Nazareth que tu persécutes.»
[22:9] — Ceux qui étaient avec moi avaient vu la lumière, mais n'avaient pas entendu la voix de celui qui me parlait.
[22:10] Je dis alors : «Que dois-je faire, Seigneur?» et le Seigneur me répondit : «Relève-toi, rends-toi à Damas, et là on te dira tout ce que tu as l'ordre de faire.»
[22:11] — Comme je n'y voyais pas (la lumière m'avait ébloui), mes compagnons me prirent par la main et me menèrent à Damas.
[22:12] Un certain Hananias, homme pieux et fidèle à la Loi, estimé de tous les résidents juifs,
[22:13] vint se présenter à moi et me dit : «Saul, mon frère, regarde», — et immédiatement je le vis.
[22:14] Puis il me dit : «Le Dieu de nos pères t'a prédestiné à connaître sa volonté, à voir le Juste et à entendre les paroles de sa bouche ;
[22:15] car tu seras son témoin auprès de tous les hommes, témoin de ce que tu as vu et entendu.
[22:16] Et maintenant pourquoi tarderais-tu? Lève-toi, reçois le baptême et purifie-toi de tes péchés en invoquant son nom.»
[22:17] De retour à Jérusalem, comme j'étais en prière au Temple, je tombai en extase,
[22:18] et je le vis qui me disait : «Hâte-toi de partir, sors au plus vite de Jérusalem, car ils n'accepteront pas le témoignage que tu me rends.»
[22:19] Et je lui dis : «Seigneur, il savent eux-mêmes que j'ai fait emprisonner et flageller dans les synagogues ceux qui croient en toi,
[22:20] et quand ils ont versé le sang, d'Étienne, ton témoin, j'étais là, présent, j'applaudissais, je gardais les vêtements des bourreaux» ;
[22:21] et il me dit : «Va, car je t'enverrai au loin vers les païens.»
[22:22] On l'avait écouté jusque-là, mais, à ce mot, les clameurs recommencèrent: «A mort, cet homme! il ne faut pas lui laisser la vie!»
[22:23] Ils vociféraient, ôtaient leurs vêtements, faisaient voler la poussière.
[22:24] Le tribun commanda alors de le faire entrer dans la Forteresse et de le mettre à la question pour savoir la vraie cause de tous ces cris contre lui.
[22:25] Comme on l'avait déjà attaché au poteau pour recevoir les coups de lanières, Paul dit au centurion qui commandait: «Vous est-il permis de flageller un citoyen romain qui n'est pas même condamné?»
[22:26] A ces paroles, le centurion alla en référer au tribun : «Que vas-tu faire? lui dit-il, cet homme est citoyen romain.»
[22:27] Le tribun vint à Paul et lui dit: «Réponds-moi, es-tu citoyen romain?» — «Oui», lui dit Paul.
[22:28] Le tribun repartit : «Moi, j'ai dépensé une somme considérable pour avoir ce titre.» — «Et moi, lui répliqua Paul, je l'ai par ma naissance.»
[22:29] Les exécuteurs s'écartèrent immédiatement, et le tribun commença à avoir peur, voyant qu'il avait fait mettre aux fers un citoyen romain.
[22:30] Le lendemain, voulant savoir positivement quels griefs articulaient les Juifs, il lui fit ôter les fers et donna ordre de convoquer le haut sacerdoce et le Sanhédrin en entier ; puis il amena Paul et le fit comparaître devant eux.
[23:1] Paul, regardant en face le Sanhédrin, dit: «Frères, «C'est en toute bonne conscience que je me suis conduit devant Dieu jusqu'à aujourd'hui...»
[23:2] Le grand-prêtre Hananias ordonna alors aux assistants de souffleter Paul sur la bouche.
[23:3] «Dieu te frappera à ton tour, muraille blanchie!» répondit Paul en se tournant vers lui, «tu sièges pour me juger selon la Loi, et c'est au mépris de la Loi que tu ordonnes de me frapper!»
[23:4] — «Quoi! tu injuries le grand-prêtre de Dieu!» dirent les assistants.
[23:5] Mais Paul : «Je ne savais pas, frères, que ce fût le grand-prêtre, car il est écrit : «Tu n'insulteras pas le chef de ton peuple.»
[23:6] Paul, sachant que l'assemblée était composée en partie de Sadducéens, en partie de Pharisiens, s'écria en plein Sanhédrin : «Frères, je suis Pharisien, fils de Pharisiens, c'est pour mon espérance, c'est pour la résurrection des morts qu'on me met en jugement !»
[23:7] Ces paroles provoquèrent une scission entre les Pharisiens et les Sadducéens et l'assemblée se divisa.
[23:8] En effet, les Sadducéens nient la résurrection, l'existence des anges et des Esprits ; les Pharisiens admettent tout cela.
[23:9] Il s'ensuivit une discussion tumultueuse ; certains Scribes du parti pharisien se levèrent, prirent la défense de Paul et dirent : «Nous ne trouvons rien à reprocher à cet homme... Si un Esprit lui a parlé! un ange, peut-être !»...
[23:10] La dispute s'envenimait, et le tribun craignait que Paul ne fût mis en pièces ; il donna ordre à une escouade de soldats de descendre dans la salle, d'arracher Paul de leurs mains et de le reconduire à la Forteresse.
[23:11] La nuit suivante, le Seigneur lui apparut et lui dit : «Courage! comme tu as été mon témoin à Jérusalem, il faut aussi que tu sois mon témoin à Rome!»
[23:12] Le lendemain matin, les Juifs formèrent entre eux un complot et s'obligèrent par voeu à ne manger ni boire tant qu'ils n'auraient pas tué Paul.
[23:13] Ils étaient plus de quarante à avoir fait cette conjuration.
[23:14] Ils allèrent trouver les chefs des prêtres et les Anciens et leur dirent : «Nous nous sommes obligés par voeu, sous les plus terribles anathèmes, à ne rien manger que nous n'ayons tué Paul.
[23:15] Intervenez donc, avec le Sanhédrin, auprès du tribun pour obtenir une nouvelle comparution, comme si vous vouliez étudier plus à fond son affaire. Quant à nous, nous sommes prêts ; nous le tuerons dans le trajet.»
[23:16] Mais le fils de la soeur de Paul entendit parler de ce guet-apens, se rendit à la Forteresse, y entra et révéla tout à Paul.
[23:17] Celui-ci fit alors appeler un des centurions : «Mène ce jeune homme au tribun, lui dit-il, il a quelque chose à lui communiquer.
[23:18] Le centurion l'emmena donc chez le tribun et lui dit : «Le prisonnier Paul m'a fait appeler et m'a prié de t'amener ce jeune homme, qui a quelque chose à te dire.»
[23:19] Le tribun prit le jeune homme par la main, le conduisit à l'écart et lui demanda : «Qu'as-tu à me communiquer?»
[23:20] — «Les Juifs, répondit-il, sont convenus de te prier de faire comparaître Paul demain devant le Sanhédrin, comme s'ils voulaient étudier plus à fond son affaire.
[23:21] Garde-toi de le faire ; c'est un guet-apens ; ils sont plus de quarante qui se sont obligés par voeu à ne manger ni boire avant de l'avoir tué. Ils sont tout prêts ; ils n'attendent que ton consentement.»
[23:22] Le tribun renvoya le jeune homme en lui défendant de parler à personne de ce qu'il venait de lui apprendre.
[23:23] Puis il fit appeler deux centurions : «Tenez prêts, leur dit-il, à partir de la troisième heure de la nuit, deux cents soldats, soixante-dix cavaliers et deux cents hommes du train pour aller jusqu'à Césarée.»
[23:24] Il commanda aussi de se pourvoir de montures pour Paul, afin de le mener sain et sauf au procurateur Félix.
[23:25] En même temps il écrivit à celui-ci une lettre, dont voici la teneur :
[23:26] «Claudius Lysias à son excellence le procurateur Félix. Salut.
[23:27] «Cet homme a été arrêté par les Juifs, et ils allaient le tuer, quand j'arrivai avec la troupe et le leur enlevai ; j'avais appris qu'il était citoyen romain.
[23:28] Voulant connaître le motif de leurs accusations, je le conduisis au Sanhédrin ;
[23:29] voici ce que je trouvai : des poursuites sur des questions relatives à leur Loi et aucun grief qui méritât la mort ou la prison.
[23:30] Mais on m'a dénoncé un complot contre cet homme ; je te l'ai donc envoyé sans retard et j'ai prévenu les accusateurs qu'ils eussent aussi à prendre la parole contre lui devant toi.»
[23:31] Les soldats exécutèrent ces ordres ; ils prirent Paul et le conduisirent de nuit jusqu'à Antipatris.
[23:32] Le lendemain, ils laissèrent les cavaliers continuer le chemin avec lui et rentrèrent à la Forteresse.
[23:33] Ceux-là, arrivés à Césarée, remirent la lettre au procurateur et lui présentèrent Paul.
[23:34] Il la lut et s'informa de quel pays il était. Apprenant qu'il était de Cilicie :
[23:35] «Je t'entendrai, dit-il, quand tes accusateurs seront arrivés.» Puis il ordonna de le garder dans le prétoire d'Hérode.
[24:1] Cinq jours après arriva le grand-prêtre Hananias, accompagné de quelques Anciens et d'un avocat, un certain Tertullus ; ils vinrent dénoncer Paul au procurateur.
[24:2] On le fit appeler, et Tertullus commença son accusation en ces termes:
[24:3] «Excellent Félix, Nous jouissons d'une paix profonde, grâce à toi, grâce aussi, aux réformes faites au sein de ce peuple, et dues à ta sollicitude en tout et partout ; nous en éprouvons une bien vive reconnaissance.
[24:4] Mais je ne veux pas te retenir trop longtemps ; je te prie seulement de nous écouter un instant avec ta bonté habituelle.
[24:5] Cet homme est une peste ; il excite des séditions parmi les Juifs dans le monde entier ; il est chef de l'hérésie des Nazaréens ;
[24:6] nous l'avons trouvé essayant de profaner le Temple ; alors nous l'avons arrêté.
[24:7] (Nous avons voulu le juger selon notre propre Loi : mais le tribun Lysias, étant survenu, l'a arraché de nos mains avec une grande violence, en ordonnant à ses accusateurs de venir devant toi.)
[24:8] Tu peux, en l'interrogeant sur ces faits, apprendre de sa bouche tout ce dont nous l'accusons.»
[24:9] Les Juifs s'associèrent à ces paroles et déclarèrent qu'elles étaient exactes.
[24:10] Sur un signe du procurateur, Paul prit ensuite la parole : «Voilà plusieurs années que tu administres ce peuple, je le sais ; aussi est-ce avec une grande confiance que je viens me défendre moi-même.
[24:11] Tu peux constater: — qu'il n'y a pas plus de douze jours que je suis arrivé à Jérusalem pour y adorer ;
[24:12] - que personne ne m'a vu discuter avec quelqu'un dans le Temple ; — que je n'y ai point fait d'attroupement ; — pas davantage dans les synagogues ou dans la ville ;
[24:13] — et qu'ils ne peuvent pas prouver ce dont ils m'accusent maintenant.»
[24:14] «Mais voici ce que je t'avoue : Il y a une doctrine qu'ils appellent une hérésie, et c'est en la suivant : — que j'adore le Dieu de mes pères ; — que je crois à tout ce qui est écrit dans da Loi et les Prophètes» ;
[24:15] — que j'ai en Dieu l'espérance (et eux aussi ils la partagent) qu'il y aura une résurrection des justes et des injustes.
[24:16] Voilà pourquoi je m'efforce moi-même d'avoir en tout temps une conscience irréprochable devant Dieu et devant les hommes.
[24:17] «Après une absence de plusieurs années, je suis venu faire à mon peuple des aumônes, lui porter des offrandes.
[24:18] C'est alors que certains Juifs d'Asie m'ont trouvé dans le Temple, occupé à des purifications, sans le moindre attroupement, sans le moindre bruit.
[24:19] Ils auraient dû se présenter devant toi et m'accuser, s'ils avaient un reproche à me faire ;
[24:20] ou bien, que ceux ici présents disent de quel méfait ils m'ont trouvé coupable quand j'ai comparu devant le Sanhédrin.
[24:21] Serait-ce de leur avoir dit ces mots, les seuls que je leur ai adressés : C'est la question de la résurrection des morts qui me fait juger aujourd'hui par vous?»
[24:22] Félix, qui savait assez exactement de quelle doctrine il s'agissait, ajourna la cause, en disant : «Quand Lysias, le tribun, sera ici, j'étudierai votre affaire.»
[24:23] En attendant, il ordonna au centurion de garder Paul, mais de le traiter avec douceur et de n'empêcher aucun des siens de lui rendre des services.
[24:24] Quelques jours après, Félix vint avec sa femme Drusille, qui était juive. Il fit appeler Paul et l'entendit parler de la foi au Christ Jésus ;
[24:25] et comme il traitait de la justice, de la tempérance, du jugement à venir, Félix eut peur : «En voilà assez pour le moment, dit-il, je te ferai rappeler à la première occasion.»
[24:26] En outre, il espérait que Paul lui donnerait de l'argent, et, dans ce but, il le faisait venir assez souvent et s'entretenait avec lui.
[24:27] Deux années se passèrent ainsi ; Félix eut pour successeur Porcius Festus, et comme il voulait faire plaisir aux Juifs, il laissa Paul en prison.
[25:1] Trois jours après son arrivée dans sa province, Festus monta de Césarée à Jérusalem.
[25:2] Là, le haut sacerdoce et les autorités juives portèrent plainte contre Paul ; ils lui demandèrent avec instance et comme une faveur (mais dans un but hostile) de le faire revenir à Jérusalem ;
[25:3] ils auraient dressé une embuscade pour le tuer dans le trajet.
[25:4] Festus répondit que Paul resterait prisonnier à Césarée et que lui-même y retournerait bientôt.
[25:5] «Que les plus notables d'entre vous, ajouta-t-il, qui voudraient charger cet homme descendent avec moi et formulent leur accusation.»
[25:6] Il ne resta avec eux que peu de jours, huit ou dix, puis retourna à Césarée. Dès le lendemain, il siégea sur son tribunal et fit comparaître Paul.
[25:7] A son entrée, les Juifs, descendus de Jérusalem, l'entourèrent, en formulant de nombreuses et graves accusations qu'ils ne pouvaient prouver ;
[25:8] tandis que Paul se défendait, en déclarant qu'il n'avait commis aucune faute ni contre la Loi juive, ni contre le Temple, ni contre l'Empereur.
[25:9] Là-dessus, Festus, qui voulait faire plaisir aux Juifs, dit à Paul : «Veux-tu monter à Jérusalem et y être jugé sur tout cela en ma présence?»
[25:10] Paul lui répondit: «C'est devant le tribunal de l'Empereur que je comparais ; c'est là que je dois être jugé ; je n'ai fait aucun tort aux Juifs, et tu le sais fort bien.
[25:11] Si je suis coupable, si j'ai mérité la mort, je ne demande pas de grâce ; si, au contraire, je n'ai rien fait de ce dont ils m'accusent, personne n'a le droit de me livrer à eux par complaisance. J'en appelle à l'Empereur !»
[25:12] Festus, alors, s'entretint un moment avec ses assesseurs et répondit : «Tu en as appelé à l'Empereur, tu iras à l'Empereur.»
[25:13] Quelques jours plus tard, le roi Agrippa et Bérénice vinrent à Césarée saluer Festus.
[25:14] Ils y restèrent plusieurs jours et Festus exposa au roi l'affaire de Paul. Il y a ici un homme, lui dit-il, que Félix a laissé prisonnier ;
[25:15] pendant mon séjour à Jérusalem, le haut sacerdoce et les autorités juives ont porté plainte contre lui et m'ont demandé sa condamnation.
[25:16] Je leur ai répondu que la coutume romaine ne permet pas de livrer un homme par complaisance, sans que l'accusé ait été confronté avec ses accusateurs et ait eu toute facilité de se justifier de l'accusation.
[25:17] Ils sont alors venus ici et, sans perdre un moment, dès le lendemain, je siégeai sur mon tribunal et je fis comparaître cet homme.
[25:18] Les accusateurs qui se sont présentés n'ont relevé contre lui aucun des crimes que je m'attendais à voir établir ;
[25:19] il ne s'est agi entre eux que de subtilités relatives à leurs croyances particulières et d'un certain Jésus qui est mort et que Paul dit être vivant.
[25:20] Ne sachant quel parti prendre dans une discussion de ce genre, j'ai demandé à Paul s'il voulait aller à Jérusalem et y être jugé sur tout cela.
[25:21] Mais il en a appelé pour que sa cause fût réservée au jugement de Sa Majesté ; j'ai alors ordonné de le garder en prison jusqu'à ce que je l'envoie à l'Empereur.»
[25:22] Agrippa dit à Festus : «Je voulais justement entendre cet homme.» — «Tu l'entendras demain», répondit Festus.
[25:23] Le lendemain, en effet, Agrippa et Bérénice vinrent avec une suite brillante et se rendirent à la salle d'audience, accompagnés des officiers de l'armée et des principaux personnages de la ville. Sur l'ordre de Festus, Paul fut introduit.
[25:24] Festus prit la parole : «Roi Agrippa, et vous tous ici présents, «Vous voyez cet homme à propos duquel tous les Juifs, en masse, et à Jérusalem et ici, sont venus m'importuner ; ils me crient que je ne dois pas lui laisser la vie.
[25:25] Moi j'ai compris qu'il n'avait rien fait qui méritât la mort ; lui-même, d'ailleurs, en a appelé à l'Empereur et j'ai décidé de le lui envoyer.
[25:26] Mais je n'ai rien de bien positif à écrire à son sujet au Maître ; voilà pourquoi je l'ai fait paraître devant vous, et surtout devant toi, Roi Agrippa, et, après cet interrogatoire, j'aurai quelque chose à écrire.
[25:27] En effet, je trouve absurde d'envoyer un prisonnier sans indiquer les charges qui pèsent sur lui.»
[26:1] — «Je te donne la parole pour ta défense», dit Agrippa à Paul. Celui-ci fit alors un geste de la main et se défendit en ces termes :
[26:2] «Roi Agrippa, Je m'estime heureux d'avoir aujourd'hui à me disculper devant toi de tout ce dont m'accusent les Juifs,
[26:3] car tu connais parfaitement tous les usages de ce peuple et les questions qui le préoccupent. Je te prie donc de m'écouter patiemment.»
[26:4] «Ce qu'a été dès l'origine ma conduite, pendant ma jeunesse, au milieu de mon peuple, à Jérusalem, tous les Juifs le savent ;
[26:5] ils me connaissent d'ancienne date, pour avoir appartenu, s'ils veulent bien en convenir, à la tendance la plus stricte de notre religion ; je veux dire que j'étais Pharisien.
[26:6] Et maintenant me voilà mis en cause pour avoir espéré en la promesse faite par Dieu à nos pères
[26:7] et que nos douze tribus, priant avec instance, nuit et jour, espèrent voir s'accomplir. Et c'est pour cette espérance-là, ô Roi, que des Juifs m'accusent!
[26:8] Est-ce que vous trouvez incroyable que Dieu ressuscite des morts?»
[26:9] «Pour moi, j'avais cru devoir m'opposer de toutes mes forces au nom de Jésus de Nazareth ;
[26:10] et c'est ce que j'ai fait à Jérusalem. J'ai fait jeter en prison un grand nombre de fidèles, m'y étant fait autoriser par les chefs des prêtres, et quand on les mettait à mort, j'y souscrivais entièrement.
[26:11] Il m'arrivait dans toutes les synagogues de sévir contre eux et de les forcer à blasphémer. J'étais tellement furieux contre eux que je les persécutais jusque dans les villes du dehors.
[26:12] Dans ce but, je partis pour Damas avec de pleins pouvoirs et une autorisation délivrée par les chefs des prêtres,
[26:13] lorsque, en plein jour, sur la route, je vis, Roi, une lumière venant du ciel, plus brillante que le soleil et nous enveloppant de son éclat, mes compagnons de voyage et moi.
[26:14] Tous nous tombâmes par terre et j'entendis une voix qui me disait en hébreu : «Saul, Saul, pourquoi me persécutes-tu? Il t'est difficile de regimber contre l'aiguillon.»
[26:15] Je répondis : «Qui es-tu, Seigneur?» et le Seigneur dit : «Je suis Jésus que tu persécutes ; mais relève-toi, tiens-toi debout ;
[26:16] voici pourquoi je te suis apparu : pour t'élire serviteur et témoin de ce que tu viens de voir et de ce que tu verras encore ;
[26:17] je te protégerai contre ce peuple et contre les païens auxquels je t'envoie,
[26:18] pour leur ouvrir les yeux, pour les convertir des ténèbres à la lumière, de la puissance de Satan à Dieu, pour leur obtenir, par la foi en moi, le pardon des péchés et une part de l'héritage promis à ceux qui lui sont consacrés.»
[26:19] Et alors, Roi Agrippa, je n'ai pas voulu désobéir à cette vision céleste ;
[26:20] mais à ceux de Damas d'abord, ensuite à ceux de Jérusalem, puis à tous les habitants de la Judée et aux païens, j'ai prêché de se repentir, de se convertir à Dieu, de faire des oeuvres dignes de la repentance.
[26:21] Voilà pourquoi les Juifs se sont emparés de moi dans le Temple et ont essayé de me tuer sur place.
[26:22] Mais, grâce à la protection de Dieu, j'ai vécu jusqu'à aujourd'hui, rendant témoignage aux petits et aux grands, sans rien dire en dehors de ce que «Moïse et les Prophètes» ont prédit devoir arriver ;
[26:23] savoir que le Christ devait souffrir, et qu'étant le premier des ressuscités, il devait annoncer la lumière au peuple et aux païens»
[26:24] Paul en était là de sa défense quand Festus dit à haute voix :, «Tu es fou, Paul ; tes longues études t'ont fait perdre l'esprit.»
[26:25] Mais Paul : «Je ne suis pas fou, Excellent Festus, ce sont des paroles vraies et sensées que je prononce.
[26:26] Le roi connaît ces faits, aussi je m'adresse à lui avec confiance, car je suis persuadé qu'il n'en ignore aucun ; tout cela ne s'est pas fait en cachette.
[26:27] Crois-tu aux prophètes, Roi Agrippa? Je sais que tu y crois.»
[26:28] Agrippa dit alors à Paul : «Tu vas me persuader bientôt de me faire chrétien !»
[26:29] Et Paul: «Dieu veuille que tôt ou tard non seulement toi, mais tous ceux qui m'écoutent aujourd'hui en viennent à me ressembler... excepté par ces chaînes!»
[26:30] Tous se levèrent, le roi, le procurateur, Bérénice, l'assemblée.
[26:31] En se retirant, ils s'entretenaient ensemble et se disaient que cet homme ne faisait rien qui méritât la mort ou la prison.
[26:32] «On aurait pu relâcher cet homme, dit Agrippa à Festus, s'il n'en avait pas appelé à l'Empereur.»
[27:1] Lorsqu'il fut décidé que nous partirions pour l'Italie, on remit Paul et quelques autres prisonniers à un centurion de la cohorte Augusta, nommé Julius.
[27:2] Montés à bord d'un navire d'Adramyttium qui devait faire escale dans les ports de la province d'Asie, nous prîmes la mer ; un Macédonien de Thessalonique, Aristarque, était avec nous.
[27:3] Le second jour nous arrivions à Sidon, et Julius, qui traitait Paul avec beaucoup de douceur, lui permit d'aller visiter ses amis et de recevoir leurs soins.
[27:4] Partis de là, nous suivîmes les côtes de l'île de Chypre, parce que les vents étaient contraires,
[27:5] et, après avoir traversé la mer qui baigne la Cilicie et la Pamphylie, nous abordâmes à Myrra en Lycie.
[27:6] Là le centurion, ayant trouvé un navire alexandrin qui faisait voile pour l'Italie, nous fit monter à son bord.
[27:7] Après plusieurs jours d'une navigation très lente, nous arrivions à grand'peine à la hauteur de Cnide. Le vent ne nous permettant pas d'aborder, nous suivîmes les côtes de l'île de Crète dans la direction du cap Salmoné.
[27:8] Après l'avoir doublé, non sans difficulté, nous arrivâmes à un endroit appelé Les Bons-Ports, près de la ville de Lasa.
[27:9] Il s'était écoulé un temps considérable, et la navigation devenait dangereuse, l'époque du Grand Jeûne étant déjà passée.
[27:10] Paul alors donna son avis. «Je prévois, dit-il, de sérieuses avaries et de grands dangers, non seulement pour la cargaison et pour le bateau, mais pour nos personnes mêmes, si nous continuons notre voyage.»
[27:11] Mais le centurion avait plus de confiance en ce que disaient le capitaine et le pilote qu'en ce que disait Paul.
[27:12] D'ailleurs le port n'était pas bon pour hiverner, et l'avis général fut d'en repartir et de tâcher de gagner, pour y passer l'hiver, Phénix, port de Crète, exposé au sud-ouest et au nord-ouest.
[27:13] Comme il soufflait une brise du sud, on crut le moment favorable, on leva l'ancre et on se mit à longer de près les côtes de Crète.
[27:14] Mais, tout à coup, un des ouragans, appelés Euraquilon, vint s'abattre sur l'île.
[27:15] Le navire entraîné fut hors d'état de tenir tête au vent ; on céda ; on fut emporté.
[27:16] Comme nous passions sous une petite île appelée Clandé, nous parvînmes, mais non sans peine, à manoeuvrer la chaloupe.
[27:17] On s'en servit pour prendre quelques précautions et entourer le navire de câbles. Puis, comme on craignait d'être jeté sur les Syrtes, on plia les vergues et on s'abandonna au vent.
[27:18] Le second jour, la tempête était toujours aussi forte, et on, jeta à la mer tout le chargement ;
[27:19] le troisième, nous nous débarrassions nous-mêmes du mobilier du navire.
[27:20] On ne vit pas le soleil, on n'aperçut pas une seule étoile pendant plusieurs jours, et la tempête restant toujours aussi affreuse, tout espoir de salut nous fut dès lors interdit.
[27:21] Comme depuis longtemps personne n'avait pris de nourriture, Paul parut au milieu de tous et dit : «Il aurait fallu écouter mon conseil et ne pas partir de l'île de Crète ; vous auriez évité ce désastre et cette perte.
[27:22] Mais maintenant je vous invite à prendre courage ; aucun de vous ne périra ; le navire seul sera perdu.
[27:23] Car cette nuit m'est apparu un ange du Dieu auquel j'appartiens et que j'adore,
[27:24] et il m'a dit : «Ne crains rien, Paul! tu dois comparaître devant l'Empereur, et Dieu t'accorde la vie de tous ceux qui naviguent avec toi.»
[27:25] Ayez donc bon courage ; car j'ai cette foi en Dieu, qu'il en sera comme il m'a été dit.
[27:26] Il faut que nous soyons jetés sur une île.»
[27:27] La quatorzième nuit que nous étions ainsi ballottés sur l'Adriatique, vers le milieu de cette nuit, les matelots crurent au voisinage de la terre.
[27:28] Ils jetèrent la sonde, et trouvèrent vingt brasses ; un peu après ils la jetèrent encore, et trouvèrent quinze brasses :
[27:29] ils craignirent d'aller donner sur des récifs ; quatre ancres furent alors jetées de la poupe et chacun attendit le jour avec anxiété.
[27:30] Comme les matelots cherchaient à s'échapper du navire et mettaient la chaloupe à la mer sous prétexte de jeter les ancres de l'avant,
[27:31] Paul dit au centurion et aux soldats : Si ces hommes ne restent pas à bord vous ne pouvez être sauvés.»
[27:32] Les soldats coupèrent alors les cordes de la chaloupe et la laissèrent tomber.
[27:33] Paul, en attendant le jour, conseilla à tous de prendre de la nourriture. «C'est aujourd'hui le quatorzième jour, dit-il, que vous passez dans l'attente, à jeun, sans rien prendre.
[27:34] Je vous conseille donc de manger ; cela est nécessaire à votre salut ; aucun de vous ne perdra un cheveu de sa tête.»
[27:35] En disant cela, il prit du pain, le rompit, en rendant grâces à Dieu devant tous, et se mit à manger.
[27:36] Tous reprirent alors courage et mangèrent aussi.
[27:37] Nous étions en tout deux cent soixante-seize à bord
[27:38] Quand on eut fini, on allégea encore le navire en jetant tout le blé à la mer.
[27:39] Lorsque le jour parut, personne ne reconnut la terre, mais on entrevoyait une baie avec une plage et on résolut d'essayer d'y mettre le navire à l'abri.
[27:40] On coupa donc les câbles des ancres qu'on laissa se perdre dans la mer, on lâcha les amarres des gouvernails, on hissa la voile d'artimon qu'on offrit au vent et on gouverna vers la plage.
[27:41] On tomba sur une langue de terre battue des deux côtés par la mer ; là, le navire échoua. La proue, qui s'était enfoncée dans le sable, resta immobile ; la poupe, au contraire, se disloquait à chaque coup de mer.
[27:42] Les soldats proposèrent alors de tuer les prisonniers de peur qu'ils ne s'échappassent à la nage.
[27:43] Mais le centurion, qui voulait sauver Paul, les empêcha de le faire ; il ordonna à ceux qui savaient nager de se jeter les premiers à l'eau et de gagner la terre ;
[27:44] aux autres de se mettre sur des planches, sur des épaves de toutes sortes ; et c'est ainsi que tous réussirent à se sauver à terre.
[28:1] Une fois hors de danger, nous apprîmes que cette île s'appelait Malte.
[28:2] Les indigènes nous accueillirent avec une humanité peu ordinaire ; ils allumèrent un grand feu et nous y réunirent tous, car la pluie tombait, et il faisait froid.
[28:3] Comme Paul prenait une poignée de bois sec et la jetait dans le brasier, la chaleur en fit sortir une vipère qui s'attacha à sa main.
[28:4] Quand les indigènes virent l'animal qui pendait à sa main, ils se dirent entre eux : «Certainement c'est un meurtrier que cet homme ; à peine échappe-t-il à la mer et la Justice divine ne veut pas lui laisser la vie!»
[28:5] Mais lui secoua l'animal dans le feu et ne ressentit aucun mal.
[28:6] Eux s'attendaient à le voir enfler ou tomber mort tout à coup. Pendant longtemps ils attendirent, et voyant qu'il ne lui arrivait rien de fâcheux, ils changèrent d'avis et déclarèrent qu'il était un dieu.
[28:7] Il y avait, près de cet endroit-là, des terres appartenant au principal personnage de l'île, un certain Publius ; il nous recueillit et nous traita pendant trois jours avec beaucoup d'hospitalité.
[28:8] Or le père de ce Publius était retenu au lit par des accès de fièvre et la dysenterie. Paul entra chez lui, fit la prière, lui imposa les mains et le guérit.
[28:9] Là-dessus, tous les autres habitants malades de l'île vinrent aussi et furent guéris.
[28:10] Aussi nous rendirent-ils toutes sortes d'honneur et, à notre départ, ils nous fournirent ce dont nous avions besoin.
[28:11] Trois mois plus tard, nous prenions passage sur un navire alexandrin, à l'enseigne des Dioscures, qui avait hiverné dans le port de l'île.
[28:12] Puis nous gagnions Syracuse et nous y passions trois jours ;
[28:13] de là, longeant toujours la côte, nous touchions à Reggio. Le lendemain le vent du sud se leva, et, en deux jours, nous étions à Pouzzoles.
[28:14] Nous y trouvâmes des frères qui nous engagèrent à rester une semaine avec eux. Ensuite nous nous mîmes en route pour Rome.
[28:15] Les frères de cette ville, qui avaient eu de nos nouvelles, vinrent à notre rencontre jusqu'à «Forum d'Appius» et jusqu'à «Les Trois Tavernes». A leur vue, Paul rendit grâces à Dieu et prit courage.
[28:16] Quand nous fûmes arrivés à Rome, Paul eut la permission de rester seul avec le soldat qui le gardait.
[28:17] Trois jours après, cependant, il convoqua les Juifs de Rome les plus considérés, et quand ils furent réunis, il leur dit : «Mes frères, je n'avais rien fait de contraire à notre peuple et aux institutions de nos pères, lorsqu'on m'a arrêté à Jérusalem et livré entre les mains des Romains.
[28:18] Ceux-ci, après avoir examiné ma cause, voulaient me relâcher, parce que rien ne pouvait motiver ma condamnation à mort.
[28:19] Mais les Juifs, s'y étant opposés, je me vis forcé d'en appeler à l'Empereur, sans cependant vouloir me plaindre de mes compatriotes.
[28:20] Voilà pourquoi je vous ai demandés ; je voulais vous voir et vous parler, car c'est à cause de l'espérance d'Israël que je porte cette chaîne.»
[28:21] Ils lui répondirent : «Nous n'avons pas reçu de lettres de Judée à ton sujet, et aucun de nos frères n'est venu nous faire de rapport ni nous dire du mal de toi.
[28:22] Cependant nous voudrions bien apprendre de toi ce que tu penses ; car, à notre connaissance, ce parti-là rencontre partout de l'opposition.»
[28:23] Alors ils prirent jour ensemble et un plus grand nombre encore vint le trouver chez lui. Du matin au soir il leur exposait ce que c'était que le Royaume de Dieu et les suppliait en leur démontrant par la «Loi et les Prophètes» tout ce qui concerne Jésus.
[28:24] Les uns se laissèrent convaincre par ses paroles, les autres restèrent incrédules.
[28:25] Comme ils se séparaient sans avoir pu se mettre d'accord, Paul leur dit ce simple mot : «L'Esprit saint a admirablement parlé quand il a dit à vos pères par le prophète Ésaïe :
[28:26] «Va vers ce peuple et dis-lui : Vos oreilles entendront et vous ne comprendrez pas ; Vos yeux regarderont et vous ne verrez pas,
[28:27] Car le coeur de ce peuple s'est endurci ; Ils ont fait la sourde oreille ; ils ont fermé les yeux, Pour que leurs yeux ne voient pas, que leurs oreilles n'entendent pas, Que leurs coeurs ne comprennent pas Pour se convertir et que je puisse les guérir.»
[28:28] «Sachez donc que ce salut de Dieu a été envoyé aux païens ; ceux-là l'écouteront!»
[28:29] (Lorsqu'il eut dit cela, les Juifs s'en allèrent, discutant vivement entre eux.)
[28:30] Paul demeura deux ans entiers dans un appartement qu'il avait loué à ses frais ;
[28:31] il pouvait y recevoir tous ceux qui venaient le voir ; il prêchait le Royaume de Dieu ; il enseignait ce qui concerne le Seigneur Jésus-Christ sans difficultés et en toute liberté. 

### Romans

[1:1] Paul, serviteur de Jésus-Christ, élu apôtre choisi pour prêcher l'évangile de Dieu,
[1:2] (Évangile promis d'avance par ses prophètes dans les saintes Écritures
[1:3] et concernant son Fils né, quant à la chair, de la race de David,
[1:4] et, quant à l'Esprit de sainteté, déclaré avec puissance Fils de Dieu, par sa résurrection d'entre les morts, Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur) ;
[1:5] (Nous avons reçu de sa grâce la mission d'amener en son nom à l’obéissance de la foi tous les païens),
[1:6] (dont vous faites aussi partie, vous élus de Jésus-Christ).
[1:7] A tous les biens-aimés de Dieu, fidèles élus qui sont à Rome. Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:8] Je commence en rendant grâces pour vous tous à mon Dieu par Jésus-Christ de ce que votre foi est renommée dans le monde entier.
[1:9] Le Dieu, que je sers de toute mon âme en prêchant l'Évangile de son Fils, m'est témoin que sans cesse je fais mention de vous dans mes prières,
[1:10] lui demandant toujours que je puisse une fois enfin réussir, par sa volonté, à venir chez vous.
[1:11] J'ai, en effet, le plus grand désir de vous voir, pour vous communiquer quelque don spirituel propre à vous affermir ;
[1:12] je veux dire, pour que, chez vous, nous nous encouragions mutuellement, vous et moi, par la foi qui nous est commune.
[1:13] Je ne veux pas vous laisser ignorer, mes frères, que souvent j'ai formé le projet d'aller chez vous (j'en ai été empêché jusqu'à présent), afin de recueillir aussi quelques fruits parmi vous comme parmi les autres païens.
[1:14] Je me dois aux Grecs et aux étrangers, aux savants et aux ignorants.
[1:15] J'ai donc, pour ma part, grande envie de vous prêcher l'Évangile à vous aussi, habitants de Rome !
[1:16] Car je n'ai pas honte de l'Évangile ; il est une puissance de Dieu donnant le salut à tout croyant, au Juif d'abord, puis au païen.
[1:17] Il s'y révèle, en effet, une justice de Dieu, qui vient de la foi, qui est accordée à la foi, comme il est écrit : «Le juste vivra par la foi.»
[1:18] Il y a une colère de Dieu qui se révèle du haut du ciel contre toute impiété et toute iniquité d'hommes qui méchamment étouffent la vérité,
[1:19] car ce qu'on peut savoir sur Dieu est à leur portée, Dieu le leur a fait connaître.
[1:20] En effet, les perfections invisibles de Dieu, son éternelle puissance et sa divinité, éclatent aux yeux depuis la création du monde, pour quiconque sait regarder ses oeuvres. De la sorte ils sont inexcusables ;
[1:21] car enfin, ayant conscience de Dieu, ils ne lui ont ni rendu gloire, ni rendu grâces comme à leur Dieu ; au contraire, ils se sont perdus dans des raisonnements sans valeur ; leur coeur inintelligent a été plongé dans les ténèbres.
[1:22] Ils se sont dits sages et ils ont été insensés,
[1:23] ils ont substitué, à la gloire du Dieu immortel des images représentant l'homme mortel, les oiseaux, les quadrupèdes, les reptiles.
[1:24] Voilà pourquoi Dieu les a livrés à toutes les passions de leurs coeurs et à une impureté telle qu'eux-mêmes ils déshonorent leurs corps.
[1:25] Oui, c'est pour avoir substitué à la vérité de Dieu le mensonge, pour avoir servi, avoir adoré la créature au lieu du Créateur, — (Béni soit-il à jamais ! Amen!) —
[1:26] c'est pour cela que Dieu les a livrés à des passions infâmes : Les femmes ont remplacé les relations naturelles par des actes contre nature ;
[1:27] les hommes de même ont abandonné leurs relations naturelles avec la femme, se sont pris de passions furieuses les uns pour les autres, ont commis entre hommes des infamies et ont reçu en leurs personnes le salaire que mérite leur égarement ;
[1:28] et comme ils ne se sont pas souciés de savoir qui était Dieu, Dieu les a livrés à un esprit d'aveuglement, et ils font ce qu'il ne faut pas faire.
[1:29] Ils ont tous les vices, toutes les méchancetés, toutes les malices, toutes les rapacités ; ne respirant qu'envie, meurtre, discorde, ruse, mauvaise foi ; délateurs,
[1:30] calomniateurs, impies, insolents, orgueilleux, présomptueux, ingénieux au mal, enfants rebelles,
[1:31] inintelligents, parjures, durs, impitoyables.
[1:32] Ces gens-là connaissent le décret de Dieu qui condamne à mort ceux qui commettent de tels actes, et non seulement ils les commettent, mais ils approuvent ceux qui s'y livrent.
[2:1] Donc, tu es sans excuse, ô homme, qui que tu sois, de juger autrui ; car, en le jugeant, tu te condamnes toi-même, et, en effet, tout en le jugeant, tu te conduis comme lui ;
[2:2] et la sentence de Dieu sur ceux qui se conduisent ainsi est, nous le savons, conforme à la vérité.
[2:3] Penses-tu, toi qui juges ceux qui se conduisent ainsi et qui en fais autant, penses-tu échapper à la sentence de Dieu?
[2:4] Et son inépuisable bonté, et sa tolérance, et sa patience les méprises-tu? Ignores-tu que la bonté de Dieu t'invite au repentir ?
[2:5] Par ton endurcissement et par l'impénitence de ton coeur, tu t'amasses un trésor de colère pour le jour terrible où se révélera le juste jugement de Dieu
[2:6] «Qui rendra à chacun selon ses oeuvres»
[2:7] Aux uns qui, en persévérant dans l'oeuvre bonne, cherchent la gloire, l'honneur et l'immortalité : la vie éternelle !
[2:8] Aux autres qui, par esprit de parti, s'opposent à la vérité et se laissent aller à l'iniquité : la colère et l'indignation!
[2:9] Malheur, désespoir sur toute âme d'homme qui fait le mal, sur celle du Juif d'abord, sur celle du païen ensuite!
[2:10] Gloire, honneur et paix à quiconque fait le bien, au Juif d'abord, au païen ensuite!
[2:11] Car Dieu n'a pas égard aux personnes ;
[2:12] tous ceux qui auront péché sans avoir eu de Loi, périront sans avoir eu de Loi, et ceux qui auront péché en ayant eu une Loi, seront jugés par cette Loi.
[2:13] En effet, ce ne sont pas ceux qui entendent lire une Loi qui sont justes aux yeux de Dieu ; mais ceux qui la pratiquent seront déclarés justes.
[2:14] Et quand les païens qui n'ont pas de Loi font naturellement ce que la Loi commande, tout en n'ayant pas de Loi, ils sont eux-mêmes leur propre Loi ;
[2:15] ils montrent que l'oeuvre commandée par la Loi est écrite dans leur coeur, c'est leur conscience qui l'atteste et ce sont leurs pensées qui tantôt les accusent, tantôt même les absolvent.
[2:16] On le verra le jour où Dieu, selon l'Évangile que je prêche, jugera par Jésus-Christ les actions secrètes des hommes.
[2:17] Toi tu te nommes un Juif, tu te reposes sur la Loi, tu es fier de ton Dieu,
[2:18] tu connais sa volonté, instruit par la Loi tu sais, peser le pour et le contre,
[2:19] tu te sens capable d'être un guide pour les aveugles, une lumière pour ceux qui sont dans les ténèbres,
[2:20] un directeur pour les ignorants, un maître pour ceux qui sont encore enfants, car tu as dans la Loi l'expression de la sagesse et de la vérité ;
[2:21] et quand tu instruis ainsi les autres tu ne t'instruis pas toi-même! tu prêches de ne pas voler, et tu voles!
[2:22] tu dis de ne pas commettre d'adultères, et tu en commets! tu as les idoles en abomination, et tu commets des sacrilèges!
[2:23] tu es fier d'avoir une Loi, et tu outrages Dieu en la violant !
[2:24] «Le nom de Dieu, comme dit l'Écriture, est déshonoré par les païens à cause de vous.»
[2:25] La circoncision est utile, sans doute, tant que tu pratiques la Loi ; si tu la violes, tu es comme si tu n'étais pas circoncis.
[2:26] Si l'incirconcis observe les ordonnances de la Loi, tout incirconcis qu'il est, ne sera-t-il pas considéré comme circoncis?
[2:27] Et l'incirconcis de naissance qui observe la Loi ne te jugera-t-il pas, toi, qui la violes, possesseur de la lettre de la Loi et de la circoncision ?
[2:28] On n'est pas Juif par l'extérieur ; la vraie circoncision n'est pas celle qui se voit sur le corps ;
[2:29] mais le vrai Juif c'est celui qui l'est intérieurement, le vrai circoncis l'est dans son coeur, il ne l'est pas à la lettre, il l’est en esprit ; voilà le Juif qui est approuvé sinon des hommes, du moins de Dieu!
[3:1] Quelle est donc la prérogative du Juif, ou quelle est l'utilité de la circoncision?
[3:2] Elle est grande à tous les égards : Il y a d'abord que Dieu a confié aux Juifs ses oracles.
[3:3] Comment donc? s'il en est qui ont manqué de foi, leur infidélité annulera-t-elle la fidélité de Dieu ?
[3:4] C'est impossible, il faut que Dieu soit véridique, Tous les hommes dussent-ils être des menteurs,» comme il est écrit : «Tes paroles doivent être reconnues justes Et tu dois gagner ta cause quand on te juge.»
[3:5] Mais de ce que notre injustice met en relief la justice de Dieu, que conclurons-nous? que Dieu sera injuste en laissant agir sa colère? (je parle là comme font les hommes)
[3:6] c'est impossible ; autrement comment Dieu jugerait-il le monde?
[3:7] Et si mon manque de foi a fait apparaître dans toute sa gloire la véracité de Dieu, pourquoi donc serai-je jugé comme pécheur?
[3:8] et pourquoi (comme nos calomniateurs le répandent et nous accusent de le dire) ne ferions-nous pas le mal, pour qu'il en sorte du bien? Je condamne ceux qui parlent ainsi.
[3:9] Que dire alors? qu'avons-nous à mettre en avant? absolument rien. Nous avons déjà montré que les Juifs comme les Grecs, tous sont sous l'empire du péché,
[3:10] comme il est écrit : «Il n'y a pas de juste, pas un seul ;
[3:11] Personne n'est intelligent, Personne ne cherche Dieu ;
[3:12] Tous se sont fourvoyés et corrompus ensemble ; Il n'y en a pas un qui fasse le bien, pas un seul.
[3:13] Leur gosier est un sépulcre béant ; Leur langue leur sert à tromper ; Le venin de l'aspic est sur leurs lèvres ;
[3:14] Leur bouche est pleine de malédiction et d'amertume ;
[3:15] Ils ont le pied léger pour répandre le sang,
[3:16] La désolation et le malheur sont sur leur chemin ;
[3:17] La voie de la paix, ils l'ignorent ;
[3:18] La crainte de Dieu, ils ne l'ont pas devant les yeux.»
[3:19] Or nous savons que tout ce que dit la Loi, elle le dit à ceux qui sont soumis à la Loi, pour que toute bouche soit fermée, et que le monde entier soit sous le coup du jugement de Dieu.
[3:20] Car les oeuvres de la Loi «Ne justifient devant lui aucune créature ;» la Loi ne donne que la connaissance du péché.
[3:21] Mais maintenant il a été révélé une justice de Dieu, indépendante de la Loi ; la Loi et les Prophètes en parlent.
[3:22] Cette justice qui vient de Dieu par la foi en Jésus-Christ s'adresse à tous les croyants ; et cela sans distinction ;
[3:23] car tous les hommes ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu.
[3:24] Dans sa grâce, ils sont gratuitement justifiés, au moyen de la Rédemption faite par Jésus-Christ.
[3:25] Dieu l'avait destiné à être, par sa mort sanglante, une victime propitiatoire pour ceux qui croiraient,
[3:26] et il a ainsi montré sa justice. (Dans son indulgence il n'a pas tenu compte des péchés antérieurs). Il a, dis-je, montré de nos jours sa justice, pour qu'on sût qu'il est juste et qu'il justifie celui qui a la foi en Jésus.
[3:27] Où est, après cela, le motif de s'enorgueillir? il est exclu. Par quelle institution? celle des oeuvres ; non, mais par celle de la foi.
[3:28] Nous pensons donc que l'homme est justifié par la foi indépendamment des oeuvres de la Loi.
[3:29] Dieu ne serait-il que le Dieu des Juifs? n'est-il pas aussi le Dieu des païens?
[3:30] Oui, des païens aussi, puisqu'il n'y a qu'un Dieu qui justifiera les circoncis par la foi et les incirconcis par la foi.
[3:31] Est-ce que nous annulons donc la Loi par la foi? Nullement. nous la confirmons au contraire.
[4:1] Quel avantage pouvons-nous dire que notre premier père Abraham a obtenu par lui-même?
[4:2] Si ce sont ses oeuvres qui l'ont justifié, il peut être orgueilleux ; mais il ne le peut pas devant Dieu.
[4:3] Que dit l'Écriture : «Abraham eut foi en Dieu, et cela lui fut compté pour justice»
[4:4] Or le salaire de celui qui a fait de bonnes oeuvres n'est pas considéré comme une grâce, mais comme une dette.
[4:5] Quant à celui qui n'a pas fait de bonnes oeuvres, mais qui a foi en Celui qui justifie le pécheur, sa foi lui «est comptée pour justice».
[4:6] David aussi parle du bonheur de celui que Dieu considère comme juste indépendamment de ses oeuvres :
[4:7] «Heureux ceux dont les fautes sont pardonnées Et dont les péchés sont effacés.
[4:8] Heureux celui dont le Seigneur ne porte pas en compte le péché.»
[4:9] Cette béatitude ne s'adresse-t-elle qu'aux circoncis? ne s'applique-t-elle pas aussi aux incirconcis? Quand nous disons pour Abraham que «sa foi lui fut comptée pour justice,»
[4:10] comment lui fut-elle comptée? avant ou après sa circoncision? Ce n'est pas après, c'est avant sa circoncision!
[4:11] Et il a reçu le signe de la circoncision comme le sceau de la justice que sa foi lui avait obtenue quand il n'était pas circoncis ; c'était pour qu'il fût le père de tous les incirconcis qui auraient la foi, et qu'elle leur fût comptée pour justice.
[4:12] Il devait être aussi le père des circoncis qui non seulement le seraient, mais qui marcheraient sur ses traces, en ayant la foi qu'il avait, lui, notre père Abraham, avant sa circoncision.
[4:13] En effet, ce n'est pas une Loi qui a assuré à Abraham et à ses descendants la possession du monde, c'est la justice que procure la foi.
[4:14] Si c'est une Loi qui assure cette possession, alors la foi est inutile et la promesse est annulée.
[4:15] (La Loi ne produit que la colère, et là où il n'y a pas de Loi, il n'y a pas non plus de violation.)
[4:16] Voici pourquoi la possession vient par la foi : c'est pour qu'elle soit l'effet d'une grâce, et que la promesse soit assurée à tous les descendants, non pas seulement à ceux qui ont reçu la Loi, mais à ceux qui ont eu la foi d'Abraham ; il est notre père à tous
[4:17] (ainsi que cela est écrit : «Je t'ai rendu père de plusieurs peuples»), il l'est devant le Dieu en qui il a cru, qui rend la vie aux morts et qui appelle à l'existence ce qui n'existe pas.
[4:18] Contre toute espérance, il a été plein d'espérance, il a cru et il est devenu «le père de plusieurs peuples» (selon cette parole : «Telle sera ta postérité»).
[4:19] Sa foi n'a pas faibli ; il n'a pas fait attention à son extrême vieillesse (il était presque centenaire) ni à l'âge trop avancé de Sarra.
[4:20] Il ne douta pas de la promesse de Dieu ; il ne fut pas incrédule ; au contraire, fortifié par sa foi, il donna gloire à Dieu,
[4:21] convaincu que Celui qui a promis est assez puissant pour remplir sa promesse.
[4:22] Voilà pourquoi «elle lui fut comptée pour justice».
[4:23] Or ce n'est pas pour lui seul que ce mot est écrit : «cela lui fut compté»,
[4:24] c'est aussi pour nous ; cela doit nous être «compté» également à nous qui croyons en celui qui a ressuscité des morts notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ,
[4:25] lui qui «a été livré à cause de nos péchés» et a été ressuscité à cause de notre justification.
[5:1] Étant ainsi justifiés par la foi, soyons en paix avec Dieu par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ,
[5:2] qui, de plus, nous a donné, par notre foi, accès à cette grâce que nous possédons ; aussi mettons-nous notre orgueil à espérer la gloire de Dieu.
[5:3] Bien plus, nous mettons encore notre orgueil dans les afflictions sachant que l'affliction produit la patience,
[5:4] que par la patience nous supportons l'épreuve, que de l'épreuve naît l'espérance.
[5:5] Or l'espérance ne trompe pas, parce que l'Esprit saint, reçu par nous, fait abonder l'amour de Dieu dans nos coeurs.
[5:6] En effet, nous étions encore faibles, et Christ, au temps marqué, est mort pour des impies.
[5:7] On donnerait difficilement sa vie pour un juste (oui, il pourrait arriver que l'on consentît à mourir pour un homme de bien),
[5:8] mais la preuve de son amour pour nous Dieu l'a donnée, en ce que Christ est mort pour nous quand nous étions encore pécheurs.
[5:9] A plus forte raison, serons-nous sauvés de la colère par celui dans le sang duquel nous avons été justifiés.
[5:10] En effet, si, quand nous étions ennemis, Dieu nous a réconciliés par la mort de son Fils, à plus forte raison, étant réconciliés, serons-nous sauvés par sa vie.
[5:11] Bien plus, nous avons encore sujet de mettre notre orgueil en Dieu par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui nous a maintenant obtenu la réconciliation.
[5:12] Par conséquent, de même que par un seul homme le péché est entré dans le monde et par le péché la mort, et que la mort s'est ainsi étendue à tous les hommes, parce que tous ont péché.
[5:13] Avant la Loi, le péché était dans le monde ; or, en l'absence de Loi, le péché n'est pas imputé
[5:14] et cependant la mort a exercé son règne depuis Adam jusqu'à Moïse, même sur ceux qui n'avaient point péché dans les mêmes conditions qu'Adam. Adam était l'image de celui qui devait venir.
[5:15] Toutefois, il n'en est pas de même de la faute d'une part et du don de la grâce de l'autre. Car si la faute d'un seul homme a entraîné la mort de beaucoup, à plus forte raison la grâce de Dieu et le don de cette grâce, le don d'un seul homme, Jésus-Christ, en ont enrichi beaucoup.
[5:16] Il n'en est pas de même non plus des conséquences du premier péché d'une part et du don de l'autre ; car la sentence qui suivit une faute unique a entraîné une condamnation, et le don de la grâce qui suivit des fautes nombreuses a entraîné un acquittement.
[5:17] Si, en effet, à la suite d'une seule faute et par le fait d'un seul homme, la mort a exercé son règne, à bien plus forte raison ceux qui reçoivent la grâce immense de Dieu et le don de la justice participeront-ils au Royaume et à la vie par le fait d'un seul homme aussi, Jésus-Christ.
[5:18] Ainsi donc, de même qu'une seule faute a entraîné la condamnation de tous les hommes, de même un seul acte de justice a entraîné pour tous les hommes la justification qui donne la vie ;
[5:19] et de même que la désobéissance d'un seul homme en a rendu pécheurs un grand nombre, de même l'obéissance d'un seul en rendra justes un grand nombre.
[5:20] Quant à la Loi, elle est intervenue pour multiplier les fautes, mais là où le péché a abondé, la grâce a surabondé,
[5:21] et alors, comme le péché a régné par la mort, de même aussi la grâce régnera par la justice pour la vie éternelle par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[6:1] Et maintenant comment conclure? En disant que nous persisterons à pécher pour faire abonder la grâce?
[6:2] Non, certes. Nous qui sommes morts au péché, comment y vivrions-nous encore?
[6:3] Ne savez-vous pas que nous tous qui avons été baptisés en Jésus-Christ, c'est en sa mort que nous l'avons été? Nous avons été ensevelis avec lui par le baptême en sa mort,
[6:4] et de même que Christ a été ressuscité des morts par la gloire du Père, de même nous devons vivre d'une vie nouvelle.
[6:5] Si nous sommes étroitement unis à lui par une mort semblable à la sienne, nous le serons aussi par une même résurrection ;
[6:6] nous savons que notre vieil homme a été crucifié avec lui, afin que ce corps de péché soit détruit, et que nous ne soyons plus esclaves du péché.
[6:7] Celui qui est mort est déclaré juste et est délivré du péché.
[6:8] Si nous sommes morts avec le Christ, nous croyons que nous vivrons aussi avec lui,
[6:9] car nous savons que Christ ressuscité des morts ne meurt plus ; la mort n'a plus de pouvoir sur lui.
[6:10] Il est mort, en effet, et c'est à cause du péché qu'il est mort une fois pour toutes ; puis il est revenu à la vie, et c'est pour Dieu qu'il vit.
[6:11] De même considérez-vous aussi comme morts au péché et comme vivants pour Dieu en Jésus-Christ.
[6:12] Que le péché ne règne donc pas dans votre corps mortel, n'obéissez pas à ses passions ;
[6:13] ne livrez pas vos membres au péché ; n'en faites pas les instruments du vice, mais donnez-vous à Dieu, vous qui étiez morts et qui vivez, consacrez vos membres à Dieu, faites-en des instruments de justice.
[6:14] Le péché n'aura plus de pouvoir sur vous, car vous n'êtes pas sous la Loi, mais sous la grâce.
[6:15] Mais quoi? Devons-nous pécher parce que nous ne sommes pas sous la Loi, mais sous la grâce? Oh ! nullement.
[6:16] Ne savez-vous pas que si vous vous asservissez à quelqu'un et lui obéissez, vous devenez ses esclaves? soit du péché qui mène à la mort, soit de la soumission qui mène à la justice.
[6:17] Grâces soient rendues à Dieu, de ce qu'autrefois, esclaves du péché, vous vous êtes soumis de coeur au type de doctrine qui vous a été offert!
[6:18] Mais du moment que vous avez été délivrés du péché, vous êtes devenus esclaves de la justice (j'emploie cette expression usuelle : esclaves, à cause de votre faiblesse naturelle) ;
[6:19] de même, veux-je dire, que vous avez mis vos membres au service de l'impureté et de l'iniquité pour violer la Loi, de même vous devez mettre maintenant vos membres au service de la justice pour vous sanctifier.
[6:20] Lorsque vous étiez esclaves du péché, vous étiez libres à l'égard de la justice.
[6:21] Quel avantage en retiriez-vous? Un avantage qui vous fait honte aujourd'hui ; cela vous menait à la mort.
[6:22] Mais maintenant, délivrés du péché et esclaves de Dieu, l'avantage que vous retirez, c'est la sanctification qui mène à la vie éternelle.
[6:23] Le salaire du péché, c'est la mort ; mais le don de la grâce de Dieu, c'est la vie éternelle en Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[7:1] Ignorez-vous, frères (je parle à des personnes Connaissant la Loi), que celle-ci tient l'homme en son pouvoir aussi longtemps qu'il est en vie?
[7:2] La femme mariée, par exemple, est liée par une loi à son mari s'il est vivant ; si son mari vient à mourir, le lien légal qui l'attachait à lui est rompu.
[7:3] Ainsi elle méritera le nom d'adultère si, du vivant de son mari, elle se donne à un autre ; mais, après la mort de son mari, elle est affranchie de toute obligation légale, il n'y a plus d'adultère si elle se donne à un autre.
[7:4] Il en est de même de nous, mes frères ; nous avons été mis à mort relativement à la Loi par le moyen du corps du Christ pour appartenir à un autre, à celui qui est ressuscité des morts, afin que nous portions des fruits pour Dieu.
[7:5] Car lorsque nous vivions encore selon la chair, les passions coupables, excitées par la Loi, exerçaient leur activité dans les membres de notre corps, et nous portions des fruits pour la mort.
[7:6] Mais maintenant le lien légal a été rompu ; nous sommes morts à cette Loi qui nous retenait captifs, pour que nous servions Dieu dans la nouveauté de l'Esprit et non dans la vétusté de la lettre.
[7:7] Eh bien, comment conclure? en disant que la Loi c'est le péché? Non certes, mais que par la Loi seule je connais le péché. Par exemple, je n'aurais rien su de la convoitise, si la Loi n'avait dit: «Tu ne convoiteras pas !»
[7:8] et c'est le péché qui, saisissant l'occasion de ce commandement, a fait naître en moi toutes sortes de convoitises, car sans Loi le péché n'existe pas.
[7:9] Je vivais sans Loi autrefois, mais le commandement me fut donné, le péché vint à naître, et moi je mourus.
[7:10] Et il est arrivé ceci : le commandement qui devait me mener à la vie, ce commandement-là même m'a conduit à la mort.
[7:11] Oui, le péché a saisi l'occasion du commandement, m'a séduit et m'a tué par ce commandement même.
[7:12] Quant à la Loi, elle est sainte, et le commandement lui-même est saint, juste et bon.
[7:13] Mais alors c'est une bonne chose qui est cause de ma mort? Nullement, c'est le péché ; il s'est servi d'une bonne chose pour m'apporter la mort, et alors il a montré ce qu'il était, il est apparu on ne peut plus coupable, ce péché qui se sert ainsi du commandement.
[7:14] Oui, nous savons que la Loi elle-même est spirituelle ; mais c'est moi qui suis charnel, vendu et asservi au péché.
[7:15] Je ne sais pas même ce que je fais : car je ne fais pas ce que je veux ; au contraire, ce que je déteste, voilà ce que je fais.
[7:16] Et alors si je fais ce que je ne veux pas, je rends témoignage à la Loi, je la reconnais bonne,
[7:17] et, dans ce cas, ce n'est plus moi qui agis, c'est le péché qui habite en moi.
[7:18] Je sais, en effet, qu'en moi, je veux dire en ma chair, il n'habite rien de bon : vouloir le bien est, il est vrai, à ma portée, mais l'accomplir, non.
[7:19] Car je ne fais pas le bien que je veux, mais le mal que je ne veux pas, voilà ce que je fais.
[7:20] Eh bien, si je fais ce que je ne veux pas, ce n'est plus moi qui agis, mais le péché qui habite en moi.
[7:21] Voici donc la situation où je me trouve : quand, ma volonté est de faire le bien, c'est le mal qui est là.
[7:22] Mon être intérieure adhère avec joie à la Loi de Dieu ;
[7:23] mais je découvre dans mes membres une autre loi en guerre avec la loi de ma raison et qui m'asservit à la loi du péché qui est dans mes membres.
[7:24] Malheureux que je suis ! qui me délivrera de ce corps de mort !
[7:25] Grâces soient à Dieu par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur! Ainsi je me soumets, moi-même, par la raison, à la Loi de Dieu, mais, par la chair, je suis soumis à la loi du péché.
[8:1] Il n'y a donc plus maintenant de condamnation pour ceux qui sont en Jésus-Christ,
[8:2] parce que la Loi de l'Esprit de vie nous a affranchis, en Jésus-Christ, de la loi du péché et de la mort.
[8:3] Ce qui était impossible à la Loi, la chair lui ôtant toute force, Dieu l'a fait en envoyant son propre Fils, à cause du péché, prendre une chair de péché semblable à la nôtre ; il a condamné le péché dans la chair même,
[8:4] afin que le décret de la Loi s'accomplît en nous, en ceux qui ne marchent pas selon la chair, mais selon l'Esprit.
[8:5] Ceux qui sont selon la chair s'attachent à ce qui est de la chair ; ceux qui sont selon l'Esprit, à ce qui est de l'Esprit ;
[8:6] or l'attachement pour la chair mène à la mort, l'attachement pour l'Esprit, à la vie et au salut,
[8:7] parce que l'attachement pour la chair est une inimitié contre Dieu, puisqu'il ne se soumet pas à la Loi de Dieu (et même il ne le peut pas).
[8:8] Ceux qui sont dans la chair ne peuvent plaire à Dieu ;
[8:9] mais vous, vous n'êtes pas dans la chair, mais dans l'Esprit, si toutefois l'Esprit de Dieu habite en vous. — Si quelqu'un n'a pas l'Esprit de Christ, il ne lui appartient pas. —
[8:10] Si Christ est en vous, votre corps est, il est vrai, soumis à la mort à cause du péché, mais votre esprit l'est à la vie à cause de la justice.
[8:11] Si l'Esprit de Celui qui a ressuscité Jésus des morts habite en vous, lui qui a ressuscité Jésus des morts donnera aussi la vie à vos corps mortels au moyen de son Esprit qui demeure en vous.
[8:12] Ainsi, mes frères, nous sommes obligés non envers la chair pour vivre selon la chair...
[8:13] Si vous vivez selon la chair, vous devez vous attendre à mourir. Si, au contraire, vous tuez par l'Esprit l'activité du corps, vous vivrez,
[8:14] parce que tous ceux qui se laissent conduire par l'Esprit de Dieu, sont fils de Dieu,
[8:15] et que vous n'avez point reçu un esprit de servitude pour craindre encore, mais que vous avez reçu un Esprit d'adoption, par lequel nous nous écrions : Abba! Père !
[8:16] Cet Esprit atteste lui-même à notre esprit que nous sommes enfants de Dieu,
[8:17] et si nous sommes enfants, nous sommes aussi héritiers ; héritiers de Dieu, cohéritiers de Christ, si nous participons à ses souffrances pour participer aussi à sa gloire.
[8:18] J'estime, en effet, que les souffrances d'à présent ne sont rien en comparaison de la gloire qui doit un jour se révéler pour nous.
[8:19] Car la création attend avec impatience cette révélation des fils de Dieu,
[8:20] parce que ce n'est pas de son propre gré qu'elle a été assujettie à la fragilité ; elle l'a été au gré de celui qui l'a assujettie,
[8:21] et elle espère être affranchie, elle aussi, de la servitude de la corruption et passer à la glorieuse liberté des enfants de Dieu.
[8:22] Nous savons, en effet, que jusqu'à présent la création tout entière gémit, elle est dans les angoisses de l'enfantement ;
[8:23] et ce n'est pas elle seulement, c'est nous aussi qui avons reçu comme prémices l'Esprit et qui gémissons en nous-mêmes, attendant l'adoption, c'est-à-dire la délivrance de notre corps.
[8:24] Car c'est en espérance que nous sommes sauvés ; or une espérance dont on voit l'objet n'est plus une espérance ; ce qu'on voit, pourquoi l'espérer encore?
[8:25] Mais si nous espérons ce que nous ne voyons pas, c'est que nous attendons avec persévérance.
[8:26] De plus, l'Esprit supplée aussi à notre faiblesse ; nous ne savons pas, en effet, ce qu'il faut demander dans nos prières, mais l'Esprit lui-même intercède pour nous par des soupirs et sans paroles.
[8:27] Or, Celui qui scrute les coeurs connaît les désirs de l'Esprit, parce que celui-ci intercède pour les fidèles selon les vues de Dieu ;
[8:28] et nous savons que tout contribue au bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu, de ceux qui sont élus d'après son décret ;
[8:29] nous savons que ceux qu'il a connus d'avance, ont été aussi prédestinés par lui à reproduire l'image de son Fils qui sera ainsi l'aîné de plusieurs frères ;
[8:30] et ceux qu'il a prédestinés, il les a aussi appelés ; ceux qu'il a appelés, il les a aussi justifiés ; ceux qu'il a justifiés il les a aussi glorifiés.
[8:31] Que dire de plus? Si Dieu est pour nous, qui sera contre nous?
[8:32] Lui qui n'a pas épargné son propre Fils, mais l'a livré à la mort pour nous tous, comment ne nous donnerait-il pas toutes choses avec lui?
[8:33] Qui osera accuser les élus de Dieu? Serait-ce Dieu qui les «justifie?»
[8:34] «Qui les condamnera?» Serait-ce Jésus-Christ, qui est mort? plus encore, qui est ressuscité, qui est assis à la droite de Dieu, qui intercède pour nous ?
[8:35] Qui nous arrachera à l'amour du Christ? Sera-ce la tribulation? ou l'angoisse? ou la persécution? ou la faim? ou le dénuement ? ou les périls? ou le glaive?
[8:36] «A cause de toi», comme dit l'Écriture, «nous sommes mis à mort tout le long du jour ; On nous considère comme des brebis pour la boucherie»,
[8:37] Mais, dans tous ces combats, nous restons plus que vainqueurs, grâce à Celui qui nous a aimés!
[8:38] Oui, je suis certain que ni la mort ni la vie, ni les anges ni les dominations, ni le présent ni l'avenir,
[8:39] ni les puissances, ni les forces d'en haut ni les forces d'en bas, ni une création quelconque, ne pourra nous arracher à l'amour de Dieu en Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur !
[9:1] Je parle en vérité, devant Christ, je ne mens point (ma conscience éclairée par l'Esprit saint me l'atteste)
[9:2] en disant que j'éprouve une grande tristesse, une continuelle peine de coeur
[9:3] et que je voudrais être anathème et séparé du Christ pour mes frères, pour ceux de ma race et de mon sang,
[9:4] je parle des Israélites qui ont eu le privilège de l'adoption, de la gloire promise, des alliances, de la législature, du vrai culte, des promesses,
[9:5] qui ont eu les patriarches et dont est sorti, selon la chair, le Christ qui est au-dessus de tous! (Dieu en soit éternellement béni! Amen.)
[9:6] Je ne veux cependant pas dire que Dieu ait manqué à ses promesses. Pour être issu d'Israël, on n'est pas toujours vrai Israélite ;
[9:7] pour être de la race d'Abraham, on n'est pas toujours de ses vrais enfants, mais : «C'est d'après Isaac que ta race sera nommée.»
[9:8] Cela signifie que les enfants par le sang ne sont pas nécessairement les enfants de Dieu, mais que ce sont les enfants par la promesse qui comptent comme la vraie race ;
[9:9] car c'est d'une promesse qu'il est question dans ce passage : «Vers ce temps-là je viendrai et Sarra aura un fils» ;
[9:10] et ce n'est pas tout, il y a aussi Rébecca qui fut enceinte des oeuvres d'un seul homme, Isaac, notre père ;
[9:11] eh bien, avant que ses jumeaux fussent nés, avant il, qu'ils eussent fait ni bien, ni mal, — pour que fut bien établi le décret de Dieu basé sur un choix qui ne dépend pas des oeuvres, mais uniquement de Celui qui appelle,
[9:12] — Rébecca apprit que «l'aîné servirait le plus jeune»,
[9:13] car il est écrit: «J'ai aimé Jacob Et j'ai haï Ésaü.»
[9:14] Que faut-il en conclure? qu'il y a de l'injustice en Dieu? c'est impossible,
[9:15] puisqu'il dit à Moïse : «J'aurai pitié de celui dont il me plaira d'avoir pitié et j'aurai compassion de celui dont il me plaira d'avoir compassion.»
[9:16] Ainsi rien ne sert de vouloir et de s'agiter, c'est Dieu qui fait miséricorde.
[9:17] En effet, l'Écriture dit à Pharaon : «Voici pourquoi je t'ai suscité : Pour montrer en toi ma puissance et proclamer mon nom sur toute la terre.»
[9:18] Ainsi, il a pitié de qui il veut, il endurcit qui il veut.
[9:19] Tu me diras alors : — pourquoi donc se plaint-il encore? qui donc peut résister à sa volonté? —
[9:20] Mais toi, ô homme, qui es-tu donc pour discuter avec Dieu? Est-ce que le vase d'argile dit au potier : «Pourquoi m'as-tu fait ainsi ?»
[9:21] Est-ce que le potier n'a pas le droit avec la même masse de terre de faire deux vases l'un pour un noble usage, l'autre pour un usage vulgaire?
[9:22] Et s'il plaît à Dieu de montrer sa colère et de faire connaître sa puissance! Et s'il a eu la grande patience de supporter des vases de colère fabriqués pour la perdition!
[9:23] Et si cela fait ressortir les richesses de sa gloire à l'égard des vases de miséricorde préparés d'avance pour la gloire!
[9:24] Je parle ici de nous qu'il a appelés et parmi les Juifs et même parmi les païens.
[9:25] C'est ce qu'il dit dans Osée : «J'appellerai mon peuple celui qui n'était pas mon peuple, Et bien aimée celle qui n'était pas bien aimée.
[9:26] Et là où on leur disait : Vous n'êtes pas mon peuple, On les appellera fils du Dieu vivant.»
[9:27] Ésaïe s'écrie aussi à propos d'Israël : «Quand le nombre des fils d'Israël serait comme le sable de la mer, Un petit reste seulement sera sauvé »,
[9:28] Car le Seigneur achèvera promptement d'exécuter sa sentence sur la terre ;
[9:29] Et comme l'avait déjà dit Ésaïe : «Si le Seigneur des armées ne nous avait laissé une postérité, Nous serions devenus comme Sodome, Nous aurions été semblables à Gomorrhe.»
[9:30] Que faut-il en conclure? que les païens qui ne cherchaient pas la justice ont obtenu la justice, celle qui vient de la foi ;
[9:31] et les Israélites qui cherchaient dans la Loi un principe de justice n'y sont pas arrivés ;
[9:32] pourquoi donc? parce qu'ils ne le cherchaient pas par la foi, mais comme devant venir des oeuvres de la Loi ; ils se sont heurtés à «la pierre d'achoppement»,
[9:33] suivant ce mot de l'Écriture : «Voici je place en Sion une pierre d'achoppement, Une pierre qui fait tomber ; Mais celui qui aura confiance en elle ne sera pas déçu.»
[10:1] Frères, le désir de mon coeur et la prière que j'adresse à Dieu pour eux, c'est qu'ils soient sauvés.
[10:2] Je leur rends le témoignage qu'ils ont du zèle pour Dieu, mais c'est un zèle ignorant,
[10:3] car c'est parce qu'ils ont ignoré la justice de Dieu et qu'ils ont voulu établir leur propre justice qu'ils ne se sont pas soumis à la justice de Dieu.
[10:4] En effet, la fin de la Loi c'est Christ donnant la justice à, quiconque a foi en lui.
[10:5] Voici comment Moïse déliait la justice obtenue par la Loi : «L'homme qui fera ces choses aura la vie par elles.»
[10:6] Mais la justice obtenue par la foi parle ainsi : «Ne dis pas en ton coeur : Qui montera au ciel» (le dire serait vouloir en faire descendre Christ),
[10:7] ou : «Qui descendra dans l'abîme?» (le dire serait vouloir faire remonter Christ de chez les morts ) ;
[10:8] au contraire, que dit-elle : «Tout près de toi est la parole, dans ta bouche et dans ton coeur»
[10:9] (il s'agit ici de la parole de la foi que nous prêchons) ; et alors si tu confesses de ta bouche le Seigneur Jésus et si tu crois dans ton coeur que Dieu l'a ressuscité des morts, tu seras sauvé ;
[10:10] parce que la foi du coeur mène à la justice, la confession de la bouche mène au salut.
[10:11] L'Écriture dit en effet : «Quiconque aura foi en lui ne sera pas déçu.»
[10:12] Ainsi, point de différence entre le Juif et le Grec : tous ont un seul et même Seigneur, riche pour tous ceux qui l'invoquent, car :
[10:13] «Quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé.»
[10:14] Mais comment l'invoqueront-ils s'ils n'ont pas cru en lui? comment croiront-ils s'ils n'en ont pas entendu parler? Comment en entendront-ils parler si personne ne le leur prêche?
[10:15] comment ira-t-on le leur prêcher, s'il n'y a point d'envoyés? Aussi est-il écrit : «Qu'ils sont beaux... Les pieds de ceux qui annoncent de bonnes nouvelles !»
[10:16] Mais ils n'ont pas tous voulu écouter la Bonne Nouvelle ; aussi Ésaïe dit-il :«Seigneur, qui a ajouté foi à ce que nous avons fait entendre?».
[10:17] Donc, la foi se produit après qu'on a entendu, et l'on entend quand la parole de Christ est prêchée.
[10:18] Mais je me dis : Peut-être n'ont-ils pas entendu prêcher? eh bien, c'est tout le contraire: «Dans la terre entière a retenti leur voix, Et jusqu'au bout du monde leurs paroles.»
[10:19] Je me dis encore : Peut-être Israël n'a-t-il pas compris? Eh bien ! Moïse a dit le premier : «Je vous rendrai jaloux d'un peuple de rien ; Contre un peuple inintelligent je vous mettrai en colère.»
[10:20] Ésaïe va plus loin encore et il dit : «Ils m'ont trouvé ceux qui ne me cherchaient pas ; Ils m'ont découvert ceux qui ne s'informaient pas de moi »,
[10:21] tandis qu'en parlant d'Israël il dit : «Tout le long du jour j'ai tendu les bras A un peuple désobéissant et récalcitrant.»
[11:1] Je demande maintenant si «Dieu a rejeté son peuple ?» Non certainement ; moi-même suis un Israélite, descendant d'Abraham, de la tribu de Benjamin.
[11:2] «Dieu n'a pas rejeté le peuple» qu’il a autrefois préféré. Ne savez-vous pas ce que dit l'Écriture dans l'histoire d'Élie, et comme celui-ci se plaint à Dieu d'Israël :
[11:3] «Seigneur, ils ont tué tes prophètes, renversé tes autels, moi seul ai survécu et ils en veulent à ma vie!»
[11:4] Mais que lui dit l'oracle : «Je me suis réservé sept mille hommes qui n'ont pas fléchi le genou devant Baal»
[11:5] Eh bien! il y a de même aujourd'hui une réserve par suite de l'élection qui est une grâce.
[11:6] Mais, si elle est une grâce, elle n'est donc pas le fruit des oeuvres, autrement la grâce ne serait plus une grâce.
[11:7] Qu'est-ce à dire? Israël n'a pas obtenu ce qu'il cherche, les élus l'ont obtenu ; et le reste s'est endurci
[11:8] selon qu'il est écrit : «Dieu leur a donné un esprit d'engourdissement, Des yeux pour ne pas voir, Des oreilles pour ne pas entendre jusqu'à aujourd'hui,»
[11:9] et David dit : «Que leur table leur soit un filet, un piège, Une trappe, un châtiment ;
[11:10] Que leurs yeux soient obscurcis pour ne pas voir, Que leur dos soit à jamais courbé.»
[11:11] Je demande alors si c'est pour tomber qu'ils ont ainsi bronché? Non certainement, mais leur faute a eu pour résultat l'annonce du salut aux païens de manière à provoquer leur émulation.
[11:12] Si, par leur faute, ils ont enrichi le monde, si, par un moment de retard, ils ont enrichi les païens, que sera leur entrée en masse dans l'Église?
[11:13] C'est à vous, païens, que je parle : tout en étant apôtre des païens je couvre mon ministère de gloire
[11:14] en m'efforçant de provoquer l'émulation de ceux de ma race et d'en sauver quelques-uns.
[11:15] Car, si leur rejet a eu pour résultat la réconciliation du monde, que sera leur admission ? ce sera vraiment une résurrection.
[11:16] Si les prémices sont saintes, toute la masse l'est aussi ; si la racine est sainte, les rameaux le sont aussi.
[11:17] Si quelques rameaux ont été retranchés, si toi, olivier sauvage, as été greffé à leur place, si tu as été mis en communication avec la racine et la sève de l'olivier,
[11:18] garde-toi bien de t'enorgueillir aux dépens des branches coupées. Si tu t'enorgueillis, souviens-toi que ce n'est pas toi qui portes la racine, c'est la racine qui te porte.
[11:19] — Mais les rameaux, diras-tu, ont été coupés pour que je sois greffé.
[11:20] — D'accord, ils ont été coupés faute de foi ; toi tu restes-là par ta foi ; garde-toi de te vanter, tremble au contraire ;
[11:21] si Dieu n'a pas épargné les rameaux naturels, il pourrait ne pas t'épargner non plus.
[11:22] Remarque donc et la bonté et la sévérité de Dieu : sévérité pour ceux qui sont tombés, bonté pour toi, si toutefois tu te maintiens dans cette bonté, autrement toi aussi tu seras retranché ;
[11:23] et quant à eux, s'ils ne persistent pas dans leur incrédulité, ils seront greffés ;
[11:24] Dieu a bien le pouvoir de les greffer de nouveau, car si toi, tu as été coupé sur un olivier sauvage de sa nature et as été greffé, contrairement à ta nature, sur l'olivier franc, à plus forte raison, eux, qui appartiennent à l'olivier franc de sa nature, pourront être greffés sur leur propre tronc.
[11:25] Pour que vous ne preniez pas de vous-mêmes une trop haute opinion, frères, je ne veux pas vous laisser ignorer une chose restée jusqu'ici secrète : l'aveuglement d'une partie d'Israël durera jusqu'à ce que la totalité des païens soit entrée dans l'Église
[11:26] et, après cela, tout Israël sera sauvé, comme il est écrit : «De Sion viendra le Libérateur Et il éloignera de Jacob l'impiété.
[11:27] Telle est l'alliance que je conclurai avec eux, Quand j'effarerai leurs péchés.»
[11:28] A regarder à l'Évangile, ils sont ennemis de Dieu à cause de vous, à regarder à l'élection ils sont des bien-aimés à cause de leurs pères.
[11:29] Dieu ne se repent jamais ni des grâces qu'il accorde ni de l'appel qu'il adresse.
[11:30] De même que vous autrefois vous désobéissiez à Dieu et que maintenant vous avez obtenu miséricorde par suite de leur désobéissance,
[11:31] eux de même ont maintenant désobéi à cause de la miséricorde qui vous est accordée et afin de l'obtenir maintenant à leur tour.
[11:32] Car Dieu a enveloppé tous les hommes dans la désobéissance pour leur faire à tous miséricorde.
[11:33] O profondeur de la richesse, de la sagesse et de la science de Dieu! Que ses jugements sont insondables! que ses voies sont impénétrables!
[11:34] car : «Qui a connu la pensée du Seigneur ; De qui a-t-il pris conseil?»
[11:35] et encore : De qui est-il l'obligé? Et qui doit recevoir de lui en retour?»
[11:36] Tout vient de lui ! Tout est par lui ! Tout est pour lui ! Gloire à lui dans l'éternité ! Amen.
[12:1] Je vous exhorte donc, frères, au nom du Dieu des compassions, à lui offrir vos personnes en sacrifice vivant, saint, acceptable ; ce serait de votre part un culte raisonnable.
[12:2] Ne suivez pas les errements de notre siècle ; au contraire, que votre esprit se transforme en se renouvelant, de manière à bien vous pénétrer de ce qu'est la volonté de Dieu : volonté qui est bonne, acceptable, parfaite.
[12:3] Ainsi je vous dis à tous, m'autorisant de la grâce qui m'a été accordée, de ne pas vous exagérer votre valeur, mais de rester dans les limites d'une juste appréciation, chacun selon la mesure de foi que Dieu lui a départie ;
[12:4] car de même que notre corps, qui est un, a plusieurs membres et que tous les membres n'ont pas la même fonction,
[12:5] de même, tous, tant que nous sommes, nous ne faisons qu'un seul corps en Christ, et nous sommes tous membres les uns des autres,
[12:6] possédant des dons divers chacun selon la grâce qui lui a été accordée ; l'un a le don de prophétie, en proportion de sa foi ;
[12:7] l'autre a, dans son ministère, le don du diaconat ; ici c'est un docteur qui a le don de l'enseignement ;
[12:8] là un prédicateur qui a le don de la parole ; le bienfaiteur doit donner avec générosité ; le supérieur, présider avec zèle ; celui qui est chargé des oeuvres de miséricorde, remplir ses fonctions avec joie.
[12:9] Que votre amour soit sans hypocrisie. Ayez horreur du mal ; soyez fermement attachés au bien.
[12:10] Comme des frères, soyez pleins d'affection les uns pour les autres ; estimez-vous ; ayez des prévenances réciproques.
[12:11] Ne ralentissez pas votre zèle, ayez de l'ardeur d'âme, mettez-vous au service du Seigneur.
[12:12] Soyez joyeux dans l'espérance, patients dans l'affliction, persévérants dans la prière.
[12:13] Subvenez aux besoins des fidèles. Exercez l'hospitalité avec empressement.
[12:14] Bénissez vos persécuteurs, oui, bénissez, ne maudissez pas.
[12:15] Soyez heureux avec les heureux, pleurez avec ceux qui pleurent.
[12:16] Vivez ensemble en bonne intelligence. Gardez-vous de l'orgueil ; marchez avec ceux qui sont humbles.
[12:17] «Ne vous croyez pas meilleurs que vous ne l'êtes.» Ne rendez à personne le mal pour le mal. «Intéressez-vous à ce qui est bien aux yeux de tous les hommes.»
[12:18] Autant que possible et, dans la mesure où cela dépend de vous, vivez en paix avec tout le monde.
[12:19] Ne vous vengez pas vous-mêmes, mes bien aimés ; laissez faire la colère dont il est écrit : «La vengeance est à moi, c'est moi qui rétribuerai, dit le Seigneur.»
[12:20] Ainsi donc : «Si ton ennemi a faim donne-lui à manger, S'il a soif donne-lui à boire ; En faisant cela tu entasseras sur sa tête des charbons ardents.»
[12:21] Ne te laisse pas vaincre par le mal, mais sache vaincre le mal par le bien.
[13:1] Que tout le monde se soumette aux puissances régnantes ; car il n'y a pas de puissance qui ne vienne de Dieu ; les puissances qui existent sont instituées par Dieu ;
[13:2] et, de la sorte, celui qui fait de l'opposition aux puissances résiste à l'ordre établi par Dieu, et ceux qui résistent ainsi s'attirent un jugement sévère.
[13:3] En effet, ceux qui gouvernent ne sont pas à redouter pour les bonnes actions, mais pour les mauvaises. Veux-tu ne pas avoir à redouter l'autorité? Fais le bien et tu recevras ses éloges.
[13:4] Car elle est au service de Dieu pour toi, pour ton bien ; mais si tu fais le mal, tremble, car ce n'est pas pour rien qu'elle porte l'épée ; elle est au service de Dieu pour le venger et montrer sa colère à ceux qui font le mal.
[13:5] Il faut donc se soumettre, non seulement par crainte de cette colère, mais par devoir de conscience.
[13:6] Voilà encore pourquoi vous avez des impôts à payer ; en effet, ceux qui gouvernent sont des fonctionnaires de Dieu employés particulièrement à remplir l'office qu'il leur a confié.
[13:7] Donnez donc à chacun ce qui lui est dû : à qui l'impôt, l'impôt ; à qui la redevance, la redevance ; à qui le respect, le respect ; à qui l'honneur, l'honneur.
[13:8] Ne contractez de dettes envers personne, sauf la dette de l'amour mutuel. En effet, celui qui aime les autres a accompli la Loi,
[13:9] car les commandements : «Tu ne seras point adultère, tu ne seras point meurtrier, tu ne seras point voleur, tu ne convoiteras point» ou n'importe quel autre, se résument d'un seul mot, celui-ci : «Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même.»
[13:10] L'amour ne fait point de mal au prochain ; l'amour est donc l'accomplissement de la Loi.
[13:11] Je dis cela, parce que vous savez dans quel temps nous vivons! vous savez que l'heure est venue de nous réveiller du sommeil! car le salut est maintenant plus proche de nous que lorsque nous sommes devenus croyants.
[13:12] La nuit s'avance ; le jour approche ; laissons donc là les oeuvres de ténèbres et revêtons les armes de la lumière.
[13:13] Marchons honnêtement comme on marche en plein jour ; point d'orgies, point d'excès, point d'impuretés, point de débauches, point de disputes, point de jalousies ;
[13:14] revêtez, au contraire, le Seigneur Jésus-Christ, et ne vous préoccupez pas de la chair pour ne pas en réveiller les passions.
[14:1] Accueillez celui dont les convictions sont mal affermies, sans discuter ses opinions.
[14:2] Celui-ci a des convictions qui lui permettent de manger de tout ; celui-là, mal affermi, ne mange que des légumes.
[14:3] Eh bien, celui qui mange de tout ne doit pas mépriser celui qui ne mange pas de tout, et celui qui ne mange pas de tout juger celui qui mange de tout, car Dieu l'a aussi accueilli.
[14:4] Qui es-tu toi, pour juger le serviteur d'autrui? s'il marche droit, s'il bronche, c'est l'affaire de son maître ; mais il ne bronchera pas car son maître est puissant pour le soutenir.
[14:5] Celui-ci considère, en effet, un jour comme plus sacré qu'un autre, celui-là considère tous les jours comme égaux : que chacun ait ici une conviction bien entière et personnelle.
[14:6] Celui qui fait attention au jour le fait à cause du Seigneur ; celui qui mange de tout le fait à cause du Seigneur, puisqu'il rend grâces à Dieu, et celui qui ne mange pas de tout le fait à cause du Seigneur et rend, lui aussi, grâces à Dieu.
[14:7] En effet, aucun de nous ne vit pour lui-même, et aucun ne meurt pour lui-même,
[14:8] car si nous vivons, nous vivons pour le Seigneur ; si nous mourons, nous mourons pour le Seigneur. Soit donc que nous vivions, soit que nous mourions, nous sommes au Seigneur ;
[14:9] et c'est pour cela que Christ est mort et est ressuscité, c'est pour être le Seigneur des vivants et des morts.
[14:10] Pourquoi donc, toi, juges-tu ton frère et pourquoi donc, toi, méprises-tu ton frère, quand nous devons tous comparaître devant le tribunal de Dieu?
[14:11] En effet, il est écrit : «Aussi vrai que je vis, dit le Seigneur, Devant moi fléchira tout genou Et toute langue louera Dieu.
[14:12] Par conséquent, chacun de nous rendra compte à Dieu pour soi-même.
[14:13] Ne nous jugeons donc plus les uns les autres. mais décidez plutôt que vous ne placerez jamais devant votre frère une pierre d'achoppement, que vous ne lui donnerez jamais une occasion de tomber.
[14:14] (Je sais, je suis convaincu en Jésus mon Seigneur que rien n'est impur en soi, sauf cependant si quelqu'un pense que telle ou telle chose est impure, alors pour lui elle est impure).
[14:15] Si prenant telle nourriture tu attristes ton frère, tu n'agis plus avec charité. Ne va pas, à cause de ta nourriture, perdre celui pour lequel Christ est mort ;
[14:16] ne faites pas calomnier ce que vous avez de bon.
[14:17] On ne réalise pas le Royaume de Dieu par ce qu'on mange et par ce qu'on boit, mais par la justice, par la paix, par la joie dans l'Esprit saint.
[14:18] Celui qui sert le Christ de cette manière est agréable à Dieu et estimé des hommes.
[14:19] Recherchons donc tout ce qui peut contribuer à la paix et à l'édification mutuelle.
[14:20] Ne va pas, pour une question de nourriture, ruiner l'oeuvre de Dieu. Tout est pur, c'est vrai ; mais un homme fait le mal quand, par la nourriture qu'il prend, il devient une cause d'achoppement ;
[14:21] et il fait le bien quand il ne mange pas de viande, quand il ne boit pas de vin, quand il ne fait rien qui risque de faire tomber son frère.
[14:22] Toi tu as ta conviction, garde-la pour toi seul sous le regard de Dieu. Heureux celui qui ne prononce pas son propre jugement par ce qu'il approuve!
[14:23] Celui qui, en ayant des doutes, mange de tout, est condamné, parce qu'il agit sans conviction ; tout ce qu'on ne fait pas avec conviction est un péché.
[15:1] Nous devons, nous les forts, supporter les faiblesses de ceux, qui sont moins forts que nous, et nous ne devons pas n'avoir de complaisance que pour nous-mêmes.
[15:2] Que chacun de nous tâche de plaire à son prochain pour lui faire du bien et pour l'édifier,
[15:3] car le Christ n'a pas cherché ce qui lui plaisait à lui, mais, comme il est écrit : «Les outrages de ceux qui t'outragent sont tombés sur moi»,
[15:4] Or tout ce qui a été écrit d'avance l'a été pour notre instruction, afin que la patience et la consolation que nous puisons dans les Écritures conservent en nous l'espérance.
[15:5] Que le Dieu de patience et de consolation vous donne d'être d'accord entre vous comme le veut Jésus-Christ
[15:6] afin que, d'un seul coeur et d'une seule voix, vous donniez gloire à Dieu le Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[15:7] Accueillez-vous donc les uns les autres, comme le Christ vous a accueillis, pour la gloire de Dieu.
[15:8] J'affirme, en effet, que Christ est devenu le serviteur de ceux de la circoncision pour montrer la véracité de Dieu, pour confirmer les promesses faites à leurs pères,
[15:9] et quant aux païens, ils glorifient Dieu de sa miséricorde, comme il est écrit : «C'est pourquoi je te célébrerai parmi les païens et je louerai ton nom» ;
[15:10] et ailleurs il est dit : «Réjouissez-vous, païens, avec son peuple»,
[15:11] et encore : «Louez le Seigneur, vous toutes les nations ; Célébrez-le, vous tous les peuples.»
[15:12] Ésaïe dit aussi : «paraîtra le rejeton de Jessé, Celui qui s'élèvera pour dominer sur les païens ; Les païens espéreront en lui.»
[15:13] Que le Dieu de l'espérance vous comble de toute la joie et de toute la paix que donne la foi pour que vous soyez riches d'espérance par la puissance de l'Esprit saint.
[15:14] Je suis convaincu, mes frères, je le suis tout le premier, que, vous êtes pleins de bonté, doués de beaucoup d'intelligence, capables de vous avertir les uns les autres.
[15:15] Cependant je vous ai parlé sévèrement dans quelques passages et comme pour raviver vos souvenirs : je l'ai fait en vertu de la grâce que Dieu m'a accordée
[15:16] d'être le ministre de Jésus-Christ auprès des païens, officiant pour l'Évangile de Dieu, afin que les païens lui soient une offrande agréable, étant sanctifiée par l'Esprit saint.
[15:17] Je puis donc me glorifier en Jésus-Christ de tout ce qui regarde la cause de Dieu.
[15:18] Car je n'oserais jamais parler de choses que Christ n'aurait pas faites par mon ministère pour la soumission des païens,
[15:19] soit par mes paroles soit par mes actes, par la puissance des miracles et des prodiges, par la puissance de l'Esprit de Dieu ; c'est au point que j'ai rempli de l'Évangile du Christ le cercle immense qui va depuis Jérusalem jusqu'à l'Illyrie,
[15:20] et je me suis fait un devoir d'honneur de ne pas prêcher l'Évangile là où le nom de Christ avait déjà été prononcé pour ne pas bâtir sur un fondement posé par autrui.
[15:21] Mais, comme il est écrit : «Ceux auxquels il n'avait pas été annoncé le verront, Et ceux qui n'en avaient pas entendu parler le comprendront.»
[15:22] C'est pour cela que j'ai été si souvent empêché de venir chez vous ;
[15:23] mais aujourd'hui je n'ai plus rien à faire dans ces contrées-ci, et comme j'ai depuis plusieurs années un très grand désir d'aller vous voir et que je dois aller en Espagne,
[15:24] j'espère vous faire une visite en passant, puis vous me fournirez les moyens d'aller là-bas après que j'aurai satisfait, en partie du moins, le besoin que j'ai de vous voir.
[15:25] Pour le moment je vais à Jérusalem porter un secours aux fidèles,
[15:26] car la Macédoine et l'Achaïe ont bien voulu organiser une collecte en faveur des fidèles de Jérusalem qui sont dans la pauvreté ;
[15:27] elles l'ont bien voulu, dis-je ; mais aussi bien, le leur doivent-elles ; car si les païens ont eu leur part de leurs biens spirituels, elles doivent à leur tour les assister leurs biens matériels.
[15:28] Quand j'aurai terminé cette affaire et que je leur aurai soigneusement remis la somme, je me rendrai en Espagne en passant par chez vous ;
[15:29] et je sais que je viendrai chez vous accompagné des plus riches bénédictions de Christ.
[15:30] Mais je vous demande, frères, au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ et de l'amour qui unit nos esprits, de lutter avec moi et pour moi dans vos prières à Dieu,
[15:31] afin qu’il me délivre des incrédules de Judée et que la mission que je vais remplir à Jérusalem, soit favorablement accueillie des fidèles.
[15:32] Et alors je pourrai aller chez vous dans la joie et, s'il plaît à Dieu, me reposer avec vous.
[15:33] Le Dieu de paix soit avec vous tous. Amen.
[16:1] Je vous recommande notre soeur Phoebé, diaconesse de l'église de Kenchrées,
[16:2] pour que l'accueil que vous lui ferez en notre Seigneur soit digne des fidèles, et que vous l'assistiez dans toute affaire où elle pourrait avoir besoin de vous. Elle a rendu service à plusieurs personnes, à moi en particulier.
[16:3] Saluez Prisca et Aquilas, mes collaborateurs en Jésus-Christ,
[16:4] qui, pour me sauver la vie, ont exposé la leur, et je ne suis pas le seul à les en remercier, mais encore toutes les Églises des païens.
[16:5] Saluez aussi l'Église qui s'assemble dans leur maison. Saluez mon cher Épénète, le premier-né de l'Asie en Christ.
[16:6] Saluez Marie, elle s'est donnée beaucoup de peine pour vous.
[16:7] Saluez Andronicus et Junias, mes parents et mes compagnons de captivité ; ils sont distingués entre les apôtres et même ont été en Christ avant moi.
[16:8] Saluez Amplias ; il m'est cher dans le Seigneur.
[16:9] Saluez Urbanus, notre collaborateur en Christ, ainsi que mon cher Stachys.
[16:10] Saluez Apellès, qui est un honnête homme en Christ. Saluez les gens de la maison d'Aristobule.
[16:11] Saluez Hérodion, mon parent. Saluez les gens de la maison de Narcisse qui sont au Seigneur,
[16:12] Saluez Triphaina et Tryphosa, ouvrières dans l'oeuvre du Seigneur. Saluez ma chère Persis, elle a bien travaillé pour le Seigneur.
[16:13] Saluez Rufus, homme distingué dans le Seigneur, et sa mère que j'appelle ma mère.
[16:14] Saluez Asyncrytus, Phlégon, Hermès, Patrobas, Hermas et les frères qui sont avec eux.
[16:15] Saluez Philologus et Julie, Nérée et sa soeur, Olympas et tous les fidèles qui sont avec eux.
[16:16] Saluez-vous les uns les autres d'un saint baiser. Toutes les Églises du Christ vous saluent.
[16:17] Je vous invite, frères, à prendre garde à ceux qui sèment des divisions et des scandales contre la doctrine que vous avez apprise. Évitez-les ;
[16:18] car ces gens-là ne servent pas notre Seigneur Christ, mais leur ventre, et, par leurs flatteries et leurs beaux discours, ils séduisent les coeurs des simples.
[16:19] Votre docilité est maintenant partout connue, je me réjouis donc de vous, mais je veux que vous soyez sages pour le bien et innocents devant le mal.
[16:20] Le Dieu de paix écrasera bientôt Satan sous vos pieds. La grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus soit avec vous.
[16:21] Timothée, mon collaborateur, vous salue, ainsi que Lucius, Jason, Sosipater, mes parents.
[16:22] Moi, Tertius, qui ai écrit cette lettre, je vous salue aussi en notre Seigneur.
[16:23] Gaïus, qui me donne l'hospitalité, ainsi qu'à toute l'Église, vous salue. Éraste, le receveur de la ville, et le frère Quartus vous saluent.
[16:24] (Que la grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec vous tous, amen.)
[16:25] A Celui qui peut vous fortifier dans la foi en mon Évangile et en l'enseignement de Jésus-Christ, conformément à la révélation du mystère caché durant des siècles,
[16:26] mais aujourd'hui dévoilé et publié dans des écrits prophétiques par l'ordre du Dieu éternel, pour amener tous les païens à obéir à la foi,
[16:27] au Dieu qui seul est sage soit gloire par Jésus-Christ à jamais ! Amen. 

### I Corinthians

[1:1] Paul, élu, par la volonté de Dieu, apôtre de Jésus-Christ, et le frère Sosthènes, à l'église de Dieu qui est à Corinthe,
[1:2] aux sanctifiés en Jésus-Christ, aux fidèles élus, et à tous ceux qui invoquent le nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ dans tout ce pays, qui est le nôtre comme le leur.
[1:3] Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:4] Je ne cesse de remercier Dieu de la grâce qu'il vous a accordée en Jésus-Christ.
[1:5] Vous avez été, par lui, comblés de richesses ; vous avez reçu beaucoup d'instruction et d'intelligence,
[1:6] et le témoignage du Christ a été bien solidement établi au milieu de vous.
[1:7] Aussi ne vous manque-t-il aucun don de la grâce, à vous qui attendez l'apparition de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:8] Dieu, de son côté, vous fortifiera jusqu'à la fin, et vous serez irréprochables le jour de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:9] Ah ! il est fidèle, le Dieu qui vous a appelés à la communion avec son fils Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[1:10] Je vous conseille cependant, mes frères, au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, d'être tous d'accord dans vos paroles ; qu'il n'y ait pas de scission entre vous ; soyez tous bien unis d'esprit et de sentiment.
[1:11] Qu'ai-je appris, en effet, mes frères, par les fils de Chloé? qu'il y a de la discorde parmi vous.
[1:12] Je m'explique : Voici ce qu'on vous entend dire: «Moi, je suis du parti de Paul!» — «Moi, de celui d'Apollos!» — «Moi, de celui de Képhas !» — «Moi, de celui de Christ!»
[1:13] — Est-ce que le Christ est divisé ? Est-ce que Paul a été crucifié pour vous? Est-ce que vous avez été baptisés au nom de Paul?
[1:14] Je rends grâces de n'avoir baptisé aucun de vous - (sauf toutefois Crispus et Caïus) —
[1:15] pour que personne ne puisse dire que vous avez été baptisés en mon nom.
[1:16] J'ai bien baptisé aussi la maison de Stephanas ; à cela près, personne d'autre que je sache.
[1:17] Christ ne m'a pas fait apôtre pour baptiser, mais pour prêcher l'Évangile, pour le prêcher sans aucune des habiletés de la philosophie, afin de ne pas rendre inutile la croix du Christ.
[1:18] La prédication de la croix, en effet, est folie pour ceux qui vont périr ; pour nous, les sauvés, elle est une puissance de Dieu,
[1:19] car il est écrit : «Je perdrai la sagesse des sages, Et la prudence des prudents je la rendrai vaine.»
[1:20] Où est le philosophe? où est le docteur de la Loi? où est le raisonneur mondain?
[1:21] Dieu n'a-t-il pas changé en folie la sagesse de ce monde ? Puisque Dieu a permis, dans sa sagesse, que le monde ne parvînt pas avec sa philosophie à le connaître, il a bien voulu par une prédication appelée folie, sauver les croyants :
[1:22] les Juifs exigent des miracles, les Grecs veulent de la philosophie ;
[1:23] nous, nous prêchons Christ crucifié ; il est pour les Juifs un scandale ;
[1:24] il est pour les païens une folie ; mais pour les appelés, soit Juifs, soit Grecs, il est Christ, puissance de Dieu, sagesse de Dieu.
[1:25] Ah! cette «folie» de Dieu, elle est plus sage que ce qui vient des hommes ; cette «faiblesse» de Dieu, elle est plus forte que ce qui vient des hommes!
[1:26] Voyez, mes frères, comment vous avez été appelés : il n'y a pas parmi vous beaucoup de philosophes, comme on les appelle, ni beaucoup d'hommes influents ou de haute naissance ;
[1:27] mais Dieu a choisi ce qui est insensé selon le monde pour confondre les philosophes, il a choisi ce qui est faible selon le monde pour confondre les forts ;
[1:28] oui, ceux d'une condition inférieure, les méprisés, Dieu les a choisis ; ceux qui n'étaient rien
[1:29] pour réduire au néant ceux qui étaient quelque chose, afin qu'aucun être mortel ne puisse s'enorgueillir en sa présence.
[1:30] Par lui, vous appartenez à Jésus-Christ, qui, grâce à Dieu, est devenu notre «philosophie», je veux dire notre justice, notre sanctification et notre rédemption,
[1:31] afin, comme dit l'Écriture, «Que celui qui veut se glorifier se glorifie...au sujet du Seigneur.»
[2:1] Et moi, frères, quand je vins à vous, je ne vins pas vous annoncer le témoignage de Dieu avec le prestige de l'éloquence ou de la philosophie.
[2:2] Parmi vous, je n'ai jugé savoir qu'une seule chose: Jésus-Christ et Jésus-Christ crucifié.
[2:3] Aussi ai-je passé tout ce temps dans la faiblesse, la crainte, la plus grande humilité.
[2:4] Mes discours, mes prédications ne tiraient pas leur valeur des arguments de la philosophie, mais ils la tiraient des démonstrations de l'Esprit et de la puissance divine,
[2:5] afin que votre foi ne reposât pas sur la philosophie des hommes, mais sur la puissance de Dieu.
[2:6] Nous avons bien notre philosophie, mais nous ne la prêchons qu'aux hommes d'âge mûr. C'est une philosophie qui n'est pas celle de ce siècle, ni celle des princes de ce siècle qui vont passer.
[2:7] Nous prêchons une philosophie divine, jusqu'ici mystérieuse et cachée, et que Dieu avait décrétée avant les siècles et cela pour notre gloire.
[2:8] Aucun des princes de ce siècle ne l'a connue (s'ils l'eussent connue, ils n'auraient pas crucifié le Seigneur de gloire),
[2:9] mais, comme dit l'Écriture : «...Ce qu'aucun oeil n'a vu, ce qu'aucune oreille n'a entendu, Ce qui n'est monté au coeur d'aucun homme, Ce que Dieu a préparé pour ceux qui l'aiment...»
[2:10] C'est à nous que Dieu l'a révélée par son Esprit ; car l'Esprit sonde tout, même les profondeurs de Dieu.
[2:11] Quel homme sait ce qui se passe dans un homme? Ce n'est que l'esprit de cet homme qui est en lui-même. De même ce qui est en Dieu, personne ne le sait que l'Esprit de Dieu.
[2:12] Nous, nous n'avons pas reçu l'esprit du monde, mais l'Esprit qui vient de Dieu (pour que nous sachions les grâces que Dieu nous a faites).
[2:13] Ce qu'il nous révèle, nous ne l'exprimons pas dans les termes qu'enseigne la philosophie humaine, mais dans ceux qu'enseigne l'Esprit ; nous sommes attentifs à exprimer ce qui est spirituel en style spirituel.
[2:14] L'homme qui n'a que ses facultés naturelles n'accepte pas les choses de l'Esprit de Dieu. Il les taxe de folie, il ne peut les connaître, parce qu'elles demandent à être jugées avec l'Esprit.
[2:15] L'homme spirituel, au contraire, juge de tout et n'est jugé par personne.
[2:16] «Qui connaît, en effet, la pensée du Seigneur Pour l'instruire? » Nous, nous avons la pensée de Christ.
[3:1] Quant à moi, frères, je n'ai pu vous parler jusqu'à présent comme à des hommes spirituels, mais je vous ai parlé comme à des hommes charnels, comme à de petits enfants en Christ.
[3:2] Je vous ai donné du lait, et non une nourriture solide ; vous n'eussiez pu la supporter. Vous ne le pourriez pas encore ;
[3:3] vous êtes toujours charnels. Il y a entre vous de la jalousie et des querelles ; n'est-ce pas la preuve que vous êtes charnels et que vous agissez dans des vues purement humaines?
[3:4] Quand vous dites, l'un : «Moi, je suis pour Paul» ; l’autre : «Moi, je suis pour Apollos», n'est-ce pas à la manière des hommes que vous agissez ?
[3:5] Qui est donc Apollos ? qui est Paul? Ce sont des serviteurs par lesquels le Seigneur vous a amenés à la foi, chacun selon la tâche qui lui a été confiée.
[3:6] Moi j'ai planté, Apollos a arrosé, mais c'est Dieu qui a donné la croissance.
[3:7] Celui qui plante n'est rien, celui qui arrose n'est rien, Dieu qui donne la croissance est tout.
[3:8] Celui qui plante et celui qui arrose sont sur la même ligne, et chacun recevra sa propre récompense suivant son propre travail.
[3:9] Nous sommes les collaborateurs de Dieu ; vous êtes le champ auquel Dieu travaille ; la maison qu'il construit.
[3:10] En architecte prudent et dans la mesure de grâce que Dieu m'a accordée, j'en ai posé le fondement ; un autre continue la construction. Chacun doit prendre garde à la manière dont il construit.
[3:11] Quant au fondement, personne ne peut en poser un autre que celui qui est déjà en place, c'est-à-dire Jésus-Christ.
[3:12] Sur ce fondement, que chacun élève sa construction, en or, en argent, en pierres précieuses, en bois, en foin, en paille,
[3:13] son oeuvre sera mise en lumière ; on la connaîtra, le jour du Seigneur ; le feu la révélera ; oui, le feu prouvera ce que vaut l'oeuvre de chacun.
[3:14] Celui dont l'oeuvre, dont la construction restera debout, recevra son salaire.
[3:15] Celui dont l'oeuvre sera consumée, la perdra ; lui-même sera sauvé, mais comme on l'est à travers le feu.
[3:16] Ne savez-vous pas que vous êtes un sanctuaire de Dieu et que l'Esprit de Dieu demeure en vous?
[3:17] Si quelqu'un détruit le sanctuaire de Dieu, Dieu le détruira lui aussi ; car le sanctuaire de Dieu est sacré et vous l'êtes, vous aussi.
[3:18] Que personne ne se fasse d'illusion ; si l'un d'entre vous croit être ce que notre siècle appelle sage, qu'il commence par être fou pour devenir sage.
[3:19] Car la sagesse de ce monde est une folie devant Dieu ; comme il est écrit: «Celui qui surprend les sages dans leurs ruses...»
[3:20] et encore : «Le Seigneur connaît les raisonnements des sages ; Il sait qu'ils sont vains,»
[3:21] Ainsi, que personne ne mette son orgueil dans des hommes, car tout est à vous,
[3:22] Paul, Apollos ou Képhas, le monde, la vie ou la mort, le présent ou l'avenir, tout est à vous,
[3:23] vous à Christ, Christ à Dieu.
[4:1] On doit donc nous considérer comme ministres de Christ et comme administrateurs des desseins cachés de Dieu.
[4:2] D'ailleurs, ce qu'on demande à des administrateurs, c'est de les trouver fidèles.
[4:3] Pour moi, il m'importe peu d'être jugé par vous ou par un tribunal humain. Je m'interdis aussi de me juger moi-même ;
[4:4] ma conscience, certes, ne me reproche rien ; mais ce n'est pas là ce qui me justifie, mon vrai juge est le Seigneur.
[4:5] Ne portez donc pas de jugement prématuré ; attendez que le Seigneur vienne ; il jettera la lumière sur les choses cachées dans l'ombre ; il mettra en plein jour les volontés des coeurs ; alors chacun recevra de Dieu l'éloge qu'il mérite.
[4:6] Si j'ai fait l'application de ces principes à Apollos et à moi-même, frères, c'est à cause de vous ; pour que vous appreniez, par notre exemple, à ne pas dépasser de justes limites et que vous cessiez de vous enfler l'un au-dessus de l'autre et aux dépens d'un tiers.
[4:7] Qui donc t'accorde un privilège? que possèdes-tu que tu n'aies reçu? Si tu as reçu, pourquoi te vanter comme si tu n'avais pas reçu?
[4:8] Vous êtes donc déjà rassasiés! vous êtes donc déjà assez riches! vous êtes donc entrés sans nous dans le Royaume ! Ah ! que je voudrais que vous y fussiez entrés pour qu'il nous fût possible d'y entrer avec vous!
[4:9] Je pense, en effet, que Dieu a fait de nous autres apôtres les derniers des hommes et, pour ainsi dire, de malheureux condamnés à mort, puisque nous sommes donnés en spectacle, comme à l'amphithéâtre, au monde, aux anges et aux hommes.
[4:10] Nous sommes des fous à cause de Christ, vous, des sages en Christ! nous sommes faibles, vous êtes forts! vous êtes honorés, nous sommes obscurs!
[4:11] Jusqu'à cette heure, nous souffrons la faim, la soif, le dénûment, nous sommes insultés, nous menons une vie errante, nous travaillons sans relâche de nos mains ;
[4:12] on nous maudit, et nous bénissons ; on nous persécute, et nous supportons ; on nous injurie, et nous exhortons ;
[4:13] nous sommes, pour ainsi dire, les balayures du monde, le rebut de tous jusqu'à présent !
[4:14] Je ne vous écris pas cela pour vous faire honte, mais je vous avertis comme mes enfants bien-aimés.
[4:15] Car eussiez-vous des milliers de maîtres en Christ, vous n'avez pas plusieurs pères : c'est moi qui suis votre père en Jésus-Christ par la prédication de l'Évangile.
[4:16] Je vous en conjure donc, suivez mon exemple ;
[4:17] c'est dans ce but que je vous envoie Timothée, qui est mon fidèle et bien-aimé fils dans le Seigneur ; il vous rappellera quelle route je suis en Jésus-Christ, et comment j'enseigne partout dans toutes les Églises.
[4:18] Certaines gens ont eu l'orgueil de prétendre que je ne viendrai plus vous voir.
[4:19] Je viendrai bientôt, au contraire, s'il plaît au Seigneur, et je connaîtrai les orgueilleux, non à ce qu'ils disent, mais à ce qu'ils font.
[4:20] Car le Royaume de Dieu ne se fonde pas avec des paroles, mais avec des actes.
[4:21] Que préférez-vous? que je vienne chez vous avec une verge ou avec amour et dans un esprit de douceur?
[5:1] On dit partout qu'il y a chez vous un cas de fornication, et de fornication telle qu'on n'en voit pas parmi les païens : Quelqu'un vivrait avec la femme de son père!
[5:2] Et vous vous laissez enfler d'orgueil! et vous ne portez pas plutôt le deuil! et vous n'avez pas chassé de votre sein celui qui a commis une telle action!
[5:3] Eh bien, moi, absent de corps, mais présent en esprit, j'ai déjà jugé comme si j'étais présent celui qui a péché de la sorte :
[5:4] Au nom de notre Seigneur-Jésus, vous et mon esprit étant réunis, avec le pouvoir de notre Seigneur Jésus,
[5:5] je livre un tel homme à Satan pour la mortification de sa chair, afin que son esprit soit sauvé au jour du Seigneur Jésus.
[5:6] Il n'est pas beau, votre sujet d'orgueil! Ne savez-vous pas qu'un peu de levain fait lever toute la pâte?
[5:7] Jetez donc le vieux levain pour être une pâte nouvelle ; aussi bien devez-vous être sans levain, puisque notre agneau pascal, Christ, a été immolé.
[5:8] Célébrons donc la fête, non avec du vieux levain, du levain de méchanceté et de perversité, mais avec les pains azymes de la pureté et de la vérité.
[5:9] Je vous ai écrit dans ma lettre de ne point avoir de relations avec les impurs.
[5:10] Je ne parlais pas absolument des impurs qui vivent dans le monde, ou des rapaces, avares ou idolâtres, car pour cela il vous faudrait sortir du monde.
[5:11] Mais je vous ai écrit de ne point avoir de relations avec celui qui, se nommant votre frère, serait ou impur, ou rapace, ou idolâtre, ou calomniateur, ou ivrogne, ou avare, de ne pas même vous mettre à table avec un homme pareil!
[5:12] Est-ce à moi de juger les gens du dehors? Ce sont ceux du dedans, n'est-ce pas, que vous avez à juger?
[5:13] Ceux du dehors Dieu les jugera. «Retranchez le coupable du milieu de vous !»
[6:1] Osez-vous bien, quand vous avez une affaire entre vous, en appeler au jugement des païens et non à celui des fidèles?
[6:2] Ne savez-vous pas que les fidèles jugeront le monde? Et si le monde doit être jugé par vous, seriez-vous incapables de rendre des jugements de moindre importance?
[6:3] Ne savez-vous pas que nous jugerons des anges? Et nous ne jugerions pas des questions d'intérêt !
[6:4] Quand vous avez entre vous des questions d'intérêt, vous vous adressez à ceux que l'Église méprise ; et vous les constituez Juges !
[6:5] Ainsi, je le dis à votre honte, il n'y a pas parmi vous un seul homme intelligent qui soit capable d'être juge entre ses frères!
[6:6] Mais un frère est en procès avec un frère et cela devant des infidèles!
[6:7] C'est déjà un bien grand dommage que vous ayez des procès entre vous. Pourquoi ne souffrez-vous pas plutôt l'injustice? Pourquoi ne vous laissez-vous pas plutôt dépouiller?
[6:8] mais c'est vous-mêmes qui êtes injustes, spoliateurs, et cela envers des frères!
[6:9] Ne savez-vous donc pas que les injustes ne seront point héritiers du Royaume de Dieu? Ne vous y trompez pas : ni impurs, ni idolâtres, ni adultères, ni débauchés efféminés et infâmes,
[6:10] ni voleurs, ni rapaces, ni ivrognes, ni calomniateurs, ni avares ne seront héritiers du Royaume de Dieu!
[6:11] Et cela vous l'étiez, quelques-uns, mais vous. avez été purifiés ; mais vous avez été sanctifiés ; mais vous avez été justifiés, au nom du Seigneur Jésus-Christ et par l'Esprit de notre Dieu!
[6:12] «Tout m'est permis», — mais tout n'est pas opportun. «Tout m'est permis», — mais, moi, je ne me laisserai dominer par rien.
[6:13] Les aliments sont pour l'estomac et l'estomac pour les aliments, mais Dieu mettra fin à l'un comme aux autres. Le corps n'est pas pour l'impureté, mais pour le Seigneur et le Seigneur pour le corps.
[6:14] Dieu a ressuscité le Seigneur et il nous ressuscitera aussi par sa puissance.
[6:15] Ne savez-vous pas que vos corps sont membres de Christ? Arracherai-je donc les membres du Christ, pour en faire les membres d'une prostituée?
[6:16] A Dieu ne plaise! Ne savez-vous pas que celui qui s'unit à une prostituée est un même corps avec elle? car il est dit : «Ils seront deux dans une chair.»
[6:17] Celui qui s'unit au Seigneur est un même esprit avec lui.
[6:18] Fuyez l'impureté! Tout autre péché que l'homme commette, se fait hors du corps ; celui qui se livre à l'impureté pèche contre son propre corps.
[6:19] Ne savez-vous pas que vos corps sont le temple du saint Esprit qui est en vous, et que vous tenez de Dieu, et que vous n'êtes plus à vous-mêmes ?
[6:20] Car vous avez été achetés à un grand prix. Glorifiez donc Dieu dans vos corps.
[7:1] Voici ma réponse aux divers sujets de votre lettre : L'homme fait bien de renoncer au mariage.
[7:2] Cependant, pour éviter tout dérèglement, que chaque homme ait sa femme, que chaque femme ait son mari ;
[7:3] que le mari remplisse ses devoirs envers sa femme, et la femme envers son mari.
[7:4] Le corps de la femme ne lui appartient pas, il est à son mari. De même le corps du mari ne lui appartient pas, il est à sa femme.
[7:5] Ne refusez pas d'être l'un à l'autre, sauf d'un commun accord et momentanément pour vaquer à la prière ; puis retournez ensemble, de peur que Satan ne se serve de votre incontinence pour vous tenter.
[7:6] En parlant ainsi, je vous fais une concession, je ne vous donne pas d'ordre.
[7:7] Je voudrais que tous les hommes fussent comme moi : mais chacun reçoit de Dieu son don particulier, l'un celui-ci, l'autre celui-là.
[7:8] Je dis aux hommes non mariés et aux veuves : il est bon que vous restiez ainsi, comme moi.
[7:9] Mais si vous ne pouvez vous astreindre à la continence, mariez-vous. Car il vaut mieux se marier que de brûler.
[7:10] A ceux qui sont mariés, j'ordonne ceci (non pas moi, mais le Seigneur) : que la femme ne se sépare point de son mari
[7:11] (si elle s'en trouvait séparée, qu'elle reste sans se remarier ou qu'elle se réconcilie avec lui) ; que le mari ne répudie point sa femme.
[7:12] Aux autres je dis (moi, non le Seigneur) : si un frère a pour femme une païenne et qu'elle consente à vivre avec lui, qu'il ne divorce pas.
[7:13] Et si une femme a pour mari un païen et qu'il consente à vivre avec elle, qu'elle ne divorce pas.
[7:14] Car la femme a rapproché des fidèles son mari païen ; le frère a rapproché des fidèles sa femme païenne ; si cela n'était pas, vos enfants seraient hors de l'Église, tandis qu'ils sont au nombre des fidèles.
[7:15] Si la partie païenne veut se séparer, qu'elle se sépare! dans ce cas, le frère ou la soeur ne sent pas liés, quoique Dieu vous ait appelés à vivre en paix.
[7:16] Sais-tu, en effet, femme, si tu ne sauveras pas ton mari? Sais-tu, mari, si tu ne sauveras pas ta femme?
[7:17] En général, chacun doit garder la part que le Seigneur lui a faite, rester là où il était quand Dieu l'a appelé. C'est là ce que j'ordonne dans toutes les Églises.
[7:18] As-tu été appelé circoncis? ne dissimule pas ta circoncision ; as-tu été appelé incirconcis? ne te fais pas circoncire.
[7:19] La circoncision n'est rien, l'incirconcision n'est rien, mais l'observation des commandements de Dieu...
[7:20] Chacun doit rester là où il était quand il a été appelé.
[7:21] As-tu été appelé esclave? ne t'en soucie pas, et alors même que tu pourrais te libérer, reste plutôt esclave,
[7:22] car l'esclave appelé au Seigneur est l'affranchi du Seigneur, et de même, l'homme libre appelé est l'esclave de Christ.
[7:23] Vous avez été achetés un grand prix ; ne devenez pas esclaves des hommes,
[7:24] et que chacun, mes frères, reste devant Dieu là où il était quand il a été appelé.
[7:25] Pour ceux ou celles qui sont vierges, je n'ai point reçu d'ordre du Seigneur ; mais je donne mon opinion comme étant, par la miséricorde du Seigneur, digne de confiance.
[7:26] Je crois qu'il vaut mieux, puisque la crise finale est imminente, oui, je crois qu'il vaut mieux pour l'homme rester comme il est.
[7:27] Es-tu engagé avec une femme? ne cherche pas à rompre ; n'as-tu aucun engagement? ne cherche point de femme.
[7:28] Si cependant tu te maries, ce n'est pas un péché ; et si une vierge se marie, ce n'est pas un péché. Mais ceux qui font cela auront des souffrances dans cette vie, et moi je voudrais les leur épargner.
[7:29] Je vous assure, frères, que le temps est court ; voici ce qui reste à faire : que ceux qui ont des femmes soient comme n'en ayant pas ;
[7:30] ceux qui pleurent comme ne pleurant pas ; ceux qui se réjouissent comme ne se réjouissant pas ; ceux qui achètent comme ne possédant pas ;
[7:31] ceux qui usent de ce monde, comme n'en usant absolument pas ; car la figure de ce monde passe!
[7:32] Je voudrais que vous n'eussiez pas de soucis mondains : or, l'homme non marié a le souci des affaires du Seigneur ; il cherche à plaire au Seigneur.
[7:33] L'homme marié a le souci des affaires de ce monde ; il cherche à plaire à sa femme.
[7:34] Il y a la même différence entre la femme mariée et la vierge : la vierge a le souci des affaires du Seigneur, afin d'être sainte de corps et d'esprit ; mais la femme mariée a le souci des affaires de ce monde ; elle cherche à plaire à son mari.
[7:35] Je vous dis cela dans votre intérêt, non pour vous tendre un piège ; je vous le dis en vue des convenances et de ce qui est le plus propre à vous attacher sans distraction au culte du Seigneur.
[7:36] Si cependant quelqu'un pense qu'il y a des inconvénients pour sa fille à passer l'âge du mariage, et s'il croit devoir agir en conséquence, qu'il fasse ce qu'il voudra! Ce n'est pas un péché, qu'on se marie!
[7:37] Mais celui qui a pris dans son coeur une résolution inébranlable sans subir aucune contrainte, maître de faire ce qu'il veut, oui, qui a décidé dans le fond de son coeur de garder sa fille vierge, fait bien.
[7:38] Ainsi celui qui marie sa fille fait bien, celui qui ne la marie pas fait mieux.
[7:39] Une femme est liée aussi longtemps que son mari est vivant. Si le mari vient à mourir, elle est libre de se remarier avec qui elle veut, seulement que ce soit dans le Seigneur.
[7:40] Cependant elle est plus heureuse si elle reste comme elle est ; c'est mon opinion ; et je crois, moi aussi, avoir l'Esprit de Dieu.
[8:1] Sur la question des viandes offertes en sacrifice aux idoles, tous, nous le savons, nous sommes éclairés... (Être éclairé rend orgueilleux, c'est l'amour qui édifie ) ;
[8:2] — si quelqu'un s'imagine être éclairé sur quelque chose, il n'est pas encore éclairé comme il faudrait l'être,
[8:3] mais si quelqu'un a de l'amour pour Dieu, Dieu est éclairé sur lui —...
[8:4] Ainsi donc sur la question : Peut-on manger des viandes offertes en sacrifice aux idoles ? nous savons qu'il n'y a pas d'idoles au monde, et qu'il n'y a qu'un seul Dieu, qu'il n'y en a pas d'autre.
[8:5] Il y a bien de prétendus dieux qui seraient les uns au ciel, les autres sur la terre, et il y aurait ainsi plusieurs dieux et plusieurs seigneurs,
[8:6] mais nous n'avons qu'un seul Dieu, le Père, d'où tout vient et pour lequel nous sommes ; nous n'avons qu'un seul Seigneur Jésus-Christ, par lequel tout existe et, nous aussi, nous sommes par lui.
[8:7] Mais tous ne sont pas éclairés ; quelques personnes ont gardé leurs anciennes idées sur l'idole ; elles croient manger d'un sacrifice fait à une idole réelle, et, par suite de cette faiblesse, leur conscience perd sa pureté.
[8:8] Or, ce n'est pas la manière dont nous nous nourrissons qui nous rendra agréables à Dieu ; que nous mangions de ceci, que nous ne mangions pas de cela, nous n'y perdons, nous n'y gagnons rien ;
[8:9] mais prenez garde que votre force même ne soit la pierre d'achoppement des faibles ;
[8:10] si l'on te voit, toi qui es éclairé, à table dans un temple païen, celui dont la conscience est faible ne sera-t-il pas porté à manger de la viande sacrifiée aux idoles?
[8:11] et il se perd alors, parce que toi tu es éclairé, cet homme faible, ce frère pour lequel Christ est mort!
[8:12] En étant ainsi coupables envers des frères, en blessant leur conscience qui est faible, vous vous rendez coupables envers Christ lui-même.
[8:13] Voilà pourquoi, si la viande que je mange scandalise mon frère, je renoncerai pour toujours à manger de la viande, afin de ne pas scandaliser mon frère.
[9:1] Ne suis-je pas libre? ne suis pas apôtre? n'ai-je pas vu Jésus notre Seigneur? N'êtes-vous pas mon oeuvre dans le Seigneur?
[9:2] Si pour d'autres je ne suis pas apôtre, au moins le suis-je pour vous. Car le sceau de mon apostolat c'est vous qui l'êtes dans le Seigneur,
[9:3] et mon apologie auprès de ceux qui me mettent en cause, la voilà.
[9:4] N'aurions-nous pas le droit de manger et boire à vos frais?
[9:5] N'aurions-nous pas le droit de mener partout avec nous une femme soeur comme les autres apôtres, comme les frères du Seigneur, comme Képhas?
[9:6] Barnabas et moi, sommes-nous seuls à ne pas avoir le droit de nous dispenser de travailler?
[9:7] Qui a jamais fait son service militaire à ses propres frais? Plante-t-on une vigne pour n'en pas manger le fruit? Fait-on paître un troupeau sans se nourrir de son lait?
[9:8] Est-ce que je ne vous indique là que les usages du monde? La Loi même ne dit-elle pas la même chose?
[9:9] Dans la Loi de Moïse il est écrit : «Tu ne muselleras pas le boeuf qui foule le blé.» Est-ce que Dieu s'occupe des boeufs?
[9:10] Ne dit-il pas cela exclusivement pour nous? Oui, c'est pour nous que cette parole a été écrite. Elle signifie que celui qui laboure la terre et celui qui bat le blé doivent le faire avec l'espérance d'en avoir leur part.
[9:11] Nous avons semé chez vous la semence spirituelle, serait-ce il beaucoup de cueillir quelque chose de votre temporel?
[9:12] Si d'autres se sont donné ce droit sur vous, ne l'aurions-nous pas à plus forte raison? Eh bien, nous n'avons pas usé de ce droit ; au contraire, nous supportons tout pour ne créer aucun obstacle à l'Évangile du Christ!
[9:13] Ignorez-vous que ceux qui font le service sacré sont nourris par le Temple? que ceux qui sont occupés à l'autel sont les commensaux de l'autel?
[9:14] De même le Seigneur a ordonné à ceux qui annoncent l'Évangile de vivre de l'Évangile.
[9:15] Eh bien, moi, je n'ai usé d'aucun de ces droits. Je n'écris pas cela pour que vous m'en fassiez jouir désormais, car j'aimerais mieux mourir que de me laisser enlever ce sujet de gloire.
[9:16] En effet, ce n'est pas prêcher l'Évangile qui est mon sujet de gloire. C'est une obligation qui m'est imposée et malheur à moi si je ne prêche pas l'Évangile!
[9:17] Ah! si je le prêchais de mon propre mouvement, j'aurais un mérite, mais si je le prêche par ordre, c'est un ministère qui m'est confié.
[9:18] Quel est alors mon mérite? c'est qu'en évangélisant je prêche l'Évangile gratis, de sorte que je n'use pas des droits que j'ai au nom de l'Évangile.
[9:19] Étant libre de tous, je me suis fait esclave de tous, pour en gagner un plus grand nombre.
[9:20] Je me suis fait Juif pour les Juifs, afin de gagner les Juifs ; à ceux qui sont sous l'autorité de la Loi, je me suis présenté comme étant sous l'autorité de la Loi (quoique je ne fusse pas sous cette autorité), afin de gagner ceux qui sont, sous l'autorité de la Loi.
[9:21] Avec ceux qui ne sont pas sous l'autorité de la Loi, j'ai été sans Loi (quoique je ne fusse pas hors de la vraie Loi de Dieu, étant dans la Loi de Christ), afin de gagner ceux qui ne sont pas sous l'autorité de la Loi.
[9:22] Pour les faibles, j'ai été faible afin de gagner les faibles. J'ai été tout à tous pour en sauver un certain nombre de toutes les manières.
[9:23] Et tout cela je le fais à cause de l'Évangile, afin d'en avoir ma part.
[9:24] Ne savez-vous pas que dans les courses du stade tous courent, mais qu'un seul remporte le prix? Courez de manière à le remporter.
[9:25] Ceux qui doivent concourir aux jeux s'imposent de rigoureuses abstinences ; et c'est pour recevoir une couronne périssable ; nous, faisons de même pour une couronne impérissable.
[9:26] Pour moi, voici comment je cours : je ne vais pas à l'aventure ; voici comment je me bats : je ne frappe pas dans le vide ;
[9:27] mais je meurtris mon corps et je le rends esclave, de peur qu'après avoir fait le héraut pour les autres je ne sorte de la lice rejeté.
[10:1] Je ne veux pas vous laisser ignorer, frères, que nos pères ont tous été sous la nuée, qu'ils ont tous passé à travers la mer,
[10:2] que tous, en Moïse, ont reçu le baptême dans la nuée et dans la mer,
[10:3] que tous ont mangé du même aliment spirituel,
[10:4] que tous ont bu du même breuvage spirituel (en effet ils buvaient à un rocher spirituel qui les suivait, ce rocher c'était le Christ).
[10:5] Cependant la plupart d'entre eux ne furent point agréables à Dieu, puisque le désert était jonché de leurs corps.
[10:6] Ces événements sont des figures prophétiques pour nous afin que nous ne convoitions point le mal, comme eux l'ont convoité.
[10:7] Ne devenez pas idolâtres comme quelques-uns d'entre eux, ainsi qu'il est écrit : «Le peuple s'assit pour manger et boire et ils se levèrent pour danser.»
[10:8] Ne vous adonnez pas à l'impureté, comme quelques-uns d'entre eux s'y sont adonnés, et, en un seul jour, il en tomba vingt-trois mille.
[10:9] Ne tentez pas le Seigneur, comme quelques-uns d'entre eux l'ont tenté, et les serpents les firent périr ;
[10:10] ne murmurez pas comme quelques-uns d'entre eux, ont murmuré et l'exterminateur les fit périr.
[10:11] Ces événements sont des figures prophétiques, ils ont été écrits pour notre instruction à nous qui vivons à la fin du monde.
[10:12] Que celui donc qui croit être debout, prenne garde de tomber!
[10:13] Vous n'avez été exposés à aucune épreuve surhumaine, et Dieu est fidèle, il ne permettra pas que vous soyez éprouvés au delà de vos forces, mais, avec l'épreuve, il vous enverra le moyen d'en sortir et de pouvoir la supporter.
[10:14] Pour ces raisons, mes biens- aimés, fuyez l'idolâtrie.
[10:15] Je vous parle comme à des personnes raisonnables, jugez vous-mêmes de ce que je dis.
[10:16] La coupe de bénédiction que nous bénissons n'est-elle pas une communion avec le sang du Christ? Le pain que nous rompons n'est-il pas une communion avec le corps du Christ?
[10:17] Il n'y a qu'un seul pain ; de même, si nombreux que nous soyons, nous ne formons qu'un seul corps ; car tous nous avons notre part de ce seul pain.
[10:18] Voyez chez le peuple d'Israël ; ceux qui mangent des victimes sacrifiées sont, n'est-ce pas, en communion avec l'autel?
[10:19] Que veux-je dire? que la viande sacrifiée aux idoles ait quelque valeur?
[10:20] que l'idole ait quelque valeur? Certes non, mais les sacrifices des païens «Sont faits aux démons et non à Dieu», et je ne veux pas que vous soyez en communion avec les démons.
[10:21] Vous ne pouvez pas boire à la fois à la coupe du Seigneur et à la coupe des démons ; vous ne pouvez prendre part à la table du Seigneur et à la table des démons.
[10:22] Voudrions-nous irriter le Seigneur? Sommes-nous plus forts que lui?
[10:23] «Tout est permis», mais tout n'est pas opportun ; «tout est permis», mais tout n'édifie pas.
[10:24] Que personne ne cherche son propre intérêt, mais celui d'autrui.
[10:25] Tout ce qu'on vend à la boucherie, mangez-le sans faire d'enquête par motif de conscience,
[10:26] car «La terre et tout ce qu'elle contient sont au Seigneur».
[10:27] Si un des païens vous invite et que vous vouliez y aller, tout ce qui vous est offert, mangez-le sans faire d'enquête par motif de conscience.
[10:28] Mais si quelqu'un vous dit : «Ceci a été offert en sacrifice », alors n'en mangez pas à cause de celui qui vous avertit, et aussi à cause de la conscience :
[10:29] la conscience, dis-je, non la vôtre, mais celle d'autrui. — Mais pourquoi ma liberté serait-elle critiquée par une autre conscience que par la mienne?
[10:30] Si je mange avec actions de grâces, pourquoi serais-je blâmé pour une chose dont je rends grâces?
[10:31] — Soit donc que vous mangiez, que vous buviez, que vous fassiez quoi que ce soit, faites tout à la gloire de Dieu.
[10:32] Ne scandalisez ni les Juifs, ni les Grecs, ni l'Église de Dieu ;
[10:33] comme moi qui, en tout, m'accommode à tout le monde, ne cherchant pas ce qui m'est agréable à moi, mais ce qui l'est au plus grand nombre, afin qu'ils soient sauvés.
[11:1] Imitez mon exemple, comme moi celui de Christ.
[11:2] Je vous loue de ce que vous vous souvenez de moi en toutes choses, et de ce que vous observez les instructions que je vous ai transmises.
[11:3] Cependant je veux que vous sachiez ceci : Le chef de tout homme, c'est le Christ ; le chef de la femme, c'est l'homme ; le chef du Christ, c'est Dieu.
[11:4] Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise la tête couverte, déshonore son chef,
[11:5] et toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête sans voile, déshonore son chef ; c'est exactement comme si elle était rasée.
[11:6] Si une femme ne met pas de voile, alors qu'elle se coupe aussi les cheveux ; et s'il est honteux pour une femme de se couper les cheveux ou de se raser la tête, qu'elle mette donc un voile!
[11:7] L'homme ne doit pas se voiler la tête, parce qu'il est l'image et la gloire de Dieu ; mais la femme est la gloire de l'homme.
[11:8] L'homme n'a pas été tiré de la femme, mais la femme de l'homme,
[11:9] et l'homme n'a pas été créé à cause de la femme, mais la femme à cause de l'homme.
[11:10] Voici pourquoi la femme doit porter sur la tête la marque de sa dépendance : à cause des anges.
[11:11] Néanmoins, dans le Seigneur, la femme n'existe pas sans l’homme, ni l'homme sans la femme.
[11:12] Car si la femme a été tirée de l'homme, l'homme naît de la femme, et tout vient de Dieu.
[11:13] Jugez-en vous-mêmes ; est-il convenable qu'une femme prie Dieu sans être voilée?
[11:14] Un sentiment naturel ne vous enseigne-t-il pas qu'il est honteux à l'homme de laisser croître ses cheveux?
[11:15] tandis que si la femme les laisse croître c'est un honneur, car la chevelure lui a été donnée en guise de voile.
[11:16] Si quelqu'un aime ces sortes de discussions, nous n'avons pas cette habitude, et les Églises de Dieu non plus.
[11:17] En vous faisant cette recommandation, je ne vous loue pas non plus de ce que vos réunions, loin de vous faire du bien, vous font du mal.
[11:18] D'abord, on me dit que lorsque vous vous réunissez en assemblée, il y a des divisions parmi vous. Je le comprends jusqu'à un certain point ;
[11:19] il faut bien qu'il y ait divers partis parmi vous, pour qu'on reconnaisse ceux d'entre vous qui tiennent bon.
[11:20] Mais quand vous vous réunissez, ce n'est pas le vrai repas du Seigneur que vous prenez ;
[11:21] quand vous vous mettez à table, chacun commence par prendre la nourriture qui lui appartient, et alors l'un souffre de la faim et l'autre mange avec excès.
[11:22] N'avez-vous pas vos maisons, s'il ne s'agit que de manger et de boire? ou bien méprisez-vous l'Église de Dieu? voulez-vous insulter les indigents? que dois-je vous dire? faut-il vous louer? sur ce point-là je ne vous loue pas.
[11:23] Pour moi, j'ai reçu, de la part du Seigneur, ce que je vous ai transmis, savoir que le Seigneur Jésus, dans la nuit où il fut livré, prit du pain
[11:24] et, qu'après avoir rendu grâces, il le rompit et dit: «Ceci est mon corps qui est pour vous, faites ceci en mémoire de moi.»
[11:25] Après le repas il prit, de même, la coupe, en disant : «Cette coupe est la nouvelle alliance en mon sang, faites ceci, toutes les fois que vous boirez, en mémoire de moi.»
[11:26] Car toutes les fois que vous mangez ce pain et que vous buvez cette coupe, vous annoncez la mort du Seigneur jusqu'à ce qu'il vienne.
[11:27] C'est pourquoi celui qui mangerait le pain ou boirait la coupe du Seigneur indignement, se rendrait coupable envers le corps et le sang du Seigneur.
[11:28] Que chacun s'examine donc soi-même et qu'ensuite il mange du pain et boive de la coupe ;
[11:29] car celui qui mange et qui boit, mange et boit son propre jugement s'il ne reconnaît pas le corps du Seigneur.
[11:30] Voilà pourquoi il y a parmi vous beaucoup de gens débiles et malades, et que plusieurs personnes meurent.
[11:31] Si nous nous jugions nous-mêmes, nous ne serions pas jugés ;
[11:32] mais les jugements du Seigneur sont des châtiments qui nous préservent d'être condamnés avec le monde.
[11:33] Ainsi donc, mes frères, quand vous vous réunissez pour un repas, attendez-vous les uns les autres.
[11:34] Si quelqu'un a faim, qu'il mange chez lui, afin que vos réunions ne tournent pas à votre condamnation. Je réglerai le reste à mon arrivée.
[12:1] Sur la question de l'inspiration, je ne veux pas, frères, vous laisser dans l'ignorance.
[12:2] Vous savez que, lorsque vous étiez païens, vous vous laissiez entraîner, comme au hasard, vers les idoles muettes.
[12:3] Je vous apprends donc que personne, dirigé par l'Esprit de Dieu, ne dit : «Maudit Jésus», et personne ne peut dire : «Seigneur Jésus» que par l'Esprit saint.
[12:4] Il y a différents dons de la grâce, mais l'Esprit est le même.
[12:5] Il y a différentes fonctions, mais le même Seigneur.
[12:6] Il y a différentes manières d'agir, mais c'est le même Dieu qui opère tout en tous.
[12:7] En chacun l'Esprit se manifeste par le don le plus utile à tous.
[12:8] En effet, à l’un l'Esprit donne une parole de sagesse ; à l'autre le même Esprit donne une parole de science ;
[12:9] le même Esprit donne à un autre la foi ; à un autre le même Esprit accorde le don de guérison ;
[12:10] un autre opère des miracles ; un autre prophétise ; un autre distingue les esprits ; l'un parle certaines langues ; l'autre interprète ces langues.
[12:11] Tout cela est l'ouvrage d'un seul et même Esprit, distribuant à chacun ses dons comme il lui plaît.
[12:12] Il y a un seul corps et plusieurs membres, et tous les membres, malgré leur nombre, ne forment qu'un corps ; eh bien, il en est de même pour le Christ.
[12:13] Car nous avons tous été baptisés d'un seul et même Esprit pour ne former qu'un corps. Juifs ou Grecs, esclaves ou libres, c'est un seul et même Esprit qui a étanché notre soif.
[12:14] Or le corps n'est pas formé d'un seul membre, mais de plusieurs.
[12:15] Si le pied disait : comme je ne suis pas une main, je ne fais pas partie du corps, en ferait-il moins partie pour cela?
[12:16] Et si l'oreille disait : comme je ne suis pas un oeil, je ne fais pas partie du corps, en ferait-elle moins partie pour cela?
[12:17] Si le corps entier était l'oeil, où serait l'ouïe? s'il était l'ouïe, où serait l'odorat?
[12:18] Mais Dieu a disposé les membres dans le corps, chacun comme il a voulu.
[12:19] Si le tout ne formait qu'un membre, y aurait-il un corps?
[12:20] Il y a donc plusieurs membres et un seul corps.
[12:21] L'oeil ne peut dire à la main : je n'ai pas besoin de toi ; ni la tête aux pieds: je n'ai pas besoin de vous.
[12:22] Il y a plus : les membres que l'on croit les plus faibles sont très nécessaires.
[12:23] Ceux que l'on croit les moins respectables, sont au fond ceux que nous respectons le plus ; ceux qui ne sont pas décents, sont le plus décemment traités ;
[12:24] ceux qui sont décents par eux-mêmes, n'en ont pas besoin. Dieu a ainsi arrangé le corps, faisant respecter davantage ce qui n'est pas respectable en soi,
[12:25] pour éviter les divisions entre les membres et leur donner un souci réciproque les uns des autres.
[12:26] Si un membre souffre, tous les membres souffrent avec lui ; si un membre reçoit des honneurs, tous les membres en ont de la joie.
[12:27] Vous, vous êtes le corps de Christ et, chacun pour sa part, un de ses membres ;
[12:28] et ceux que Dieu a placés dans l'Église sont premièrement les apôtres, secondement les prophètes, troisièmement les docteurs, ensuite ceux qui font des miracles, puis ceux qui ont le don de guérison, le don des oeuvres de charité, des soins administratifs, ou le don de parler en langues de toutes sortes.
[12:29] Tous sont-ils apôtres? tous prophètes? tous docteurs? tous font-ils des miracles?
[12:30] tous ont-ils le don de guérison? tous parlent-ils en langues étrangères tous savent-ils les interpréter?
[12:31] Ambitionnez les plus grands de tous les dons! Je vais, cependant, vous montrer un chemin qu'il faut suivre de préférence.
[13:1] Quand je parlerais toutes les langues des hommes, quand je parlerais même toutes celles des anges, si je n'ai point l'amour, je ne suis qu'un airain sonnant ou une cymbale retentissante.
[13:2] Quand j'aurais le don de prophétie, quand je connaîtrais tous les mystères, quand je posséderais toute science, quand j'aurais la foi parfaite pour transporter les montagnes, si je n'ai pas l'amour, je ne suis rien!
[13:3] Je distribuerais tous mes biens, je livrerais mon corps aux flammes, si je n'ai pas l'amour, cela ne me sert de rien!
[13:4] L'amour est patient ; l'amour est bienveillant ; l'amour ne connaît ni l'envie, ni la présomption, ni l'enflure ;
[13:5] il n'est pas malhonnête ; il n'est pas égoïste ; il ne s'irrite pas ; il ne pense pas à mal ;
[13:6] il ne se plaît pas à l'injustice ; il se plaît au contraire à la vérité ;
[13:7] il souffre tout ; il croit tout ; il espère tout ; il supporte tout.
[13:8] L'amour n'a pas de décadence. Les prophéties? elles disparaîtront ; les langues? elles cesseront ; la science? elle disparaîtra ;
[13:9] car notre science est limitée et notre don de prophétie est limité,
[13:10] et quand le parfait viendra, ce qui est limité disparaîtra.
[13:11] Lorsque j'étais enfant, je parlais comme un enfant, je pensais comme un enfant, je raisonnais comme un enfant ; quand je suis devenu homme, j'ai laissé là les façons de l'enfant.
[13:12] Aujourd'hui, nous voyons au moyen d'un miroir, confusément ; alors, nous verrons face à face. Aujourd'hui, ma science est limitée ; alors, je connaîtrai comme j'aurai été connu.
[13:13] En somme, il reste la foi, l'espérance, l'amour, trois grandes choses: mais la plus grande des trois est l'amour ;
[14:1] proposez-vous l'amour!, Ambitionnez aussi les dons spirituels, surtout le don de prophétie.
[14:2] Celui qui parle en langue étrangère ne parle pas aux hommes, mais à Dieu, car personne ne le comprend ; par l'inspiration de l'Esprit, il dit des mystères ;
[14:3] tandis que celui qui parle comme prophète s'adresse aux hommes, il les édifie, les exhorte et les console.
[14:4] Celui qui parle en langue étrangère n'édifie que lui-même, tandis que celui qui parle comme prophète édifie l'Église.
[14:5] Je veux bien que vous parliez tous en langues étrangères, mais je préfère que vous parliez comme prophètes. Le prophète est plus grand que celui qui parle en langues étrangères, sauf le cas où celui-ci s'interprète lui-même, pour que l'Église soit édifiée.
[14:6] En quoi vous serai-je utile si, par exemple, je viens chez vous, frères, et que je vous parle en langues étrangères sans vous parler d'après une révélation comme prophète ou selon mon savoir, comme docteur?
[14:7] Il en est comme de ces instruments de musique inanimés, la flûte, la cithare ; s'ils ne rendent pas un son distinct, comment reconnaître ce qui est joué sur la flûte de ce qui est joué sur la cithare?
[14:8] Et si la trompette rend un son confus, qui se préparera au combat?
[14:9] De même, si votre langue ne donne pas de sons nettement articulés, comment savoir ce que vous dites? vous ne ferez que frapper l'air !
[14:10] Il y a, on le dit du moins, tant de langues différentes dans le monde, et pourtant chacune a sa signification ;
[14:11] mais si je ne sais pas le sens de tel idiome, je serai un étranger pour celui qui le parle, et celui qui le parle sera un étranger pour moi.
[14:12] Il en est de même de vous, puisque vous ambitionnez le don d'inspiration, cherchez à y exceller pour l'édification de l'Église.
[14:13] Celui donc qui parle en langue étrangère doit prier pour qu'il lui soit donné de s'interpréter ;
[14:14] car si je prie en langue étrangère, je prie par une inspiration de l'Esprit, mais mon bon sens reste stérile.
[14:15] Que ferai-je alors? Je prierai par l'inspiration de l'Esprit, je prierai aussi avec mon bon sens ; je chanterai par l'inspiration de l'Esprit, je chanterai aussi avec mon bon sens.
[14:16] Si tu rends gloire à Dieu par l'inspiration de l'Esprit, comment veux-tu que celui qui occupe la place du simple auditeur réponde Amen à ton action de grâces, puisqu'il ne sait pas ce que tu dis?
[14:17] Ton action de grâces est sans doute excellente, mais les autres n'en sont pas édifiés.
[14:18] Je parle plus de langues étrangères que vous tous, et j'en bénis Dieu,
[14:19] mais, dans l'Église, j'aime mieux dire cinq paroles avec mon bon sens pour instruire les autres que dix mille paroles en langues étrangères.
[14:20] Mes frères, ne soyez pas enfants dans vos jugements, ne restez enfants que s'il s'agit du mal ; dans vos jugements, soyez virils.
[14:21] Il est écrit dans la Loi : «C'est dans d'autres langues, C'est par la bouche d'étrangers Que je parlerai à ce peuple, Et, même ainsi, ils ne m'écouteront pas, dit le Seigneur!.»
[14:22] Il s'ensuit que les langues étrangères ne sont pas un signe pour les croyants, mais pour les incrédules, et que la prophétie n'en est pas un pour les incrédules, mais pour les croyants.
[14:23] Si, par exemple, l'Église est tout entière réunie dans le même endroit, et que tous parlent en langues étrangères, les simples curieux ou les incrédules qui entreront ne vous croiront-ils pas tous fous?
[14:24] Si, au contraire, tous prononcent des prophéties, l'incrédule ou le simple curieux qui entre se voit repris par tous, jugé par tous ;
[14:25] les secrets de son coeur sont dévoilés ; il se jettera la face contre terre, il adorera Dieu, et il avouera que «Dieu est certainement au milieu de vous».
[14:26] Que faire alors, mes frères? Quand vous êtes réunis, vous avez l'un un cantique, l'autre une leçon, l'autre une révélation, l'autre une langue étrangère, l'autre une interprétation ; eh bien que tout se fasse pour l'édification.
[14:27] S'agit-il d'une langue étrangère? que deux frères, trois au plus, prennent la parole et l'un après l'autre, ensuite qu'un seul interprète.
[14:28] S'il n'y a pas là d'interprète, que les frères se taisent dans l'assemblée, qu'ils se parlent à eux-mêmes et à Dieu.
[14:29] De même pour les prophéties : que deux ou trois prennent la parole et que les autres jugent.
[14:30] Cependant si un frère, assis à sa place, reçoit une révélation, celui qui parle doit se taire.
[14:31] Vous pouvez tous prophétiser, mais chacun à son tour, pour que tout le monde soit instruit et tout le monde édifié.
[14:32] Le prophète est maître de l'esprit prophétique qui l'anime ;
[14:33] Dieu n'est pas le Dieu du désordre, mais le Dieu de la paix.
[14:34] Que vos femmes gardent le silence en public, comme cela se fait dans toutes les communautés des fidèles ; elles n'ont pas la permission de parler ; elles doivent rester soumises, comme dit la Loi.
[14:35] Si elles désirent s'instruire sur quelque détail, qu'elles interrogent leurs maris chez elles ; il n'est pas convenable qu'une femme parle en public.
[14:36] Est-ce de chez vous que la parole de Dieu est partie, ou bien n'est-elle parvenue qu'à vous seuls?
[14:37] Si quelqu'un croit être un prophète ou un homme inspiré, il doit reconnaître que ce que je vous écris là est un commandement du Seigneur. Si quelqu'un veut l'ignorer, qu'il l'ignore!
[14:38] En résumé, mes frères, ambitionnez le don de prophétie
[14:39] et n'empêchez pas qu'on parle en langues étrangères,
[14:40] mais que tout se passe convenablement et avec ordre.
[15:1] Je vous rappelle, mes frères, l'Évangile que je vous ai prêché, que vous avez aussi accepté, dans lequel vous avez aussi persévéré,
[15:2] et qui aussi vous sauvera si vous le retenez dans les termes mêmes où je vous l'ai prêché ; autrement votre foi aurait été vaine.
[15:3] Car je vous ai transmis avant tout ce que j'ai reçu, savoir que Christ est mort pour nos péchés conformément aux Écritures,
[15:4] qu'il a été enseveli, qu'il est ressuscité le troisième jour, conformément aux Écritures,
[15:5] qu'il est apparu à Képhas, ensuite aux douze.
[15:6] Ensuite il est apparu à plus de cinq cents frères à la fois, dont la plupart vivent encore aujourd'hui, et quelques-uns sont morts ;
[15:7] ensuite il est apparu à Jacques ; ensuite à tous les apôtres ;
[15:8] enfin après eux tous, il m'est apparu à moi comme à l'avorton !
[15:9] Car, moi, je suis le moindre des apôtres, je ne suis pas digne d'être appelé apôtre, parce que j'ai persécuté l'Église de Dieu.
[15:10] Mais, par la grâce de Dieu, je suis ce que je suis, et la grâce qu'il m'a faite n'a pas été stérile ; au contraire, j'ai plus travaillé qu'eux tous ; non pas moi cependant, mais la grâce de Dieu qui est avec moi.
[15:11] Ainsi donc, que ce soit moi, que ce soit eux, voilà ce que, nous prêchons, et voilà ce que vous avez cru.
[15:12] Eh bien, si l'on prêche que Christ est ressuscité des morts, comment certains d'entre vous disent-ils qu'il n'y a pas de résurrection des morts?
[15:13] S'il n'y a pas de résurrection des morts, Christ non plus n'est pas ressuscité,
[15:14] et si Christ n'est pas ressuscité, vaine est notre prédication, vaine votre foi.
[15:15] Il se trouve même que nous sommes de faux témoins à l'égard de Dieu, car nous avons témoigné contre lui en disant qu'il a ressuscité le Christ qu’il n'a pas ressuscité puisque, en effet, les morts ne ressuscitent pas.
[15:16] Si les morts ne ressuscitent pas, Christ non plus n'est pas ressuscité.
[15:17] Si Christ n'est pas ressuscité, votre foi est illusoire, vous êtes encore dans vos péchés
[15:18] et, par suite, ceux qui se sont endormis en Christ ont péri.
[15:19] Si notre espoir dans le Christ ne dépasse pas la vie présente, nous sommes les plus à plaindre de tous les hommes.
[15:20] Mais maintenant, Christ est ressuscité des morts, le premier de ceux qui se sont endormis.
[15:21] En effet, par un homme est venue la mort, par un homme aussi la résurrection des morts ;
[15:22] car de même qu'en Adam tous sont mortels, de même dans le Christ tous recouvreront la vie ;
[15:23] mais chacun à son rang : le premier, le Christ, puis ceux du Christ à son apparition ;
[15:24] ensuite il y aura la fin, quand il remettra la royauté à Dieu le Père, après avoir anéanti toute domination, toute autorité, toute puissance.
[15:25] Il doit régner, en effet, «Jusqu'à ce qu'il ait mis tous les ennemis sous ses pieds.»
[15:26] Le dernier ennemi anéanti sera la mort,
[15:27] car «Il a tout mis sous ses pieds». Mais quand il dira que tout est soumis, il faudra évidemment excepter Celui qui lui aura tout soumis ;
[15:28] et quand tout lui sera ainsi soumis, alors le Fils lui-même se soumettra à Celui qui lui a tout soumis, pour que Dieu soit tout en tous.
[15:29] Autrement que feraient ceux qui se font baptiser pour les morts ? Si, en tout cas, les morts ne ressuscitent pas, pourquoi se font-ils baptiser pour eux?
[15:30] et pourquoi nous, nous exposons-nous à tout moment?
[15:31] Tous les jours je vois la mort en face, aussi vrai, mes frères, que vous êtes mon sujet de gloire en Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur!
[15:32] Si j'ai lutté contre des espèces de bêtes fauves à Éphèse, à quoi cela me sert-il? Si les morts ne ressuscitent pas, «Mangeons et buvons, car demain nous mourrons!»
[15:33] Ne vous y trompez pas : «Les mauvaises compagnies corrompent les bonnes moeurs.»
[15:34] Revenez à votre bon sens, sérieusement, et ne péchez pas. Car certains d'entre vous sont dans l'ignorance sur Dieu, je le dis à votre honte!
[15:35] - Mais, dira quelqu'un, comment les morts ressusciteront-ils? Avec quel corps reviendront-ils ?
[15:36] — Insensé, ce que tu sèmes n'est vivifié qu'après avoir traversé la mort.
[15:37] Ce que tu sèmes n'est pas le corps qui sera un jour, mais un simple grain, par exemple de froment ou de n'importe quelle plante.
[15:38] Puis Dieu lui donne le corps qu'il lui a plu de lui donner, et à chaque semence un corps particulier.
[15:39] Toute chair n'est pas une même chair ; autre est la chair des hommes, autre la chair des bêtes, autre la chair des oiseaux, autre des poissons.
[15:40] Il y a des corps célestes et des corps terrestres ; autre est la gloire des célestes, autre des terrestres ;
[15:41] autre est la gloire du soleil, autre la gloire de la lune ; autre la gloire des étoiles ; une étoile même diffère en gloire d'une autre étoile.
[15:42] Il en est de même de la résurrection des morts : semé corruptible, le corps ressuscite incorruptible ;
[15:43] semé humble, il ressuscite glorieux ; semé faible, il ressuscite fort ;
[15:44] semé corps matériel, il ressuscite corps spirituel ; s'il y a un corps matériel, il y a aussi un corps spirituel ;
[15:45] c'est ainsi qu'il est écrit : «Le premier homme Adam devint une âme vivante», le dernier Adam est devenu un esprit vivifiant.
[15:46] Mais ce n'est pas le corps spirituel qui existe d'abord, c'est le corps matériel ; ensuite le spirituel.
[15:47] Le premier homme était «de terre, de poussière» le second homme est du ciel.
[15:48] Tel celui qui est «de poussière», tels ceux qui sont de poussière ; et tel celui qui est du ciel, tels seront ceux du ciel ;
[15:49] et comme nous avons porté l'image de celui qui est «de poussière», nous porterons aussi l'image de celui qui est du ciel.
[15:50] Voici ce que j'affirme, mes frères : la chair et le sang ne peuvent avoir en héritage le Royaume de Dieu, la corruption n'a pas en héritage l'incorruptibilité.
[15:51] Je vais vous dire une chose restée jusqu'à présent secrète : Tous nous ne mourrons pas, mais tous nous serons transformés,
[15:52] en un instant indivisible, en un clin d'oeil, au son de la dernière trompette. Car la trompette sonnera, les morts ressusciteront incorruptibles, et nous, nous serons transformés.
[15:53] Il faut, en effet, que ce corps corruptible revête l'incorruptibilité et que ce corps mortel revête l'immortalité ;
[15:54] et quand ce corps corruptible aura revêtu l'incorruptibilité et que ce corps mortel aura revêtu l'immortalité, alors s'accomplira ce qui est écrit : «La mort a été absorbée dans la victoire !
[15:55] Où est, ô mort, ta victoire? Où est, ô mort, ton aiguillon ?
[15:56] (l'aiguillon de la mort c'est le péché, et la puissance du péché, la loi).
[15:57] Rendons grâce à Dieu qui nous a donné la victoire par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[15:58] Ainsi, mes frères bien-aimés, soyez fermes, inébranlables, faites sans cesse des progrès dans l'oeuvre du Seigneur, sachant que votre peine n'est pas vaine dans le Seigneur.
[16:1] Pour la collecte en faveur des fidèles, vous suivrez, vous aussi, les indications que j'ai données aux Églises de Galatie ;
[16:2] le premier jour de chaque semaine, chacun de vous mettra quelque chose de côté chez lui, et réunira ainsi ce qu'il peut donner pour que la collecte ne se fasse pas seulement à mon arrivée.
[16:3] Quand je serai là, j'enverrai au moyen d'une lettre ceux que vous aurez choisis porter vos offrandes à Jérusalem ;
[16:4] s'il convient que j'y aille moi-même, ils feront le voyage avec moi.
[16:5] Je viendrai chez vous en passant par la Macédoine ; je ne ferai, en effet, que la traverser,
[16:6] mais chez vous il est possible que je m'arrête et même que je passe l'hiver pour que vous me conduisiez là où j'irai.
[16:7] Je ne veux pas, cette fois, vous voir seulement en passant, et j'espère rester quelque temps avec vous, s'il plaît au Seigneur.
[16:8] Mais je resterai à Éphèse jusqu'à la Pentecôte,
[16:9] car une porte d'activité s'y est ouverte pour moi toute grande, et les opposants sont nombreux.
[16:10] Si Timothée vient, ayez soin qu'il n'ait rien à craindre au milieu de vous, car il travaille à l'oeuvre du Seigneur, tout comme moi.
[16:11] Que personne donc ne le méprise, et reconduisez-le en paix pour qu'il vienne auprès de moi, car je l'attends avec les frères.
[16:12] Quant à notre frère Apollos, je l'ai vivement engagé à aller chez vous avec les autres frères ; mais il ne veut décidément pas aller maintenant ; il ira quand il en aura le loisir.
[16:13] Veillez, soyez fermes dans la foi, soyez virils, soyez forts.
[16:14] Faites, tout dans un esprit d'amour.
[16:15] Encore une prière, mes frères! Vous connaissez la famille de Stephanas ; elle est la première de l’Achaïe qui ait cru, elle s'est dévouée au service des fidèles ;
[16:16] eh bien, ayez de la déférence pour des personnes semblables et pour quiconque agit et travaille avec elles.
[16:17] Je suis heureux de la visite de Stephanas, de Fortunatus et d'Achaïcus ; ils ont suppléé à votre absence ;
[16:18] car ils ont tranquillisé mon esprit et le vôtre. Sachez apprécier de tels hommes!
[16:19] Les Églises d'Asie vous saluent. Aquilas et Prisca vous envoient bien des salutations dans le Seigneur ainsi que l'Église qui s'assemble dans leur maison.
[16:20] Tous les frères vous saluent. Saluez vous les uns les autres d'un saint baiser.
[16:21] Je vous salue en écrivant moi-même : Paul.
[16:22] Si quelqu'un n'aime pas le Seigneur, qu'il soit anathème ! Maranatha.
[16:23] La grâce du Seigneur Jésus soit avec vous.
[16:24] Je vous aime tous en Jésus-Christ. 

### II Corinthians

[1:1] Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, et le frère Timothée, à l'église de Dieu qui est à Corinthe et à tous les fidèles qui sont dans l'Achaïe entière.
[1:2] grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:3] Béni soit le Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, Père des miséricordes et Dieu de toute consolation,
[1:4] qui nous console dans toutes nos afflictions, pour que nous puissions, à notre tour, consoler les autres dans toutes leurs afflictions, les consolant comme Dieu nous a consolés.
[1:5] Car si les souffrances du Christ débordent sur nous, par le Christ aussi déborde notre consolation.
[1:6] Sommes-nous affligés? c'est pour votre consolation et votre salut ; sommes-nous consolés ? c'est aussi pour votre consolation que vous trouvez en supportant patiemment des souffrances semblables à nos souffrances,
[1:7] et notre espérance à votre égard est inébranlable. Nous savons qu'ayant votre part de souffrances, vous aurez aussi votre part de consolations.
[1:8] Nous ne vous laisserons pas ignorer, frères, que nous avons été persécutés en Asie ; nous avons été absolument accablés ; nos forces étaient à bout, au point que nous désespérions même de conserver la vie.
[1:9] Nous en avions fait à part nous le sacrifice pour apprendre à ne pas nous confier en nous-mêmes, mais en Dieu qui ressuscite les morts.
[1:10] C'est lui qui nous a arrachés à ce grand danger de mort ; il nous y arrachera encore, oui, nous l'espérons, il nous y arrachera à l'avenir.
[1:11] Vous aiderez à cette délivrance par vos prières ; ainsi, plusieurs personnes nous auront obtenu ce bienfait, et plusieurs personnes en feront l'objet de leurs actions de grâces.
[1:12] Notre gloire à nous c'est le témoignage que nous rend notre conscience de nous être conduits dans le monde, et surtout à votre égard, avec la sainteté et la sincérité que Dieu demande, nullement par la sagesse mondaine, mais par la grâce de Dieu.
[1:13] Nous ne vous écrivons pas autre chose que ce que vous lisez et connaissez ; et j'espère que vous reconnaîtrez jusqu'à la fin
[1:14] (une partie d'entre vous l'ont déjà reconnu) que nous faisons votre orgueil et que vous ferez le nôtre le jour du Seigneur Jésus.
[1:15] Dans cette conviction, je voulais aller d'abord chez vous pour vous faire une double faveur :
[1:16] je me serais rendu de chez vous en Macédoine ; puis de Macédoine je serais revenu chez vous, et vous m'auriez aidé pour le voyage de Judée.
[1:17] Ai-je pris cette résolution avec légèreté? est-ce que, dans mes projets, je n'écoute que mes caprices? est-ce que je dis tantôt oui, tantôt non?
[1:18] Ah ! je le déclare, par la fidélité de Dieu, la parole que nous vous avons adressée n'a pas été tantôt oui, tantôt non ;
[1:19] le Fils de Dieu, Jésus-Christ, que nous vous avons prêché, Sylvanus, Timothée et moi, n'a pas été tantôt oui, tantôt non ;
[1:20] mais il a été oui. Toutes les promesses de Dieu sont oui en Jésus-Christ et nous prononçons par lui le mot Amen à la gloire de Dieu.
[1:21] Celui qui nous rend ainsi, vous et nous, fermes pour le Christ, et qui nous a oints, c'est Dieu.
[1:22] Il nous a aussi marqués de son sceau, et il a mis, à titre d'arrhes, son Esprit dans nos coeurs.
[1:23] Mais si je ne suis pas revenu à Corinthe, j'en prends Dieu à témoin, sur mon âme, c'est pour vous épargner ;
[1:24] non que nous dominions sur votre foi ; mais nous voulons contribuer à votre joie ; quant à la foi, vous y restez fermes!
[2:1] Je me suis donc décidé à ne pas revenir une seconde fois chez vous pour vous attrister
[2:2] (car si je vous attristais, que deviendrais-je, n'ayant pour m'égayer que celui que j'aurais attristé?) ; et je vous ai écrit.
[2:3] Je vous ai écrit pour qu'à mon arrivée ceux qui devaient me donner de la joie ne me fissent pas de chagrin ; j'étais convaincu, et cela de vous tous, que ma joie est aussi la vôtre à tous.
[2:4] J'étais profondément affligé, j'avais le coeur serré, je pleurais en vous écrivant, non que je voulusse vous faire de la peine, mais vous montrer l'amour sans bornes que j'ai pour vous.
[2:5] Si l'un de vous en particulier a été une cause de tristesse, ce n'est pas moi personnellement, non je ne veux pas l'accabler, c'est vous tous, en un sens, qu'il a attristés.
[2:6] Ce blâme général est pour lui un châtiment suffisant ; aussi vous faut-il au contraire lui accorder sa grâce et le consoler de peur qu'il ne succombe à un trop grand chagrin.
[2:7] Prenez donc, je vous prie, une décision charitable à son égard ;
[2:8] car j'avais un but en vous écrivant, je voulais vous mettre à l'épreuve et voir si vous m'obéissiez en toutes choses.
[2:9] Si vous lui accordez sa grâce, il a aussi la mienne ; et, quant à moi,
[2:10] si je l'accorde, c'est à cause de vous, c'est en présence du Christ que je l'accorde,
[2:11] et pour que nous ne fassions pas les affaires de Satan dont les desseins nous sont bien connus.
[2:12] J'étais allé à Troas pour annoncer l'Évangile du Christ, le Seigneur m'y ouvrait une porte,
[2:13] et cependant je n'y ai pas eu l'esprit en repos parce que je n'y ai pas rencontré mon frère Tite, aussi ai-je pris congé des frères, et suis-je parti pour la Macédoine.
[2:14] Grâces soient à Dieu qui nous fait sans cesse triompher en Christ et qui, en tout lieu, répand par nous sa connaissance comme on répand un parfum.
[2:15] Car le parfum de Christ c'est nous qui le sommes pour Dieu et parmi les sauvés et parmi ceux qui vont périr ;
[2:16] pour ceux-ci cette odeur vient de la mort et va à la mort, pour ceux-là elle vient de la vie et va à la vie ; — (à cette tâche qui suffira?) —
[2:17] nous ne sommes pas, en effet, comme le grand nombre, nous ne frelatons pas la parole de Dieu, mais c'est avec sincérité, mais c'est telle qu'elle vient de Dieu, c'est devant Dieu, c'est en Christ que nous la prêchons.
[3:1] Nous recommençons, n'est-ce pas, à faire nous-mêmes notre éloge? Aurions-nous peut-être besoin, comme certains individus, de lettres de recommandation pour vous ou de votre part?
[3:2] notre lettre, c'est vous ; écrite dans nos coeurs, reconnaissable et lisible pour tout le monde ;
[3:3] on sait bien que vous êtes une lettre de Christ rédigée par nous, écrite non à l'encre, mais par l'Esprit du Dieu vivant, non sur des tables de pierre, mais sur des tables de chair, sur vos coeurs.
[3:4] Une pareille assurance en Dieu, c'est du Christ que nous la tenons ;
[3:5] par nous-mêmes nous sommes incapables de rien concevoir, de rien tirer de notre propre fonds,
[3:6] toute notre capacité vient de Dieu, qui nous a rendus capables d'être ministres d'une Nouvelle Alliance, qui n'est pas de lettre, mais d'esprit ; car la lettre tue, et l'esprit vivifie.
[3:7] Si le ministère de la mort, gravé en lettres sur la pierre, a été si entouré de gloire que les enfants d'Israël ne pouvaient fixer le visage de Moïse, tellement il resplendissait d'un éclat maintenant anéanti,
[3:8] combien le ministère de l'Esprit ne sera-t-il pas plus glorieux?
[3:9] Si le ministère de la condamnation a été glorieux, le ministère de la justice sera beaucoup plus glorieux encore ;
[3:10] on peut même dire, dans un sens, que ce qui a été glorifié autrefois ne l'a pas été, en comparaison d'une gloire supérieure.
[3:11] Si, en effet, ce qui est anéanti a été glorieux, à plus forte raison ce qui est éternel sera glorieux.
[3:12] Cette espérance que nous avons nous remplit de hardiesse
[3:13] et nous ne faisons pas comme Moïse «qui se voilait la face» pour cacher aux regards des enfants d'Israël la fin d'un éclat périssable.
[3:14] Leur intelligence s'obscurcit, et aujourd'hui encore ce voile est là quand on leur lit l'Ancienne Alliance ; ils ne voient pas avec évidence que le Christ seul l'abolit.
[3:15] Oui, aujourd'hui encore, quand on leur lit Moïse, il y a un voile sur leur coeur.
[3:16] «Lorsqu'ils se convertissent au Seigneur, ce voile est enlevé ».
[3:17] C'est le Seigneur qui est l'Esprit ; là où est l'Esprit du Seigneur, là est la liberté ;
[3:18] et nous tous qui, le visage découvert, contemplons dans un miroir la gloire du Seigneur, nous nous transformons à son image ; sa gloire devient la nôtre comme cela doit se faire par l'Esprit du Seigneur.
[4:1] Voilà pourquoi, chargés par la miséricorde de Dieu d'un pareil ministère, nous ne faiblissons pas ;
[4:2] au contraire nous repoussons bien loin tout procédé secret et honteux, nous ne recourons pas à la ruse, nous ne falsifions pas la parole de Dieu, mais nous publions ouvertement la vérité, et ainsi nous nous recommandons nous-mêmes à toute conscience d'homme, et cela à la face de Dieu.
[4:3] (S'il reste encore un voile sur notre Évangile, c'est pour ceux qui vont périr que ce voile existe,
[4:4] pour les incrédules dont le dieu de ce monde a aveuglé les pensées, afin qu'ils ne soient point illuminés des splendeurs du glorieux Évangile du Christ, qui est l'image de Dieu.)
[4:5] Car nous ne nous prêchons pas nous-mêmes, mais Jésus-Christ le Seigneur ; et nous-mêmes nous sommes vos serviteurs à cause de Jésus.
[4:6] En effet, le Dieu qui a dit : «Que des ténèbres jaillisse la lumière», a fait aussi jaillir la lumière dans nos coeurs, pour que nous fassions resplendir la connaissance de la gloire de Dieu sur la face de Christ.
[4:7] Nous portons ce trésor dans des vases d'argile pour prouver que la puissance débordante de sa vertu vient de Dieu et non pas de nous ;
[4:8] nous sommes toujours surchargés, jamais écrasés ; tourmentés, jamais désespérés ;
[4:9] persécutés, jamais vaincus ; jetés à terre, jamais morts ;
[4:10] nous portons partout dans notre corps le martyre de Jésus, pour que, dans notre corps, se montre aussi sa vie.
[4:11] Nous sommes toujours livrés vivants à la mort à cause de Jésus pour que, dans la mort de notre chair, se montre aussi sa vie.
[4:12] Ainsi la mort exerce son pouvoir sur nous et la vie agit en vous.
[4:13] Nous avons le même Esprit de foi que dans ce passage de l'Écriture : «J'ai cru, c'est pourquoi j'ai parlé.» Nous croyons, nous aussi, voilà pourquoi nous parlons,
[4:14] sachant que celui qui a ressuscité le Seigneur Jésus nous ressuscitera avec Jésus et nous fera paraître avec vous devant lui.
[4:15] Tout cela à cause de vous et afin que la grâce de plus en plus abondante multiplie les actions de grâces d'un plus grand nombre d'entre vous pour la gloire de Dieu.
[4:16] Aussi nous ne faiblissons pas ; au contraire, si notre être extérieur tombe en ruines, notre être intérieur se renouvelle de jour en jour ;
[4:17] car un moment de légères afflictions nous vaut une somme immense, incalculable de gloire éternelle,
[4:18] à nous qui ne regardons pas aux choses visibles, mais aux invisibles, parce que les choses visibles ne durent qu'un temps, les invisibles sont éternelles.
[5:1] Nous savons, en effet, que si notre maison sur la terre, si notre tente vient à être détruite, nous avons un édifice fait par Dieu, une maison que la main de l'homme n'a point construite, qui est éternelle, qui est dans les cieux.
[5:2] Et alors nous soupirons dans cette demeure-ci, ayant un immense désir de revêtir celle qui vient du ciel, par-dessus l'autre,
[5:3] si toutefois nous avons déjà un vêtement, si ce n'est pas dans la nudité que nous sommes trouvés.
[5:4] Oui, nous qui vivons dans une tente, nous soupirons, nous sommes accablés, parce que nous ne voulons pas être dépouillés de notre vêtement, mais mettre l'autre par-dessus, afin que tout ce qui est mortel soit absorbé par la vie.
[5:5] Celui qui nous a formés à cet avenir c'est Dieu, et il nous a donné, à titre d'arrhes, l'Esprit.
[5:6] Nous sommes donc, en tout temps, pleins de courage (nous savons bien que demeurant dans le corps, nous demeurons loin du Seigneur,
[5:7] car nous marchons par la foi et non par la vue) ;
[5:8] nous sommes, dis-je, pleins de courage, et nous aimerions mieux sortir du corps et aller demeurer près du Seigneur.
[5:9] Voilà encore pourquoi nous faisons tous nos efforts, que nous en sortions, que nous y restions, pour lui être agréables.
[5:10] Nous tous, en effet, devons comparaître devant le tribunal du Christ pour y recevoir, chacun ce qu'il a mérité, d'après ce qu'il a fait, — pendant qu'il avait un corps, — soit en bien, soit en mal.
[5:11] Sachant ainsi qu'il faut craindre le Seigneur, nous cherchons à en persuader les hommes ; quant à Dieu, il nous connaît bien, et j'espère que, au fond de vos consciences, vous nous connaissez bien aussi.
[5:12] Nous ne voulons pas vous recommencer notre éloge, mais vous fournir l'occasion de faire valoir notre mérite et d'avoir à répondre à ceux pour lesquels l'apparence est tout et la réalité n'est rien ;
[5:13] (si, en effet, nous sommes des «exaltés», c'est pour glorifier Dieu ; si nous sommes pleins de bon sens, c'est pour votre bien ;)
[5:14] ce qui nous retient, c'est l'amour du Christ ; étant d'avis que si un seul est mort pour tous, alors tous sont morts,
[5:15] et lui il est mort pour tous afin que les vivants ne vivent plus pour eux-mêmes, mais pour celui qui est mort et ressuscité pour eux.
[5:16] Aussi ne connaissons-nous plus personne selon la chair ; si nous avons connu un Christ selon la chair, nous ne le connaissons plus aujourd'hui ;
[5:17] de plus, si quelqu'un est en Christ, il est une nouvelle créature ; les vieilles choses sont passées ; voyez, tout est devenu nouveau ;
[5:18] et tout cela vient de Dieu qui nous a réconciliés avec lui par Christ et nous a confié le ministère de la réconciliation ;
[5:19] et, en effet, Dieu a réconcilié le monde avec lui en Christ, en ne tenant plus compte des péchés des hommes et en nous chargeant de prêcher la réconciliation.
[5:20] C'est donc pour Christ que nous remplissons les fonctions d'ambassadeurs, comme si Dieu lui-même vous exhortait par nous ; c'est pour Christ que nous vous prions : réconciliez-vous avec Dieu.
[5:21] Celui qui n'a pas connu le péché, il l'a fait péché pour nous, afin que nous devenions en lui justice de Dieu.
[6:1] Nous sommes ses collaborateurs ; aussi vous exhortons-nous à ne pas recevoir inutilement cette grâce de Dieu ;
[6:2] (car il dit : «Au temps favorable, je t'ai exaucé, Au jour du salut, je t'ai secouru» ; eh bien, le voici ce temps particulièrement «favorable», le voici ce «jour du salut.»)
[6:3] Nous tâchons de ne jamais scandaliser personne et de ne donner aucune prise à la critique dans notre ministère ;
[6:4] au contraire nous nous faisons respecter comme ministres de Dieu par une grande patience dans les afflictions, dans les détresses, dans les angoisses,
[6:5] sous les coups, dans les cachots, dans les émeutes, dans les fatigues, dans les veilles, dans les jeûnes ;
[6:6] par la pureté, la science, la bienveillance, la douceur, un esprit saint, un amour sincère,
[6:7] une prédication véridique, une puissance de Dieu! nous servant des armes offensives et défensives de la justice ;
[6:8] tantôt honorés, tantôt vilipendés ; tantôt diffamés, tantôt considérés ; tenus pour imposteurs bien que véridiques ;
[6:9] pour obscurs quoique bien connus ; pour mourants et voilà que nous vivons ; pour gens que Dieu châtie et pourtant nous ne mourons pas ;
[6:10] pour tristes, nous qui sommes toujours dans la joie ; pour pauvres, nous qui enrichissons les autres ; pour dénués de tout, nous qui possédons tout!
[6:11] Notre bouche s'est ouverte pour vous, Corinthiens, notre coeur s'est élargi ;
[6:12] vous tenez une grande place dans ce coeur, et vous ne nous en faites aucune dans le vôtre!
[6:13] Ah! rendez-nous la pareille (je vous parle comme à mes enfants), faites-nous une large place!
[6:14] (Ne marchez pas de concert avec les incrédules ; la justice peut-elle s'accorder avec l'iniquité? la lumière s'entendre avec les ténèbres?
[6:15] le Christ peut-il s'unir à Bélial? le croyant partager avec l'incrédule?
[6:16] un temple de Dieu peut-il frayer avec des idoles? car nous sommes, nous, un temple du Dieu vivant, selon cette parole de Dieu : «J'habiterai au milieu d'eux, et j'y marcherai, je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple.»
[6:17] C'est pourquoi «Sortez du milieu d'eux et séparez-vous, dit le Seigneur ; Ne touchez pas à ce qui est impur Et moi je vous recevrai.
[6:18] Je serai donc pour vous un Père Et vous serez pour moi des fils et des filles, Dit le Seigneur tout-puissant.»
[7:1] Ayant de pareilles promesses, bien-aimés, purifions-nous de toute souillure de la chair et de l'esprit, achevant notre sanctification dans la crainte de Dieu.)
[7:2] Accueillez-nous ; nous n'avons fait tort à personne ; nous n'avons nui à personne ; nous n'avons exploité personne ;
[7:3] je ne dis pas cela pour vous faire un reproche, car, je l'ai déjà dit, vous êtes dans nos coeurs à la vie et à la mort.
[7:4] J'ai une grande confiance en vous ; je suis tout fier de vous ; je suis extrêmement consolé, je nage dans la joie, si grandes que soient nos afflictions.
[7:5] En effet, à notre arrivée en Macédoine, nous n'avons pas eu un moment de repos, nous étions éprouvés de toutes manières: combats au dehors, inquiétudes au dedans.
[7:6] Mais le Dieu qui relève ceux qui sont abattus nous a relevés par l'arrivée de Tite,
[7:7] par son arrivée et surtout par le bien qu'il avait reçu de vous ; car il nous a parlé de votre ardeur, de votre chagrin, de votre zèle pour moi ; et j'en ai eu une immense joie.
[7:8] Si ma lettre vous a fait de la peine, je ne le regrette pas ; je l'avais d'abord regretté (je vois bien que ma lettre vous a fait de la peine, du moins momentanément) ;
[7:9] aujourd'hui je suis heureux, non certes de votre chagrin, mais du repentir qu’il a produit. Vous avez été attristés selon Dieu, pour que nous ne vous causions aucun tort.
[7:10] La tristesse selon Dieu produit une repentance qui conduit au salut et qu'on ne regrette jamais ; la tristesse selon le monde amène la mort.
[7:11] Voyez plutôt : Votre tristesse selon Dieu, quel empressement elle a provoqué en vous ; bien plus, quelles excuses, quelle indignation, quelle crainte, quelle ardeur, quel dévouement, quelle sévérité! De toutes façons, vous avez tenu à vous montrer vous-mêmes innocents dans cette affaire.
[7:12] Du reste, si je vous ai écrit à ce sujet, ce n'était ni à cause de l'offenseur, ni à cause de l'offensé, c'était afin que votre dévouement pour nous éclatât parmi vous à la face de Dieu.
[7:13] Voilà ce qui nous a consolés. A cette consolation s'est ajoutée une immense joie : la vue de la joie de Tite ; vous lui avez tous mis l'esprit en repos.
[7:14] Si je vous avais un peu vantés devant lui, je n'ai pas eu à le regretter ; vous savez que nous vous avons toujours dit la vérité ; eh bien, l'éloge de vous que j'avais fait à Tite s'est trouvé de même être la vérité.
[7:15] Son affection pour vous est d'autant plus grande qu'il se souvient de votre déférence à tous et de la modestie respectueuse de votre accueil.
[7:16] Je suis heureux de l'entière confiance que je puis avoir en vous.
[8:1] Nous voulons vous informer, frères, de la grâce que Dieu a accordée aux Églises de Macédoine :
[8:2] très éprouvées et affligées, d'une extrême pauvreté, elles ont, avec une profonde joie, répandu à profusion les richesses de leur libéralité.
[8:3] Selon leurs moyens, j'en suis témoin, même au delà de leurs moyens, spontanément,
[8:4] allant jusqu'aux supplications pour recevoir de nous la faveur de les laisser participer à ce service destiné aux fidèles,
[8:5] et, dépassant notre attente, elles se sont données elles- mêmes au Seigneur d'abord, puis à nous par la volonté de Dieu.
[8:6] Aussi avons-nous engagé Tite à aller achever chez vous, comme il l'avait commencée, cette oeuvre de charité.
[8:7] D'ailleurs, vous êtes partout les premiers, par la foi, par l'éloquence, par la science, par l'ardeur du zèle, par l'amour que vous nous témoignez ; soyez aussi les premiers dans cette oeuvre de charité.
[8:8] Ce n'est pas un ordre que je vous donne, je vous cite seulement le zèle des autres pour éprouver la sincérité de votre amour.
[8:9] — (Car vous connaissez la grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ qui, étant riche, s'est fait pauvre pour vous, afin de vous rendre riches par sa pauvreté.) —
[8:10] C'est donc un simple avis que je vous donne, et vous n'avez pas besoin d'autre chose, vous qui avez non seulement commencé l'oeuvre les premiers, mais qui, les premiers, l'avez décidée, et cela dès l'année dernière.
[8:11] Maintenant donc, achevez votre oeuvre, et apportez à la terminer, selon vos moyens, l'ardeur que vous avez mise à la vouloir.
[8:12] Quand on donne de bon coeur, on est bien venu d'après ce qu'on a, non d'après ce qu'on n'a pas ;
[8:13] car il n'est pas question de se mettre dans la gêne pour mettre les autres à l'aise ;
[8:14] la règle c'est l'égalité. Aujourd'hui votre superflu servira à leurs besoins ; et un jour leur superflu servira à son tour à vos besoins, ainsi s'établira l'égalité,
[8:15] comme il est écrit : «Celui qui avait beaucoup ne surabondait pas, et celui qui avait peu ne manquait de rien.»
[8:16] Grâces soient rendues à Dieu d'avoir mis au coeur de Tite le même empressement pour vous ;
[8:17] car il a accueilli ma prière. Son zèle, du reste, est plus ardent encore, et il part de lui-même pour aller vous voir.
[8:18] Avec lui, nous envoyons un frère, loué par toutes les Églises de ce qu'il a fait pour l'Évangile,
[8:19] bien plus, délégué par elles pour nous accompagner dans notre voyage avec le produit de la collecte que nous avons faite pour la gloire du Seigneur lui-même et aussi de bon coeur.
[8:20] Nous tenons à éviter qu'on puisse dire du mal de nous à propos de l'abondante collecte que nous venons de faire.
[8:21] «Nous voulons être irréprochables, non seulement devant le Seigneur, mais aussi devant les hommes.»
[8:22] Avec eux, nous envoyons aussi un autre de nos frères, dont nous avons éprouvé le zèle plusieurs fois, en diverses occasions, et qui en a d'autant plus aujourd'hui qu'il est plein de confiance en vous.
[8:23] Quant à Tite, il est mon collègue et mon collaborateur auprès de vous ; quant à nos frères, ils sont les envoyés des Églises, la gloire de Christ.
[8:24] Prouvez donc et votre charité et l'éloge que j'ai fait de vous ; prouvez-les à la face des Églises!
[9:1] Quant au secours destiné aux fidèles, il est bien superflu que je vous en écrive ;
[9:2] car je sais votre bonne volonté, et je m'en fais gloire auprès des Macédoniens : «L'Achaïe, leur dis-je, est prête depuis l'année dernière», et votre zèle a été un stimulant pour la plupart.
[9:3] Et maintenant je vous envoie les frères pour que l'éloge que j'ai fait de vous ne reçoive pas en cela un démenti, et que vous soyez prêts comme je l'ai dit.
[9:4] Car enfin, si les Macédoniens arrivent avec moi et ne vous trouvent pas prêts, quelle honte pour nous (et permettez-moi d'ajouter, pour vous) qu'une telle confiance!
[9:5] J'ai donc jugé nécessaire de prier les frères de prendre les devants auprès de vous, pour vous faire organiser d'avance la libéralité annoncée, qu'elle soit prête, qu'elle soit une vraie libéralité et non une lésinerie.
[9:6] Écoutez ceci : Celui qui sème chichement, récoltera chichement et celui qui sème libéralement, récoltera aussi libéralement.
[9:7] Que chacun donne ce qu'il a décidé en son coeur de donner, sans chagrin, sans contrainte ; «Dieu aime celui qui donne joyeusement».
[9:8] Dieu peut vous combler de toutes ses grâces, de sorte qu'ayant toujours et en tout votre suffisance, vous ayez encore du superflu pour toutes les bonnes oeuvres,
[9:9] selon qu'il est écrit : «Il a répandu, il a donné aux pauvres, Sa justice demeure à toujours.»
[9:10] Celui qui fournit La semence au semeur, Et le pain dont il se nourrit» vous fournira, vous multipliera la semence et augmentera «les fruits de votre justice.»
[9:11] Vous serez ainsi comblés de richesses pour de grandes libéralités qui nous feront rendre, à nous, des actions de grâces à Dieu.
[9:12] Car l'accomplissement de cette oeuvre sainte n'aura pas seulement pour effet de subvenir aux besoins des fidèles, mais encore il y aura un excédent qui consistera en ferventes actions de grâces rendues à Dieu.
[9:13] Ils le glorifieront parce que ce secours leur aura prouvé votre soumission, votre adhésion à l'Évangile du Christ, votre libéralité, votre communion avec eux et avec tous.
[9:14] Ils prieront pour vous, ils éprouveront de l'affection pour vous en voyant les grâces dont Dieu vous a comblés!
[9:15] Ah! grâces à Dieu pour son ineffable don !
[10:1] C'est moi Paul qui vous demande au nom de la douceur et de la bonté du Christ, — oui, moi qui ai, a chez vous, des dehors Si modestes» et qui, «de loin, suis si hardi avec vous
[10:2] - c'est moi qui vous prie de ne pas m'obliger, à mon arrivée, de vous traiter avec la ferme hardiesse dont je me propose d'user envers certaines gens qui pensent que nous nous conduisons d'après des considérations charnelles.
[10:3] Sans doute nous vivons dans une chair mortelle, mais notre combat n'est pas charnel,
[10:4] nos armes de guerre ne sont pas charnelles ; au contraire elles sont divinement puissantes pour détruire des forteresses,
[10:5] pour renverser des raisonnements, pour abattre toute hauteur qui s'élève contre la science de Dieu, pour assujettir toute pensée au joug du Christ,
[10:6] et nous sommes prêts à punir toute désobéissance, aussitôt que votre obéissance à vous sera parfaite.
[10:7] Ah! ce sont les dehors que vous regardez? Eh bien, si quelqu'un croit être du parti de Christ, qu'il soit bien persuadé d'une chose : s'il est du parti de Christ, nous en sommes nous aussi!
[10:8] Et quand j'aurais été un peu trop fier du pouvoir que nous tenons du Seigneur (pour vous édifier, non pour vous ruiner), je n'aurais pas à en rougir,
[10:9] pour ne pas avoir l'air de vouloir vous «effrayer par mes lettres».
[10:10] «Ses lettres, dit-on, sont sévères, sont énergiques, mais, quand il est là, c'est un homme faible, et sa parole est bien peu de chose.»
[10:11] — Que celui qui parle ainsi soit bien convaincu de ceci : le langage que nous tenons de loin dans nos lettres, nous le tiendrons de près dans nos actes.
[10:12] Nous ne sommes pas assez osés pour nous confondre ou nous comparer avec certaines gens qui font leur propre éloge. Ceux-là se mesurent à leur propre mesure, ils se comparent à eux-mêmes ; ils sont peu intelligents.
[10:13] Nous, nous ne nous vanterons pas sans mesure ; nous resterons dans le ressort, dans le champ d'action dont Dieu nous a tracé la limite et qui nous a permis, entre autres, de parvenir jusqu'à vous.
[10:14] Nous n'étendons pas trop notre domaine, comme nous le ferions si nous n'étions pas arrivés jusqu'à vous, car c'est jusque chez vous que nous sommes allés prêcher l'Évangile du Christ.
[10:15] Nous ne nous vantons pas sans mesure en nous parant des travaux d'autrui ; nous espérons, au contraire, que votre foi se développera assez pour que nous puissions agrandir considérablement notre domaine en partant de chez vous
[10:16] et en suivant toujours nos limites ; et alors nous irons évangéliser au delà de chez vous, sans jamais nous vanter du champ d'action d'un autre et des travaux qu'il a terminés.
[10:17] «Celui qui veut se glorifier doit se glorifier dans le Seigneur.»
[10:18] Ce n'est pas celui qui se loue lui-même, qui aura bien soutenu l'épreuve, mais celui que le Seigneur loue.
[11:1] Ah! que je voudrais vous voir supporter un moment mes «folies» ; mais, oui, vous me supportez,
[11:2] parce que je vous aime avec jalousie, avec une sainte jalousie ; et je vous ai fiancés à un seul époux, au Christ, pour vous présenter à lui comme une vierge pure.
[11:3] Mais j'ai bien peur que, semblables à Ève séduite par les ruses du serpent, vos pensées ne soient corrompues et n'aient perdu leur candeur pour Christ.
[11:4] Si, en effet, on vient vous prêcher un autre Jésus que le nôtre, si on vous fait accepter un Esprit différent de celui que vous avez reçu, ou un Évangile différent de celui que vous avez accueilli, vous supportez cela parfaitement!
[11:5] Je crois, cependant, que je ne suis nullement au-dessous de ces archi apôtres !
[11:6] Si je parle comme un homme du peuple, je ne suis pas sans instruction ; et je vous l'ai bien montré en tout et pour tout.
[11:7] Ai-je fait une faute en m'humiliant moi-même pour vous élever, je veux dire en vous annonçant l'Évangile de Dieu gratis?
[11:8] J'ai dépouillé d'autres Églises, j'ai accepté d'elles un salaire pour pouvoir vous servir
[11:9] et quand j'étais chez vous, m'étant trouvé dans la gêne, je ne vous en ai pas importunés ; ce sont les frères venus de Macédoine qui m'ont donné ce qui me manquait. Je me suis gardé jusqu'au bout de vous être à charge, et je m'en garderai à l'avenir.
[11:10] Je prends Christ à témoin que cette gloire-là ne me sera pas enlevée dans les pays d'Achaïe!
[11:11] Pourquoi? parce que je ne vous aime pas? Ah! Dieu le sait!
[11:12] Mais j'agis et j'agirai toujours ainsi pour ôter tout prétexte à ceux qui ne veulent qu'un prétexte pour se dire mes égaux dans ce détail auquel ils tiennent tant!
[11:13] Ces hommes-là ce sont de faux apôtres, des ouvriers trompeurs, ils se déguisent en apôtres de Christ ;
[11:14] ce n'est pas étonnant ; Satan se déguise bien en ange de lumière,
[11:15] il n'est donc pas surprenant que ses ministres se déguisent en ministres de justice ; leur fin sera digne de leurs oeuvres.
[11:16] Je le répète, personne ne doit me croire «fou» ; ou bien, convenons-en, je suis «un fou», alors laissez-moi chanter un peu ma gloire.
[11:17] Ce que je vais dire, je ne le dirai pas selon le Seigneur, je parlerai comme a un fou» ;
[11:18] j'ai la prétention de chanter ma gloire ; il y en a tant qui chantent la leur, chantons aussi la nôtre!
[11:19] Vous qui êtes si sages, vous savez être indulgents pour les fous ;
[11:20] vous avez une étonnante patience avec ces gens qui vous asservissent, qui vous mangent, qui vous pillent, qui vous regardent de haut en bas, qui vous frappent au visage !
[11:21] Je suis honteux de le dire, mais nous nous sommes montrés bien faibles. Si ces gens-là se mettent en avant, moi, dans «ma folie», je le fais comme eux ;
[11:22] ils sont Hébreux? moi aussi je le suis ; ils sont Israélites? moi aussi je le suis ; ils sont de la race d'Abraham? moi aussi j'en suis.
[11:23] Ils sont ministres de Christ? (ici «ma folie» dépasse toute mesure), je suis bien plus ; oui, bien plus qu'eux par mes immenses travaux, par les innombrables coups que j'ai reçus, par mes emprisonnements multipliés, par les mille morts que j'ai souffertes.
[11:24] Cinq fois les Juifs m'ont appliqué leurs «quarante coups moins un» ;
[11:25] trois fois j'ai été bâtonné, une fois j'ai été lapidé, trois fois j'ai fait naufrage ; j'ai passé toute une nuit et un jour dans l'abîme ;
[11:26] et les voyages sans nombre, et les dangers en passant les fleuves, et les dangers du côté des voleurs, et les dangers du côté des Juifs, et les dangers du côté des païens, et les dangers dans les villes, et les dangers dans la solitude, et les dangers sur mer, et les dangers chez les faux frères,
[11:27] et les labeurs, et les fatigues, et les veilles répétées, et la faim, et la soif, et les jeûnes prolongés, et le froid, et le dénûment!
[11:28] Et, sans parler du reste, mes préoccupations quotidiennes! le souci de toutes les Églises!
[11:29] Qui vient à faiblir que je n'en souffre? Qui vient à tomber sans que j'en aie la fièvre !
[11:30] S'il faut me vanter, c'est de mes souffrances que je me vanterai :
[11:31] Le Dieu et Père du Seigneur Jésus (Béni soit-il à jamais! ) sait que je ne mens pas.
[11:32] A Damas, le gouverneur du roi Arétas faisait garder la ville pour m'arrêter,
[11:33] et c'est par une fenêtre, dans un panier, qu'on me fit descendre le long des murailles, et c'est ainsi que je parvins à m'échapper.
[12:1] Me vanter! ah! j'ai tort ; cependant j'en viens aux visions et aux révélations du Seigneur:
[12:2] Je connais un homme en Christ qui, il y a de cela quatorze ans (est-ce avec son corps, est-ce hors de son corps, je n'en sais rien, Dieu le sait), fut enlevé jusqu'au troisième ciel ;
[12:3] et je sais que cet homme (avec son corps ou sans son corps, je n'en sais rien, Dieu le sait) fut enlevé jusqu'au paradis
[12:4] et entendit des choses ineffables, qu'un homme ne doit pas répéter.
[12:5] Je me vanterai de cet homme-là ; mais de moi-même je ne me vanterai pas, sauf toutefois de mes souffrances ; et cependant si je voulais me vanter, je ne serais nullement «fou», je dirais la vérité ;
[12:6] mais je m'en abstiens pour que personne ne me pense supérieur à ce qu'il voit et entend quand je suis présent.
[12:7] D'ailleurs, pour que l'extraordinaire grandeur de ces révélations ne me jetât pas dans l'orgueil, il m'a été donné une écharde enfoncée en ma chair, c'est un ange de Satan, occupé à me souffleter, pour m'empêcher de m'enorgueillir.
[12:8] Trois fois j'ai prié le Seigneur de l'éloigner de moi, et il m'a dit : «Ma grâce te suffit, car la grandeur de ma puissance se montre surtout dans l'infirmité. »
[12:9] Je me vanterai donc bien plus volontiers de mes souffrances afin que la puissance du Christ repose sur moi.
[12:10] C'est pourquoi je me complais dans les souffrances, dans les insultes, dans les nécessités, dans les persécutions, dans les angoisses pour Christ, car lorsque je suis faible, c'est alors que je suis fort !
[12:11] Je viens de faire le fou ; vous m'y avez forcé ; c'est vous qui auriez dû faire mon éloge. En rien je n'ai été inférieur aux archiapôtres, et cependant je ne suis rien.
[12:12] Les signes de l'apôtre, miracles, prodiges, actes de puissance surnaturelle, je les ai opérés devant vous, avec une patience qui ne s'est jamais lassée.
[12:13] En quoi avez-vous été moins favorisés que les autres Églises, si ce n'est que je ne vous ai pas importunés de mes besoins? Pardonnez-moi cette injustice-là.
[12:14] Voici la troisième fois que je suis sur le point de venir chez vous, et cette fois-ci encore je ne vous importunerai pas. Ce que je recherche, ce ne sont pas vos biens, c'est vous-mêmes. Ce ne sont pas les enfants qui doivent thésauriser pour les parents, ce sont les parents pour les enfants.
[12:15] Quant à moi, je dépenserai volontiers tout ce que j'ai, et je me dépenserai moi-même pour le bien de vos âmes, quand même vous m'aimeriez d'autant moins que je vous aime davantage.
[12:16] «D'accord», dit-on, je ne vous ai pas été a directement à charge», mais comme je suis «un fripon»,
[12:17] je vous ai «pris de l'argent par ruse». — Est-ce que je vous ai fait exploiter par aucun de ceux que je vous ai adressés?
[12:18] J'ai prié Tite d'aller chez vous, et j'ai envoyé avec lui le frère que vous savez ; est-ce que Tite vous aurait exploités? n'avons-nous pas marché selon le même esprit et dans les mêmes traces?
[12:19] Vous croyez toujours que nous voulons vous faire notre éloge ? c'est devant Dieu, c'est en Christ que nous parlons ; et tout cela, mes bien-aimés, pour votre édification.
[12:20] Ah! je crains bien qu'à mon arrivée je ne vous trouve pas tels que je voudrais, et que vous, vous ne me trouviez tel que vous ne voudriez pas. Je crains qu'il n'y ait parmi vous des disputes, des jalousies, des colères, des rivalités, des calomnies, des bavardages,
[12:21] de l'insolence, du désordre ; je crains qu'à mon arrivée, mon Dieu ne m'humilie encore à votre sujet, et que je n'aie à pleurer sur plusieurs de vous qui auront été pécheurs et qui ne se seront pas repentis de l'impureté, de la corruption, des débauches auxquelles ils se seront livrés.
[13:1] Pour la troisième fois j'arrive chez vous. «Sur la déposition de deux ou de trois témoins se décidera toute affaire.»
[13:2] A mon second séjour j'ai déclaré, et aujourd'hui, de loin, je déclare de nouveau à ceux qui ont péché et à tous que si je viens encore à vous, je serai sans pitié.
[13:3] Puisqu'il vous plaît de tenter si c'est vraiment Christ qui parle en moi, vous verrez que, pour vous, il n'est pas faible, et qu'au contraire il fait éclater sa puissance parmi vous.
[13:4] Sans doute il a été crucifié dans sa faiblesse, mais il est vivant par la puissance de Dieu, et nous, de même, nous sommes faibles comme lui, mais nous vivrons avec lui et pour vous par la puissance de Dieu.
[13:5] Examinez-vous vous-mêmes pour voir si vous êtes dans la foi, mettez-vous vous-mêmes à l'épreuve ; peut-être ne reconnaissez-vous pas que Jésus-Christ est en vous? Mais alors l'épreuve tourne contre vous !
[13:6] J'espère en tout cas vous amener à reconnaître qu'elle ne tourne pas contre nous!
[13:7] Cependant nous demandons instamment à Dieu que vous ne fassiez rien de mal, car nous ne tenons pas à montrer que l'épreuve tourne pour nous ; nous désirons seulement que vous fassiez le bien, dût-on nous considérer comme manquant à notre devoir !
[13:8] Car nous n'avons aucun pouvoir contre la vérité, nous n'en avons que pour la vérité,
[13:9] et nous sommes joyeux de passer pour faibles, si vous, vous êtes forts. Aussi demandons-nous ceci à Dieu : que vous arriviez à la perfection.
[13:10] Si je vous écris tout cela de loin, c'est parce que je ne veux pas avoir, de près, à sévir et à user du pouvoir que je tiens du Seigneur (pour vous édifier et non pour vous ruiner).
[13:11] Enfin, frères, soyez joyeux, tendez à la perfection, acceptez les exhortations, soyez tous d'accord, vivez en paix, et le Dieu d'amour et de paix sera avec vous.
[13:12] Saluez-vous les uns les autres d'un saint baiser.
[13:13] Tous les fidèles vous saluent.
[13:14] Que la grâce du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, l'amour de Dieu et la communion du Saint-Esprit soient avec vous tous. 

### Galatians

[1:1] Paul, apôtre (non par la grâce des hommes ou par une institution humaine, mais par la grâce de Jésus-Christ et de Dieu le Père qui a ressuscité Jésus d'entre les morts)
[1:2] et tous les frères qui sont avec moi, aux églises de Galatie.
[1:3] Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu le Père et par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ,
[1:4] qui s'est donné lui-même pour nos péchés afin de nous délivrer de ce monde pervers où nous vivons, conformément à la volonté de notre Dieu et Père,
[1:5] auquel soit la gloire aux siècles des siècles ! amen.
[1:6] J'admire que si vite vous vous détourniez de celui qui vous a appelés par la grâce de Christ, pour adopter un autre Évangile!
[1:7] Un autre! il n'y en a point ; il n'y a que certains brouillons qui veulent pervertir l'Évangile du Christ!
[1:8] Eh bien, écoutez : Si jamais quelqu'un, fût-ce moi, fût-ce un ange du ciel, venait vous évangéliser autrement que je ne l'ai fait, qu'il soit anathème!
[1:9] Je viens de le dire, et je vous le répète : Si quelqu'un prêche autre chose que ce que vous avez appris, qu'il soit anathème!
[1:10] Est-ce la faveur des hommes que je cherche ou celle de Dieu? Est-ce aux hommes que je veux plaire? Ah! si j'en étais encore à plaire aux hommes, je ne serais pas serviteur de Christ!
[1:11] Je vous déclare, mes frères, que l'Évangile qui vous a été prêché par moi n'est pas d'origine humaine.
[1:12] Ce n'est pas même des hommes que je l'ai reçu ou appris, c'est d'une révélation de Jésus-Christ.
[1:13] Vous avez entendu parler de ma vie passée, quand j'étais dans le Judaïsme. Vous savez que je persécutais à outrance l'Église de Dieu, que je la ravageais.
[1:14] Vous savez que je surpassais dans mon Judaïsme bon nombre de ceux de mon âge et de ma race ; j'étais plus que fanatique de mes traditions nationales.
[1:15] Mais quand Celui qui m'a choisi dès le sein de ma mère et qui m'a appelé par sa grâce,
[1:16] jugea bon de me révéler intérieurement son Fils, pour que je fusse son évangéliste parmi les païens, sur-le-champ, sans prendre conseil de personne
[1:17] sans aller à Jérusalem, auprès de ceux qui étaient apôtres avant moi, je me retirai en Arabie, puis je revins à Damas.
[1:18] Ensuite, trois années plus tard, j'allai, il est vrai, à Jérusalem, pour faire la connaissance de Képhas ; et je passai quinze jours auprès de lui ;
[1:19] mais je ne vis aucun des autres apôtres, si ce n'est Jacques, le frère du Seigneur.
[1:20] Ce que je vous écris, j'affirme en présence de Dieu que ce n'est pas un mensonge!
[1:21] Je me rendis ensuite dans les provinces de Syrie et de Cilicie ;
[1:22] mais j'étais personnellement inconnu des Églises de Christ qui sont en Judée ;
[1:23] elles avaient seulement entendu dire ceci : «Notre ancien persécuteur prêche maintenant la foi que naguère il voulait détruire» ;
[1:24] et on rendait gloire à Dieu à mon sujet.
[2:1] Ensuite, quatorze années plus tard, je montai de nouveau à Jérusalem, avec Barnabas ; je pris aussi Tite avec moi.
[2:2] J'y montai sur une révélation ; je leur communiquai l'Évangile tel que je le prêche aux païens. J'eus des entretiens particuliers avec les plus considérés d'entre eux, de peur que mes courses passées ou présentes ne fussent inutiles.
[2:3] Eh bien, on n'exigea pas même que Tite qui, m'accompagnait, et qui était Grec, se fit circoncire.
[2:4] Cependant, par égard pour les intrus, les faux frères qui s'étaient glissés parmi nous pour espionner la liberté dont nous jouissons grâce à Jésus-Christ et qui voudraient nous remettre en esclavage...
[2:5] Nous ne leur avons pas cédé, nous ne nous sommes pas soumis un seul instant, afin que la vérité de l'Évangile fût maintenue pour vous.
[2:6] Quant à ceux que l'on considérait comme des personnages (ce qu'ils étaient jadis peu m'importe, Dieu ne fait pas acception de personnes)... ceux, dis-je, qui étaient considérés comme des personnages ne m'apprirent rien de plus.
[2:7] Au contraire, voyant que l'évangélisation des non-circoncis m'était confiée, comme l'était à Pierre celle des circoncis
[2:8] (car Celui qui a donné à Pierre la force d'être apôtre des circoncis m'a donné aussi à moi la force d'être apôtre des païens),
[2:9] connaissant, dis-je, la grâce qui m'avait été accordée, Jacques, Képhas et Jean, qui passaient pour les colonnes de l'Église, nous donnèrent la main, à Barnabas et à moi, en signe d'union, afin que nous fussions, pour les païens, ce qu'ils étaient pour les circoncis.
[2:10] Ils nous prièrent seulement de nous souvenir des pauvres ; aussi me suis-je empressé de le faire.
[2:11] Quand Képhas vint à Antioche, je lui résistai en face, parce qu’il avait évidemment tort.
[2:12] En effet, avant l'arrivée de certains individus, envoyés par Jacques, il mangeait avec les païens ; après leur arrivée, il se tint à l'écart, il s'isola, parce qu'il avait peur des partisans de la circoncision. Les autres Juifs firent les hypocrites avec lui,
[2:13] si bien que Barnabas lui-même fut entraîné dans cette hypocrisie.
[2:14] Alors, quand je vis qu'ils ne marchaient pas dans le droit chemin de la vérité de l'Évangile, je dis à Képhas devant tout le monde : «Si toi qui es Juif, tu agis comme les païens et non comme les Juifs, comment peux-tu obliger les païens à faire comme les Juifs?
[2:15] Nous autres, nous sommes Juifs de naissance ; nous ne sommes pas des pécheurs comme tous ces païens...»
[2:16] Sachant cependant que l'homme n'est pas justifié par les oeuvres de la Loi, mais qu'il l'est uniquement par la foi en Jésus-Christ. nous avons cru en Jésus-Christ pour être justifiés par cette foi. Ce n'est pas par les oeuvres de la Loi, parce que les oeuvres de la Loi &lt;&lt; Ne justifient aucune créatures.»
[2:17] S'il se trouve alors que nous, qui cherchons notre justification en Christ, nous sommes aussi des pécheurs, Christ aura été (ce qu'à Dieu ne plaise) un ministre de péché!
[2:18] Si je rebâtis ce que j'avais abattu, je me constitue moi-même prévaricateur!
[2:19] Pour moi, c'est par égard pour la Loi que je suis mort à la Loi, afin de vivre à Dieu.
[2:20] J'ai été crucifié avec Christ ; je ne vis plus, c'est Christ qui vit en moi. Le reste de vie que je traîne en la chair, je le vis dans la foi au Fils de Dieu a qui m'a aimé et s'est livré pour moi.
[2:21] Je ne veux pas anéantir la grâce de Dieu, et si la justice s'obtient par la Loi, alors Christ est mort pour rien!
[3:1] Ô Galates insensés! qui est-ce donc qui vous a ensorcelés, vous sous les yeux desquels on a fait passer l'image de Jésus-Christ crucifié!
[3:2] Je ne vous poserai qu'une question : Est-ce pour avoir observé la Loi que vous avez reçu l'Esprit, ou est-ce pour avoir entendu prêcher la foi?
[3:3] Que vous êtes donc fous! Vous avez commencé par l'Esprit, et puis vous finissez par la chair!
[3:4] Tant d'expériences pour rien! Et encore si c'était pour rien!
[3:5] Celui qui vous confère l'Esprit et qui fait des miracles parmi vous, agit-il ainsi parce que vous observez la Loi ou parce que vous avez entendu prêcher la foi?
[3:6] Souvenez-vous qu'Abraham «eut foi en Dieu et cela lui fut compté pour justice».
[3:7] Sachez donc que ceux qui ont la foi pour principe sont fils d'Abraham.
[3:8] L'Écriture a prévu que Dieu justifierait les païens par la foi, et elle a d'avance annoncé cette bonne nouvelle à Abraham :
[3:9] «Toutes les nations seront bénies en toi.» Ainsi ceux qui ont la foi sont bénis avec Abraham le croyant.
[3:10] Ceux qui en restent aux oeuvres de la Loi sont sous le poids d'une malédiction, car il est écrit : «Maudit est quiconque n'observe pas tout ce qui est écrit dans le Livre de la Loi de manière à le pratiquer.»
[3:11] De plus, il est bien évident que personne n'est justifié devant Dieu par la Loi, puisque : «Le juste vivra par la foi.»
[3:12] Or la Loi ne se base pas sur la foi, mais : «Celui qui pratiquera ces commandements aura la vie par eux.»
[3:13] Christ nous a rachetés de la malédiction de la Loi, en devenant malédiction pour nous, (puisqu'il est écrit: «Maudit est quiconque est pendu au bois»),
[3:14] afin que la bénédiction accordée à Abraham passât aux païens par Jésus-Christ, et que nous obtenions par la foi l'Esprit promis.
[3:15] Mes frères, quand un contrat est passé en bonne forme (je parle des usages du monde), personne ne peut l'annuler ou le modifier par addition.
[3:16] Or, c'est à Abraham que les promesses ont été faites et à sa postérité. Il n'est pas dit : «et à ses postérités», comme s'il s'agissait de plusieurs personnes, mais, comme pour parler d'une seule : «et à ta postérité.» Il s'agit de Christ.
[3:17] Eh bien, je dis ceci : Dieu ayant passé un contrat en bonne forme, la Loi venue quatre cent trente ans plus tard, ne peut le casser ; elle ne peut annuler la promesse.
[3:18] Si on obtient l'héritage par une Loi, il ne vient plus d'une promesse. Or ce qu'Abraham a reçu de Dieu, il l'a reçu par une promesse.
[3:19] Alors, pourquoi la Loi? elle a été ajoutée à la promesse à cause des transgressions, jusqu'à la venue de «la postérité» au sujet de laquelle les promesses avaient été faites. Elle a été promulguée par des anges et par le ministère d'un médiateur.
[3:20] Or, un médiateur ne dépend pas d'un seul parti. Dieu au contraire est un!.
[3:21] Y aurait-il alors une contradiction entre la Loi et les promesses? Pas le moins du monde. Ah! sans doute, s'il avait été donné une Loi capable de produire la vie,
[3:22] alors la justice viendrait de la Loi. L'Écriture a au contraire tout enfermé sous le péché, afin que la promesse soit réalisée, pour les croyants, par la foi en Jésus-Christ.
[3:23] Avant la venue de la foi, la Loi nous tenait prisonniers et nous gardait ;
[3:24] nous attendions la foi qui devait être révélée. La Loi a été pour nous ce qu'est un pédagogue ; elle nous a conduits au Christ, pour que nous fussions justifiés par la foi.
[3:25] Maintenant que la foi est venue, nous ne sommes plus soumis au pédagogue.
[3:26] Car vous êtes tous fils de Dieu par la foi en Jésus-Christ.
[3:27] Oui, vous qui avez tous été baptisés pour être à Christ, vous êtes revêtus de Christ.
[3:28] Il n'y a plus là ni Juif, ni païen ; ni esclave, ni libre ; ni homme, ni femme ; vous êtes tous un en Jésus-Christ.
[3:29] Et si vous êtes à Christ, vous êtes par conséquent de la famille d'Abraham, vous héritez en vertu de la promesse.
[4:1] Eh bien, voici ce que j'affirme : tant que l'héritier est mineur, il ne diffère en rien de l'esclave. Il possède tout l'héritage,
[4:2] et cependant il est sous des tuteurs et des administrateurs jusqu'au temps marqué par le père.
[4:3] De même nous, tant que nous étions mineurs, nous étions esclaves des prescriptions du monde.
[4:4] Quand le temps fut accompli, Dieu envoya son Fils, né d'une femme, né sous la Loi,
[4:5] pour racheter ceux qui étaient sous la Loi, et pour que nous jouissions des privilèges de fils.
[4:6] Et c'est parce que vous êtes fils, que Dieu a envoyé en nos coeurs l'Esprit de son Fils, s'écriant : Abba! c'est-à-dire Père!
[4:7] Vous n'êtes donc plus esclaves, vous êtes fils, et si vous êtes fils, vous êtes aussi héritiers, grâce à Dieu.
[4:8] Autrefois, ne connaissant pas Dieu, vous serviez des êtres qui ne sont pas dieux,
[4:9] mais maintenant que vous connaissez Dieu, bien mieux! que vous êtes connus de Dieu, comment retournez-vous à ces pauvres et misérables commencements, dont vous voulez de nouveau devenir esclaves?
[4:10] Vous observez certains jours, et les lunaisons, et les époques des fêtes, et certaines années !
[4:11] ah! j'ai bien peur pour vous de n'avoir travaillé chez vous en pure perte!
[4:12] Faites comme moi ; car moi, j'ai fait comme vous ; frères, je vous en supplie, jusqu'ici vous ne m'aviez fait aucun tort.
[4:13] Vous savez comme j'étais malade la première fois que je vous ai annoncé l'Évangile ;
[4:14] et vous ne m'avez pas méprisé, vous ne m'avez pas repoussé, quand ma chair passait ainsi par l'épreuve ; au contraire, vous m'avez reçu comme un ange de Dieu, comme Jésus-Christ !
[4:15] Qu'est devenue votre joie d'alors? Je vous rends témoignage que, Si vous l'aviez pu, vous vous seriez arraché les yeux pour me les donner.
[4:16] Et me voilà devenu votre ennemi, parce que je vous ai dit la vérité !
[4:17] Il y a des gens pleins de zèle pour vous, mais non en vue du bien ; ce qu'ils veulent c'est vous détacher de moi, pour que vous les aimiez seuls.
[4:18] S'aimer en vue du bien, c'est une belle chose ; mais il faut que cela dure, et ne pas seulement m'aimer quand je suis là.
[4:19] Oh ! mes enfants, vous que j'enfante de nouveau dans la douleur jusqu'à ce que Christ soit formé en vous,
[4:20] que je voudrais être près de vous dans ce moment, et changer de langage, car je suis bien inquiet de vous!
[4:21] Dites-moi, vous qui voulez être sous la Loi, n'entendez-vous pas la lecture de la Loi?
[4:22] Il y est écrit qu'Abraham avait deux fils, l'un de sa servante, l'autre de sa femme libre.
[4:23] Celui de la servante était né selon l'ordre de la nature, celui de la femme libre à la suite de la promesse.
[4:24] Tout cela est allégorique : ces femmes sont deux alliances, l'une, celle du mont Sinaï, a enfanté pour la servitude ; c'est Agar.
[4:25] (Le mot Agar désigne, en effet, le mont Sinaï en Arabie.) Elle correspond à la Jérusalem actuelle
[4:26] qui est en servitude avec ses enfants. Mais la Jérusalem d'en haut est libre, c'est notre mère à nous.
[4:27] Il est écrit, en effet : Réjouis-toi, femme stérile, qui n'as point enfanté! Pousse des cris de joie, élève la voix, toi qui n'as pas senti les douleurs maternelles, Car les enfants de la femme abandonnée sont plus nombreux Que ceux de la femme mariée.»
[4:28] Et nous, mes frères, nous sommes les vrais descendants d'Isaac, les enfants de la promesse.
[4:29] Mais comme alors le fils né selon l'ordre de la nature persécutait celui qui était né selon l'Esprit, il en est encore ainsi aujourd'hui.
[4:30] Mais que dit l’Écriture : «Chasse la servante et son fils, car le fils de la servante ne doit pas hériter avec le fils de la femme libre.»
[4:31] Ainsi, mes frères, nous ne sommes pas enfants de la servante, mais de la femme libre.
[5:1] Christ nous a libérés ; restez fermes dans cette liberté et ne reprenez pas le joug de l'esclavage.
[5:2] C'est moi, Paul, qui vous le dis : Si vous vous faites circoncire, Christ ne vous servira de rien.
[5:3] Je déclare encore une fois à tout homme qui se fait circoncire que cet acte l'oblige à observer toute la Loi.
[5:4] Vous êtes absolument séparés de Christ, vous tous qui cherchez la justification dans la Loi ; vous êtes déchus de la grâce.
[5:5] Nous, par l'Esprit, nous attendons de la foi l'espérance de la justification.
[5:6] Car, en Jésus-Christ, peu importe circoncision ou non-circoncision ; ce qui importe c'est la foi devenant active par l'amour.
[5:7] Vous couriez si bien! Qui donc vous a arrêtés, détournés de la vérité?
[5:8] Ah! ce conseil ne vient pas de Celui qui vous appelle!
[5:9] Un peu de levain fait lever la pâte tout entière...
[5:10] J'ai la confiance — dans le Seigneur — que vous reviendrez à penser comme moi... Quant à celui qui vous trouble, il portera la peine de tout ceci, quel qu'il soit
[5:11] Et moi, mes frères, je n'ai qu'à prêcher la circoncision, on ne me persécutera plus!
[5:12] mais alors la croix et son scandale sont anéantis Ah ! Je les voudrais plus que circoncis, ceux qui vous troublent
[5:13] Vous, mes frères, c'est à la liberté que vous avez été appelés ; mais que cette liberté ne vous entraîne pas vers la chair. Vous devez, en vous aimant, vous servir les uns les autres.
[5:14] Toute la Loi se résume d'un seul mot : «Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même.»
[5:15] Et si, les uns les autres, vous vous mordez et vous dévorez, prenez garde, les uns par les autres vous vous perdrez.
[5:16] Marchez, vous dis-je, sous la direction de l'Esprit et résistez aux passions de la chair.
[5:17] La chair, en effet, conspire contre l'Esprit, et l'Esprit contre la chair ; tous deux sont en lutte pour que vous ne fassiez pas ce que vous voudriez faire.
[5:18] Mais si l'Esprit vous conduit, vous n'êtes plus sous le joug de la Loi.
[5:19] Les oeuvres de la chair sont faciles à reconnaître ; c'est la fornication, l'impureté, la débauche,
[5:20] l'idolâtrie, la sorcellerie, les haines, les disputes, l'envie, la colère, les querelles, les factions, l'esprit de parti,
[5:21] les jalousies, l'ivresse, les orgies et autres choses semblables, et, je vous le déclare d'avance (je vous en ai déjà prévenus), ceux qui agissent ainsi n'auront pas en héritage le Royaume de Dieu.
[5:22] Le fruit de l'Esprit, au contraire, est l'amour, la joie, la paix, la patience, l'indulgence, la bonté, la fidélité, la douceur, la tempérance.
[5:23] Pour ceux qui vivent ainsi, il n'y a pas de Loi.
[5:24] Ceux qui sont à Jésus-Christ ont crucifié leur chair avec ses passions et ses désirs.
[5:25] Si nous vivons par l'Esprit, marchons aussi avec l'Esprit.
[5:26] Ne devenons pas vains et vaniteux en nous provoquant les uns les autres, et en nous portant mutuellement envie.
[6:1] Mes frères, lors même que vous surprenez un homme en faute, vous qui êtes dirigés par l'Esprit, corrigez-le avec douceur ; veille sur toi-même, que tu ne sois pas tenté, toi aussi.
[6:2] Supportez mutuellement le poids de vos fautes et accomplissez ainsi la loi du Christ ;
[6:3] car s'imaginer valoir quelque chose, quand on n'est rien, c'est se faire illusion à soi-même.
[6:4] Que chacun examine ses propres actes, et alors il gardera ses motifs de vanité pour lui seul, et il ne les gardera plus pour autrui.
[6:5] Chacun, en effet, aura son propre fardeau à porter.
[6:6] Celui à qui l'on enseigne la Parole de Dieu, doit faire part de tous ses biens à celui qui enseigne.
[6:7] Ne vous y trompez pas, on ne se moque pas de Dieu ; ce que l'homme sème, il le récolte.
[6:8] Celui qui sème dans sa chair, récoltera ce que produit la chair: la mort ; celui qui sème dans l'Esprit, récoltera ce que produit l'Esprit: la vie éternelle.
[6:9] Ne nous, lassons pas de faire le bien et, le moment venu, nous récolterons, si nous avons tenu bon.
[6:10] Maintenant que nous en avons l'occasion, faisons du bien à tout le monde, et surtout à nos frères dans la foi.
[6:11] Remarquez ces grands caractères, ils sont de ma main.
[6:12] Des gens qui veulent plaire par la chair, voilà ceux qui vous forcent à vous faire circoncire, et seulement pour n'être pas persécutés au nom de la croix du Christ.
[6:13] Car ces circoncis n'observent pas la Loi, mais ils veulent vous faire circoncire pour tirer gloire de votre chair.
[6:14] Pour moi, Dieu me garde de me glorifier, sauf de la croix de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Par lui le monde est crucifié pour moi, comme je le suis pour le monde.
[6:15] Il ne s'agit ni d'être circoncis, ni de ne pas l'être, mais d'être créé à nouveau.
[6:16] Sur tous ceux qui observeront cette règle, paix et miséricorde, ainsi que sur l'Israël de Dieu!
[6:17] Qu'à l'avenir personne ne me fasse de la peine, car je porte sur mon corps les stigmates de Jésus.
[6:18] La grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec votre esprit, frères. Amen 

### Ephesians

[1:1] Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, aux fidèles et aux croyants en Jésus-Christ qui sont à Ephèse.
[1:2] Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:3] Béni soit le Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, car il nous a comblés par Christ et dans les cieux de toutes sortes de bénédictions spirituelles ;
[1:4] il nous a élus en lui avant la création du monde, pour nous sanctifier et nous rendre irréprochables devant lui.
[1:5] Dans son amour, il a décidé d'avance que nous serions ses enfants par Jésus-Christ ; tel a été son bon plaisir, telle sa volonté.
[1:6] Honneur en soit à la grâce magnifique qu'il nous a faite en son bien-aimé !
[1:7] C'est en lui, par son sang, que nous avons la Rédemption, la rémission des péchés, tant est riche sa grâce,
[1:8] celle qu'il a répandue sur nous, en nous donnant toute sagesse et toute intelligence ;
[1:9] il nous a dévoilé le secret de sa volonté, ce dessein qu'il avait formé à part lui
[1:10] (et qu'il devait faire éclater le moment venu) de tout réunir en Christ, seul chef, ce qui est sur la terre, comme ce qui est dans le ciel.
[1:11] C'est aussi par le Christ que nous appartenons à Dieu, désignés à cela d'avance, prédestinés par Celui qui fait tout à son gré et à sa volonté,
[1:12] pour que nous servions à le louer et à le glorifier, nous qui les premiers avons espéré en lui.
[1:13] C'est aussi par le Christ que vous avez entendu la parole de vérité, l'Évangile qui vous sauve ; enfin c'est par lui que vous avez cru et que vous avez été marqués du sceau de l'Esprit saint promis,
[1:14] gage de notre héritage futur et de la Rédemption de ceux qui appartiennent à Dieu. Honneur en soit à sa gloire!
[1:15] Voilà pourquoi, moi, qui ai entendu parler de votre foi au Seigneur Jésus et de votre amour pour tous les fidèles,
[1:16] je ne cesse de rendre grâces pour vous et de vous nommer dans mes prières.
[1:17] Je demande au Dieu de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, au Père de gloire, de vous donner un esprit de sagesse et de révélation ; que vous appreniez à le connaître ;
[1:18] qu'il éclaire les yeux de vos coeurs ; que vous sachiez à quelle espérance il vous appelle ; quelle est la richesse et la gloire de l'héritage offert par lui aux fidèles ;
[1:19] quelle est la grandeur, l'immensité de la puissance qu'il exerce en nous les croyants, quand il fait agir la vertu de sa force.
[1:20] Il a fait agir cette force en Christ, en le ressuscitant des morts, en le plaçant à sa droite dans les cieux,
[1:21] au-dessus de toute autorité, puissance, pouvoir, souveraineté, ou de tout autre titre à donner, non seulement dans ce monde, mais aussi dans l'autre ;
[1:22] «En mettant tout à ses pieds,» en le donnant comme chef suprême à l'Église,
[1:23] qui est son corps, qui est le tout, qu'il remplit partout et de toutes manières.
[2:1] Vous aussi, vous étiez morts par les fautes, par les péchés
[2:2] auxquels vous vous êtes autrefois livrés sous l'influence de notre siècle mondain, sous l'influence de celui qui commande aux puissances qui sont dans l'air, je parle de cet Esprit qui agit aujourd'hui dans les hommes rebelles.
[2:3] Oui, nous tous, nous cédions autrefois à nos passions charnelles, nous obéissions à tous les caprices de la chair et des sens, et nous étions naturellement enfants de colère comme les autres hommes.
[2:4] Mais Dieu, dans la richesse de sa miséricorde et au nom du grand amour dont il nous aimait,
[2:5] nous a fait revivre avec le Christ, nous que nos fautes avaient déjà fait mourir (c'est par grâce que vous êtes sauvés) ;
[2:6] il nous a ressuscités, et nous a assigné une place dans les cieux par Jésus-Christ.
[2:7] Ainsi montre-t-il à tous les âges à venir l'extraordinaire richesse de sa grâce, par la bonté qu'il a eue pour nous en Jésus-Christ ;
[2:8] car c'est par la grâce que vous êtes sauvés, au moyen de la foi ; et cela ne vient pas de vous, c'est un don de Dieu.
[2:9] Ce n'est pas l'effet de vos oeuvres, et personne n'a à s'en glorifier ;
[2:10] car nous sommes son ouvrage ; nous avons été créés en Jésus-Christ pour faire de bonnes oeuvres, et Dieu nous a rendus d'avance capables de les pratiquer.
[2:11] Souvenez-vous donc qu'autrefois, vous, païens de naissance, ceux qui s'appelaient les circoncis, parce qu'ils l'étaient de main d'homme dans leur corps, vous appelaient les incirconcis ;
[2:12] souvenez-vous, dis-je, que vous étiez alors sans Christ, privés du droit de cité en Israël, étrangers aux alliances et aux promesses, n'ayant ni espérance ni Dieu dans le monde.
[2:13] Maintenant, au contraire, étant en Jésus-Christ, vous qui étiez autrefois éloignés, vous vous êtes rapprochés par le sang du Christ.
[2:14] Car c'est lui qui est notre paix ; il a réuni les deux peuples, il a abattu le mur de séparation, il a fait disparaître leur inimitié
[2:15] en anéantissant par sa mort, la Loi, les ordonnances, les commandements ; de la sorte il a formé en lui-même, avec les deux hommes, un seul homme nouveau, il a fait, la paix,
[2:16] et, tous deux, réunis en un seul corps, il les a réconciliés avec Dieu par la croix, sur laquelle il fit mourir en sa personne leur inimitié.
[2:17] Il est venu vous annoncer «La paix» à vous «qui étiez au loin comme à ceux qui étaient près».
[2:18] Car, grâce à lui, nous pouvons avoir, tous les deux, accès auprès du Père dans un même Esprit.
[2:19] Vous n'êtes donc plus ni étrangers, ni intrus, vous êtes concitoyens des saints et membres de la famille de Dieu ;
[2:20] vous avez été édifiés sur le fondement posé par les apôtres qui sont aussi prophètes, fondement dont la pierre angulaire est Jésus-Christ.
[2:21] L'édifice entier, solidement élevé sur elle, deviendra un saint temple dans le Seigneur ;
[2:22] et c'est sur elle que vous aussi avez été élevés pour servir à Dieu d'habitation spirituelle.
[3:1] Voilà pourquoi, moi Paul, prisonnier de Jésus-Christ, pour vous païens...
[3:2] Vous savez quelle charge Dieu, dans sa grâce, m'a conférée auprès de vous,
[3:3] et comment c'est une révélation qui m'a initié au mystère ; je viens de vous en dire quelques mots.
[3:4] Vous pouvez comprendre, en les lisant, l'intelligence que j'ai de ce mystère du Christ.
[3:5] Dans les autres âges, les hommes ne l'ont pas connu, tel que l'Esprit vient de le révéler aux saints apôtres du Christ, qui sont aussi prophètes.
[3:6] Le voici: les païens héritent avec nous, ils font partie avec nous du même corps ; ils ont leur part de la même promesse faite en Jésus-Christ et par l'Évangile,
[3:7] et j'en ai été fait ministre ; c'est un don de la grâce de Dieu qui m'a été accordé par sa puissante intervention.
[3:8] Oui, cette grâce m'a été faite, à moi le moindre des fidèles, d'annoncer aux païens l'insondable richesse du Christ,
[3:9] et d'éclairer tout le monde sur la vraie nature du mystère caché de toute éternité en Dieu, créateur de l'univers.
[3:10] Il faut que maintenant les puissances et les pouvoirs qui le règnent dans les cieux apprennent de l'Église à connaître l'infinie sagesse de Dieu.
[3:11] C'est là l'éternel dessein que Dieu avait formé en Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[3:12] C'est en lui, c'est par la foi en lui que nous nous approchons de Dieu avec courage et confiance.
[3:13] Voilà pourquoi je vous prie de ne pas perdre courage à cause des tribulations que j'endure pour votre bien. Elles sont plutôt pour vous un sujet de gloire.
[3:14] Voilà pourquoi aussi je me mets à genoux devant le Père
[3:15] (qui donne son nom à tout ce qui est famille, soit dans le ciel, soit sur la terre ),
[3:16] pour qu'il vous accorde, dans sa glorieuse richesse, d'être puissamment fortifié par son Esprit dans votre être intérieur ;
[3:17] qu'il fasse que le Christ habite dans vos coeurs, par la foi ; que vous preniez racine dans l'amour ;
[3:18] qu'en lui, vous ayez votre fondement ; que vous arriviez à comprendre, avec tous les fidèles, quelle en est la largeur, la longueur, la profondeur, la hauteur ;
[3:19] que vous connaissiez l'amour du Christ qui dépasse toute connaissance, et qu'enfin vous soyez remplis de toute la plénitude de Dieu.
[3:20] A celui qui peut faire, pour nous, beaucoup plus, infiniment plus que tout ce que nous demandons et comprenons, grâce à sa puissance qui agit en nous,
[3:21] à lui soit gloire dans l'Église et en Jésus-Christ de génération en génération et aux siècles des siècles. Amen.
[4:1] Je vous exhorte donc, moi qui suis prisonnier dans le Seigneur,, à vivre d'une manière digne de l'appel qui vous a été adressé,
[4:2] avec une entière humilité, avec douceur, avec patience ; supportez-vous avec amour les uns les autres,
[4:3] efforcez-vous de conserver l'unité de l'esprit par le lien de la paix.
[4:4] Il n'y a qu'un corps, qu'un Esprit, comme il n'y a qu'une espérance, celle de l'appel qui vous a été adressé.
[4:5] Il n'y a qu'un Seigneur, qu'une foi, qu'un baptême,
[4:6] qu'un Dieu, Père de tous, au-dessus de tous, qui agit par tous, qui est en tous.
[4:7] Mais à chacun de nous a été donnée la grâce selon la mesure de la libéralité du Christ.
[4:8] Voilà pourquoi il dit : «Il est monté dans les hauteurs, Il a emmené des captifs, Il a fait des présents aux hommes.»
[4:9] Que suppose ce mot : «il est monté»? Que d'abord il était descendu dans des régions inférieures, sur la terre.
[4:10] Celui qui est descendu est le même que celui qui est monté au-dessus de tous les cieux, afin de tout remplir.
[4:11] C'est lui aussi qui a donné aux uns d'être apôtres ; à d'autres, d'être prophètes ; à d'autres, d'être évangélistes ;
[4:12] à d'autres, d'être pasteurs et docteurs, et leur ministère doit servir aux progrès des fidèles, à l'édification du corps du Christ,
[4:13] jusqu'à ce que nous soyons tous arrivés à l'unité de la foi et de la connaissance du Fils de Dieu, à une virile maturité, à la hauteur de la parfaite stature du Christ.
[4:14] Il veut que nous ne soyons plus des enfants, entraînés par tous les courants, emportés par tout vent de doctrine, joués par les hommes, trompés par leurs ruses qui égarent.
[4:15] Il veut que fidèles, avec amour, à la vérité, nous grandissions à tous égards, pour atteindre celui qui est la tête, le Christ.
[4:16] C'est de lui que le corps entier bien proportionné, bien lié, solidement pourvu de nombreuses jointures, tire son développement, chaque membre selon ses forces, pour s'édifier lui-même et croître dans l'amour.
[4:17] Voici donc ce que je vous demande, ce dont je vous conjure au nom du Seigneur : ne vivez plus comme vivent les païens dont la raison est égarée,
[4:18] dont l'intelligence est obscurcie, qui sont étrangers à la vie de Dieu, par suite de l'ignorance où ils sont, et de l'endurcissement de leur coeur.
[4:19] Ils ont perdu tout sens moral, ils se sont livrés à la débauche, à la pratique de toute sorte d'impureté et à l'avarice.
[4:20] Mais vous, ce n'est pas ainsi qu'on vous a enseigné, le Christ,
[4:21] puisque vous en avez entendu parler et qu'on vous a appris à son école
[4:22] (et c'est la vérité en Jésus) à vous défaire, comme l'exige votre conduite passée, du vieil homme corrompu par de trompeuses passions,
[4:23] à renouveler votre esprit, votre intelligence,
[4:24] à revêtir le nouvel homme créé à l'image de Dieu dans une justice et une sainteté inséparables de la vérité.
[4:25] Ainsi donc renoncez au mensonge ; «Que chacun dise la vérité à son prochain», car nous sommes membres les uns des autres.
[4:26] «Dans la colère ne péchez pas» ; que le soleil ne se couche pas sur votre colère ;
[4:27] n'offrez aucune prise au Diable.
[4:28] Que le voleur ne commette plus de vol, qu'il occupe plutôt ses mains à quelque bon travail pour qu'il puisse donner à celui qui est dans le besoin.
[4:29] Que votre bouche ne prononce jamais de mauvaises paroles, mais, à l'occasion, dites quelques bonnes paroles édifiantes qui fassent du bien à ceux qui les entendent.
[4:30] N'attristez pas le saint Esprit de Dieu, dont vous avez reçu le sceau pour le jour de la délivrance.
[4:31] Que tout ce qui est amertume, violence, colère, crierie, médisance, soit banni d'entre vous,
[4:32] et aussi tout ce qui est méchanceté. Soyez bons les uns pour les autres, pleins de tendresse, pardonnez-vous mutuellement, comme Dieu vous a pardonné en Christ.
[5:1] Devenez donc imitateurs de Dieu, comme des enfants bien-aimés ;
[5:2] et appliquez-vous à l'amour à l'exemple du Christ qui vous a aimés et qui s'est lui-même livré pour nous a offrande et sacrifice, parfum d'une odeur agréable à Dieu».
[5:3] Que ni la débauche, ni une impureté quelconque, ni l'avarice ne soient même nommées parmi vous, comme il convient à des fidèles.
[5:4] Point de paroles indécentes, point de niaiseries, point de plaisanteries, ce n'est pas convenable. Prononcez plutôt des actions de grâces.
[5:5] Vous savez, en effet, vous reconnaissez que ni débauché, ni impur, ni avare (l'avare est un idolâtre), ne possèdent d'héritage dans le Royaume du Christ et de Dieu.
[5:6] Que personne ne vous trompe par de vaines paroles : c'est bien à cause de ces vices que la colère de Dieu frappe les hommes rebelles.
[5:7] N'ayez donc rien de commun avec eux.
[5:8] Car autrefois vous étiez ténèbres, aujourd'hui vous êtes lumière dans le Seigneur. Vivez comme des enfants de lumière.
[5:9] (Le fruit de la lumière c'est tout ce qui est bonté, justice, vérité.)
[5:10] Examinez ce qui est agréable au Seigneur,
[5:11] ne vous associez pas aux oeuvres stériles des ténèbres ; faites mieux : condamnez-les ouvertement.
[5:12] Ce que les païens font en secret, on a honte même de le dire.
[5:13] Mais tout ce que l'on condamne ouvertement est dévoilé, mis en pleine lumière, car tout ce qu'on dévoile, on le met en pleine lumière.
[5:14] C'est pour cela qu'il dit: «Réveille-toi, toi qui dors, relève-toi d'entre les morts, et le Christ t'éclairera.»
[5:15] Veillez donc avec le plus grand soin sur votre conduite ; n'agissez pas en insensés, mais en hommes sages,
[5:16] profitant des occasions, car les temps sont mauvais.
[5:17] Ainsi ne devenez pas déraisonnables, et comprenez ce que veut le Seigneur.
[5:18] «Ne vous enivrez»... pas le vin mène à l'intempérance ; soyez au contraire remplis de l'Esprit.
[5:19] Parlez-vous en psaumes, en hymnes, en chants spirituels, chantez et psalmodiez du fond du coeur au Seigneur.
[5:20] Rendez toujours grâces de tout au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ à Dieu notre Père.
[5:21] Soumettez-vous les uns aux autres dans la crainte de Christ.,
[5:22] Que les femmes soient soumises, chacune à son mari, comme au Seigneur.
[5:23] Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme le Christ est le chef de l'Église, lui, le Sauveur du corps ;
[5:24] de même que l'Église est soumise au Christ, de même les femmes doivent se soumettre en tout à leurs maris.
[5:25] Vous, maris, aimez vos femmes, comme le Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est lui-même livré pour elle,
[5:26] pour la sanctifier par sa parole après l'avoir purifiée et lavée dans l'eau,
[5:27] afin de faire paraître à ses yeux cette Église, brillante de beauté, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable, mais sainte et sans défaut.
[5:28] De même aussi, les maris doivent aimer leurs femmes, car elles font partie d'eux-mêmes, et celui qui aime sa femme s'aime lui-même.
[5:29] Personne ne se met à haïr son corps ; on le nourrit au contraire ; on en prend soin, et c'est ainsi que le Christ en use envers l'Église,
[5:30] envers nous qui sommes les membres de son corps.
[5:31] «A cause de cela l'homme laissera son père et sa mère et s'attachera à sa femme, et ils seront deux dans une chair.»
[5:32] Ce passage est bien mystérieux ; moi, je l'explique en l'appliquant à Christ et à l'Église.
[5:33] En tout cas, chacun parmi vous doit aimer sa femme comme soi-même, et la femme doit respecter son mari.
[6:1] Vous, enfants, obéissez à vos parents selon le Seigneur ; c'est justice :
[6:2] «Respecte ton père et ta mère.» Voilà un commandement capital à cause de cette promesse :
[6:3] «afin d'être heureux et de vivre longtemps sur la terre.»
[6:4] Et vous, qui êtes pères, n'irritez pas vos enfants, mais élevez-les en les instruisant et les avertissant selon le Seigneur.
[6:5] Vous, qui êtes esclaves, obéissez à ceux qui sont vos maîtres sur la terre, dans la crainte, dans l'humilité, dans la droiture de votre coeur, comme au Christ,
[6:6] et non pas seulement quand ils ont l'oeil sur vous, comme si vous n'aviez à satisfaire que des hommes, mais, esclaves de Christ, faites la volonté de Dieu de toute votre âme.
[6:7] Servez-les avec affection, comme s'il s'agissait du Seigneur et non pas d'hommes,
[6:8] et sachez, que chacun sera récompensé par le Seigneur selon le bien qu'il aura fait, qu'il soit esclave ou qu'il soit libre.
[6:9] Et vous, maîtres, agissez de même envers eux, laissez là les menaces, car vous savez que leur maître et le vôtre est dans les cieux, et qu'il n'a pas égard à la condition des personnes.
[6:10] Enfin, cherchez votre force dans le Seigneur, dans sa vertu, dans sa puissance.
[6:11] Revêtez l'armure de Dieu afin de pouvoir résister aux manoeuvres du Diable.
[6:12] Car nous avons à combattre, non contre des adversaires de chair et de sang, mais contre les chefs, les souverains, les dominateurs de ce monde de ténèbres, contre les mauvais Esprits des régions célestes.
[6:13] Prenez donc l'armure de Dieu afin de pouvoir résister dans les mauvais jours et rester debout après avoir triomphé de tout.
[6:14] Tenez ferme ; «Que la vérité soit la ceinture de vos reins.» «Que la justice soit votre cuirasse.»
[6:15] «Que vos pieds aient pour chaussures la préparation à suivre Évangile de paix. »
[6:16] Par-dessus tout, prenez le bouclier de la foi ; avec lui vous pourrez éteindre tous les traits enflammés du Malin.
[6:17] Saisissez aussi «le casque du salut» et «l'épée de l'Esprit», c'est-à-dire la Parole de Dieu.
[6:18] Priez Dieu ardemment, suppliez-le en toute occasion et par l'Esprit. Montrez là de la vigilance, beaucoup de persévérance ; priez pour tous les fidèles,
[6:19] ainsi que pour moi ; qu'il me soit donné,, quand j'ouvre la bouche, de parler courageusement, de faire connaître le mystère de l'Évangile
[6:20] (moi, son ambassadeur, et qui suis aux fers) ; oui, que j'en parle avec assurance, comme je le dois.
[6:21] Pour que vous sachiez, vous aussi, où j'en suis et ce que je fais, le bien-aimé frère Tychique, un fidèle ministre du Seigneur, vous dira tout.
[6:22] Je vous l'envoie dans ce but ; vous saurez par lui où nous en sommes, et il consolera vos coeurs.
[6:23] La paix soit avec les frères, et l'amour, uni à la foi, accordé par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[6:24] La grâce soit avec tous ceux qui aiment notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ d'une manière inaltérable. 

### Philippians

[1:1] Paul et Timothée, serviteurs de Jésus-Christ, à tous les fidèles en Jésus-Christ qui sont à Philippes ainsi qu'aux conducteurs de l'église et aux diacres.
[1:2] grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:3] Je rends grâces à mon Dieu chaque fois que je me souviens de vous.
[1:4] Sans cesse, dans toutes mes prières, je le prie pour vous tous avec joie,
[1:5] parce que vous êtes restés fidèles à l'Évangile depuis le premier jour jusqu'à maintenant.
[1:6] Je suis persuadé que celui qui a commencé cette bonne oeuvre en vous la mènera à bonne fin jusqu'au jour de Jésus-Christ.
[1:7] En pensant ainsi de vous tous, je ne fais que vous rendre justice, car je vous porte dans mon coeur. Que je sois en prison, que je défende et prêche l'Évangile, vous prenez tous une si vive part à la grâce qui m'est faite!
[1:8] Dieu m'est témoin que j'éprouve pour vous tous la tendresse de Jésus-Christ !
[1:9] Et je demande ceci : que votre amour aille toujours en grandissant, et qu'il vous donne de l'intelligence
[1:10] et toute sorte de discernement, que vous appréciiez toutes choses à leur juste valeur, que vous arriviez purs et irréprochables à la journée de Christ,
[1:11] riches des fruits de la justice qui viennent de Jésus-Christ, à la gloire et à la louange de Dieu.
[1:12] Je veux que vous sachiez, mes frères, que ma position a été plutôt un avantage pour l’Évangile.
[1:13] En effet, on a parfaitement su dans tout le prétoire et dans le public que j'étais prisonnier pour la cause de Christ,
[1:14] et la plupart de nos frères rassurés, grâce au Seigneur, sur ma détention, ont plus de hardiesse, moins de crainte pour annoncer la parole de Dieu.
[1:15] Il en est, sans doute, qui prêchent le Christ par jalousie et pour faire de la polémique, mais d'autres le font dans des dispositions bienveillantes.
[1:16] Ceux-ci sont pleins d'affection, parce qu'ils savent que je suis chargé de défendre l'Évangile ;
[1:17] ceux-là ont un esprit de parti, ils annoncent le Christ sans loyauté ; ils pensent aggraver ma situation de prisonnier.
[1:18] Qu'importe après tout? Avec ou sans arrière-pensée, Christ est de toutes manières annoncé, et je m'en réjouis et m'en réjouirai toujours.
[1:19] Car je sais que «Cela tournera à mon salut», grâce à vos prières et au secours de l'Esprit de Jésus-Christ.
[1:20] J'ai la conviction, j'ai le ferme espoir de n'être en rien confondu ; au contraire, je serai plein de hardiesse, et, maintenant comme toujours, mon corps, que je vive ou que je meure, servira à la gloire de Christ.
[1:21] Pour moi, Christ est ma vie et mourir est un avantage!
[1:22] Si, d'un autre côté, ma vie se prolonge, je verrai fructifier mon oeuvre ; aussi ne sais-je lequel préférer.
[1:23] Je suis arrêté entre deux désirs contraires : d'un côté celui de partir et d'être avec Christ, c'est de beaucoup ce que je préférerais ;
[1:24] de l'autre, celui de rester dans cette vie, et à cause de vous c'est nécessaire.
[1:25] Aussi ai-je la confiance, la certitude que je resterai, que je resterai avec vous tous pour vos progrès dans la joie et dans la foi ;
[1:26] et ainsi mon retour auprès de vous vous fournira l'occasion de rendre gloire à mon sujet à Jésus-Christ.
[1:27] Seulement que votre conduite soit digne de l'Évangile du Christ ;, que je vienne vous voir ou que je reste absent, il me faut apprendre que vous restez fermes, tous dans le même esprit, luttant d'un commun accord pour la foi de l'Évangile,
[1:28] ne vous laissant intimider en rien par les adversaires ; cette fermeté sera un signe évident de ruine pour eux, de salut pour vous, et cela de la part de Dieu.
[1:29] Car il vous aura fait la grâce, à propos de Christ, non seulement de croire en lui, mais aussi de souffrir pour lui
[1:30] et de soutenir le même combat que vous m'avez vu soutenir et que, vous le savez, je soutiens encore.
[2:1] S'il y a donc quelque consolation en Christ, s'il y a quelque, encouragement à s'aimer, si c'est quelque chose que la communion d'esprit, quelque chose que la tendresse et la compassion,
[2:2] mettez le comble à ma joie, en vivant en bonne intelligence, en étant animés du même amour, en ne faisant qu'un coeur et qu'une âme.
[2:3] N'agissez jamais par esprit de parti ou par vaine gloire, mais que l'un, en toute humilité, regarde l'autre comme lui étant supérieur
[2:4] et que chacun, au lieu de songer à son propre intérêt, songe à celui des autres.
[2:5] Ayez les sentiments qui animaient Jésus-Christ :
[2:6] il était dans la même condition que Dieu et il n'a pas considéré cette égalité avec Dieu comme un butin à garder pour lui,
[2:7] mais il s'est dépouillé lui-même, il a pris la condition de l'esclave ; il est devenu semblable aux hommes,
[2:8] il s'est montré homme dans toute son apparition ; il s'est humilié lui-même, il s'est soumis jusqu'à mourir, mourir même sur une croix !
[2:9] Aussi Dieu l'a-t-il élevé bien haut et lui a-t-il donné un nom qui l'emporte sur tous les noms,
[2:10] afin qu'au nom de Jésus «Fléchissent tous les genoux» dans le ciel, sur la terre, sous la terre
[2:11] et que «Toute langue confesse» que Jésus-Christ est le Seigneur pour la gloire de Dieu le Père!
[2:12] Mes bien-aimés, vous avez toujours été soumis ; travaillez donc à votre salut avec crainte et en tremblant, et non seulement comme lorsque j'étais au milieu de vous, mais plus encore aujourd'hui que je suis absent.
[2:13] Car c'est Dieu qui fait naître en vous et la volonté et l'action, suivant son bon plaisir.
[2:14] Faites tout sans murmurer et sans hésiter,
[2:15] pour devenir irréprochables et purs, des «...enfants de Dieu parfaits...» au milieu «... d'un siècle dépravé et corrompu...» ; vous y apparaissez comme les astres dans le monde,
[2:16] retenant la parole de vie, et je serai fier à la journée de Christ, car je n'aurai pas inutilement parcouru ma carrière, et je n'aurai pas «...travaillé inutilement».
[2:17] Si même je dois verser mon sang et être offert en sacrifice pour le service de votre foi, je dis : «Quelle joie! quelle joie!» avec vous tous ;
[2:18] vous aussi dites : «Quelle joie! quelle joie!» avec moi.
[2:19] J'espère cependant, avec l'aide du Seigneur Jésus, vous envoyer bientôt Timothée, pour avoir de vos nouvelles et être, moi aussi, un peu tranquillisé.
[2:20] Je n'ai personne ici qui pense comme moi et qui puisse s'intéresser sérieusement à ce qui vous concerne.
[2:21] Tous songent à leurs propres intérêts et non à ceux de Jésus-Christ.
[2:22] Quant à lui, vous savez qu'il a été mis à l'épreuve et qu'il s'est consacré avec moi au service de l'Évangile, comme un fils avec son père.
[2:23] J'espère vous l'envoyer aussitôt que je verrai quelle tournure prennent mes affaires.
[2:24] J'ai de plus la confiance qu'avec l'aide du Seigneur j'arriverai moi-même incessamment.
[2:25] En attendant, j'ai cru nécessaire de vous envoyer Épaphrodite, mon frère, mon collaborateur, mon compagnon de luttes qui est venu, député par vous, pourvoir à mes besoins.
[2:26] D'ailleurs il désirait ardemment vous revoir tous, et il était désolé que vous eussiez appris sa maladie.
[2:27] Il a été malade, en effet, et, a vu la mort de près. Mais Dieu a eu pitié de lui, et non seulement de lui, mais aussi de moi, pour que je n'eusse pas tristesse sur tristesse.
[2:28] Je vous l'envoie donc avec d'autant plus d'empressement que vous aurez la joie de le revoir et que moi, j'aurai un chagrin de moins.
[2:29] Ainsi, accueillez-le dans le Seigneur avec une joie entière, et rendez honneur à des hommes
[2:30] comme lui, car c'est pour l'oeuvre de Christ qu'il a été à la mort ; il a exposé sa vie pour prendre votre place dans les services que vous ne pouviez me rendre, étant absents.
[3:1] Enfin, mes frères, soyez joyeux dans le Seigneur ; cela ne m'ennuie pas de vous répéter la même chose, et pour vous c'est plus sûr.
[3:2] Attention aux chiens ! attention aux mauvais ouvriers! attention à tous ces mutilés!
[3:3] c'est nous qui sommes les vrais circoncis, nous qui adorons selon l'Esprit de Dieu, qui tirons notre gloire de Jésus-Christ et ne mettons pas notre confiance dans des distinctions charnelles ;
[3:4] et cependant je pourrais le faire si je le voulais! Des distinctions charnelles! j'en ai plus que personne,
[3:5] moi, circoncis le huitième jour, de la race d'Israël, de la tribu de Benjamin, Hébreu fils d'Hébreux, pratiquant la Loi jusqu'à être Pharisien,
[3:6] acharné jusqu'à persécuter l'Église, irréprochable observateur des justices légales!
[3:7] C'étaient là pour moi des titres ; mais je suis arrivé, à cause du Christ, à les considérer comme rien.
[3:8] Oui, tout cela n'est plus rien pour moi, quand je songe à toute l'importance qu'il y a à connaître Jésus-Christ, mon Seigneur. A cause de lui, j'ai tout perdu ; pour gagner Christ, j'ai tenu tous mes avantages pour des ordures ; pour m'unir à lui,
[3:9] j'ai renoncé à ma justice légale ; j'ai la justice que donne la foi en Christ, justice selon Dieu fondée sur la foi ;
[3:10] mon but est de le connaître lui et toute la valeur de sa résurrection ; mon but est de participer à ses souffrances ; j'ai pris sur moi l'image de sa mort,
[3:11] espérant atteindre, moi aussi, à la résurrection d'entre les morts !
[3:12] Ce n'est pas que je me sois encore emparé du prix, que je sois déjà arrivé à la perfection ; mais je le poursuis, espérant aussi m'en emparer, car Jésus-Christ s'est emparé de moi.
[3:13] Non, mes frères, je ne prétends pas, moi, m'être emparé du prix ; seulement, j'oublie ce qui est en arrière, je m'élance vers ce qui est devant moi,
[3:14] je cours au but, pour remporter le prix auquel Dieu m'a appelé d'en haut en Jésus-Christ.
[3:15] Tels doivent être les sentiments des plus avancés ; et si sur quelque détail vous en étiez d'un autre avis, Dieu vous l'expliquera.
[3:16] Mais du point où nous sommes arrivés, allons toujours en avant.
[3:17] Imitez-moi, mes frères, et regardez ceux qui marchent en me prenant pour modèle.
[3:18] Il y en a plusieurs dont je vous ai souvent parlé, — et je vous en reparle les larmes aux yeux, — qui marchent en ennemis de la croix du Christ.
[3:19] Ils finiront par la perdition ; leur Dieu c'est leur ventre ; ils se vantent de leurs infamies ; ils ne pensent qu'aux choses de la terre.
[3:20] Pour nous, notre patrie est dans les cieux, d'où nous attendons, pour Sauveur, notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ ;
[3:21] il transformera notre misérable corps et le rendra semblable à son corps glorieux, car il possède le pouvoir de se rendre maître de tout.
[4:1] Ainsi donc, mes frères, mes bien-aimés que je chéris, vous, ma joie et ma couronne, restez fermement attachés au Seigneur, mes bien-aimés.
[4:2] Je demande à Evodia et à Syntyché de vivre en bonne intelligence sous le regard du Seigneur.
[4:3] Et quant à toi, mon vrai collègue, je te supplie de les supporter. Elles ont lutté pour l'Évangile avec moi, et aussi avec Clément et mes autres collaborateurs, dont les noms sont dans le livre de vie.
[4:4] Soyez toujours joyeux dans le Seigneur, je le répète: soyez, joyeux.
[4:5] Que tout le monde connaisse votre douceur. Le Seigneur est proche ;
[4:6] ne vous inquiétez de rien, mais, pour tout, priez ; priez en rendant grâces et en exposant vos besoins à Dieu,
[4:7] et la paix de Dieu, qui surpasse toute compréhension, gardera vos coeurs et vos pensées en Jésus-Christ.
[4:8] Enfin, mes frères, tout ce qui est vrai, tout ce qui est respectable, tout ce qui est juste, tout ce qui est pur, tout ce qui est aimable, tout ce qui est honorable, tout ce qui est une vertu, tout ce qui est un éloge doit être l'objet de vos pensées.
[4:9] Ce que vous avez appris et reçu, ce que vous m'avez entendu dire, ce que vous m'avez vu faire, mettez-le en pratique, et le Dieu de paix sera avec vous.
[4:10] J'ai été extrêmement heureux dans le Seigneur de cette refloraison tardive de votre amitié et de ce qu'enfin vous avez pu penser à moi. Vous y songiez bien, mais vous n'aviez pas d'occasion.
[4:11] Si je dis cela, ce n'est pas pour parler de ma pauvreté ; j'ai appris à me contenter de ce que j'ai.
[4:12] Je sais être dans le besoin ; je sais aussi avoir du superflu. Je suis initié à tout et partout ; à être rassasié comme à avoir faim, à avoir le superflu comme à manquer du nécessaire.
[4:13] Je puis tout en Celui qui me fortifie.
[4:14] Vous n'en avez pas moins bien fait de prendre votre part de ma détresse.
[4:15] D'ailleurs vous savez, vous, les Philippiens, qu'au commencement de l'évangélisation, quand j'ai quitté la Macédoine, il n'y eut aucune Église, sauf la vôtre, qui se mit, en rapport avec moi et m'ouvrit un compte courant.
[4:16] Ainsi, à Thessalonique, vous m'avez envoyé une fois, deux fois même, ce dont j'avais besoin.
[4:17] Ce n'est pas que je recherche les présents ; mais je recherche le profit qui en résulte pour vous.
[4:18] J'ai tout ce qu'il me faut, je surabonde même, je suis riche depuis que j'ai reçu ce que vous m'avez envoyé par Épaphrodite, délicieux parfum, sacrifice accepté et approuvé de Dieu!
[4:19] Mon Dieu, selon sa richesse, pourvoira glorieusement et en Jésus-Christ à tous vos besoins.
[4:20] Qu'à notre Dieu et Père soit la gloire aux siècles des siècles! Amen.
[4:21] Saluez en Jésus-Christ tous les fidèles. Les frères qui sont avec moi vous saluent.
[4:22] Tous les fidèles vous saluent, particulièrement ceux de la maison de l'Empereur.
[4:23] La grâce du Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec votre esprit. 

### Colossians

[1:1] Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ, par la volonté de Dieu, et, le frère Timothée
[1:2] aux frères en Christ, fidèles et croyants, qui sont à Colosses. Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père.
[1:3] Nous rendons sans cesse des actions de grâces pour vous au Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ dans nos prières ;
[1:4] car on nous a raconté votre foi en Jésus-Christ et l'amour que vous éprouvez pour tous les fidèles,
[1:5] votre espérance enfin qui sera récompensée dans le ciel. On vous a parlé autrefois de ces choses quand on vous a annoncé la vérité évangélique.
[1:6] L'Évangile est au milieu de vous, comme, du reste, dans le monde entier. Il y porte des fruits, il y gagne du terrain comme il l'a fait chez vous depuis le jour où vous avez appris à connaître la vérité, c'est-à-dire la grâce de Dieu.
[1:7] C'est Épaphras, notre bien-aimé compagnon de service, qui vous a instruits ; ce fidèle ministre du Christ auprès de nous
[1:8] nous a fait connaître les sentiments d'amour que l'Esprit vous inspire.
[1:9] Et alors nous, depuis le jour où nous avons appris tout cela, nous ne cessons de prier pour vous ; nous demandons à Dieu que vous appreniez à connaître tout à fait sa volonté, avec cette entière sagesse et cette intelligence que donne l'Esprit.
[1:10] Vous vivrez ainsi d'une manière digne du Seigneur, vous le satisferez entièrement. Vous porterez toute espèce de bons fruits, vous ferez des progrès dans la connaissance de Dieu.
[1:11] Vous serez admirablement fortifiés par sa glorieuse puissance ; vous serez remplis de patience, de persévérance, de joie.
[1:12] Vous rendrez des actions de grâces à notre Père qui vous a mis à même d'avoir un jour votre part de l'héritage des fidèles dans la lumière,
[1:13] qui nous a arrachés au pouvoir des ténèbres, qui nous a transportés dans le Royaume de son Fils bien-aimé ;
[1:14] car par lui nous sommes rachetés, délivrés de nos péchés.
[1:15] Il est une image du Dieu invisible, il est né le premier de tous les êtres créés ;
[1:16] c'est en lui, en effet, que tout a été créé, tout ce qui est dans le ciel, tout ce qui est sur la terre, ce qui est visible et ce qui est invisible, les trônes, les seigneuries, les autorités, les puissances, tout a été créé par lui et pour lui.
[1:17] Il est avant toutes choses et toutes choses subsistent en lui.
[1:18] Il est la tête du corps, c'est-à-dire le chef de l'Église ; il est le principe ; il est le premier-né d'entre les morts, afin d'être partout à la première place.
[1:19] En effet, c'est en lui que Dieu a voulu que sa plénitude entière résidât ;
[1:20] c'est par lui qu'il a voulu tout réconcilier avec lui-même, et ce qui est sur la terre et ce qui est dans le ciel ; par lui il a rétabli la paix au moyen du sang versé sur la croix.
[1:21] Autrefois vous lui étiez étrangers, vous étiez ses ennemis par vos pensées et vos mauvaises oeuvres ; aujourd'hui le Christ vous a réconciliés
[1:22] par la mort de son corps, de sa chair, pour vous faire comparaître devant lui, saints, sans tache et sans reproche ;
[1:23] si du moins vous restez attachés à la foi, fermes, inébranlables, sans vous écarter de l'espérance apportée par l'Évangile que vous avez entendu, Évangile prêché à toute créature sous le ciel, et dont moi, Paul, je suis devenu le ministre.
[1:24] Je suis maintenant dans la joie en souffrant pour vous ; et ce, qui manquait encore aux souffrances du Christ, je le complète moi-même pour le bien de son corps, je veux dire de l'Église
[1:25] dont je suis devenu le ministre. C'est Dieu qui m'a confié cette charge ; je dois vous annoncer le plein accomplissement de la parole de Dieu,
[1:26] le mystère caché de tout temps et à tous les peuples, mais qu'il a aujourd'hui révélé à ses fidèles.
[1:27] Dieu a voulu leur faire connaître toute la glorieuse richesse de ce mystère à l'égard des païens, c'est-à-dire : Christ en vous, l'espérance de la gloire!
[1:28] Nous le prêchons ; nous exhortons, nous instruisons chaque homme avec une entière sagesse, pour présenter à Dieu chaque homme devenu parfait en Christ.
[1:29] C'est à cela que je travaille, pour cela que je lutte, grâce à sa force qui agit puissamment en moi.
[2:1] Je tiens à ce que vous sachiez toute la grandeur de ce combat que je livre pour vous, pour les Laodicéens, pour tous ceux qui ne me connaissent pas de vue,
[2:2] j'y tiens pour réconforter leurs coeurs, pour que l'amour les unisse, pour qu'ils aient une intelligence riche et complète, qu'ils connaissent le mystère de Dieu, de Christ,
[2:3] où sont «... cachés tous les trésors» de la sagesse et de la science.
[2:4] Je vous dis cela pour que personne ne vous trompe par de spécieux raisonnements.
[2:5] Si je suis absent de corps, je suis cependant avec vous en esprit, heureux de voir votre bon ordre et la fermeté de votre foi en Christ.
[2:6] Comme vous avez appris à connaître le Christ, Jésus, le Seigneur, vivez ainsi en lui,
[2:7] greffés, édifiés sur lui, affermis dans la foi, telle qu'on vous l'a enseignée, et montrez beaucoup de reconnaissance.
[2:8] Faites attention à celui qui voudrait vous accaparer avec de la philosophie, trompeuse illusion, enseignement purement humain, tout élémentaire et mondain, qui n'est pas selon Christ.
[2:9] Car c'est en lui que réside réellement toute la plénitude de la divinité.
[2:10] Et vous, vous êtes remplis de lui, le chef de toute autorité et de tout pouvoir.
[2:11] En lui aussi vous avez été circoncis ; je ne parle pas de la circoncision que font les hommes, mais de celle du Christ, du dépouillement de votre corps charnel.
[2:12] Vous avez été ensevelis avec lui au moyen du baptême, où vous êtes aussi ressuscités avec lui, par la foi en la puissance de Dieu qui l'a ressuscité d'entre les morts.
[2:13] Vous étiez morts par vos péchés, et par votre incirconcision charnelle, et il vous a fait revivre avec lui ; il nous a pardonné tous nos péchés,
[2:14] il a effacé l'acte qui était contre nous, dont les clauses nous étaient contraires, il l'a mis de côté en le clouant sur la croix,
[2:15] il a dépouillé les autorités et les puissances, il les a victorieusement données en spectacle, il a triomphé d'elles par le Christ !
[2:16] Que personne ne vienne donc vous critiquer pour un mets, une boisson, un jour de fête, de nouvelle lune ou pour des sabbats,
[2:17] tout cela n'est que l'ombre de ce qui devait venir ; la réalité est en Christ.
[2:18] Ne vous laissez pas enlever votre prix par ceux qui font les humbles, rendent un culte aux anges, spéculent sur des rêveries, que leurs idées charnelles remplissent d'un vain orgueil,
[2:19] et qui ne s'attachent pas au chef, dont le corps entier pourvu de nerfs et de muscles, et soutenu par eux, prend le développement que Dieu lui donne.
[2:20] Si vous êtes morts avec Christ aux enseignements élémentaires et mondains, pourquoi, comme si vous viviez encore dans le monde, vous faites-vous des règlements:
[2:21] «Ne touche pas ceci, ne goûte pas cela ; n'approche pas de ceci ; tout cela te souillera, si tu en fais usage.»
[2:22] «Ce sont les hommes qui enseignent et commandent ces choses.»
[2:23] Elles ont sans doute un certain air de sagesse, c'est un culte volontaire, plein d'humilité et de dureté pour le corps, mais elles n'ont aucune valeur et ne servent qu'à satisfaire les sens.
[3:1] Si vous êtes ressuscités avec le Christ, recherchez les choses, qui sont en haut, où le Christ est «Assis à la droite de Dieu ;»
[3:2] pensez aux choses qui sont en haut et non à celles qui sont sur la terre,
[3:3] car vous êtes morts et votre vie est cachée avec le Christ en Dieu ;
[3:4] et quand, un jour, le Christ qui est votre vie aura paru, vous, vous apparaîtrez avec lui dans la gloire.
[3:5] Mortifiez donc vos membres, ceux qui sont de la terre, la débauche, l'impureté, la luxure, les passions coupables et l'avarice (elle est une idolâtrie).
[3:6] Voilà ce qui attire la colère de Dieu,
[3:7] et voilà ce que, vous aussi, vous avez fait autrefois ; oui, vous avez vécu dans ces désordres.
[3:8] Mais aujourd'hui vous devez vous défaire de tout ce qui est colère, emportement, méchanceté, médisance ; ne prononcez plus de mots inconvenants ;
[3:9] ne vous dites pas de mensonge l'un à l'autre ; débarrassez-vous du vieil homme et de ses oeuvres,
[3:10] et revêtez-vous du nouvel homme, qui se renouvelle à l'image de son Créateur
[3:11] et arrive à comprendre l'état où il n'y a ni Grec ni Juif, ni circoncis ni incirconcis, ni étranger ni barbare, ni esclave ni homme libre, mais où Christ est tout et en tous.
[3:12] Vous, les élus de Dieu, les fidèles, les bien-aimés, montrez des coeurs pleins de pitié, de bonté, d'humilité, de douceur, de patience.
[3:13] Supportez-vous les uns les autres ; pardonnez-vous mutuellement quand l'un de vous a à se plaindre de son prochain ; faites comme, le Seigneur qui vous a pardonné.
[3:14] Par-dessus tout, montrez de l'amour ; c'est lui qui réunit toutes les perfections.
[3:15] Que dans vos coeurs règne la paix du Christ ; vous y avez été appelés pour ne former qu'un seul et même corps. Soyez reconnaissants.
[3:16] Que la parole du Christ demeure en vous dans toute sa richesse. Instruisez-vous, avertissez-vous les uns les autres avec une grande sagesse. Que des psaumes, des hymnes, des chants spirituels montent à Dieu de vos coeurs reconnaissants.
[3:17] Quoi que vous fassiez, que vous parliez, que vous agissiez, faites tout au nom du Seigneur Jésus, en rendant grâces par lui à Dieu le Père.
[3:18] Vous, femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme il convient quand on est au Seigneur.
[3:19] Vous, maris, aimez vos femmes et ne vous irritez pas contre elles.
[3:20] Vous, enfants, obéissez en tout à vos parents, car cela est agréable au Seigneur.
[3:21] Vous, pères, ne tourmentez pas vos enfants, de peur qu'ils ne se découragent.
[3:22] Vous, esclaves, obéissez en tout à ceux qui sont vos maîtres sur la terre ; ne les servez pas seulement quand ils vous voient, comme si vous n'aviez à plaire qu'à des hommes ; mais servez-les en toute simplicité de coeur et en craignant le Seigneur.
[3:23] Dans tout ce que vous faites, travaillez de toute votre âme, comme s'il s'agissait du Seigneur et non des hommes.
[3:24] Vous savez que vous recevrez du Seigneur en récompense l'héritage céleste. Soyez les esclaves de Christ le Seigneur.
[3:25] Celui qui aura fait le mal sera puni pour ce mal ; il n'y aura point d'acception de personnes.
[4:1] Vous, maîtres, fournissez à vos esclaves ce qui est juste, équitable ; vous savez que vous avez, vous aussi, un maître au ciel.
[4:2] Dans vos prières montrez de la persévérance, de la vigilance, de la reconnaissance.
[4:3] En même temps, priez pour nous, que Dieu nous ouvre une porte, que nous parlions, que nous prêchions le mystère du Christ. C'est pour lui que je porte la chaîne ;
[4:4] demandez que je le fasse connaître comme je dois l'annoncer.
[4:5] Conduisez-vous avec prudence envers ceux du dehors, et profitez bien des moments opportuns.
[4:6] Que vos paroles soient toujours aimables, pleines de saveur, de manière à savoir répondre à chacun comme il faut.
[4:7] Vous apprendrez tout ce qui me concerne personnellement par Tychique, mon bien-aimé frère, mon aide fidèle, mon collègue dans l'oeuvre du Seigneur.
[4:8] Je vous l'envoie tout exprès pour cela, pour que vous sachiez où en sont nos affaires, et qu'il console vos coeurs.
[4:9] Avec lui est notre fidèle et bien-aimé frère, Onésime, l'un de vos compatriotes. Ils vous informeront de tout ce qui se passe ici.
[4:10] Vous avez les salutations d'Aristarque, mon compagnon de prison, et celles de Marc, le cousin de Barnabas (vous avez reçu des avis à son sujet ; quand il viendra vous voir, faites-lui bon accueil),
[4:11] celles de Jésus dit Justus. Ce sont les seuls circoncis qui aient travaillé avec moi pour le Royaume de Dieu ; ils ont été pour moi une véritable force.
[4:12] Vous avez aussi les salutations de votre compatriote Épaphras ; c'est un serviteur de Jésus-Christ ; il lutte sans cesse pour vous dans ses prières, pour que vous persistiez dans votre parfaite et entière soumission à toute la volonté de Dieu.
[4:13] Je lui rends le témoignage qu'il est plein de sollicitude pour vous ainsi que pour les frères de Laodicée et de Hiérapolis.
[4:14] Vous avez les salutations de mon bien-aimé Luc, le médecin, et celles de Démas.
[4:15] Nous saluons nos frères de Laodicée ainsi que Nymphas et l'Église qui s'assemble dans leur maison.
[4:16] Quand vous aurez lu cette lettre, ayez soin qu'elle soit lue aussi de l'Église de Laodicée et lisez à votre tour celle qu'on vous enverra de Laodicée.
[4:17] Dites à Archippe : Prends garde de bien remplir le ministère que tu as reçu de la part du Seigneur.
[4:18] Je vous salue en écrivant moi-même : Paul. N'oubliez pas que je suis en prison. La grâce soit avec vous. 

### I Thessalonians

[1:1] Paul, Silvanus et Timothée à l'église des Thessaloniciens en Dieu le Père et en Jésus-Christ le Seigneur. Grâce et paix vous soient accordées.
[1:2] Nous rendons constamment grâces à Dieu pour vous tous ; nous vous nommons dans nos prières ;
[1:3] et nous rappelons sans cesse, en présence de Dieu notre Père, les oeuvres de votre foi, les travaux de votre charité et la persévérance de votre espoir en notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:4] Nous savons, frères bien-aimés de Dieu, que vous avez été élus ;
[1:5] car nous ne vous avons pas évangélisés seulement avec des paroles, mais avec une vraie puissance, avec l'Esprit saint, avec une forte conviction. Vous savez bien ce que nous avons été au milieu de vous et pour votre bien,
[1:6] et vous êtes devenus nos imitateurs et ceux du Seigneur, en accueillant sa parole dans un moment de grande affliction avec la joie que donne l'Esprit saint.
[1:7] Aussi êtes-vous devenus un modèle pour tous les croyants de la Macédoine et de l'Achaïe.
[1:8] Car c'est de chez vous que la parole du Seigneur s'est fait entendre ; et ce n'est pas seulement en Macédoine et en Achaïe, c'est partout que votre foi en Dieu a été connue ; aussi n'avons-nous pas besoin d'en parler.
[1:9] Chacun raconte en parlant de nous comment vous nous avez reçus à notre arrivée, comment vous vous êtes convertis à Dieu, abandonnant les idoles pour le servir, lui, le Dieu vivant et vrai,
[1:10] et pour attendre du haut des cieux son Fils qu'il a ressuscité des morts, Jésus, celui qui nous délivre de la colère à venir.
[2:1] Vous savez bien vous-mêmes, frères, que notre arrivée chez vous n'a pas été stérile :
[2:2] après avoir été persécutés, après avoir été insultés à Philippes, vous le savez, nous avons eu une grande confiance en notre Dieu, et nous vous avons prêché son Évangile au milieu de bien des luttes.
[2:3] C'est que notre prédication ne reposait ni sur l'erreur, ni sur des motifs impurs, ni sur la fraude ;
[2:4] mais Dieu nous ayant jugés dignes de nous confier l'Évangile, nous parlons non pour plaire aux hommes, mais à Dieu qui sonde nos coeurs.
[2:5] Jamais, en effet, nous n'avons employé la flatterie en vous parlant, vous le savez ; jamais non plus nos motifs n'ont été intéressés, Dieu nous en est témoin.
[2:6] Nous n'avons pas recherché non plus les honneurs des hommes, ni chez vous, ni chez d'autres, et cependant, étant apôtres de Christ, nous aurions pu nous imposer à vous.
[2:7] Eh bien, au contraire, nous avons été pleins de douceur au milieu de vous. Comme une mère qui soigne tendrement ses enfants,
[2:8] nous étions disposés, dans notre affection pour vous, à vous donner non seulement l'Évangile de Dieu, mais nos vies elles-mêmes, tellement vous nous étiez devenus chers.
[2:9] Vous vous rappelez, frères, nos efforts et nos peines ; c'est en travaillant nuit et jour pour n'être à charge à aucun de vous que nous vous avons prêché l'Évangile de Dieu.
[2:10] Vous êtes témoins, et Dieu aussi, de la piété, de l'équité et de l'intégrité avec lesquelles nous avons agi envers vous, croyants ; comme un père le ferait pour ses enfants,
[2:11] nous vous avons, vous le savez, exhortés, encouragés, conjurés de vivre
[2:12] d'une manière digne de Dieu qui vous appelle à son Royaume et à sa gloire.
[2:13] Voilà aussi pourquoi nous rendons sans cesse grâces à Dieu de ce que, recevant de nous, de notre bouche, la parole de Dieu, vous l’avez acceptée, non comme une parole d'hommes, mais, ce qu'elle est réellement, comme une parole de Dieu ; et elle se montre efficace en vous, les croyants.
[2:14] En effet, vous êtes devenus, frères, les imitateurs des Églises de Dieu qui, en Judée, sont à Jésus-Christ ; car vous avez eu à souffrir de la part de vos compatriotes ce qu'elles ont eu à souffrir de la part des Juifs,
[2:15] de ceux qui ont aussi mis à mort le Seigneur Jésus et les prophètes, qui nous ont persécutés, qui déplaisent à Dieu, sont ennemis de tous les hommes,
[2:16] qui nous empêchent de parler aux païens pour les sauver, et qui mettent sans cesse le comble à leurs péchés ; mais la colère de Dieu les a atteints, et définitivement.
[2:17] Quant à nous, frères, privés de votre présence pendant quelque temps, mais près de vous par le coeur, nous avons ardemment, immensément désiré revoir vos visages.
[2:18] Nous avons voulu une ou deux fois revenir chez vous (je parle de moi Paul), et Satan s'y est opposé.
[2:19] — (Qui, en effet, est notre espérance, qui, notre joie, qui, la couronne dont un jour nous serons fiers? n'est-ce pas vous ? vous aussi, ne serez-vous pas tout cela en présence de notre Seigneur Jésus, lors de son apparition?
[2:20] Oui, c'est vous qui êtes notre gloire et notre joie! ) —
[3:1] Aussi nous n'y tenions plus ; nous nous sommes alors décidés à rester seuls à Athènes,
[3:2] et à vous envoyer Timothée, notre frère, qui est ministre de Dieu dans l'Évangile du Christ, pour vous fortifier, pour vous engager, dans l'intérêt de votre foi,
[3:3] à ne pas vous laisser ébranler par les épreuves de ce temps-ci. Vous savez vous-mêmes que nous y sommes destinés.
[3:4] Quand nous étions chez vous, nous vous avons, en effet, prédit qu'il nous fallait être éprouvés et, vous le savez, c'est ce qui est arrivé.
[3:5] Voilà pourquoi, n'y tenant plus, j'ai envoyé savoir des nouvelles de votre fidélité ; je craignais que le Tentateur ne vous eût tentés, et que notre peine n'eût été perdue.
[3:6] Mais Timothée vient d'arriver de chez vous, et il nous a apporté de bonnes nouvelles de votre foi et de votre amour ; il nous a dit le bon souvenir que vous conservez de nous et votre désir de nous revoir, désir qui est aussi le nôtre.
[3:7] Aussi votre foi nous a-t-elle fortifiés, frères, au milieu de nos afflictions et de nos épreuves.
[3:8] Dans ce moment, nous ne vivons que parce que vous êtes attachés au Seigneur.
[3:9] Comment pouvons-nous assez remercier Dieu de toute la joie que vous nous faites éprouver devant lui,
[3:10] nous qui lui demandons instamment, jour et nuit, de faire que nous vous revoyions et que nous allions compléter ce qui manque encore à votre foi!
[3:11] Veuille Dieu notre Père et le Seigneur Jésus aplanir le chemin qui mène chez vous ;
[3:12] et veuille le Seigneur augmenter et faire abonder votre amour les uns pour les autres et pour tous les hommes (comme aussi le nôtre pour vous),
[3:13] pour que vos coeurs se fortifient et soient d'une irréprochable sainteté, en présence de Dieu notre Père, à l'apparition de notre Seigneur Jésus au milieu de tous ses saints!
[4:1] Enfin, frères, nous vous demandons, nous vous prions, au nom du Seigneur Jésus, de faire toujours plus de progrès (vous en faites déjà), car vous avez appris de nous comment on doit se conduire pour plaire à Dieu.
[4:2] Vous savez quels préceptes nous vous avons donnés de la part du Seigneur Jésus.
[4:3] Ce que Dieu veut, c'est votre sanctification ; que vous vous absteniez de toute impureté ;
[4:4] que chacun de vous sache avoir sa femme à lui, purement et honnêtement
[4:5] et sans les passions désordonnées des païens qui ne connaissent pas Dieu.
[4:6] En affaires, ne faites aucun tort, ne causez aucun préjudice à votre frère ; car le Seigneur fait justice de tout cela, comme nous vous l'avons dit et certifié autrefois.
[4:7] Dieu ne nous a pas appelés à l'impureté, mais à la sanctification.
[4:8] Celui donc qui repousse ces paroles ne repousse pas un homme, mais Dieu qui vous a donné à vous son Esprit saint.
[4:9] Quant à l'amour fraternel, vous n'avez pas besoin qu'on vous en écrive, car vous-mêmes vous avez appris de Dieu à vous aimer les uns les autres ;
[4:10] et vraiment vous le faites, pour tous les frères, dans la Macédoine entière. Nous vous exhortons, frères, à le faire de plus en plus,
[4:11] à tenir à honneur de vivre en paix, à vous occuper de vos propres affaires, à travailler de vos mains, comme nous vous l'avons recommandé,
[4:12] pour que votre conduite soit respectée par ceux du dehors, et que vous n'ayez besoin de personne.
[4:13] Nous ne voulons pas, frères, vous laisser dans l'ignorance touchant ceux qui se sont endormis, afin que vous ne soyez pas tristes comme les autres qui n'ont pas d'espérance.
[4:14] Si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et qu'il est ressuscité, de même nous devons croire que Dieu ramènera les morts par Jésus et avec lui.
[4:15] Nous vous disons ceci d'après une parole du Seigneur : Nous qui vivons, qui sommes réservés pour voir l'apparition du Seigneur, nous ne devancerons pas ceux qui se sont endormis.
[4:16] Car le Seigneur lui-même, à un signal donné, à la voix d'un archange et au son de la trompette de Dieu, descendra du ciel ; alors ceux qui sont morts en Christ ressusciteront d'abord.
[4:17] Puis, nous, les vivants, les réservés, nous serons enlevés en même temps qu'eux, vers les nues, pour aller à la rencontre du Seigneur dans l'air ; et ainsi nous serons toujours avec le Seigneur.
[4:18] Fortifiez-vous donc les uns les autres dans ces pensées-là.
[5:1] Quant à l'époque, à la date, vous n'avez pas besoin, frères, qu'on vous en écrive.
[5:2] Vous savez parfaitement vous-mêmes que le jour du Seigneur doit arriver comme un voleur qui vient la nuit.
[5:3] C'est au moment où les gens diront : «paix! sécurité!» qu'une ruine subite les surprendra, comme les douleurs de l'enfantement surprennent une femme enceinte, et ils n'échapperont pas.
[5:4] Mais vous, frères, vous n'êtes pas dans les ténèbres, et ce jour ne vous surprendra pas comme nous surprend un voleur.
[5:5] Vous êtes tous des fils de lumière, des fils du jour ; nous ne le sommes ni de la nuit ni des ténèbres.
[5:6] Ne dormons donc pas comme font les autres, mais soyons vigilants et sobres.
[5:7] Ceux qui dorment, dorment pendant la nuit ; ceux qui s'enivrent, s'enivrent pendant la nuit.
[5:8] Quant à nous, fils du jour, vivons sobrement, «mettons la cuirasse» de la foi et de l'amour a et le casque» de l'espérance «du salut».
[5:9] Dieu ne nous a pas destinés à la colère, mais à l'acquisition du salut par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ,
[5:10] mort pour nous, afin que, veillant ou dormant, nous vivions toujours avec lui.
[5:11] Fortifiez-vous donc les uns les autres ; édifiez-vous réciproquement, et d'ailleurs vous le faites déjà.
[5:12] Nous vous demandons encore, frères, d'avoir des égards pour ceux qui travaillent parmi vous, qui vous dirigent dans ce qui est du Seigneur et qui vous avertissent.
[5:13] Montrez-leur une affection toute particulière à cause de leurs fonctions. Vivez en paix entre vous.
[5:14] Nous vous engageons, frères, à avertir ceux qui se laissent aller au désordre, à relever les découragés, à soutenir les faibles, à être patients envers tous.
[5:15] Prenez garde à ce que personne ne rende le mal pour le mal, mais appliquez-vous toujours à ce qui est bien, soit entre vous, soit avec tout le monde.
[5:16] Soyez toujours dans la joie ;
[5:17] priez sans cesse ;
[5:18] soyez reconnaissants de tout : voilà ce que Dieu veut de vous en Jésus-Christ.
[5:19] N'éteignez pas l'Esprit ;
[5:20] ne dédaignez pas les inspirations prophétiques.
[5:21] Examinez tout ; retenez ce qui est bien.
[5:22] Abstenez-vous de toute espèce de mal.
[5:23] Que le Dieu de paix lui-même vous sanctifie parfaitement ; que votre esprit, votre âme, votre corps, tout votre être se conserve irréprochable pour l'apparition de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[5:24] Il est fidèle, Celui qui vous appelle ; il fera cela.
[5:25] Frères, priez pour nous.,
[5:26] Saluez tous les frères d'un saint baiser.
[5:27] Je vous conjure, au nom du Seigneur, de faire lire cette lettre à tous les frères.
[5:28] La Grâce de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec vous. 

### II Thessalonians

[1:1] Paul, Silvanus et Timothée à l'église des Thessaloniciens en Dieu notre Père et en Jésus-Christ le Seigneur.
[1:2] Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ
[1:3] Nous devons sans cesse rendre grâces à Dieu à votre sujet ; frères, ce n'est que juste, car votre foi s'accroît beaucoup, et votre amour les uns pour les autres augmente tellement que
[1:4] nous nous félicitons de vous auprès des Églises de Dieu ; nous leur parlons de votre patience et de votre foi dans toutes les persécutions et les afflictions que vous avez eues à supporter.
[1:5] Il y a là comme un présage du juste jugement de Dieu ; un jour vous serez jugés dignes de son Royaume pour lequel vous souffrez.
[1:6] Car enfin il est juste devant Dieu qu'il fasse souffrir à leur tour ceux qui vous font souffrir,
[1:7] et qu'il vous donne du repos avec nous à vous qui souffrez. Cela sera quand le Seigneur Jésus descendra du ciel avec les anges de sa puissance ;
[1:8] «Entouré de flammes de feu, il fera justice» de ceux qui méconnaissent Dieu et qui n'obéissent pas à l'Évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus.
[1:9] Leur châtiment sera la destruction éternelle, «Loin de la face du Seigneur Et de son éclatante puissance»,
[1:10] quand il viendra pour être, en ce jour-là, glorifié au milieu de ses fidèles et admiré par tous ceux qui auront été croyants ; car vous avez cru à notre témoignage.
[1:11] Voilà aussi pourquoi nous prions sans cesse pour vous ; nous demandons que notre Dieu vous trouve dignes de son appel ; qu'il vous remplisse, dans sa puissance, de bonnes dispositions et d'oeuvres de foi.
[1:12] C'est ainsi que le nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ sera glorifié en vous, et vous en lui, par la grâce de notre Dieu et du Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[2:1] Quant à l'apparition de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ et à notre réunion à lui, frères, nous vous en supplions,
[2:2] n'allez pas vite vous monter l'imagination, ne vous laissez pas troubler par de fausses inspirations, ou par des paroles ou par de prétendues lettres de nous, vous annonçant que nous sommes arrivés au jour du Seigneur.
[2:3] Ne vous laissez tromper par rien ni par personne : il n'arrivera rien avant qu'ait eu lieu la grande apostasie et que se soit révélé l'homme de l'iniquité, le fils de la perdition,
[2:4] le grand adversaire «s'élevant au-dessus de tout ce qu'on appelle Dieu» et qu'on adore, jusqu'à s'installer dans le temple de Dieu et se présenter comme étant Dieu lui-même.
[2:5] Ne vous souvenez-vous pas que je vous disais cela quand j'étais encore auprès de vous?
[2:6] Vous savez bien ce qui l'empêche de paraître et pourquoi il ne se révélera que lorsque son heure sera venue.
[2:7] L'iniquité exerce déjà sa mystérieuse action ; elle éclatera quand celui qui l'arrête encore aura disparu.
[2:8] Alors se révélera l'impie que le Seigneur Jésus «Tuera du souffle de sa bouche» et anéantira par l'éclat de son apparition.
[2:9] Quant à l'apparition de l'impie, elle se fera par la puissance de Satan, avec toutes sortes de miracles, de signes, de prodiges menteurs
[2:10] et une foule de séductions coupables pour les hommes qui vont périr, qui n'ont pas voulu accepter et aimer la vérité qui les eût sauvés.
[2:11] Voilà pourquoi Dieu leur envoie un formidable penchant pour l'erreur qui les fait croire au mensonge,
[2:12] afin que tous ceux qui n'auront pas cru à la vérité et se seront complus dans le mal tombent sous son jugement.
[2:13] Quant à nous, frères chéris du Seigneur, nous devons rendre à Dieu, pour vous, de continuelles actions de grâces de ce qu'il vous a choisis depuis le commencement pour vous sauver par la sanctification de l'Esprit et par la foi en la vérité ;
[2:14] il vous a appelés à cet état par notre prédication de l'Évangile, afin que vous prissiez part à la gloire de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[2:15] Restez donc fermes, frères, et retenez les enseignements que nous vous avons donnés soit de vive voix, soit dans notre lettre.
[2:16] Que notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ lui-même et que Dieu notre Père, qui nous a aimés et nous a donné dans sa grâce une consolation éternelle et une douce espérance,
[2:17] consolent vos coeurs et vous affermissent en toute bonne oeuvre et en toute bonne parole.
[3:1] Enfin, priez pour nous, frères, afin que la parole du Seigneur se répande, qu'elle soit partout glorifiée comme chez vous,
[3:2] et que nous soyons délivrés des hommes intraitables et méchants ; car tous n'ont pas la foi.
[3:3] Le Seigneur est fidèle ; il vous fortifiera et vous préservera du Malin.
[3:4] Nous avons la confiance en vous dans le Seigneur, que vous faites et que vous ferez ce que nous vous recommandons.
[3:5] Veuille le Seigneur former vos coeurs à l'amour de Dieu et à la patiente attente du Christ!
[3:6] Nous vous recommandons, frères, au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ de vous éloigner de tout frère qui se conduit d'une manière déréglée et ne suit pas l'enseignement que vous avez reçu de nous.
[3:7] Vous savez vous-mêmes ce qu'il faut faire pour nous imiter, car nous n'avons pas vécu parmi vous d'une manière déréglée ;
[3:8] nous n'avons mangé gratis le pain de personne, mais nous avons jour et nuit péniblement et laborieusement travaillé pour n'être à charge à aucun de vous ;
[3:9] et ce n'était pas parce que nous n'en avions pas le droit, mais c'était pour vous donner un exemple à imiter.
[3:10] Quand nous étions au milieu de vous, nous vous donnions cette règle : celui qui refuse de travailler ne doit pas non il plus manger.
[3:11] Nous apprenons, en effet, qu'il y a parmi vous des personnes qui se conduisent d'une manière déréglée, qui ne travaillent point et perdent leur temps à des futilités.
[3:12] Nous invitons et nous exhortons ces personnes-là par notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ à travailler paisiblement et à manger un pain qui soit le leur.
[3:13] Pour vous, frères, ne vous lassez pas de faire le bien.
[3:14] Si quelqu'un ne se soumet pas à ce que nous vous disons dans cette lettre, notez-le, n'ayez point de rapport avec lui pour qu'il soit couvert de honte.
[3:15] Cependant ne le traitez pas comme un ennemi, mais avertissez-le comme un frère.
[3:16] Que le Seigneur de paix vous donne lui-même la paix, toujours, de toutes manières. Que le Seigneur soit avec vous tous.
[3:17] Je vous salue en écrivant moi-même, PAUL. Je signe ainsi toutes mes lettres ; c'est mon écriture
[3:18] La grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec vous tous. 

### I Timothy

[1:1] Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ, par ordre de Dieu notre sauveur et de Jésus-Christ notre espérance,
[1:2] à Timothée, mon véritable enfant dans la foi. Grâce, miséricorde et paix te soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[1:3] Comme je t'ai recommandé, à mon départ pour la Macédoine, de rester à Éphèse afin d'ordonner à certaines gens de ne pas enseigner de fausses doctrines,
[1:4] de ne pas s'occuper de contes et d'interminables généalogies qui provoquent les discussions au lieu de favoriser le plan de Dieu basé sur la foi...
[1:5] Le but de cet ordre c'est l'amour venant d'un coeur pur, d'une bonne conscience, d'une foi sincère.
[1:6] Certaines gens s'en sont détournés et se sont perdus dans ce qui n'est que du bavardage.
[1:7] Ils veulent être docteurs de la Loi, sans comprendre ni ce qu'ils disent ni ce qu'ils affirment.
[1:8] Nous ne nions pas que la Loi ne soit bonne, mais pour celui qui sait en faire usage,
[1:9] qui est convaincu qu'elle n'est pas faite pour le juste, mais pour ceux qui n'en veulent pas, qui la rejettent, pour ceux qui sont impies et pécheurs, irréligieux et profanes,
[1:10] parricides, meurtriers, impurs, débauchés infâmes, qui commettent des rapts ; menteurs, parjures, ou qui violent d'une manière quelconque la saine instruction.
[1:11] Voilà ce qu'enseigne le glorieux Évangile du Dieu bienheureux, Évangile que je suis chargé de prêcher.
[1:12] Je remercie celui qui m'a donné ma force, Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur, de ce qu'il m'a jugé digne de confiance, de ce qu'il m'a appelé au ministère,
[1:13] moi l'ancien blasphémateur, l'ancien persécuteur, l'ancien insulteur. Mais il a eu pitié de moi parce que j'étais un ignorant, j'avais agi dans l'incrédulité,
[1:14] et la grâce de notre Seigneur a surabondé ainsi que la foi et l'amour pour Jésus-Christ.
[1:15] Il est un fait certain et absolument digne de foi, c'est que Jésus-Christ est venu au monde pour sauver les pécheurs, dont je suis, moi, le premier.
[1:16] Mais voici pourquoi il a eu pitié de moi: Jésus-Christ voulait montrer en moi tout le premier sa grande patience, il voulait que je servisse d'exemple à ceux qui croiront en lui et obtiendront la vie éternelle.
[1:17] Au Roi de l'univers, immortel, invisible, au Dieu unique, soient honneur et gloire aux siècles des siècles ! Amen.
[1:18] Voici la recommandation que je t'adresse, Timothée, mon enfant, m'autorisant des prophéties dont tu as été l'objet : accomplis-les en faisant en bon soldat cette belle campagne, ayant confiance et bonne conscience.
[1:19] Certains l'ont perdue et leur foi a fait naufrage.
[1:20] Parmi eux se trouvent Hyménée et Alexandre, que j'ai livrés à Satan, pour leur apprendre à ne pas blasphémer.
[2:1] Je t'exhorte, avant tout, à faire faire des prières, supplications, intercessions, actions de grâces pour tous les hommes,
[2:2] pour les rois, pour tous ceux qui sont au pouvoir, afin que nous puissions vivre paisiblement, tranquillement, en toute piété et honnêteté.
[2:3] C'est une bonne chose et qui est agréable à Dieu, notre Sauveur,
[2:4] qui veut que tous les hommes soient sauvés et parviennent à la connaissance de la vérité.
[2:5] Il n'y a, en effet, qu'un seul Dieu ; il n'y a aussi qu'un seul médiateur entre Dieu et les hommes, un homme, Jésus-Christ, qui s'est donné en rançon pour tous ;
[2:6] ce fait s'est passé au temps, marqué.
[2:7] Quant à moi, j'ai été désigné pour en être le héraut et l'apôtre (je dis la vérité, je ne mens pas) et pour enseigner aux païens la foi et la vérité.
[2:8] Je veux donc que, partout, les hommes prient, qu'ils lèvent au ciel des mains pures, sans colère, sans arrière-pensées.
[2:9] Les femmes, de même ; et qu'elles aient une tenue convenable ; qu'elles se fassent une parure de leur pudeur et de leur modestie ; ni tresses, ni or, ni perles, ni vêtements coûteux,
[2:10] mais seulement de bonnes oeuvres ; voilà ce qui convient à des femmes qui font profession de piété.
[2:11] La femme doit se laisser instruire en silence et avec une entière soumission.
[2:12] Je ne permets à la femme ni d'enseigner, ni de s'émanciper de l'autorité de l'homme ; qu'elle garde le silence.
[2:13] Car c'est Adam qui fut créé le premier, puis ce fut le tour d'Ève ;
[2:14] et ce n'est pas Adam qui a été séduit, c'est la femme qui s'est laissé séduire et a commis la faute.
[2:15] Cependant elle sera sauvée par la maternité, si elle persiste sagement dans la foi, dans la charité, et dans la sanctification.
[3:1] Il est un fait certain : si quelqu'un aspire à la charge de conducteur d'une église, il convoite une belle tâche.
[3:2] Eh bien, il faut, que le conducteur d'une église soit irréprochable ; qu'il ne soit le mari que d'une femme ; qu'il soit sobre, modéré, modeste, hospitalier, capable d'enseigner ;
[3:3] qu'il n'aime ni le vin, ni les querelles ; au contraire, qu'il soit doux et pacifique ; qu'il ne tienne pas à, l'argent ;
[3:4] qu’il dirige bien sa propre maison ; que ses enfants soient obéissants et parfaitement élevés
[3:5] (si on ne sait pas diriger sa propre maison, comment se charger du soin de l'église de Dieu!) ;
[3:6] qu'il ne soit pas nouvellement converti, de peur que l'orgueil ne le fasse tomber au pouvoir du Diable.
[3:7] Il faut encore qu'il jouisse de la considération de ceux du dehors, de peur qu'il ne donne prise aux reproches, et ne tombe dans le piège du Diable.
[3:8] Les diacres de même doivent être respectables ; qu'ils ne soient point de mauvaise foi ; qu'ils ne se livrent pas à des excès de boisson ; qu'ils ne soient pas bassement intéressés ;
[3:9] qu'ils gardent dans une conscience pure le mystère de la foi.
[3:10] Qu'on commence par les prendre à l'essai ; ensuite qu'on les admette comme diacres, s'il ne s'est élevé aucune plainte.
[3:11] Les femmes, de même, doivent être respectables, non médisantes, sobres, fidèles en toutes choses.
[3:12] Les diacres ne doivent être maris que d'une femme ; bien diriger leurs enfants et leurs propres maisons.
[3:13] Ceux qui ont été de bons diacres finissent par arriver à un rang honorable et par acquérir beaucoup d'assurance dans la foi en Jésus-Christ.
[3:14] Je t'écris tout cela — et cependant j'espère aller bientôt te trouver —
[3:15] parce que, si je tardais, je veux que tu saches la conduite que tu dois tenir dans la maison de Dieu, qui est l'église du Dieu vivant, la colonne et le fondement de la vérité.
[3:16] Il est grand, sans contredit, le mystère de la piété : «...Celui qui a été manifesté en chair, A été légitimé par l'Esprit, A été vu des anges, A été prêché aux païens, A été cru dans le monde, A été élevé dans la gloire.»
[4:1] L'Esprit dit clairement que, dans les derniers temps, un certain nombre abandonneront la foi pour s'attacher à des Esprits séducteurs et à des doctrines de démons,
[4:2] d'hypocrites menteurs, qui portent sur leur conscience même la marque de la flétrissure,
[4:3] qui proscrivent le mariage, qui ordonnent de s'abstenir d'aliments créés par Dieu pour être pris avec actions de grâces par les croyants qui ont reconnu la vérité.
[4:4] En effet, tout ce que Dieu a créé est bon ; on ne doit renoncer à aucun aliment, pourvu qu'on le prenne avec actions de grâces,
[4:5] car alors la parole de Dieu et la prière le sanctifient.
[4:6] C'est en exposant ces choses aux frères que tu seras un bon ministre de Jésus-Christ, nourri des paroles de la foi et de la bonne doctrine que tu as suivie jusqu'à présent.
[4:7] Quant aux contes profanes et aux radotages, repousse-les. Exerce-toi à la piété ;
[4:8] les exercices du corps ont peu d'utilité, mais la piété est utile à tout, puisqu'elle a la promesse de la vie présente et celle de la vie à venir.
[4:9] C'est là un fait certain et absolument digne de foi.
[4:10] Si, en effet, nous nous donnons tant de peine et si nous livrons un si rude combat c'est que nous avons placé notre espérance en un Dieu vivant qui est le Sauveur de tous les hommes, surtout des croyants.
[4:11] Voilà ce que tu dois prescrire et enseigner.
[4:12] Que personne ne te méprise à cause de ta jeunesse ; au contraire, sois un modèle pour les croyants par tes paroles, par ta conduite, par ta charité, par ta foi, par ta chasteté.
[4:13] En attendant que j'arrive, occupe-toi de la lecture, de la prédication, de l'enseignement.
[4:14] Ne néglige pas le don de la grâce que tu possèdes, que tu as reçu quand les Anciens prophétisaient et t'imposaient les mains.
[4:15] Occupe-toi de ces choses, donne-toi à ces choses, afin que tout le monde soit frappé de tes progrès.
[4:16] Veille sur toi-même et sur ton enseignement. Mets-y de la persévérance, car en agissant ainsi tu te sauveras toi-même et tu sauveras ceux qui t'écoutent.
[5:1] Ne te montre pas dur pour l'homme âgé ; au contraire, exhorte-le comme un père, les jeunes gens comme des frères,
[5:2] les femmes âgées comme des mères, les jeunes femmes comme des soeurs, avec une parfaite pureté.
[5:3] Aie des égards pour les veuves ; je parle de celles qui sont réellement veuves.
[5:4] Mais quant à une veuve qui a des enfants ou des petits-enfants, c'est à ceux-ci à apprendre les premiers s'acquitter envers leur famille de leurs devoirs de piété filiale et à payer leurs parents de retour ; car cela est agréable à Dieu.
[5:5] La femme qui, au contraire, est réellement veuve, absolument seule au monde, a appris à mettre son espérance en Dieu et ne cesse ni la nuit ni le jour ses prières et ses supplications,
[5:6] tandis que celle qui court après les plaisirs est une vivante qui est morte.
[5:7] Rappelle-leur ces choses pour qu'elles soient à l'abri de tout reproche.
[5:8] Si quelqu'un néglige les siens, et, en particulier, les membres de sa famille, il a renié la foi et il est pire qu'un incrédule.
[5:9] Une veuve, pour être inscrite sur le registre, doit être âgée de soixante ans au moins, n'avoir eu qu'un mari,
[5:10] se recommander par quelques oeuvres excellentes, comme d'avoir élevé des enfants, exercé l'hospitalité, lavé les pieds des fidèles, secouru les malheureux, pratiqué toutes sortes de bonnes actions.
[5:11] Quant aux veuves encore jeunes, ne les admets pas, car lorsque l'attrait du plaisir les détache du Christ, elles veulent se remarier,
[5:12] et elles s'exposent au reproche de manquer à leur premier engagement.
[5:13] En même temps elles prennent l'habitude de ne rien faire, de courir les maisons et non seulement de ne rien faire, mais de jaser, de s'occuper de tout, de dire ce qu'il ne faut pas dire.
[5:14] Je veux donc que les jeunes veuves se remarient, qu'elles aient, des enfants, une maison à diriger, et ne donnent aucune prise aux médisances de l'adversaire,
[5:15] car déjà quelques-unes ont déserté pour suivre Satan.
[5:16] Si donc, parmi les croyants, un homme, une femme a dans sa famille des veuves, il doit les secourir ; celles-ci ne doivent pas être à la charge de l'Église, qui doit se consacrer aux veuves absolument seules au monde.
[5:17] Juge dignes d'un double honneur les Anciens qui ont bien rempli leurs devoirs, en particulier ceux qui se chargent de la prédication et de l'enseignement.
[5:18] L'Écriture dit en effet : «Tu ne muselleras point le boeuf qui foule le blé»,
[5:19] et l'ouvrier mérite son salaire. N'accueille point d'accusation contre un Ancien, sauf dans le cas où il y aurait «deux ou trois témoins».
[5:20] Reprends devant tout le monde ceux qui sont en faute, pour inspirer aussi de la crainte aux autres.
[5:21] Je te conjure devant Dieu, devant Jésus-Christ et devant les anges élus de suivre ces conseils sans préjugé, sans rien faire par esprit de parti.
[5:22] Ne te décide pas trop vite à imposer les mains à quelqu'un, et ne te rends pas solidaire des torts d'autrui ; toi-même reste pur.
[5:23] Renonce à ne boire que de l'eau ; prends au contraire un peu de vin à cause de ton estomac et de tes fréquentes indispositions.
[5:24] Certaines personnes sont si évidemment en faute qu'on les juge tout de suite ; d'autres ne se dévoilent que plus tard.
[5:25] Il en est de même des bonnes oeuvres ; elles sont en évidence, et celles qui ne sont pas telles tout de suite ne peuvent pas rester cachées.
[6:1] Ceux qui portent le joug de la servitude doivent considérer leurs maîtres comme dignes de tout respect afin qu'on ne calomnie ni le nom de Dieu, ni notre enseignement.
[6:2] Ceux qui ont des maîtres croyants ne doivent pas les mépriser sous prétexte qu'ils sont leurs frères, mais les servir d'autant mieux que ceux qui reçoivent leurs bons soins sont des croyants, sont des bien-aimés. Tels seront tes enseignements et tes exhortations.
[6:3] Si quelqu'un enseigne d'une autre manière et s'écarte des saines doctrines de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ et de l'enseignement qui favorise la piété,
[6:4] c'est un orgueilleux, c'est un ignorant, il a la maladie des discussions oiseuses et des disputes de mots, d'où naissent les jalousies, les querelles, les calomnies, les soupçons injustes,
[6:5] les interminables discussions de gens à l'esprit faux, qui sont toujours à côté de la vérité, et considèrent la piété comme une affaire d'argent.
[6:6] Oui, sans doute, la piété est une affaire et une excellente affaire pour celui qui est content de son sort.
[6:7] Car nous n'avons rien apporté dans le monde, et nous n'en pouvons rien emporter.
[6:8] Sachons nous contenter d'avoir de quoi nous nourrir et nous couvrir.
[6:9] Ceux qui veulent devenir riches se laissent tenter, tombent dans le piège et ont une quantité de désirs déraisonnables et pernicieux qui entraînent les hommes à leur ruine et à leur perte.
[6:10] Car la racine de tous les maux c'est l'amour de l'argent ; quelques-uns s'y sont abandonnés, se sont détournés de la foi et se sont créé à eux-mêmes de cruels remords.
[6:11] Pour toi, homme de Dieu, fuis ces choses, et recherche la justice, la piété, la foi, l'amour, la patience, la douceur.
[6:12] Combats le bon combat de la foi, empare-toi de la vie éternelle en vue de laquelle tu as reçu ta vocation, et tu as fait ta belle déclaration devant de nombreux témoins.
[6:13] Je te recommande, en présence du Dieu qui donne la vie à toutes choses et de Jésus-Christ, qui a rendu témoignage devant Ponce-Pilate dans une si belle déclaration,
[6:14] d'observer ces commandements sans tache et sans reproche jusqu'à la venue de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ
[6:15] que nous montrera, au temps marqué, le bienheureux et unique Souverain, le Roi des rois, le Seigneur des seigneurs,
[6:16] le seul Être immortel, Celui qui habite une lumière inaccessible, que personne n'a vu ni ne peut voir ; à lui soit à jamais honneur et puissance. Amen.
[6:17] Aux riches de ce monde tu recommanderas de ne pas être orgueilleux, de ne pas compter sur des richesses instables, mais sur Dieu qui nous fournit largement tout ce dont nous avons besoin.
[6:18] Recommande-leur de faire du bien, de s'enrichir de bonnes oeuvres, d'être généreux, charitables,
[6:19] économisant ainsi un beau fonds pour l'avenir afin d'acquérir la véritable vie.
[6:20] Timothée, garde bien ton dépôt, évite les discussions inutiles et profanes, les objections de ce qu'on appelle à tort science.
[6:21] Certaines gens, en affectant de s'y adonner, se sont éloignés de la foi. 

### II Timothy

[1:1] Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, pour annoncer la promesse de la vie qui est en Jésus-Christ,
[1:2] à Timothée son enfant bien-aimé. Grâce, miséricorde, paix te soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[1:3] Je rends grâces au Dieu que je sers, comme mes ancêtres, avec une conscience pure (car je te nomme sans cesse, nuit et jour, dans mes prières
[1:4] et, quand je me souviens de tes larmes, j'ai un ardent désir de te revoir, ce serait pour moi le comble de la joie),
[1:5] me rappelant combien ta foi est sincère. Cette foi animait autrefois ta grand'mère Loïs, puis ta mère Eunice ; je suis convaincu qu'elle t'anime aussi.
[1:6] Voilà le motif pour lequel je te recommande d'entretenir le don que Dieu t'a fait dans sa grâce, quand je t'ai imposé les mains ;
[1:7] car Dieu ne nous a pas donné un esprit de timidité, mais de force, d'amour, de sagesse.
[1:8] N'aie donc pas honte de rendre témoignage à notre Seigneur, ni de moi, prisonnier pour lui ; sache souffrir avec moi pour l'Évangile par la puissance que Dieu te donne ;
[1:9] lui qui nous a sauvés et nous a adressé un saint appel. Ce n'est pas à cause de nos oeuvres ; c'est une décision de sa liberté, une grâce qu'il nous a accordée en Jésus-Christ de toute éternité
[1:10] et qui s'est montrée de nos jours par l'apparition de notre Sauveur Jésus-Christ, qui a anéanti la mort et mis en pleine lumière la vie et mortalité par l'Évangile,
[1:11] dont j'ai été fait le héraut, l'apôtre et le docteur.
[1:12] Voilà encore le motif pour lequel je souffre ce que je souffre, mais sans en avoir honte ; car je sais en qui j'ai cru et je suis persuadé que Celui-là a le pouvoir de garder mon dépôt jusqu'au grand jour.
[1:13] Conserve dans l'esprit de foi et d'amour qui s'inspire de Jésus-Christ le modèle des saines instructions que tu m'as entendu te donner.
[1:14] Garde le précieux dépôt avec l'aide de l'Esprit saint qui demeure en nous.
[1:15] Tu sais que tous ceux d'Asie, entre autres Phygelles et Hermogène, m'ont abandonné.
[1:16] Que le Seigneur fasse descendre sa grâce sur la famille d'Onésiphore, car il m'a souvent fortifié et n'a pas eu honte de la chaîne que je porte.
[1:17] Au contraire, dès son arrivée à Rome, il s'est mis avec empressement à ma recherche et a fini par me trouver.
[1:18] Que le Seigneur lui donne de rencontrer sa grâce au grand jour! Et tous les services qu'il a rendus à Éphèse, tu les connais mieux que personne.
[2:1] Pour toi, mon enfant, cherche la force dans la grâce qui est en Jésus-Christ ;
[2:2] et ce que tu m'as entendu dire en présence de plusieurs témoins, transmets-le à des croyants, à des hommes qui soient capables à leur tour d'en enseigner d'autres.
[2:3] Prends ta part de souffrances comme un bon soldat de Jésus-Christ.
[2:4] Personne, partant pour la guerre, ne va s'embarrasser des affaires de la vie civile, s'il veut plaire à celui qui l'a enrôlé ;
[2:5] et jamais athlète ne remporte la couronne, qui n'a pas lutté suivant les règles.
[2:6] Le laboureur doit commencer par travailler pour un, jour faire la moisson.
[2:7] Pense bien à ce que je dis là, et c'est le Seigneur qui te donnera de tout comprendre.
[2:8] Souviens-toi de Jésus-Christ, ressuscité des morts, descendant de David, d'après mon Évangile,
[2:9] Évangile pour lequel j'endure de telles souffrances que je suis enchaîné comme un malfaiteur ; mais la parole de Dieu n'est pas enchaînée!
[2:10] Voici pourquoi je supporte tout: c'est à cause des élus, c'est pour qu'ils obtiennent le salut qui est en Jésus-Christ, avec une gloire éternelle.
[2:11] Un fait est certain : si nous mourons avec lui, nous vivrons aussi avec lui ;
[2:12] si nous persévérons, nous serons dans son Royaume avec lui ; si nous le renions, lui aussi nous reniera ;
[2:13] si nous sommes infidèles, lui reste fidèle, car il ne peut se renier lui-même.
[2:14] Voilà ce que tu dois rappeler en conjurant, en présence de Dieu, de renoncer aux disputes de mots, qui ne servent à rien et sont la ruine de ceux qui les entendent.
[2:15] Fais des efforts pour te montrer à Dieu ouvrier éprouvé, qui n'a point à rougir, qui suit fidèlement la parole de la vérité.
[2:16] Évite les conversations vaines et profanes ; car, avec elles, on fera d'énormes progrès dans l'impiété,
[2:17] et la parole deviendra une vraie gangrène qui étendra partout ses ravages. Voilà ce qui est arrivé à Hyménée et à Philète:
[2:18] ils se sont détournés de la vérité, ils disent que la résurrection a déjà eu lieu, et ils détruisent la foi d'un certain nombre de personnes.
[2:19] Cependant l'édifice dont Dieu a posé l'inébranlable fondement se dresse portant cette inscription : «Le Seigneur connaît les siens» ; et: «Quiconque invoque le nom du Seigneur doit se détourner de l'iniquité».
[2:20] Dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, il y en a aussi de bois et de terre ; les uns ont un noble usage, les autres en ont un vulgaire.
[2:21] Eh bien, celui qui veille sur sa pureté, qui s'éloigne de ces gens-là, sera un vase destiné à un noble usage, sanctifié, utile à son maître, propre à toute bonne oeuvre.
[2:22] Fuis les passions de la jeunesse, recherche la justice, la foi, la charité, la paix avec ceux qui invoquent le Seigneur d'un coeur pur.
[2:23] Repousse les questions absurdes et déraisonnables, tu sais qu'elles engendrent des querelles.
[2:24] Or, le serviteur du Seigneur ne doit pas être querelleur, mais au contraire doux envers tout le monde, savoir enseigner, savoir supporter le mal,
[2:25] savoir ramener par la douceur ceux qui le contredisent, dans l'espoir que Dieu leur donnera de changer d'avis, de reconnaître la vérité, de revenir à leur bon sens,
[2:26] d'échapper aux pièges du Diable qui les tient esclaves et leur fait faire tout ce qu'il veut.
[3:1] Sache bien que, pendant les derniers jours, il y aura des moments très difficiles.
[3:2] Les hommes seront égoïstes, avares, prétentieux, arrogants, médisants, rebelles à leurs parents, ingrats, irréligieux,
[3:3] durs, déloyaux, calomniateurs, intempérants, impitoyables, indifférents,
[3:4] traîtres, emportés, vaniteux, aimant moins Dieu que leurs plaisirs,
[3:5] se donnant des airs de piété et reniant tout ce qui fait la force de la piété. Évite ces gens-là.
[3:6] Il y a, entre autres, ceux qui se glissent dans les familles, qui s'emparent de misérables femmes, chargées de péchés, travaillées par toutes sortes de passions,
[3:7] voulant toujours apprendre et ne pouvant jamais arriver à connaître la vérité.
[3:8] De même que Jannès et Jambrès s'opposèrent à Moïse, de même ces hommes s'opposent à la vérité, ils ont l'esprit faux, et leur foi ne résiste pas à l'épreuve.
[3:9] Mais ils n'iront pas plus loin, car leur folie sera bientôt évidente pour tout le monde, comme l'a été celle de ces deux imposteurs.
[3:10] Toi, tu m'es attaché par l'enseignement, la conduite, les projets, la foi, la patience, l'amour, le support,
[3:11] les persécutions, les souffrances, telles que je les ai endurées à Antioche, à Iconium, à Lystres! Que de persécutions j'ai eu à subir! et chaque fois le Seigneur m'a délivré!
[3:12] Tous ceux qui voudront mener une vie pieuse en Jésus-Christ, seront persécutés.
[3:13] Quant aux méchants et aux charlatans, ils tomberont toujours plus bas, aussi bien les séducteurs que les égarés.
[3:14] Toi, persévère dans ce que tu as appris et reconnu certain, n'oublie pas qui t'a instruit
[3:15] et que, depuis ton enfance, tu connais les saintes Écritures qui peuvent, par la foi en Jésus-Christ, te faire comprendre le salut.
[3:16] Toute Écriture est inspirée de Dieu et utile pour a enseigner, pour avertir, pour corriger, pour former à la justice,
[3:17] afin que l'homme de Dieu soit accompli et propre à toute bonne oeuvre.
[4:1] Je te conjure, en présence de Dieu et de Jésus-Christ qui doit, juger les vivants et les morts, et au nom de son avènement et de son Royaume,
[4:2] de prêcher la parole, d'insister à propos et hors de propos, de reprendre, d'exhorter, de censurer, toujours avec patience et toujours en instruisant ;
[4:3] car il viendra un temps où on ne supportera plus une saine instruction, mais chacun suivra son goût particulier, ou s'entourera en quantité de ces docteurs qui savent chatouiller agréablement les oreilles,
[4:4] et alors on se détournera de la vérité et on s'attachera à des fables.
[4:5] Pour toi, sois sobre de toutes ces choses, apprends à souffrir, remplis tes devoirs d'évangéliste, donne-toi complètement à ton ministère.
[4:6] Quant à moi, je suis bien près du sacrifice, je touche au moment du départ ;
[4:7] j'ai combattu le bon combat, j'ai achevé la course, j'ai gardé la foi.
[4:8] Il ne me reste plus qu'à recevoir la couronne de la justice ; le Seigneur, le juste juge, me la donnera au grand jour, et non seulement à moi, mais aussi à tous ceux qui ont désiré son avènement.
[4:9] Tâche de me rejoindre bientôt,
[4:10] car Démas m'a abandonné par â amour pour le monde ; il est allé à Thessalonique, Crescens en Galatie, Tite en Dalmatie.
[4:11] Luc seul est avec moi. Prends Marc et amène-le avec toi, car il m'est utile dans mon ministère.
[4:12] Quant à Tychique, je l'ai envoyé à Éphèse.
[4:13] Lorsque tu viendras, apporte-moi le manteau que j'ai laissé à Troas chez Carpus ; les livres aussi ; surtout les parchemins.
[4:14] Alexandre, le forgeron, m'a témoigné une très grande malveillance ; que le Seigneur «Lui rende selon ses oeuvres!»
[4:15] Garde-toi aussi de lui ; il s'est montré très opposé à mes paroles.
[4:16] Lors de mon premier plaidoyer personne n'est venu à mon aide ; ils m'ont tous abandonné (qu'il ne leur en soit pas tenu compte!) ;
[4:17] mais le Seigneur m'a soutenu et m'a donné des forces ; j'ai pu prêcher d'une manière très complète ; les païens m'ont tous entendu, et j'ai été délivré «de la gueule du lion».
[4:18] Le Seigneur me délivrera de toute fâcheuse affaire et me sauvera dans son céleste Royaume ; à lui soit la gloire aux siècles des siècles. Amen.
[4:19] Salue Prisca, Aquilas et la famille d'Onésiphore.
[4:20] Éraste est resté à Corinthe ; j'ai laissé Trophime malade à Milet.
[4:21] Tâche de venir avant l'hiver. Eubulus te salue, ainsi que Pudens, Linus, Claudie, et tous les frères.
[4:22] Le Seigneur soit avec ton esprit. La grâce soit avec vous. 

### Titus

[1:1] Paul, serviteur de Dieu, apôtre de Jésus-Christ, pour annoncer la foi des élus de Dieu, pour faire connaître la vérité conforme a la piété
[1:2] et donner l'espérance de la vie éternelle, promise depuis un temps immémorial par le Dieu véridique,
[1:3] révélée au temps marqué par sa parole dont il a donné l'ordre de me confier la prédication, lui, notre Dieu sauveur,
[1:4] à Tite, mon véritable enfant dans la foi qui nous est commune. Grâce et paix te soient données par Dieu notre Père et par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.
[1:5] Voici pourquoi je t'ai laissé en Crète : pour que tu règles ce qui reste à régler et que, dans chaque ville, tu installes des Anciens aux conditions que je t'ai indiquées :
[1:6] être sans reproche, mari d'une seule femme, avoir des enfants croyants, qui ne soient ni indisciplinés, ni accusés de vivre dans le désordre.
[1:7] Oui, le conducteur d'une Église doit être sans reproche, étant l'intendant de Dieu ; il ne doit être ni insolent, ni colère ; n'aimer ni le vin ni les querelles ; ne pas être bassement intéressé ;
[1:8] mais être hospitalier, aimer à faire le bien ; être modéré, juste, pieux, sobre,
[1:9] attaché à la parole authentique, conformément à la doctrine reçue, pour être capable, lui aussi, d'exhorter par un sain enseignement et de réfuter les contradicteurs.
[1:10] Car ils sont nombreux, surtout parmi les circoncis, les indisciplinés, les bavards, les trompeurs
[1:11] auxquels il faut fermer la bouche. Ces gens-là mettent le désordre dans des familles entières, enseignant ce qu'il ne faut pas enseigner et cela par honteux intérêt.
[1:12] Un des leurs a été leur propre prophète quand il a dit : «...Crétois, toujours menteurs, vilaines bêtes, ventres paresseux...»
[1:13] Voilà un jugement mérité ; voilà le motif de les reprendre sévèrement, pour qu'ils aient une foi saine,
[1:14] qu'ils ne s'occupent pas de contes judaïques et de commandements d'hommes abandonnant la vérité.
[1:15] Tout est pur pour ceux qui sont purs ; quant aux corrompus et aux incrédules, rien ne leur est pur ; leurs pensées et leurs consciences sont corrompues.
[1:16] Ils prétendent connaître Dieu, et leurs oeuvres le renient ; ils sont abominables, rebelles, incapables de rien faire de bien.
[2:1] Mais, toi, prêche comme le demande un sain enseignement :
[2:2] Que les hommes d'un âge mûr doivent être sobres, mesurés, sérieux, sains dans leur foi, leur charité, leur patience.
[2:3] Que les femmes âgées doivent aussi avoir un extérieur respectable, n'être ni médisantes, ni adonnées à la boisson ; qu'elles doivent être bonnes conseillères ;
[2:4] qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes femmes à aimer leurs maris et leurs enfants,
[2:5] à être sérieuses, chastes, bonnes ménagères, soumises, chacune à son mari, pour qu'on ne dise point de mal de la parole de Dieu.
[2:6] Exhorte aussi les jeunes gens à être sérieux,
[2:7] et donne toi-même à tous égards le modèle de toutes les vertus, de la pureté dans l'enseignement, de la dignité,
[2:8] d'une prédication saine et irréprochable, et l'adversaire aura la confusion de ne pouvoir dire aucun mal de nous.
[2:9] Aux esclaves tu diras d'être soumis à leurs maîtres, qu'en tout ils cherchent à leur plaire, qu'ils ne les contredisent pas ;
[2:10] qu'ils ne détournent rien, mais qu'ils se montrent en tout parfaitement fidèles, et ainsi ils feront honneur en tout à la doctrine de Dieu notre Sauveur.
[2:11] Car la grâce de Dieu qui sauve tous les hommes a été révélée ;
[2:12] elle nous apprend à renoncer à l'impiété et aux plaisirs du monde, à vivre sagement, justement et pieusement dans le monde présent,
[2:13] et à attendre la réalisation de notre bienheureuse espérance, l'apparition de la gloire de notre grand Dieu et Sauveur Jésus-Christ.
[2:14] Il s'est lui-même donné pour nous afin de nous racheter de tout péché et de se créer un peuple particulier» et zélé pour les bonnes oeuvres.
[2:15] Voilà ce que tu dois dire, enseigner, recommander avec une pleine autorité ; que personne ne te méprise.
[3:1] Rappelle aux fidèles qu'ils ont à se soumettre aux autorités, aux, puissances, à leur obéir, à être prêts à faire le bien ;
[3:2] à ne dire de mal de personne, à être paisibles, indulgents, à se montrer doux envers tout le monde.
[3:3] Nous aussi étions autrefois insensés, désobéissants, égarés, esclaves de toutes sortes de plaisirs et de passions, vivant dans la méchanceté et la jalousie, ne méritant que la haine et nous haïssant les uns les autres.
[3:4] Mais quand a paru la bonté, l'amour pour les hommes de Dieu notre Sauveur,
[3:5] nous avons été sauvés, non parce que nous avions accompli des oeuvres de justice, mais parce qu'il est miséricordieux ; il nous a purifiés, régénérés, renouvelés par l'Esprit saint
[3:6] qu'il a libéralement répandu sur nous par Jésus-Christ notre Sauveur.
[3:7] C'est ainsi que justifiés par sa grâce, nous devenons, en espérance, héritiers de la vie éternelle.
[3:8] Le fait est certain, et je veux que tu les en persuades, afin que ceux qui ont cru en Dieu se mettent à faire de bonnes oeuvres. Voilà ce qui est bon et utile aux hommes.
[3:9] Quant aux sottes questions, aux généalogies, aux querelles et aux discussions sur la Loi, écarte-les ; tout cela est frivole et inutile.
[3:10] Tu rompras après deux avertissements avec celui qui fomente des divisions ;
[3:11] ces gens-là, sache-le, sont coupables, pervertis et se condamnent eux-mêmes.
[3:12] Dès que je t'aurai envoyé soit Artémas, soit Tychique, tache de me rejoindre à Nicopolis, car je me suis décidé à y passer l'hiver.
[3:13] Tu auras bien soin de Zénas, le docteur de la Loi, et d'Apollon, quand ils partiront ; qu'il ne leur manque rien.
[3:14] Les nôtres aussi doivent apprendre, dans les cas urgents, à pratiquer de bonnes oeuvres et ainsi à ne pas rester stériles.
[3:15] Tous ceux qui sont avec moi te saluent. Salue les croyants qui nous aiment. 

### Philemon

[1:1] Paul, prisonnier de Jésus-Christ, et le frère Timothée à Philémon, notre bien-aimé et notre collaborateur,
[1:2] à notre soeur Appia, à Archippe, notre compagnon d'armes, et à l'église qui s'assemble dans ta maison.
[1:3] Grâce et paix vous soient accordées par Dieu notre Père et par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:4] Je rends sans cesse grâce à mon Dieu quand ton souvenir se présente à moi dans mes prières.
[1:5] J'apprends, en effet, ta foi au Seigneur Jésus et ton amour pour tous les fidèles,
[1:6] et je demande que ta foi se communique et porte des fruits et que tu saches ce qui pour nous est le bien, en vue de Christ !
[1:7] Ton amour, en effet, nous a causé beaucoup de joie et de consolation ; car les coeurs des fidèles ont été tranquillisés par toi, frère.
[1:8] Aussi aurais-je le droit en Christ de te prescrire en toute confiance ce que tu dois faire ;
[1:9] mais je préfère m'adresser à toi au nom de cet amour, et en mon nom, au nom de Paul, un vieillard, et, dans ce moment, un prisonnier de Jésus-Christ.
[1:10] Je t'adresse donc une prière pour mon fils, que j'ai engendré dans les fers, pour Onésime.
[1:11] Il s'appelle Utile, et il ne te servait à rien autrefois. A l'avenir il nous servira beaucoup à tous les deux.
[1:12] Je te le renvoie, lui, c'est-à-dire la meilleure partie de moi-même.
[1:13] Je voulais le retenir auprès de moi, pour qu'au lieu de te servir, il me servît pendant que je suis prisonnier pour l'Évangile ;
[1:14] mais je n'ai rien voulu faire sans ton avis, afin de ne pas t'obliger à lui faire du bien, et de te laisser entièrement libre.
[1:15] Peut-être n'a-t-il été séparé de toi un moment qu'afin que tu le retrouves à jamais
[1:16] non plus comme esclave, mais comme frère bien-aimé au lieu d'esclave ; oui, bien-aimé de moi d'abord et plus encore de toi et selon la nature et selon le Seigneur!
[1:17] Si donc tu me considères comme ton ami, reçois-le comme moi-même.
[1:18] S'il t'a fait quelque tort, s'il te doit quelque chose, passe-le à mon compte.
[1:19] Moi, Paul, — j'écris ceci de ma main — je te rembourserai, sans te rappeler que tu es mon débiteur et que tu l'es de ta propre personne.
[1:20] Allons, frère, fais-moi ce plaisir dans le Seigneur! Tranquillise mon coeur en Christ!
[1:21] Je t'écris convaincu de ton obéissance, certain même que tu iras au delà de ce que je te demande.
[1:22] En même temps, prépare-toi à me recevoir ; car j'espère vous être rendu, grâce à vos prières.
[1:23] Épaphras, mon compagnon de chaînes en Jésus-Christ, te salue
[1:24] ainsi que Marc, Aristarque, Démas, Luc, mes collaborateurs.
[1:25] La grâce de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ soit avec votre esprit. 

### Hebrews

[1:1] C'est à plusieurs reprises et de plusieurs manières que Dieu a autrefois parlé à nos pères par les prophètes ; et, de nos jours, qui sont les derniers,
[1:2] il nous a parlé, à nous, par un Fils, qu'il a fait héritier de toutes choses et par lequel il a aussi créé le monde.
[1:3] Étant un reflet de sa gloire et une empreinte de son essence, soutenant toutes choses par sa puissante parole, ce Fils a accompli l'oeuvre de la purification des péchés et «...s'est assis à la droite...» de la majesté divine dans les régions célestes,
[1:4] devenu d'autant supérieur aux anges que le nom dont il a hérité est plus éminent que le leur.
[1:5] Auquel des anges, en effet, Dieu a-t-il jamais dit : «Tu es mon Fils ; Je t'ai engendré aujourd'hui», et ailleurs : «Je serai son Père, et il sera mon Fils.»
[1:6] Et lorsque, dans un autre passage, il introduit le premier-né dans le monde, il dit : «Que tous les anges de Dieu l'adorent.»
[1:7] Quant aux anges, il en dit ceci «...Celui qui fait de ses anges des esprits Et de ses serviteurs une flamme de feu...»
[1:8] Il dit, au contraire, du Fils : «Ton trône, Dieu, est éternel. Le sceptre de ta royauté est un sceptre de droiture.
[1:9] Tu as aimé la justice et tu as haï l'iniquité. Voilà pourquoi, Dieu, ton Dieu t'a oint D'une huile de réjouissance, de préférence à tes égaux.»
[1:10] Et ensuite : «C'est toi, Seigneur, qui, au commencement, as fondé la terre Et les cieux sont l'oeuvre de tes mains.
[1:11] Ils périront, toi tu restes. Ils vieilliront tous comme un manteau,
[1:12] Tu les plieras comme une couverture, comme un manteau, et ils se transformeront, Mais toi tu restes le même Et tes années ne finiront pas.»
[1:13] Auquel des anges Dieu a-t-il jamais dit : «Assieds-toi à ma droite Jusqu'à ce que j'aie mis tes ennemis sous tes pieds comme un marchepied?»
[1:14] Les anges ne sont-ils pas tous des esprits subalternes, employés au service de Dieu, pour ceux qui doivent hériter du salut?
[2:1] Voilà pourquoi nous devons apporter une attention toute spéciale à ce que nous avons entendu, pour ne pas le perdre par notre négligence.
[2:2] Si, en effet, la parole apportée par des anges a reçu sa sanction, si toute transgression et toute désobéissance ont été punies comme elles le méritaient,
[2:3] comment échapperions-nous si nous négligions un si grand salut, salut qui d'abord fut annoncé par le Seigneur, et qui nous fut ensuite confirmé par ceux qui l'avaient entendu de lui,
[2:4] et dont Dieu appuyait le témoignage par des signes, des prodiges, toutes sortes de miracles et par son Esprit saint qu'il répartissait selon sa volonté?
[2:5] car ce n'est pas aux anges qu'il a soumis le monde à venir dont nous parlons.
[2:6] On lit quelque part cette déclaration : «Qu'est-ce que l'Homme que tu te souviennes de lui? Ou le Fils de l'homme que tu t'en occupes?
[2:7] Tu l'as mis pour quelque temps au-dessous des anges, Tu l'as couronné de gloire et d'honneur,
[2:8] Tu as tout mis sous ses pieds !» Ce terme : «tu lui as tout soumis» indique que Dieu n'a rien laissé en dehors de son pouvoir. Cependant nous ne voyons pas encore que «tout lui soit soumis».
[2:9] Nous voyons seulement que Jésus «mis pour quelque temps au-dessous des anges» a été, à cause de ses souffrances et de sa mort, «couronné de gloire et d'honneur». C'était par une grâce de Dieu, afin de subir la mort pour tous les hommes.
[2:10] Il était digne, en effet, de Celui par lequel et à cause duquel tout a été créé, de Celui qui voulait conduire à la gloire un grand nombre de fils, d'élever par des souffrances jusqu'à la perfection l'auteur de leur salut.
[2:11] Tous, et celui qui sanctifie et ceux qui sont sanctifiés, ont un même Père ; voilà pourquoi Jésus ne dédaigne pas d'appeler ceux-ci ses «frères»
[2:12] quand il dit : «J’annoncerai ton nom à mes frères ; Au milieu de l'assemblée, je te louerai.»
[2:13] Et ailleurs : «Je mettrai ma confiance en lui». Ailleurs encore : «Me voici, moi et les enfants que Dieu m'a donnés»,
[2:14] Puisque les «enfants» ont tous en partage la chair et le sang, lui en a eu aussi sa part pour détruire par sa mort celui qui est le maître de la mort, je veux dire le Diable,
[2:15] et pour délivrer ceux que la crainte de la mort rendait esclaves toute leur vie.
[2:16] Car assurément ce n'est pas aux anges qu'il porte secours, c'est à la race d'Abraham.
[2:17] Par suite, il le fallait entièrement semblable à «ses frères», afin d'être, pour leurs rapports avec Dieu, un grand-prêtre compatissant et digne de foi, pour faire l'expiation des péchés du peuple.
[2:18] C'est parce qu'il a souffert, c'est parce qu'il a été éprouvé qu'il peut secourir ceux qui sont éprouvés.
[3:1] En conséquence, mes saints frères, vous qui êtes appelés à aller au ciel, fixez les yeux sur l'apôtre et le grand-prêtre de la foi que nous professons,
[3:2] sur Jésus, qui était «fidèle» à celui qui l'avait institué, comme Moïse l'était dans toute sa maison ».
[3:3] - Mais Jésus a été jugé digne de surpasser Moïse en éclat de toute la distance qui sépare une maison de son constructeur.
[3:4] (Toute maison a un architecte ; Celui qui a tout construit c'est Dieu.)
[3:5] Moïse, lui, a été fidèle «DANS toute sa maison, comme un serviteurs», par le témoignage qu'il a rendu à ce qui devait être révélé plus tard ;
[3:6] Christ l'était comme un fils, «SUR sa maison» ; et sa maison à lui c'est nous, si toutefois nous persistons fermement, jusqu'à la fin dans l'assurance et l'espérance qui font notre gloire.)
[3:7] — Ainsi, comme le dit l'Esprit saint : «Si vous entendez aujourd'hui sa voix,
[3:8] N'endurcissez pas vos coeurs, comme au jour de la révolte Et de la provocation dans le désert,
[3:9] Quand vos pères m'ont provoqué et m'ont mis à l'épreuve, Eux qui avaient vu mes oeuvres pendant quarante ans!
[3:10] Voilà pourquoi je me suis irrité contre cette génération Et j'ai dit : leurs coeurs s'égarent toujours. Ils n'ont point reconnu mes voies ;
[3:11] Et voici le serment que j'ai fait dans ma colère : Jamais ils n'entreront dans mon repos !»
[3:12] Que personne de vous, mes frères, prenez-y garde, n'ait un mauvais coeur, ne soit incrédule, ne se sépare du Dieu vivant.
[3:13] Mais exhortez-vous les uns les autres, tous les jours, tant que l'on peut dire : «aujourd'hui», et qu'aucun de vous ne se laisse séduire et «endurcir» par le péché.
[3:14] Car nous n'avons notre part du Christ que si nous gardons notre assurance première, fermement, jusqu'à la fin,
[3:15] aussi longtemps qu'on peut dire : «Si vous entendez aujourd'hui sa voix N'endurcissez pas vos coeurs, comme au jour de la révolte.»
[3:16] Lesquels, après avoir entendu, «se sont révoltés»? N'est-ce pas tous ceux que Moïse avait conduits hors d'Égypte?
[3:17] Et contre qui «Dieu s'irrita-t-il pendant quarante ans»? N'est-ce pas contre ceux qui péchaient et dont «les corps jonchaient le désert»?
[3:18] Et à qui «jura-t-il qu'ils n'entreraient pas dans son repos?» N'est-ce pas à ceux qui désobéissaient?
[3:19] Nous voyons, en effet, que leur incrédulité les empêcha d'y entrer.
[4:1] Prenons donc garde : elle dure encore, la promesse «d'entrer dans son repos», et alors, qu'aucun de vous ne vienne à en perdre le bénéfice ;
[4:2] oui, la Bonne Nouvelle nous en a été annoncée à nous comme aux autres ; mais, à eux il n'a servi de rien d'entendre la parole, parce que, tout en l'entendant, ils ne se la sont pas appropriée par la foi.
[4:3] Et nous, c'est si nous avons eu la foi que «nous entrerons dans le repos», dont il a dit : «Voici le serment que j'ai fait dans ma colère, Jamais ils n'entreront dans mon repos!
[4:4] Il a parlé ainsi et cependant ses «oeuvres» étaient achevées depuis la création du monde (en effet, il a dit quelque part à propos du septième jour : «Dieu se reposa de toutes ses oeuvres le septième jour ;»)
[4:5] et puis, dans le passage ci-dessus il dit de nouveau : «Jamais ils n'entreront dans mon repos!»
[4:6] C'est parce que l'entrée dans le repos est réservée à un certain nombre, et que ceux qui en avaient les premiers reçu la Bonne Nouvelle n'y sont pas entrés à cause de leur désobéissance,
[4:7] c'est pour cela qu'il fixe de nouveau un jour : «aujourd'hui» et il le fait dans un passage de David, bien longtemps après, nous l'avons cité plus haut : «Si vous entendez aujourd'hui sa voix, N'endurcissez pas vos coeurs.»
[4:8] Si, en effet, Josué leur avait donné le repos, Dieu ne parlerait pas plus tard d'un autre jour.
[4:9] Donc, il reste un repos, un sabbat pour le peuple de Dieu
[4:10] et celui qui «entrera dans son repos se reposera de ses oeuvres» comme Dieu des siennes.
[4:11] Empressons-nous donc «d'entrer» dans ce «repos» pour qu'aucun de nous ne tombe en donnant, comme les autres, l'exemple de la désobéissance.
[4:12] Car elle est vivante, la parole de Dieu, et puissante, et plus acérée qu'aucune épée à deux tranchants, elle pénètre jusqu'à diviser et l'âme et l'esprit et les jointures et les moelles, elle juge des sentiments et des intentions du coeur ;
[4:13] aucune créature ne se dérobe devant elle ; tout est à nu, tout est à découvert aux yeux de Celui à qui nous avons affaire.
[4:14] Eh bien, puisque nous avons un tel grand-prêtre, qui a pénétré jusqu'au fond des cieux, qui s'appelle Jésus, le Fils de Dieu, soyons fermes à confesser notre foi!
[4:15] Et, en effet, nous n'avons pas un grand-prêtre qui ne puisse compatir à nos faiblesses ; au contraire, il a été tenté en toutes choses exactement comme nous, et il est resté sans péché.
[4:16] Approchons-nous donc avec assurance du trône de la grâce afin d'obtenir miséricorde et de trouver grâce en un temps bien opportun pour être secouru.
[5:1] Tout grand-prêtre, pris parmi les hommes, est établi pour le bien des hommes, pour régler leurs relations avec Dieu ; dans ce but, il offre des oblations et des sacrifices pour les péchés ;
[5:2] il peut être indulgent pour les ignorants et les égarés, puisque lui aussi est sujet à la faiblesse.
[5:3] Aussi est-il tenu à des sacrifices expiatoires aussi bien pour lui-même que pour le peuple.
[5:4] De plus, on ne s'arroge pas soi-même cette dignité ; c'est Dieu qui vous y appelle, comme il fit pour Aaron.
[5:5] Ainsi le Christ : il ne s'est pas arrogé lui-même la gloire d'être grand-prêtre, mais Dieu lui a dit : «Tu es mon Fils, Je t'ai engendré aujourd'hui!»
[5:6] et dans un autre passage : «Tu es prêtre à tout jamais Selon l'ordre de Melchisédek.»
[5:7] Lui qui, pendant sa vie sur la terre, a offert, à celui qui pouvait le délivrer de la mort, des prières et des supplications en jetant de grands cris et en versant des larmes, lui qui a été exaucé à cause de sa piété
[5:8] (il était Fils, et cependant par ses souffrances il a appris l'obéissance),
[5:9] arrivé alors au plus haut point de la perfection, il est devenu pour tous ceux qui lui obéissent l'auteur d'un salut, éternel,
[5:10] ayant été proclamé par Dieu grand-prêtre «selon l'ordre de Melchisédek».
[5:11] C'est un sujet sur lequel nous avons beaucoup à dire et des choses difficiles à expliquer, parce que vous êtes lents à comprendre.
[5:12] Il y a longtemps que vous devriez être des maîtres, et vous avez encore besoin qu'on vous apprenne les premiers éléments des révélations de Dieu ; vous en êtes à avoir besoin de lait au lieu d'une nourriture solide.
[5:13] Celui qui en est encore au lait ne comprend pas un enseignement complet ; il n'est qu'un enfant.
[5:14] La nourriture solide est pour les hommes faits, pour ceux qui ont acquis par la pratique un sens exercé à discerner le vrai du faux.
[6:1] Laissons donc les commencements de ce qu'il y a à dire sur le Christ, mettons-nous à ce qu'il y a de plus achevé, ne recommençons pas à poser les principes fondamentaux: renoncement aux oeuvres mortes, foi en Dieu,
[6:2] doctrine des baptêmes, imposition des mains, résurrection des morts, jugement éternel.
[6:3] Tout cela nous le ferons, si Dieu le permet.
[6:4] Car il est impossible que ceux qui ont été une fois éclairés, qui ont goûté le don céleste, qui ont eu part à l'Esprit saint,
[6:5] qui ont goûté l'excellente parole de Dieu et les richesses du monde à venir
[6:6] et qui retombent, soient ramenés à la repentance par une seconde régénération, eux qui, pour leur propre compte, remettent en croix le Fils de Dieu et le vouent aux outrages!
[6:7] En effet, une terre, arrosée par des pluies fréquentes et produisant des plantes utiles à ceux pour lesquels elle est cultivée, a part à la bénédiction de Dieu.
[6:8] Mais si elle ne rapporte que des épines et des chardons», on l'abandonne, on la déclare presque maudite, on finit par y mettre le feu.
[6:9] Cependant, bien-aimés, malgré ce langage, nous croyons pour vous à tout ce qu'il y a de mieux, à ce qui mène au salut.
[6:10] Dieu est trop juste pour oublier votre activité, l'amour que vous avez montré pour son nom, les services passés et présents rendus par vous aux fidèles.
[6:11] Nous désirons bien que chacun de vous montre jusqu'au bout le même zèle à affermir de plus en plus son espérance
[6:12] de manière à ne pas vous relâcher, mais à imiter ceux que leur foi et leur persévérance ont mis en possession de l'héritage promis.
[6:13] Quand Dieu fit sa promesse à Abraham (comme il ne pouvait prêter serment au nom d'un plus grand que lui, «il prêta serment sur son propre nom»),
[6:14] il dit: «Certes je te comblerai de bénédictions ; certes je multiplierai beaucoup tes descendants».
[6:15] Et alors, sa persévérance lui obtint ce qui lui avait été promis.
[6:16] Les hommes, en effet, prêtent serment sur un plus grand qu'eux, et leur serment est une garantie, il met fin à toutes leurs discussions.
[6:17] Eh bien, Dieu, voulant expressément montrer à ceux qui devaient recevoir l'héritage promis que sa volonté est immuable, intervint par un serment,
[6:18] et il l'a fait pour que, par deux choses immuables, par lesquelles il était impossible que Dieu mentît, nous ayons un puissant encouragement qui soit notre refuge, nous saisissions l'espérance qui s'offre à nous.
[6:19] Oui, cette espérance nous la tenons comme l'ancre de notre âme, ferme et solide, «elle pénètre dans le sanctuaire, derrière le voile»,
[6:20] là où Jésus notre précurseur est entré pour nous quand il est devenu grand-prêtre «à tout jamais selon l'ordre de Melchisédek».
[7:1] En effet, ce Melchisédek, «roi de Salem, prêtre du Dieu Très-Haut», qui alla au-devant d'Abraham, revenant de vaincre les rois, et le bénit,
[7:2] qui reçut d'Abraham «la dîme de tout», dont le nom signifie d'abord roi de justice («roi de Salem», qui vient ensuite, veut dire roi de paix),
[7:3] qui est sans père, sans mère, sans généalogie, dont les jours et la vie n'ont ni commencement, ni fin, qui est absolument assimilé au Fils de Dieu, reste «prêtre à perpétuité».
[7:4] Voyez maintenant comme il doit être grand, celui auquel Abraham lui-même, le patriarche, a donné une dîme prise sur les prémices de son butin.
[7:5] Or, la Loi ordonne à ceux des enfants des Lévites qui reçoivent la prêtrise de lever la dîme sur le peuple, c'est-à-dire sur leurs frères, bien qu'ils soient également issus d'Abraham,
[7:6] et voilà que celui qui n'est pas de leur famille a levé la dîme sur Abraham et a béni celui qui avait reçu les promesses!
[7:7] Mais, de l'aveu de tous, c'est l'inférieur qui est béni par le supérieur ;
[7:8] de plus, ce sont ici des hommes mortels qui perçoivent la dîme, là c'est quelqu'un dont il est attesté qu'il possède la vie ;
[7:9] et Lévi lui-même, pour ainsi dire, lui qui doit percevoir la dîme, l'a payée dans la personne d'Abraham,
[7:10] car il était encore dans les reins de son père quand Melchisédek alla au-devant de ce patriarche.
[7:11] Si l'on avait pu réaliser la perfection par le sacerdoce lévitique (car la législation donnée au peuple a pour base ce sacerdoce), pourquoi fallait-il qu'il parût un autre «prêtre» «selon l'ordre de Melchisédek» pourquoi pas selon l'ordre d'Aaron?
[7:12] Au changement de l'ordre du sacerdoce correspond nécessairement un changement de Loi ;
[7:13] et celui auquel s'appliquent ces paroles, appartient à une, autre tribu dont aucun membre n'a servi à l'autel.
[7:14] Il est notoire, en effet, que notre Seigneur est issu de Juda, et Moïse n'a jamais parlé de prêtres de cette tribu.
[7:15] Et tout cela devient plus évident encore quand c'est «à l'instar de Melchisédek» que paraît un autre «prêtre»
[7:16] nommé en vertu de sa vie impérissable et nullement par une loi ou un commandement charnel.
[7:17] Voici, en effet, le témoignage qui lui est rendu : «Tu es prêtre à tout jamais Selon l'ordre de Melchisédek»
[7:18] La Loi ancienne a été abrogée parce qu'elle était impuissante et inutile.
[7:19] Elle n'a rien amené à la perfection et, à la place, est introduite une meilleure espérance par laquelle nous nous approchons de Dieu.
[7:20] Et il y a eu un serment de prêté ; les prêtres étaient consacrés sans que personne prêtât serment,
[7:21] mais lui a été consacré avec le serment de Celui qui a dit : «Le Seigneur a juré et il ne s'en repentira pas ; Tu es prêtre à tout jamais.»
[7:22] Par là même, Jésus est devenu le garant d'une meilleure alliance.
[7:23] De plus, il y a eu une succession de prêtres, parce que la mort les empêchait de continuer leurs fonctions.
[7:24] Mais lui, qui est nommé «à tout jamais», possède le sacerdoce intransmissible.
[7:25] Et voilà pourquoi il peut sauver parfaitement ceux qui, par lui, s'approchent de Dieu, puisqu'il vit toujours pour intercéder en leur faveur.
[7:26] Qu'il était bien le grand-prêtre qu'il nous fallait, saint, innocent, sans tache, séparé des pécheurs et élevé au-dessus des cieux!
[7:27] qui n'est pas tous les jours obligé comme les autres grands-prêtres d'offrir des sacrifices pour ses propres péchés d'abord, pour ceux du peuple ensuite — (cela il l'a fait une fois pour toutes en s'offrant lui-même), —
[7:28] car la Loi institue grands-prêtres des hommes pleins de faiblesse ; or la parole du serment prêté après la Loi institue un Fils arrivé pour jamais à la perfection !
[8:1] Voici maintenant, après tout ce que nous venons de dire, le point capital : Ce grand-prêtre que nous avons est tel qu'«il s'est assis à la droite!» du trône de la majesté divine, dans les cieux,
[8:2] comme ministre du sanctuaire et du vrai «tabernacle, dressé par le Seigneur» et non par un homme.
[8:3] Tout grand-prêtre est institué pour offrir des dons et des sacrifices ; il faut donc que celui-là ait aussi quelque chose à offrir.
[8:4] S'il était sur la terre, il ne serait pas même prêtre — (puisqu'il s'y trouve ceux qui offrent les dons selon la Loi
[8:5] et qui servent ce qui n'est que la copie, l'ombre des réalités célestes, d'après l'avis donné à Moïse lorsqu'il allait dresser le tabernacle : Aie soin, lui fut-il dit, de tout faire d'après le modèle qui t'a été montré sur la montagne»),
[8:6] mais il a maintenant obtenu un ministère d'autant supérieur qu'il est médiateur d'une plus excellente Alliance dont la promulgation repose sur de meilleures promesses.
[8:7] En effet, si la première Alliance avait été irréprochable, il n'aurait pas été question de la remplacer par une seconde.
[8:8] Or c'est bien un reproche qu'il fait quand il dit: «Voici qu'il vient des jours, dit le Seigneur, Où je contracterai avec la maison d'Israël et avec la maison de Juda, Une nouvelle Alliance.
[8:9] Elle ne ressemblera pas à l'Alliance que je fis avec leurs pères Le jour où je les pris par la main Pour les faire sortir du pays d'Égypte ; Comme ils ne sont pas restés fidèles à mon Alliance, Moi, de mon côté, je les ai négligés, dit le Seigneur.
[8:10] Voici l'Alliance que je contracterai avec la maison d'Israël : Après ces jours-ci Je mettrai mes lois dans leur esprit Et je les graverai dans leur coeur ; Je serai leur Dieu Et ils seront mon peuple,
[8:11] Et aucun d'eux n'aura à instruire son concitoyen, Ou son frère en lui disant : «Sache qui est le Seigneur.» Car tous me connaîtront Depuis le plus petit jusqu'au plus grand
[8:12] Aussi serai-je plein de miséricorde pour leurs iniquités Et ne me souviendrai-je plus de leurs péchés.»
[8:13] appelant cette Alliance-là «nouvelle» il a déclaré la première vieillie ; or ce qui a vieilli, ce qui est suranné est près de disparaître.
[9:1] La première Alliance avait-elle aussi des règles pour le culte et, un sanctuaire terrestre.
[9:2] On avait, en effet, construit un tabernacle ; dans sa première partie se trouvaient le candélabre, la table et les pains de proposition. On l'appelait Lieu Saint.
[9:3] Puis, derrière le second voile, la seconde partie appelée: Lieu Très-Saint.
[9:4] Là, se trouvaient l'autel d'or pour les parfums et l'arche de l'Allince entièrement recouverte d'or ; dans l'arche, un vase d'or renfermant la manne, la verge d'Aaron qui avait fleuri et les tables de l'Alliance ;
[9:5] au-dessus, les Chérubins de la gloire couvrant de leur ombre le propitiatoire : ce n'est pas le moment de parler de tout cela en détail.
[9:6] Tout étant ainsi disposé, les prêtres qui célèbrent le culte entrent constamment dans la première partie ;
[9:7] mais dans la seconde le grand-prêtre seul et une seule fois dans l'année, et jamais sans y porter du sang qu'il offre et pour lui-même et pour les péchés du peuple.
[9:8] L'Esprit saint montre par là que l'entrée du Lieu Très-Saint n'était pas ouverte tant que subsistait la première partie du tabernacle,
[9:9] et celle-ci est un symbole pour le temps présent où l'on fait encore des offrandes et des sacrifices incapables de mener celui qui les fait à la perfection qu'exige sa conscience.
[9:10] Ce sont des prescriptions purement charnelles et qui ne sont imposées, comme tout ce qui concerne la nourriture, la boisson, les diverses ablutions, que jusqu'à l'époque de la réforme.
[9:11] Mais Christ est survenu, grand-prêtre des biens à venir et traversant le tabernacle plus grand et plus parfait, que la main de l'homme n'a pas construit (je veux dire qui n'est pas de cette création-ci) ;
[9:12] il est entré une fois pour toutes dans le Lieu Très-Saint, non avec du sang de boucs et de veaux, mais avec son propre sang, et il a accompli une éternelle rédemption.
[9:13] Car si le sang de boucs et de taureaux, si la cendre d'une génisse dont on asperge ceux qui sont souillés, les sanctifie et leur donne la pureté charnelle,
[9:14] combien plus le sang du Christ, qui, avec son esprit éternel, s'est lui-même offert à Dieu sans défaut, purifiera-t-il votre conscience des oeuvres mortes pour que vous serviez un Dieu vivant.
[9:15] Et voilà pourquoi il a fait par sa médiation un nouveau Testament ; sa mort est venue racheter les péchés commis sous le premier, et, par elle, les élus ont reçu l'éternel héritage qui la leur avait été promis.
[9:16] En effet, quand on parle de testament, il faut que la mort du testateur soit constatée.
[9:17] Un testament n'est valable qu'à la mort ; il est de nul effet pendant la vie du testateur.
[9:18] Aussi le premier contrat a-t-il été inauguré avec du sang.
[9:19] Quand Moïse eut exposé à tout le peuple la Loi entière, tous les commandements, il prit le sang des veaux et des boucs avec de l'eau, de la laine rouge et une branche d'hysope, il aspergea le livre et tout le peuple,
[9:20] en disant : «Voici le sang de l'Alliance que Dieu m'a chargé de faire avec vous.»
[9:21] Il aspergea aussi de sang le tabernacle et tous les objets servant au culte.
[9:22] En général, on purifie tout avec du sang, d'après la Loi ; sans effusion de sang, il n'y a pas de pardon.
[9:23] Eh bien, puisque l'image des réalités célestes est purifiée de cette, manière-là, il fallait que ces réalités mêmes le fussent par des sacrifices plus importants encore.
[9:24] Aussi Christ n'est-il pas entré dans un sanctuaire fait de main d'homme, dans une imitation du vrai sanctuaire, mais dans le ciel même, afin de se présenter pour nous devant la face de Dieu.
[9:25] Et il n'y est pas entré pour se sacrifier plusieurs fois lui-même, à la manière du grand-prêtre qui, chaque année, entre dans le sanctuaire avec du sang étranger.
[9:26] S'il avait fait cela, il aurait dû souffrir plusieurs fois depuis le commencement du monde ; non, il ne s'est montré qu'une fois, à la fin du monde, pour annuler le péché par son sacrifice.
[9:27] De même qu'il faut que les hommes meurent une fois, puis vient leur jugement,
[9:28] de même le Christ ne s'est offert qu'une fois «Pour anéantir une quantité de péchés», puis il reviendra, non plus à cause du péché, mais pour donner le salut à ceux qui l'attendent.
[10:1] En effet, la Loi, ne contenant que l'ombre des biens à venir, et non l'image réelle des choses, ne peut jamais par ses sacrifices, toujours les mêmes et offerts sans cesse chaque année donner la parfaite pureté à ceux qui y prennent part.
[10:2] Autrement n'aurait-on pas cessé de les offrir, car ceux qui les offraient, une fois purifiés, n'auraient plus eu conscience de leurs péchés?
[10:3] Mais, au contraire, ces sacrifices eux-mêmes ravivaient chaque année le souvenir des péchés.
[10:4] Car il est impossible que du sang de taureaux et de boucs effacent des péchés.
[10:5] Voilà pourquoi le Christ dit en entrant dans le monde : «Tu n'as pas voulu de sacrifice, ni d'offrande, Tu m'as formé un corps ;
[10:6] les holocaustes, ni les offrandes pour le péché ne t'ont fait plaisir. »
[10:7] J'ai dit alors : «Voici je viens (Dans le volume il est question de moi) Pour faire, Dieu, ta volonté.»
[10:8] Après avoir commencé par dire : «Tu n'as voulu ni sacrifices, ni oblations, ni holocaustes, ni offrandes pour le péché, et tu n'y as pas pris plaisir,» (Tout cela cependant est offert d'après la Loi,)
[10:9] il ajoute : «Voici je viens pour faire ta volonté.» Il supprime le premier point pour établir le second,
[10:10] et c'est grâce à cette volonté que nous sommes sanctifiés une fois pour toutes, nous qui le sommes par le sacrifice du corps de Jésus-Christ.
[10:11] De plus, chaque prêtre se présente tous les jours et officie, offrant des sacrifices, souvent les mêmes et qui ne peuvent pas effacer les péchés.
[10:12] Lui, au contraire, n'a offert qu'un seul sacrifice pour les péchés, puis «S'est assis» pour toujours «à la droite de Dieu» ;
[10:13] et désormais il attend «Que ses ennemis soient renversés, soient sous ses pieds, comme un marchepied».
[10:14] C'est par une offrande unique qu'il a donné pour toujours la parfaite pureté à ceux qu'il sanctifie. D'ailleurs,
[10:15] l'Esprit saint nous l'atteste, car, après avoir dit :
[10:16] «Voici l'alliance que je contracterai avec eux Quand le moment sera venu, dit le Seigneur, Je mettrai mes lois dans leur coeur, Je les graverai dans leur esprit...» ajoute :
[10:17] «Je n'aurai plus aucun souvenir de leurs péchés et de leurs iniquités.»
[10:18] Or, là où il y a pardon, il n'est plus question de sacrifice pour le péché.
[10:19] Ainsi, mes frères, puisque nous avons la ferme assurance que nous entrerons dans le sanctuaire, grâce au sang de Jésus —
[10:20] (car il a inauguré pour nous un chemin nouveau et réel à travers le rideau, c'est-à-dire par son corps)
[10:21] — puisque nous avons un grand-prêtre préposé à la maison de Dieu,
[10:22] approchons-nous avec un coeur sincère, avec une foi pleine et entière, le coeur et la conscience purifiés de tout mal, et le corps lavé d'une eau pure ;
[10:23] continuons, sans fléchir, à confesser notre espérance (car il est, fidèle, Celui qui a fait la promesse!).
[10:24] Ayons l'oeil les uns sur les autres pour nous exciter à l'amour et aux bonnes oeuvres ;
[10:25] ne désertons pas nos réunions, comme quelques-uns en ont pris l'habitude, mais fortifions-nous-y, et cela d'autant plus que vous voyez approcher le grand jour.
[10:26] Si, après avoir fait connaissance avec la vérité, nous péchons exprès, il ne reste plus de sacrifice pour les péchés ;
[10:27] il ne reste que la terrible attente du jugement et un feu dévorant qui doit consumer les rebelles.
[10:28] Celui qui a violé la Loi de Moïse meurt sans miséricorde «sur la déposition de deux ou trois témoins».
[10:29] Combien sera plus terrible le châtiment dont sera jugé digne celui qui aura foulé aux pieds le Fils de Dieu et regardé comme vil «le sang de l'Alliance», — ce sang qui l'a sanctifié, — qui aura outragé l'Esprit de la grâce?
[10:30] Nous connaissons celui qui a dit : «A moi la vengeance, moi je rendrai à mon tour», et ailleurs : «Le Seigneur jugera son peuple.»
[10:31] Il est terrible de tomber entre les mains du Dieu vivant!
[10:32] Souvenez-vous des premiers temps où, après avoir été éclairés, vous avez dû soutenir de nombreuses et douloureuses luttes ;
[10:33] ici, exposés publiquement aux insultes et aux afflictions, là, sympathisant avec ceux que l'on traitait ainsi.
[10:34] Vous avez eu compassion des prisonniers, vous vous êtes résignés avec joie à la confiscation de vos biens, sachant que vous possédez ailleurs une fortune qui vaut mieux et vous restera toujours.
[10:35] Ne perdez donc rien de votre confiance ; une récompense immense y est attachée.
[10:36] Ce qu'il vous faut, c'est de la patience, pour qu'après avoir fait la volonté de Dieu, vous remportiez ce qui vous est promis.
[10:37] Encore «Un bien, un bien petit espace de temps. Celui qui doit venir arrivera et ne tardera point,
[10:38] Et mon juste vivra par la foi ; Mais s'il recule, mon âme ne trouve pas en lui de plaisirs.»
[10:39] Quant à nous, nous ne sommes pas de ceux qui reculent pour se perdre, mais de ceux qui ont la foi pour sauver leurs âmes!
[11:1] Or, la foi est la ferme conviction de choses qu'on espère, l'absolue certitude de faits qu'on ne voit pas.
[11:2] C'est parce que les hommes d'autrefois ont eu cette foi là que leur éloge nous a été fait.
[11:3] C'est par la foi que nous reconnaissons qu'une parole de Dieu a formé le monde et, de la sorte, ce que nous voyons n'est pas provenu de choses existantes.
[11:4] C'est par la foi qu'Abel offrit à Dieu un meilleur sacrifice que Caïn, sacrifice qui le fit déclarer juste, Dieu approuvant «ses offrandes» et, par elle, lui qui est mort parle encore.
[11:5] C'est à cause de sa foi qu'Énoch fut enlevé de manière à ne pas voir la mort et «on ne le trouva plus parce que Dieu l'avait enlevé». En effet, avant son enlèvement, on fait de lui cet éloge : «il était agréable à Dieu».
[11:6] Or, sans la foi, il est impossible de lui être agréable, car celui qui s'approche de Dieu doit croire que Dieu existe et qu'il est un rémunérateur pour ceux qui le cherchent.
[11:7] C'est par la foi que Noé, averti de choses qu'on ne voyait pas encore, construisit avec une pieuse prévoyance une arche pour sauver sa famille ; par elle, il condamna le monde et devint héritier de la justice que produit la foi.
[11:8] C'est par la foi qu'Abraham, appelé à partir pour le pays qu'il devait recevoir en héritage, obéit, et il partit sans savoir où il allait.
[11:9] C'est par la foi qu'il vint s'établir dans la terre promise, comme, en pays étranger, vivant sous la tente, avec Isaac et Jacob, héritiers, comme lui, de la même promesse ;
[11:10] car il attendait la cité aux solides fondements dont Dieu est l'architecte et le constructeur.
[11:11] C'est par la foi que Sarra, elle aussi, reçut, malgré son âge, la force de donner le jour à un fils, parce qu'elle avait cru à la véracité de celui qui le lui avait promis ;
[11:12] et c'est aussi pour cela que d'un seul homme, et d'un homme au dernier terme de la vieillesse, naquit une descendance semblable pour le nombre «aux étoiles du ciel et aux grains de sable qui couvrent le bord de la mer» et qui sont innombrables.
[11:13] Dans cette foi ils moururent tous, sans avoir reçu les choses promises, les ayant seulement vues et saluées de loin et se reconnaissant «étrangers et voyageurs sur la terre».
[11:14] Ceux qui tiennent ce langage montrent bien qu'ils cherchent une patrie ;
[11:15] et s'ils avaient songé à celle dont ils étaient sortis, ils avaient tout le temps d'y retourner ;
[11:16] mais non, c'est une meilleure patrie qu'ils désirent, je veux dire une patrie céleste ; aussi Dieu n'a point honte d'eux ; il se fait appeler leur Dieu, car il leur a préparé une cité.
[11:17] C'est par la foi qu'Abraham, mis à l'épreuve, offrit Isaac, offrit son fils unique, lui qui avait reçu les promesses,
[11:18] lui auquel il avait été dit : «C'est d'après Isaac que ta race sera nommée» ;
[11:19] il pensait que Dieu a le pouvoir même de ressusciter les morts, aussi le recouvra-t-il de telle manière qu'il est un symbole.
[11:20] C'est par la foi, et en vue de l'avenir, qu'Isaac bénit Jacob et Ésaü.
[11:21] C'est par la foi que Jacob bénit, en mourant, chacun des fils de Joseph et qu' «il se prosterna devant le sommet de son bâton».
[11:22] C'est par la foi que Joseph, aux approches de la mort, fit mention de l'exode des enfants d'Israël et ordonna ce qu'on ferait de ses restes.
[11:23] C'est par la foi que Moïse, à sa naissance, fut caché trois mois par ses parents, parce qu'ils avaient vu que leur enfant était beau et qu'ils ne se laissaient pas effrayer par le décret du roi.
[11:24] C'est par la foi que Moïse, devenu grand, renonça au nom de fils de la fille de Pharaon,
[11:25] aimant mieux partager les souffrances du peuple de Dieu que d'avoir du péché une jouissance momentanée,
[11:26] considérant l'opprobre du Christ comme une plus grande richesse que tous les trésors de l'Égypte ; et cela parce qu'il regardait à la rémunération.
[11:27] C'est par la foi qu'il quitta l'Égypte sans redouter la colère du roi, car il tint ferme comme s'il voyait Celui qui est invisible.
[11:28] C'est par la foi qu'il établit la Pâque et l'aspersion du sang, pour que l'exterminateur ne touchât pas les premiers-nés des Israélites.
[11:29] C'est par la foi qu'ils traversèrent la mer Rouge comme on marche sur la terre sèche, tandis que les Égyptiens qui essayèrent de passer furent engloutis.
[11:30] C'est par la foi que les murs de Jéricho tombèrent après qu'on en eut fait le tour pendant sept jours.
[11:31] C'est par la foi que Rahab, la femme de mauvaise vie, ne périt pas avec les incrédules, parce qu'elle avait accueilli les espions avec bonté.
[11:32] Que dire encore? le temps me manquera si je parle de Gédéon, de Barak, de Samson, de Jephté, de David, de Samuel, des prophètes
[11:33] qui, par la foi, ont conquis des royaumes, ont exercé la justice, ont obtenu des promesses, ont fermé la gueule des lions,
[11:34] ont éteint l'ardeur du feu, ont échappé au tranchant de l'épée, ont triomphé de la maladie, ont été vaillants à la guerre, ont repoussé les invasions étrangères.
[11:35] Des femmes ont recouvré leurs morts par la résurrection ; les uns ont été livrés à la torture, refusant d'être délivrés, pour obtenir une résurrection meilleure ;
[11:36] les autres ont eu à subir les moqueries, la flagellation, et même les fers et le cachot ;
[11:37] on les a lapidés, on les a torturés, on les a sciés, on les a tués avec des épées ; ils ont été çà et là, n'ayant pour se couvrir que des peaux de brebis ou de chèvres, manquant de tout, opprimés, maltraités,
[11:38] eux dont le monde n'était pas digne, errants dans les déserts, les montagnes, les cavernes, les antres de la terre.
[11:39] Et tous ils ont été loués pour leur foi, et cependant ils n'ont point vu les promesses s'accomplir.
[11:40] Dieu avait en vue quelque chose de meilleur pour nous, et ils ne devaient pas arriver sans nous à la perfection.
[12:1] Eh bien, nous aussi, puisque nous avons autour de nous une, si grande nuée de témoins, débarrassons-nous de tout fardeau et du péché qui nous circonvient si facilement, courons avec persévérance dans la carrière ouverte devant nous,
[12:2] les yeux fixés sur ' l'auteur et le consommateur de ta foi, sur Jésus, lequel, regardant à la joie placée devant lui, a enduré la croix et, pour en avoir méprisé la honte, «S'est assis à la droite» du trône de Dieu.
[12:3] Considérez celui qui a supporté de la part des pécheurs une telle opposition contre lui pour que vos âmes ne se découragent pas, pour que vous ne faiblissiez pas.
[12:4] Vous n'avez pas encore eu à résister jusqu'au sang dans votre lutte contre le péché,
[12:5] et vous auriez oublié l'exhortation qui vous est adressée comme à des fils : «Mon fils, ne méprise pas le châtiment du Seigneur Et ne te décourage pas quand il te reprend,
[12:6] Car le Seigneur châtie celui qu'il aime Et il frappe de ses verges tout fils qu'il reconnaît comme sien.»
[12:7] Si vous avez des châtiments à endurer, c'est que Dieu vous traite comme des fils, car quel est le fils que son père ne châtie pas?
[12:8] Si vous êtes dispensés du châtiment dont tous les fils ont leur part, vous êtes illégitimes, vous n'êtes pas de vrais fils.
[12:9] De plus, nos pères par le sang nous ont châtiés, et nous les avons respectés ; ne devrons-nous pas à bien plus forte raison nous, soumettre à notre Père spirituel pour avoir la vie?
[12:10] Ceux-là nous châtiaient pour quelques jours et comme bon leur semblait ; lui le fait pour notre bien, pour que nous ayons notre part de sa sainteté.
[12:11] Tout châtiment, il est vrai, ne paraît pas être au premier moment un sujet de joie, mais de tristesse ; mais plus tard il fait recueillir en paix par ceux qui en ont subi l'épreuve, le fruit qui s'appelle la justice.
[12:12] Ainsi donc, «Relevez ces mains qui tombent Et ces genoux qui fléchissent»,
[12:13] et : «Mettez vos pieds dans les chemins droits» pour que ce qui boite ne soit pas renversé, mais plutôt guéri.
[12:14] «Cherchez à être en paix» avec tout le monde ; cherchez la sanctification, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.
[12:15] Veillez à ce que personne ne se prive de la grâce de Dieu, à ce qu'ail ne pousse aucune. plante vénéneuse qui pourrait faire du mal», qui pourrait empoisonner plusieurs d'entre vous.
[12:16] Que personne ne soit impur ou profane comme Ésaü, qui «vendit», pour un simple repas, «ses droits de premier-né».
[12:17] Et vous savez que lorsqu'il voulut plus tard recevoir la bénédiction de son père, il fut repoussé ; il ne put faire accueillir sa repentance, quoiqu'il l'eût demandée avec larmes.
[12:18] Vous ne vous êtes pas approchés d'une montagne qu'on pût toucher, «que le feu embrasa, ni de l'obscurité, des ténèbres, de la tempête,
[12:19] du bruit de la trompette, de la voix des commandements», que les auditeurs demandèrent instamment à ne pas entendre plus longtemps.
[12:20] Car ils ne pouvaient supporter cette injonction : Même l'animal qui touchera cette montagne sera lapidé».
[12:21] Et ce spectacle était si effrayant que Moïse dit : «Je suis épouvanté et tremblants».
[12:22] Mais vous vous êtes approchés de la montagne de Sion et de la ville du Dieu vivant, de la Jérusalem céleste, du choeur des myriades d'anges,
[12:23] de l'Église de vos aînés inscrits aux cieux, de Dieu, juge de tous, des esprits des justes arrivés au but,
[12:24] de Jésus, médiateur d'une Alliance nouvelle, et du sang de propitiation qui parle mieux que celui d'Abel.
[12:25] Prenez garde de refuser d'entendre Celui qui vous parle. Car s'ils n'ont pas échappé, ceux qui refusaient d'entendre Celui qui se révélait sur la terre, à bien plus forte raison n'échapperons-nous pas si nous repoussons Celui qui se révèle du haut des cieux,
[12:26] dont la voix faisait autrefois trembler la terre et qui fait aujourd'hui cette déclaration : «Je ferai trembler une fois encore non seulement la terre, mais aussi le ciel.»
[12:27] Ces mots : «une fois encore» indiquent la transformation du monde visible qui sera ébranlé, tandis que le monde inébranlable est éternel.
[12:28] Ainsi, puisque c'est un Royaume inébranlable que nous avons reçu, soyons pleins d'une reconnaissance telle que nous rendions à Dieu avec piété et avec respect un culte qui lui soit agréable.
[12:29] «Car notre Dieu est un feu dévorant.»
[13:1] Continuez à vous aimer comme des frères ;
[13:2] n'oubliez pas l'hospitalité ; car, en la pratiquant, quelques-uns, sans le savoir, ont reçu chez eux des anges.
[13:3] Souvenez-vous des prisonniers comme si vous étiez des leurs, et des malheureux, en songeant que vous aussi vous vivez dans ce corps.
[13:4] Respectez tous le mariage ; ne déshonorez pas le lit nuptial ; les débauchés et les adultères, Dieu les jugera!
[13:5] Ne soyez pas de ceux qui tiennent à l'argent ; contentez-vous de ce que vous avez ; car lui-même a dit : «Je ne te laisserai pas, «certainement je ne t'abandonnerai pas» ;
[13:6] aussi pouvons-nous dire avec confiance : «Le Seigneur me vient en aide ; je ne m'effrayerai de rien ; Que pourra me faire un homme ?»
[13:7] Souvenez-vous de vos directeurs, qui vous ont prêché la parole de Dieu ; représentez-vous la fin de leur carrière et imitez leur foi!
[13:8] Jésus-Christ est le même hier, aujourd'hui et éternellement !
[13:9] «Ne vous laissez pas entraîner par toutes sortes de doctrines étrangères ; car il est bon que la grâce donne de la fermeté au coeur, et que ce ne soient point des aliments qui n'ont point profité à ceux qui en usent.
[13:10] Nous avons un autel dont ceux qui célèbrent le culte dans le tabernacle n'ont pas le droit de manger la victime.
[13:11] Les corps des animaux, immolés pour le péché, dont le sang est porté dans le sanctuaire par le grand-prêtre «sont brûlés hors du camp».
[13:12] Voilà pourquoi Jésus aussi, pour sanctifier le peuple par son propre sang, a souffert hors de la porte.
[13:13] «Sortons alors du camp» et allons à lui en portant son opprobre.
[13:14] Car nous n'avons pas ici de cité permanente, mais nous cherchons celle qui est à venir.
[13:15] «Offrons» donc sans cesse «à Dieu» par lui «un sacrifice de louanges», je veux dire «le fruit de lèvres» confessant son nom.
[13:16] De plus, n'oubliez ni la bienfaisance, ni la libéralité, voilà les sacrifices auxquels Dieu prend plaisir.
[13:17] Obéissez à vos directeurs et acceptez leurs avis ; car ils veillent sur vos âmes comme devant en rendre compte ; et il faut qu'ils le fassent avec joie et sans avoir à se plaindre, car ce serait à votre préjudice.
[13:18] Priez pour nous, car nous sommes certains d'avoir une bonne conscience, étant décidés à bien nous conduire en toutes choses.
[13:19] Je vous demande surtout de le faire pour que je vous sois plus tôt rendu.
[13:20] Que le Dieu de paix «qui a retiré» des morts notre Seigneur Jésus, devenu par le sang «d'une Alliance éternelle» le souverain «berger des brebis»,
[13:21] vous rende capables de toutes sortes de bonnes oeuvres afin que vous fassiez sa volonté, et qu'il accomplisse en nous ce qui est agréable à ses yeux par Jésus-Christ, auquel soit la gloire aux siècles des siècles! Amen.
[13:22] Veuillez, je vous en prie, frères, faire bon accueil à ces quelques paroles d'exhortation, car je ne vous écris qu'une lettre assez brèves.
[13:23] Vous savez que notre frère Timothée a été relâché ; s'il arrive assez tôt, je vous verrai avec lui.
[13:24] Saluez tous vos directeurs et tous les fidèles. Ceux qui sont venus d'Italie vous saluent.
[13:25] La grâce soit avec vous tous. 

### James

[1:1] Jacques, serviteur de Dieu et du Seigneur Jésus-Christ aux douze tribus de la dispersion, salut.
[1:2] Regardez comme un grand bonheur, mes frères, d'être en but à diverses épreuves ;
[1:3] car, en mettant votre foi au creuset, elles produisent, vous le savez, la patience ;
[1:4] patience qui doit être parfaitement mise en pratique, pour que vous soyez parfaits, accomplis, ne laissant absolument rien à désirer.
[1:5] Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il s'adresse à Dieu, qui donne à tous, volontiers et sans reproches, et la sagesse lui sera donnée.
[1:6] Mais qu'il demande avec confiance, sans douter ; celui qui doute ressemble aux vagues de la mer quand le vent les soulève et les agite.
[1:7] Qu'une telle personne ne s'attende pas à obtenir quoi que ce soit du Seigneur.
[1:8] L'homme irrésolu est inconstant dans toutes ses entreprises.
[1:9] Que le frère humble songe avec orgueil à sa noblesse
[1:10] et le riche à sa bassesse, car il passera comme la fleur de l'herbe ;
[1:11] le soleil se lève avec sa chaleur ardente et «Il sèche l'herbe, et sa fleur tombe », et la beauté de son aspect disparaît ; ainsi se flétrira le riche au milieu de sa carrière!
[1:12] Heureux l'homme qui supporte patiemment l'épreuve ; car lorsqu'il aura fait ses preuves, il recevra la couronne de vie que Dieu a promise à ceux qui l'aiment.
[1:13] Que personne ne dise dans une tentation : «C'est Dieu qui me tente», car Dieu, qui ne peut être tenté par le mal, ne tente lui-même personne.
[1:14] Lorsqu'on est tenté, c'est qu'on est entraîné et séduit par sa propre convoitise ;
[1:15] ensuite, la convoitise, qui a conçu, donne naissance au péché ; et, enfin, le péché, parvenu à sa plus haute puissance, enfante la mort.
[1:16] Ne vous y trompez pas, mes frères bien-aimés,
[1:17] tout don excellent et tout présent parfaits viennent d'en haut, descendent d'auprès du Père des lumières, chez lequel il n'y a aucun changement, pas l'ombre d'une variation.
[1:18] Il nous a enfantés, parce qu'il l'a bien voulu, au moyen de la parole de vérité, pour que nous fussions, en quelque sorte, les prémices de ses créatures.
[1:19] Sachez-le bien, mes frères bien-aimés! Que tout homme soit prompt à écouter, lent à parler, lent à se mettre en colère,
[1:20] car la colère de l'homme n'accomplit pas la justice de Dieu.
[1:21] Enlevez donc toute souillure et tout reste de méchanceté, et recevez avec douceur la parole plantée en vous et qui peut sauver vos âmes.
[1:22] Seulement mettez cette parole en pratique, et ne vous bornez pas à l'écouter ; vous tomberiez dans une grave erreur.
[1:23] Effectivement, celui qui se borne à écouter la parole et ne la met pas en pratique ressemble à cet homme qui, après avoir vu dans un miroir les traits de son visage
[1:24] et après s'être regardé,, s'en est allé et a immédiatement oublié comment il est.
[1:25] Celui, au contraire, qui considère attentivement la Loi parfaite, la Loi de la liberté, qui prolonge sa contemplation, qui en arrive ainsi non à écouter pour oublier, mais à observer et à mettre en pratique, celui-là trouvera le bonheur dans son activité même.
[1:26] Si quelqu'un croit servir Dieu, qui ne tient pas sa langue en bride et qui se trompe lui-même, son service de Dieu est illusoire.
[1:27] Une manière de servir notre Dieu et Père, pure et sans tache à ses yeux, est de veiller sur les orphelins et les veuves dans leur détresse et de se garder soi-même immaculé du monde.
[2:1] Mes frères, point d'acception de personnes en la foi de notre Seigneur Jésus, le Christ de gloire.
[2:2] Si, par exemple, il entre dans votre synagogue un homme ayant un anneau d'or au doigt et revêtu d'habits brillants, et qu'il y entre aussi un pauvre aux vêtements sordides,
[2:3] et que vous regardiez celui qui porte de brillants habits et lui disiez — «Toi, assieds-toi ici à cette place d'honneur» ; — et que vous disiez au pauvre : — «Toi, reste là debout» ; — ou bien : «Assieds-toi plus bas que mon marchepied» ; —
[2:4] n'est-ce pas là faire des distinctions entre frères et vous établir juges dans de mauvais sentiments?
[2:5] Écoutez, mes frères bien-aimés : Dieu n'a-t-il pas choisi ceux que le monde appelle : «les pauvres», pour les faire riches en foi et héritiers du Royaume qu'il a promis à ceux qu'il aime?
[2:6] Et puis, vous faites affront au pauvre! Ne sont-ce pas les riches qui, vous tyrannisent et qui vous traînent devant les tribunaux?
[2:7] Ne sont-ce pas eux qui blasphèment le beau nom qu'on prononce en vous nommant?
[2:8] Sans doute, si vous accomplissez la Loi royale que nous donne l'Écriture: «Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même», vous faites bien,
[2:9] mais si vous faites acception de personnes, vous commettez un péché, et la Loi vous condamne et vous déclare transgresseurs!
[2:10] En effet, quelqu'un qui a observé la Loi tout entière (sauf un commandement pour lequel il a failli) est coupable comme s'il les avait tous violés.
[2:11] Car celui qui a dit : «Tu ne commettras pas d'adultère» a dit aussi : «Tu ne commettras pas de meurtre» et alors si tu ne commets pas d'adultère, mais que tu commettes un meurtre, tu deviens transgresseur de la Loi.
[2:12] Parlez et agissez comme devant être jugés par une Loi de liberté.
[2:13] Le jugement est sans miséricorde pour celui qui n'a pas fait miséricorde. La miséricorde n'a rien à craindre du jugement.
[2:14] Mes frères, à quoi sert-il à quelqu'un de dire: «j'ai la foi», s'il n'a pas les oeuvres. La foi peut-elle le sauver?
[2:15] Je suppose qu'un frère ou une soeur se trouve dans le dénuement et qu'il leur manque le pain quotidien,
[2:16] et voici l'un de vous qui leur dit: — «Allez en paix, chauffez-vous, rassasiez-vous» — et cela sans leur donner ce qu'il leur faut pour vivre, à quoi cela sert-il?
[2:17] Eh bien, il en est de même de la foi, si elle n'a pas d'oeuvres, elle est morte en soi.
[2:18] Cependant on pourrait dire : — «Toi, tu as la foi» ; — moi, j'ai aussi des oeuvres ; montre-moi ta foi sans les oeuvres ; quant à moi, c'est par mes oeuvres que je montrerai ma foi !
[2:19] Tu as la foi en un Dieu unique? tu as raison ; eh bien, les démons ont aussi cette foi-là, et cependant ils tremblent.
[2:20] Veux-tu comprendre, ô homme creux, que la foi sans les oeuvres est stérile?
[2:21] N'est-ce pas pour des oeuvres qu'Abraham notre Père fut déclaré juste, lorsqu'il offrit sur l'autel son fils Isaac?
[2:22] Tu vois que la foi et les oeuvres agissaient chez lui de concert, et que les oeuvres ont porté la foi à sa perfection.
[2:23] C'est ainsi que s'est accomplie l'Écriture qui dit : «Abraham eut foi en Dieu et cela lui fut compté pour justice», et il reçut le nom d'ami de Dieu.
[2:24] Vous voyez bien qu'un homme est considéré comme juste pour des oeuvres et non pas seulement pour sa foi.
[2:25] De même encore est-ce que Rahab, la femme de mauvaise vie, n'a pas été considérée comme juste pour des oeuvres, quand elle a donné asile aux messagers et les a fait partir par un autre chemin?
[2:26] De même que le corps sans esprit est mort, de même la foi sans oeuvres est morte.
[3:1] Ne soyez pas nombreux à vous ériger en docteurs, mes frères, vous savez que nous serons jugés d'autant plus sévèrement.
[3:2] Nous bronchons tous et de bien des manières, et si quelqu'un ne bronche pas dans ses paroles, c'est un homme parfait, capable de tenir en bride son corps tout entier.
[3:3] Quand nous mettons un mors dans la bouche des chevaux pour nous en faire obéir, nous conduisons en même temps leur, corps tout entier.
[3:4] Voyez aussi les navires : qu'ils sont grands! combien sont violents les vents qui les agitent! et c'est avec un tout petit gouvernail que le pilote les mène à volonté dans toutes les directions.
[3:5] Il en est de même de la langue, petit membre qui a de grandes prétentions! Un bien petit feu peut embraser une bien grande forêt!
[3:6] La langue aussi est du feu ; elle est le monde de l'iniquité, la langue, installée parmi nos autres membres, souillant le corps tout entier, enflammant le cours de la vie et enflammée elle-même par le feu de la géhenne !
[3:7] Toute espèce d'animaux sauvages, d'oiseaux, de reptiles, de poissons peuvent être domptés ou ont été domptés par l'espèce humaine,
[3:8] mais la langue, il n'est pas d'homme qui puisse la dompter ; mal impossible à arrêter, elle est pleine d'un venin mortel.
[3:9] Avec elle nous bénissons le Seigneur notre Père, et avec elle nous maudissons les hommes créés à l'image de Dieu.
[3:10] De la même bouche sortent bénédiction et malédiction! Il ne doit pas en être ainsi, mes frères!
[3:11] La source donne-t-elle par la même ouverture de l'eau douce et de l'eau saumâtre?
[3:12] Un figuier, mes frères, peut-il donner des olives? Une vigne, des figues? Une source d'eau salée ne peut pas davantage donner de l'eau douce.
[3:13] L'un de vous est-il sage et intelligent? Qu'il le prouve par des faits, par une bonne conduite, par la douceur de sa sagesse.
[3:14] Mais si vous avez la passion des disputes et de l'amertume dans le coeur, n'allez pas vous glorifier de votre sagesse, vous agiriez contre toute vérité, vous mentiriez.
[3:15] Cette sagesse-là ne vient pas d'en haut ; au contraire, elle est terrestre, sensuelle, diabolique ;
[3:16] car là où règnent la passion des disputes, là règnent aussi le désordre et toutes sortes de mauvaises choses.
[3:17] La sagesse qui vient d'en haut est d'abord pure, ensuite pacifique, modérée, conciliante, pleine de compassion et de bons procédés, sans duplicité, sans hypocrisie.
[3:18] Ce fruit, la justice, est semé au moyen de la paix par ceux qui répandent la paix.
[4:1] D'où viennent vos guerres? d'où viennent vos querelles? n'est-ce pas de vos passions qui combattent dans vos membres?
[4:2] Vous convoitez et vous ne possédez pas ; vous êtes meurtriers, vous êtes jaloux, et vous ne pouvez pas obtenir ; vous vous querellez et vous vous disputez ; vous ne possédez pas, parce que vous ne savez pas demander :
[4:3] vous demandez et vous ne recevez pas, parce que vous demandez mal et pour fournir un aliment à vos passions.
[4:4] Idolâtres! ne savez-vous pas que l'amour du monde, c'est l'inimitié contre Dieu? Celui donc qui veut être l'ami du monde est constitué l'ennemi de Dieu.
[4:5] Prenez-vous pour des paroles en l'air les paroles de l'Écriture? le Dieu jaloux réclame l'Esprit qu'il nous a donné ;
[4:6] de plus il nous accorde une grâce supérieure à celle du monde. Voilà pourquoi il est écrit : «Dieu résiste aux orgueilleux Et il fait grâce aux humbles.»
[4:7] Soumettez-vous donc à Dieu ; résistez au diable, et il fuira loin de vous.
[4:8] Approchez-vous de Dieu et il s'approchera de vous. Purifiez vos mains, vous qui êtes pécheurs! Sanctifiez vos coeurs, vous qui êtes irrésolus!
[4:9] Souffrez de votre misère, soyez tristes, versez des larmes, que votre rire se change en pleurs et votre gaîté en chagrin ;
[4:10] humiliez-vous devant le Seigneur et il vous élèvera.
[4:11] Ne médisez pas les uns des autres, frères. Celui qui médit d'un frère ou qui juge son frère, médit de la Loi et juge la Loi. Or, si tu juges la Loi, tu n'observes plus la Loi, tu te mets au-dessus d'elle.
[4:12] Un seul est législateur et juge : Celui qui a le pouvoir de sauver et de perdre ; mais qui es-tu, toi, pour juger ton prochain?
[4:13] Et maintenant à vous autres, qui dites : — «Aujourd'hui ou demain nous irons dans telle ville, nous y passerons un an, nous ferons des affaires et nous gagnerons de l'argent»,
[4:14] sans savoir ce que sera demain. (Qu'est-ce, en effet, que votre vie ? Vous n'êtes qu'une vapeur visible un moment, puis disparaissant.)
[4:15] Que vous feriez mieux de dire : «Si le Seigneur le veut, nous serons en vie et nous ferons ceci ou cela.»
[4:16] Vous vous enorgueillissez dans votre vaine ostentation ; cette sorte d'orgueil est mauvaise.
[4:17] Celui qui sait faire le bien et ne le fait pas, commet un péché.
[5:1] Et maintenant à vous, les riches: Pleurez! Hurlez sur les malheurs qui vous attendent!
[5:2] Vos richesses sont pourries! vos étoffes sont mangées aux vers!
[5:3] Votre argent et votre or sont tout rouillés! Cette rouille sera une preuve contre vous et, comme un feu, elle mangera vos chairs! C'est pendant les derniers jours que vous avez amassé vos trésors !
[5:4] Eh bien, le salaire des ouvriers qui ont moissonné vos campagnes et dont vous les avez frustrés, crie, et les voix des moissonneurs sont venues jusqu'aux oreilles du Seigneur des armées.
[5:5] Vous avez vécu dans les délices sur la terre, vous avez joui, vous vous êtes repus et cela le jour même où vous allez être égorgés!
[5:6] Vous avez condamné, vous avez assassiné le juste qui ne vous résistait pas!
[5:7] Patientez donc, frères, jusqu'à l'apparition du Seigneur. Voyez l'agriculteur, il attend le précieux fruit de la terre, il patiente jusqu'à ce qu'il ait reçu les pluies d'automne et celles du printemps.
[5:8] Patientez, vous aussi ; fortifiez vos coeurs, car l'apparition du Seigneur est prochaine.
[5:9] Ne vous plaignez pas les uns des autres, frères, pour ne pas être jugés. Voici le juge ; il se tient à la porte.
[5:10] Prenez pour modèles, frères, dans la souffrance et dans la patience les prophètes qui ont parlé au nom du Seigneur.
[5:11] Nous appelons heureux, voyez-vous, ceux qui ont tenu bon. Vous avez entendu parler de la constance de Job, et vous avez vu ce que le Seigneur lui a donné à la fin ; car il est plein de compassion et de miséricorde.
[5:12] Surtout, mes frères, ne prêtez pas de serment, ni par le ciel, ni par la terre, ni sous une forme quelconque. Dites seulement : oui, oui ; ou : non, non ; pour n'encourir aucun jugement.
[5:13] Un de vous est-il dans la peine? qu'il prie. Un de vous est-il dans la joie? qu'il chante des psaumes.
[5:14] Un de vous est-il malade? qu'il fasse appeler les Anciens de l'Église ; que ceux-ci prient sur lui, après lui avoir fait une onction d'huile au nom du Seigneur ;
[5:15] et la prière faite avec foi sauvera le malade, le Seigneur le rétablira, et, s'il a commis des péchés, ils lui seront pardonnés.
[5:16] Confessez-vous réciproquement vos péchés, et priez les uns pour les autres, afin que vous guérissiez ; car la prière d'un juste est bien puissante quand elle est fervente.
[5:17] Élie était un homme aussi faible que nous tous, et il demanda dans une prière qu'il ne plût pas ; et il ne plut pas sur la terre pendant trois ans et demi.
[5:18] Puis, quand il eut prié encore, le ciel donna de la pluie, et la terre fit germer ses fruits.
[5:19] Mes frères, si l'un de vous s'est laissé égarer loin de la vérité,
[5:20] et qu'un autre le ramène, qu'il sache que celui qui ramène un pécheur du chemin où il se perd, sauvera une âme de la mort et couvrira un grand nombre de péchés. 

### I Peter

[1:1] Pierre, apôtre de Jésus-Christ, aux expatriés de la dispersion de Pont, de Galatie, de Cappadoce, d'Asie et de Bithynie,
[1:2] que Dieu notre Père a élus, selon une détermination prise d'avance, qu'il a sanctifiés par l'esprit, pour obéir à Jésus-Christ et être purifiés par l'aspersion de son sang. Grâce et paix vous soient de plus en plus données.
[1:3] Béni soit le Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, de nous avoir régénérés dans sa grande miséricorde pour que nous ayons, par la résurrection de Jésus-Christ d'entre les morts, une vivifiante espérance,
[1:4] celle d'un héritage incorruptible, immaculé, inaltérable, réservé dans les cieux
[1:5] à vous que la puissance de Dieu garde par la foi pour le salut qui est prêt à paraître et paraîtra au moment suprême.
[1:6] Vous en êtes transportés de joie, quoique vous soyez, pendant quelque temps encore, attristés de diverses épreuves.
[1:7] S'il le faut, c'est afin que l'épreuve par laquelle passe votre foi, bien plus précieuse que celle de l'or (et cependant cette matière périssable est éprouvée au feu), tourne à votre louange, votre gloire, votre honneur, lorsque paraîtra Jésus-Christ,
[1:8] que vous aimez sans l'avoir vu ; et, croyant en lui sans le voir encore, vous êtes transportés d'une joie ineffable et glorieuse,
[1:9] parce que vous remporterez la récompense de votre foi, le salut de vos âmes.
[1:10] Ce salut a été le sujet des recherches et des investigations des prophètes qui ont prédit la grâce à vous destinée ;
[1:11] ils cherchaient quelle époque et quelles circonstances indiquait l'Esprit de Christ qui rendait en eux un témoignage prophétique aux souffrances destinées au Christ et à la gloire dont elles seraient suivies.
[1:12] Et il leur fut révélé que ce n'était pas pour eux-mêmes, mais pour vous qu'ils étaient dispensateurs de ces choses, que vous ont maintenant annoncées par l'Esprit saint, envoyé du ciel, ceux qui vous ont prêché l'Évangile, et au fond desquelles les anges mêmes désirent plonger leurs regards.
[1:13] Ainsi donc, ceignez vos reins (je parle au figuré), et soyez sobres ; placez votre espérance tout entière dans la grâce qui vous sera apportée lorsque paraîtra Jésus-Christ.
[1:14] En enfants obéissants, ne suivez pas les errements de vos passions premières, quand vous étiez dans l'ignorance ;
[1:15] mais, comme l'a dit le Saint qui vous a appelés, soyez saints, vous aussi, dans toute votre conduite,
[1:16] car il est écrit : «Vous serez saints, car moi je suis saint» ;
[1:17] et si vous invoquez comme Père celui qui, sans faire acception de personne, juge chacun selon son oeuvre, marchez dans la crainte de Dieu tout le temps de votre pèlerinage ;
[1:18] car ce n'est pas, vous le savez, par des choses périssables, par de l'argent ou par de l'or que vous avez été rachetés de cette manière de vivre si vaine que vous avaient léguée vos pères,
[1:19] mais par un sang précieux, semblable à celui d'un agneau sans tache et sans défaut,
[1:20] le sang de Christ, prédestiné avant la création du monde, et manifesté à cause de vous à la fin des siècles.
[1:21] Par lui vous avez foi en Dieu qui l'a ressuscité d'entre les morts et l'a glorifié, de sorte que votre foi est aussi une espérance en Dieu.
[1:22] Après avoir sanctifié vos âmes par l'obéissance à la vérité et, en vue d'une sincère affection fraternelle, aimez-vous ardemment les uns les autres et de tout coeur,
[1:23] vous qui êtes nés de nouveau non d'un germe corruptible, mais d'un germe incorruptible, d'une parole vivifiante de Dieu, d'une parole qui ne passera pas.
[1:24] Car : «Toute chair est comme l'herbe, Et toute sa gloire comme la fleur de l'herbe ; L'herbe sèche et sa fleur tombe,
[1:25] Mais la parole du Seigneur demeure éternellement.» Cette parole est celle dont la Bonne Nouvelle vous a été annoncée.
[2:1] Débarrassez-vous donc de toute méchanceté, de toute fausseté, dissimulation, jalousie et médisance ; semblables à des enfants nouveau-nés,
[2:2] désirez vivement le lait pur (je parle au sens spirituel),afin de croître par lui pour le salut,
[2:3] si : «Vous avez goûté que le Seigneur est doux,»
[2:4] Approchez-vous de lui «pierre» vivante, «rejetée» par les hommes, mais aux yeux de Dieu, «choisie», «précieuse»,
[2:5] et alors vous, comme des pierres vivantes, édifiez-vous vous-mêmes en maison spirituelle, formez un saint clergé, qui offre des sacrifices spirituels, agréables à Dieu par Jésus-Christ.
[2:6] On lit en effet dans l'Écriture : «Voici que je place en Sion une pierre, Une pierre d'angle choisie et précieuse, Et celui qui aura confiance en elle ne sera pas déçu.»
[2:7] Ainsi donc à vous, croyants, l'honneur ; quant aux incrédules: «La pierre rejetée par les constructeurs Est devenue la principale pierre d'angle,»
[2:8] et : «Une pierre d'achoppement, Un roc qui fait tomber» ; Ils s'y heurtent pour n'avoir pas cru à la parole et c'est à cela qu'ils sont destinés.
[2:9] Mais vous, vous êtes «une race élue, un clergé royal, une nation sainte, un peuple que Dieu s'est acquis pour que vous annonciez les mérites» de Celui qui vous a appelés des ténèbres à son admirable lumière ;
[2:10] vous qui, autrefois, «ne formiez pas un peuple», vous êtes maintenant : «un peuple de Dieu», vous qui : «n'aviez pas obtenu miséricorde», vous avez maintenant «obtenu miséricorde».
[2:11] Mes bien-aimés, je vous exhorte comme des étrangers et des expatriés: Gardez-vous des passions sensuelles qui font la guerre à l'âme ;
[2:12] conduisez-vous bien au milieu des païens, et alors, voyant que ces choses dont ils vous accusent à tort, vous traitant de malfaiteurs, sont, examinées de près, de bonnes oeuvres, ils rendront gloire à Dieu au jour de sa «visitation»
[2:13] Soumettez-vous, à cause du Seigneur, à toutes les autorités instituées par les hommes ; au roi, comme au souverain ;
[2:14] aux gouverneurs, comme délégués par lui pour châtier les malfaiteurs et approuver les gens de bien.
[2:15] C'est la volonté de Dieu que, par votre bonne conduite, vous imposiez silence aux insensés qui vous méconnaissent.
[2:16] Comportez-vous en hommes libres, non en, hommes dont la liberté n'est qu'un voile qui cache le vice, mais en serviteurs de Dieu.
[2:17] Soyez respectueux pour tout le monde, aimez les frères, craignez Dieu, respectez le roi.
[2:18] Domestiques, soyez en toutes choses soumis à vos maîtres avec crainte, non seulement à ceux qui sont bons et humains, mais aussi à ceux qui sont méchants.
[2:19] C'est une grâce d'endurer des peines et de souffrir injustement par motif de conscience et pour Dieu.
[2:20] Quel est votre mérite, si, après avoir commis une faute, vous supportez patiemment les soufflets? Mais si, après avoir fait le bien, vous supportez patiemment la souffrance, voilà qui est une grâce aux yeux de Dieu ;
[2:21] et c'est à cela que vous avez été appelés. Car le Christ aussi a souffert pour vous ; il vous a laissé un exemple pour que vous suiviez ses traces ;
[2:22] «Lui qui n'a pas commis de péché Et dans la bouche duquel il ne s'est trouvé aucune fraude.»
[2:23] Outragé, il n'a pas rendu l'outrage ; maltraité, il n'a point fait de menaces ; il a remis sa cause à Celui qui juge avec justice,
[2:24] et c'est lui «qui a porté nos péchés» en son corps sur le bois, afin que, morts au péché, nous vivions pour la justice ; c'est lui dont «les plaies vous ont guéris».
[2:25] Vous alliez «çà et là comme des brebis» et maintenant vous êtes revenus vers le berger et le gardien de vos âmes.
[3:1] Et vous, femmes, soyez, de même, soumises, chacune à votre mari, afin que ceux d'entre eux qui seraient rebelles à la parole soient gagnés, en dehors de la parole,
[3:2] par la conduite de leurs femmes, considérant que cette conduite est chaste et réservée.
[3:3] Cherchez non la parure du dehors, qui consiste à s'entrelacer les cheveux avec art, à porter des bijoux d'or, à mettre de riches vêtements,
[3:4] mais la beauté cachée du coeur, le charme impérissable d'un esprit doux et tranquille ; voilà la vraie richesse devant Dieu.
[3:5] Tel était l'ornement des saintes femmes d'autrefois, espérant en Dieu, soumises chacune à son mari,
[3:6] Sarra, par exemple, qui obéissait à Abraham et l'appelait son Seigneur, Sarra, dont vous êtes devenus les enfants en faisant le bien sans crainte, sans aucune appréhension.
[3:7] Et vous, maris, de votre côté, traitez vos femmes comme un être plus éclairé doit traiter un être plus faible ; ayez pour elles des égards comme pour des cohéritières de la grâce de vie, afin que vos prières ne soient pas troublées.
[3:8] Enfin, ne soyez tous qu'un coeur et qu'une âme, fraternels, compatissants, humbles,
[3:9] ne rendant pas le mal pour le mal, l'outrage pour l'outrage, au contraire bénissant, car, pour hériter d'une bénédiction, vous avez été appelés à bénir.
[3:10] Et en effet : «Que celui qui veut aimer la vie Et voir des jours heureux Garde sa langue du mal Et ses lèvres du mensonge,
[3:11] Qu'il se détourne du mal et fasse le bien, Qu'il aspire à la paix, qu'il la recherche ;
[3:12] Parce que le Seigneur a les yeux sur les justes Et ses oreilles sont attentives à leurs prières, Mais la face du Seigneur regarde ceux qui font le mal.»
[3:13] Et puis, qui peut vous faire du mal, si vous vous appliquez à faire le bien?
[3:14] Si même il vous arrivait de souffrir pour la justice, soyez-en heureux! «Seulement n'ayez d'eux aucune espèce de crainte Et ne vous laissez pas troubler ;»
[3:15] mais «craignez saintement» dans vos coeurs Christ «le Seigneur». Ayez une apologie toujours prête pour ceux qui vous demandent compte de vos espérances, mais faites-la avec douceur et modestie,
[3:16] forts de votre bonne conscience, afin que ceux qui diffament votre bonne conduite en Christ aient à rougir de leurs calomnies ;
[3:17] car il vaut mieux souffrir en faisant le bien (si telle est la volonté de Dieu) qu'en faisant le mal.
[3:18] Christ aussi a souffert pour les péchés une fois pour toutes — un juste pour des injustes! — afin de nous amener à Dieu, ayant été mis à mort quant à la chair, étant revenu à la vie quant à l'Esprit.
[3:19] Étant Esprit, il est allé prêcher aux esprits en prison,
[3:20] qui ont été rebelles autrefois, du temps où Noé construisait l'arche lorsque Dieu prolongeait sa patience. Dans cette arche, peu de personnes, huit seulement, furent sauvées et ce fut à travers l'eau ;
[3:21] or cette eau vous sauve, vous aussi, sous la forme du baptême, qui en est l'image correspondante (je n'entends pas par baptême une simple ablution débarrassant le corps de ses souillures, mais l'alliance qu'une bonne conscience fait avec Dieu) ; ce baptême-là vous sauve par la résurrection de Jésus-Christ,
[3:22] qui est à la droite de Dieu, depuis qu'il est monté au ciel et qu'il s'est soumis anges, puissances et dominations.
[4:1] Ainsi donc, Christ a souffert dans la chair ; faites-vous une, arme de cette pensée-là ; car celui qui a souffert dans sa chair en a fini avec le péché
[4:2] et ne doit plus, pendant le temps qui lui reste ici-bas, vivre selon les passions des hommes, mais selon la volonté de Dieu.
[4:3] Assez longtemps vous avez fait la volonté des païens, en vivant dans la débauche, les mauvais désirs, l'ivrognerie, les excès de, table, les orgies et le culte impie des idoles.
[4:4] Ils trouvent étrange que vous ne vous plongiez plus avec eux dans cette fange et dans ces infamies, et ils vous outragent :
[4:5] ils rendront compte à Celui qui est prêt à juger les vivants et les morts.
[4:6] Et, en effet, en vue de ce jugement, l'Évangile a été annoncé aussi aux morts, afin qu'après avoir été jugés et condamnés à la mort du corps comme pécheurs, ils puissent trouver la vie divine, la vie de l'Esprit.
[4:7] La fin de toutes choses approche. Soyez donc sages et sobres pour pouvoir prier.
[4:8] Avant tout, ayez les uns pour les autres un ardent amour, car «L'amour couvre une multitude de péchés. »
[4:9] Exercez entre vous l'hospitalité sans vous plaindre.
[4:10] Que chacun mette au service des autres le don qu'il a reçu, comme le doivent de bons administrateurs des diverses grâces de Dieu.
[4:11] Que celui qui enseigne, enseigne comme étant l'oracle de Dieu ; que celui qui exerce les fonctions de diacre, les exerce comme employant une force dispensée par Dieu, afin que, en toutes choses, Dieu soit glorifié par Jésus-Christ, auquel appartiennent la gloire et la puissance aux siècles des siècles! Amen.
[4:12] Mes bien-aimés, ne soyez pas surpris de l'incendie qui s'allume au milieu de vous pour vous éprouver, comme s'il vous arrivait quelque chose d'étrange ;
[4:13] mais réjouissez-vous d'avoir part aux souffrances du Christ, afin de vous réjouir encore, et avec chants de triomphe, au jour de la révélation de sa gloire.
[4:14] Si l'on vous outrage au nom de Christ, vous êtes heureux ; car l'Esprit de gloire, l'Esprit de Dieu repose sur vous.
[4:15] Qu'aucun de vous ne soit puni comme meurtrier, comme voleur, comme malfaiteur, comme surveillant indiscret de ceux du dehors,
[4:16] mais si quelqu'un souffre comme «chrétien», qu'il n'en rougisse pas ; qu'il glorifie Dieu au contraire de porter ce nom-là ;
[4:17] car le moment est venu où le jugement va commencer par la maison de Dieu. S'il commence par nous, quelle sera la fin de ceux qui n'obéissent pas à l'Évangile de Dieu,
[4:18] et si : «Le juste ne sera sauvé qu'à grand'peine, L'impie, le pécheur que deviendra-t-il?»
[4:19] Que ceux donc qui souffrent selon la volonté de Dieu recommandent leurs âmes au fidèle Créateur, en faisant ce qui est bien.
[5:1] J'adresse maintenant mes exhortations aux Anciens parmi vous, moi, un Ancien comme eux et un témoin des souffrances du Christ, moi, qui aurai ma part aussi de la gloire qui doit être révélée :
[5:2] Paissez le troupeau de Dieu qui est sous votre garde ; faites-le non par contrainte, mais volontairement,
[5:3] non par vil intérêt, mais par dévouement, non en dominateurs de ceux qui vous sont échus en partage, mais en devenant les modèles du troupeau ;
[5:4] et quand le souverain pasteur paraîtra, vous remporterez la couronne de la gloire qui ne se flétrit jamais.
[5:5] Quant à vous, jeunes gens, soyez soumis aux Anciens, et, d'ailleurs, montrez tous de l'humilité dans vos rapports mutuels, car : «Dieu résiste aux orgueilleux Et il fait grâce aux humbles.»
[5:6] Humilliez-vous donc sous la main puissante de Dieu pour qu'il vous élève, quand le temps sera venu,
[5:7] «Déchargez-vous sur lui de tous vos soucis», car c'est lui qui prend soin de vous.
[5:8] Soyez sobres ; soyez vigilants ; votre adversaire, le Diable, comme un lion rugissant, rôde, cherchant quelqu'un à dévorer.
[5:9] Résistez-lui, fermes en la foi, sachant que vos frères répandus dans le monde, éprouvent les mêmes souffrances que vous éprouvez.
[5:10] Le Dieu de toute grâce qui vous a appelés en Christ à sa gloire éternelle, après un peu de souffrances, vous perfectionnera lui-même, vous affermira, vous fortifiera.
[5:11] A lui soit la force aux siècles des siècles! Amen.
[5:12] C'est par Silvanus, frère, à mon avis, fidèle que je vous écris ces quelques lignes, pour vous exhorter et vous attester que c'est à la vraie grâce de Dieu que vous vous êtes attachés.
[5:13] L'élue qui est à Babylone vous salue ainsi que Marc, mon fils.
[5:14] Saluez-vous les uns les autres du baiser d'amour. Paix à vous tous qui êtes en Christ. 

### II Peter

[1:1] Syméon Pierre, serviteur et apôtre de Jésus-Christ, à ceux qui ont hérité par la justice de notre Dieu et du sauveur Jésus-Christ, d'une foi aussi précieuse que la nôtre.
[1:2] Grâce et paix vous soient de plus en plus données par la connaissance de Dieu et de Jésus notre Seigneur.
[1:3] Dans sa divine puissance, Jésus-Christ nous a dotés de tout ce qui mène à la vie et à la piété, en nous faisant connaître Celui qui nous a appelés, par sa gloire et par sa vertu ;
[1:4] et nous a, par elles, dotés des plus grandes et des plus précieuses promesses, pour vous rendre participants par elles de la nature divine, après vous avoir arrachés au monde, à ses passions et à sa corruption.
[1:5] — Faites donc de votre côté tous vos efforts pour produire avec votre foi la vertu ; avec la vertu, la science ;
[1:6] avec la science, la tempérance ; avec la tempérance, la patience ; avec la patience, la piété ;
[1:7] avec la piété, la fraternité ; avec la fraternité, l'amour.
[1:8] Posséder et développer en vous ces qualités vous empêchera d'être oisifs, vous fera faire des progrès dans la connaissance de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:9] Celui auquel elles manquent est un homme à courte vue, un aveugle, il a oublié qu'il a été purifié de ses anciens péchés.
[1:10] C'est pourquoi, mes frères, faites d'autant plus d'efforts pour rendre sûres votre vocation et votre élection. En agissant ainsi, vous ne broncherez jamais,
[1:11] et, de la sorte, l'entrée dans l’éternel Royaume de notre Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ vous sera largement assurée.
[1:12] Voilà pourquoi j'aurai toujours soin de vous remettre ces choses en mémoire. Vous les connaissez déjà, je le sais, et vous êtes pleins de fermeté dans votre foi en la vérité d'aujourd'hui ;
[1:13] mais je considérerai comme un devoir, aussi longtemps que je vivrai, de vous tenir en éveil par mes avertissements.
[1:14] Je sais que je serai tout à coup appelé à plier ma tente ; c'est notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ qui me l'a déclaré.
[1:15] Mais je ferai mon possible pour qu'après ma mort vous conserviez toujours le souvenir de ce que je vous ai dit.
[1:16] Ce ne sont pas des fables adroitement fabriquées que nous vous avons racontées en vous faisant connaître la puissance de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ et en vous parlant de son avènement ; non, nous avons été témoins oculaires de sa majesté.
[1:17] En effet, il a reçu de Dieu son Père tout honneur et toute gloire lorsqu'une voix, écho de la gloire suprême, lui parla ainsi : «Voici mon Fils bien-aimé, c'est en lui que je me complais.»
[1:18] Et cette voix, nous l'avons entendue comme elle venait du ciel quand nous étions avec lui sur la montagne sainte.
[1:19] Et nous tenons pour d'autant plus certaines les paroles des prophètes ; vous ferez bien d'y faire attention comme à un flambeau brillant dans un endroit obscur, en attendant que le jour luise et que l'étoile du matin se lève dans vos coeurs.
[1:20] Avant tout, sachez ceci : aucune des prophéties de l'Écriture n'est affaire d'interprétation privée ;
[1:21] car jamais prophétie n'a été inspirée par le caprice d'un homme, mais c'est poussés par l'Esprit saint que des hommes ont parlé de la part de Dieu.
[2:1] Il y a eu cependant aussi de faux prophètes parmi le peuple, et, parmi vous, il y aura de même de faux docteurs qui introduiront des hérésies de perdition, qui renieront le maître qui les a rachetés, qui s'attireront une ruine subite.
[2:2] Bien des gens les suivront dans leurs orgies et, à cause d'eux, la voix de la vérité sera calomniée.
[2:3] Dans leur cupide avidité, ils viendront vous exploiter avec de fallacieux discours, mais il y a bien longtemps que leur sentence ne paresse pas ; et leur perdition ne s'endort pas.
[2:4] Car si Dieu n'a pas épargné les anges qui avaient péché, s'il les a emprisonnés dans les ténèbres, précipités dans l'abîme, gardés pour le jugement,
[2:5] s'il n'a pas épargné l'ancien monde, s'il n'a préservé que sept personnes avec Noé, ce prédicateur de la justice, s'il a envoyé le déluge sur un monde impie,
[2:6] s'il a réduit en cendres les villes de Sodome et de Gomorrhe, s'il les a anéanties, s'il les a condamnées, s'il en a fait un exemple pour les impies de l'avenir,
[2:7] s'il a sauvé le juste Lot, excédé de l'infâme conduite de ces abominables
[2:8] (car ce juste demeurait au milieu d'eux et ce qu'il voyait et entendait journellement, leurs ignobles actions mettaient son âme droite à la torture),
[2:9] c'est que le Seigneur sait délivrer de l'épreuve les hommes pieux et réserver les iniques pour le jour du jugement, tout en les châtiant déjà,
[2:10] surtout ceux que leurs passions impures mènent aux jouissances charnelles, et qui méprisent l'autorité. Les audacieux! les insolents! ils insultent les gloires, et n'en tremblent pas!
[2:11] quand des anges, leurs supérieurs en force et en puissance, ne portent pas contre elles, en présence du Seigneur, de jugement insultant!
[2:12] Mais eux, comme ces bêtes brutes qui naissent à une vie purement physique, pour être prises et détruites, ils insultent ce qu'ils ignorent! ce sera, perdus comme elles, qu'ils périront,
[2:13] et ainsi ils recevront le salaire de leur iniquité, puisqu'ils trouvent leur plaisir dans des débauches d'un jour! Êtres tarés et flétris! ils se délectent de leurs fourberies, quand ils font bonne chère avec vous!
[2:14] Ils ont les yeux bouffis de passions adultères ; ils sont insatiables de péchés ; ils séduisent les âmes chancelantes ; ils ont un coeur exercé à la cupidité ; ce sont des enfants de malédiction ;
[2:15] ils ont abandonné le droit chemin ; ils se sont égarés ; ils ont suivi la voie de Balaam, fils de Bosor, qui s'éprit d'un inique salaire
[2:16] et fut dûment convaincu de sa scélératesse: un animal muet se mit à parler d'une voix humaine et arrêta la démence du prophète.
[2:17] Ce sont des fontaines sans eau ; des brouillards qu'emporte un ouragan ; le gouffre des ténèbres leur est réservé!
[2:18] Beaux parleurs, aussi vides que pompeux, ils séduisent par les passions de la chair, par la débauche, ceux qui venaient à peine d'échapper aux gens infectés d'erreur ;
[2:19] ils leur promettent la liberté, quand ils sont eux-mêmes esclaves de la corruption! (car on est esclave de ce qui vous domine).
[2:20] Si, en effet, après avoir échappé aux souillures du monde par la connaissance de notre Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ, ils s'y laissent reprendre, et que ces souillures les dominent, leur dernière condition est pire que la première.
[2:21] Il leur aurait mieux valu ne pas avoir connu la voie de la justice que de se détourner, après l'avoir connue, du saint commandement qui leur a été transmis.
[2:22] Il leur arrive ce que dit si bien le proverbe : «Le chien retourne a ce qu'il a vomi» et celui-ci: «Truie lavée va se vautrer dans la fange.»
[3:1] Voilà déjà la seconde lettre que je vous écris, mes bien-aimés, dans celle-ci, comme dans la première, je tâche de réveiller vos bons sentiments ;
[3:2] je vous rappelle les prédictions des saints prophètes, et les préceptes de notre Seigneur et Sauveur transmis par vos apôtres.
[3:3] Sachez surtout ceci : pendant les derniers jours viendront des moqueurs pleins d'ironie, qui ne se laisseront conduire que par leurs propres passions,
[3:4] et qui diront : «Eh bien! que devient la promesse de son apparition ? Depuis que nos pères sont morts, tout continue à se passer comme depuis le commencement du monde!»
[3:5] Ils affectent d'ignorer qu'il y a eu autrefois des cieux et une terre sortis de l'eau, et formés au moyen de l'eau sur la parole de Dieu ;
[3:6] par suite, le monde d'alors périt submergé dans l'eau.
[3:7] Quant aux cieux et à la terre actuels, ils sont conservés sur cette même parole de Dieu, et réservés pour le feu qui s'allumera le jour du jugement et de la destruction des impies.
[3:8] Il est une chose que vous ne devez pas oublier, bien-aimés, c'est qu'un jour, devant le Seigneur, est comme mille années et que «Mille années sont comme un jour».
[3:9] Le Seigneur n'est pas en retard pour l'exécution de sa promesse ; certaines personnes croient qu'il y a du retard ; mais il use de patience envers vous, voulant que personne ne périsse, mais que tous arrivent à la repentance.
[3:10] Le jour du Seigneur viendra comme un voleur ; alors les cieux disparaîtront avec fracas ; les éléments embrasés se fondront, et la terre et tout ce qu'elle renferme sera consumé.
[3:11] Puisque tout doit se fondre ainsi, quelle sainte conduite, quelle, piété ne devez-vous pas montrer,
[3:12] attendant et hâtant la venue du jour de Dieu (c'est à cause de ce jour que les cieux se seront fondus dans le feu, et que les éléments embrasés se seront dissous).
[3:13] Quant à nous, nous attendons, selon sa promesse, des cieux nouveaux et une terre nouvelle où la justice habitera!
[3:14] C'est pourquoi, bien-aimés, pleins de cette attente, faites des efforts pour qu'il vous trouve en paix, sans tache, sans reproche ;
[3:15] considérez la patience que montre notre Seigneur comme chose fort propre à notre salut, ainsi que notre bien-aimé frère Paul, selon la sagesse qui lui a été donnée,
[3:16] vous l'a aussi écrit ; il le fait d'ailleurs dans toutes les lettres où il parle de ces sortes de choses, lettres dans lesquelles certains passages sont difficiles à comprendre, dont les ignorants et les esprits mobiles tordent le sens, comme, du reste, les autres Écritures, pour leur propre perdition.
[3:17] Vous voilà prévenus, bien-aimés ; soyez donc sur vos gardes, de peur que, entraînés, vous aussi, par les séductions de ces misérables, vous ne veniez à déchoir, à perdre votre fermeté.
[3:18] Croissez dans la grâce et dans la connaissance de notre Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ. A lui soit la gloire maintenant et jusqu'au jour de l'éternité! 

### I John

[1:1] Ce qui existait dès le commencement, ce que nous avons, entendu, ce que nous avons vu de nos yeux, ce que nous avons contemplé et que nos mains ont touché, quant à la Parole de la vie —
[1:2] (car la vie s'est manifestée, et nous l'avons vue, nous l'attestons, et nous vous annonçons cette vie éternelle qui était auprès du Père et s'est manifestée à nous),
[1:3] ce que nous avons vu et entendu, nous vous l'annonçons pour que, vous aussi, vous soyez en communion avec nous ; et notre communion à nous est avec le Père et avec son Fils Jésus-Christ,
[1:4] et nous vous écrivons ceci pour que notre joie soit complète.
[1:5] Voici le message que nous avons appris de lui et que nous vous annonçons : Dieu est lumière, et il n'y a point de ténèbres en lui.
[1:6] Si nous nous disons en communion avec lui et que nous marchions dans les ténèbres, nous mentons, et nous ne pratiquons pas la vérité.
[1:7] Si, au contraire, nous marchons dans la lumière, comme il est lui-même dans la lumière, nous sommes en communion les uns avec les autres, et le sang de Jésus son fils nous purifie de tout péché.
[1:8] Si nous nous disons sans péché, nous nous trompons nous-mêmes, et la vérité n'est pas en nous.
[1:9] Si nous confessons nos péchés, il est fidèle et juste pour nous pardonner ces péchés et nous purifier de toute iniquité.
[1:10] Si nous disons que nous n'avons pas péché, nous faisons de lui un menteur, et sa parole n'est pas en nous.
[2:1] Mes enfants, je vous écris ceci pour que vous ne péchiez point, et si quelqu'un a péché, nous avons, auprès du Père, un intercesseur, Jésus-Christ, le juste.
[2:2] Il est, lui, une propitiation pour nos péchés, et non seulement pour les nôtres, mais aussi pour ceux du monde entier.
[2:3] Et voici comment nous savons que nous l'avons connu : c'est quand nous observons ses commandements.
[2:4] Celui qui dit : je l'ai connu, et qui n'observe pas ses commandements, est un menteur, et la vérité n'est pas en lui.
[2:5] En celui qui observe sa parole, l'amour de Dieu est véritablement parfait. Voici comment nous reconnaissons que nous sommes en lui :
[2:6] celui qui prétend demeurer en lui, doit marcher, lui aussi, comme Jésus a marché.
[2:7] Mes bien-aimés, je ne vous écris pas un commandement nouveau, mais un commandement ancien, celui que vous aviez dès le commencement. Ce commandement ancien c'est la parole que vous avez entendue.
[2:8] Cependant c'est aussi un commandement nouveau que je vous écris ; cela est vrai et pour lui et pour vous, parce que les ténèbres se dissipent, et que la vraie lumière brille déjà.
[2:9] Celui qui se dit dans la lumière et qui hait son frère, continue à être dans les ténèbres.
[2:10] Celui qui aime son frère reste dans la lumière, et il n'y a en lui aucun motif de tomber.
[2:11] Mais celui qui hait son frère est dans les ténèbres, marche dans les ténèbres, et ne sait où il va, parce que les ténèbres l'ont rendu aveugle.
[2:12] Je vous écris, enfants, parce que vos péchés vous ont été pardonnés à cause de son nom.
[2:13] Je vous écris, pères, parce que vous avez connu celui qui est dès le commencement. Je vous écris, jeunes gens, parce que vous avez vaincu le Malin. Je vous ai écrit, enfants, parce que vous avez connu le Père.
[2:14] Je vous ai écrit, pères, parce que vous avez connu celui qui est dès le commencement. Je vous ai écrit, jeunes gens, parce que vous êtes forts, et que la Parole de Dieu demeure en vous, et que vous avez vaincu le Malin.
[2:15] N'aimez pas le monde, ni ce qui est dans le monde. Si quelqu'un aime le monde, l'amour du Père n'est pas en lui : car tout
[2:16] ce qui est dans le monde, la convoitise de la chair, la convoitise des yeux et l'ostentation dans la vie, ne vient pas du Père, mais vient du monde.
[2:17] Or le monde passe, et sa convoitise aussi ; mais celui qui fait la volonté de Dieu subsiste éternellement.
[2:18] Mes enfants, nous sommes à la dernière heure ; vous avez entendu annoncer la venue d'un Antechrist ; sachez qu'il y a maintenant plusieurs Antechrists ; et ainsi nous savons que nous sommes à la dernière heure.
[2:19] Ils sont sortis du milieu de nous, mais ils n'étaient pas des nôtres ; car s'ils avaient été des nôtres, ils seraient restés avec nous, mais c'était afin de montrer que tous ne sont pas des nôtres.
[2:20] Quant à vous, vous avez une onction venant du Saint, et vous le savez tous.
[2:21] Je ne vous ai pas écrit, parce que vous ne connaissez pas la vérité, mais parce que vous la connaissez et parce qu'aucun mensonge ne vient de la vérité.
[2:22] Qui est menteur si ce n'est celui qui nie que Jésus est le Christ? Voilà l'Antechrist, celui qui renie le Père et le Fils.
[2:23] Quiconque renie le Fils n'a pas non plus le Père ; celui qui confesse le Fils a aussi le Père.
[2:24] Quant à vous, ce que vous avez entendu dès le commencement doit demeurer en vous. Si ce que vous avez entendu dès le commencement demeure en vous, vous demeurerez, vous aussi, dans le Fils et dans le Père.
[2:25] Et voici la promesse qu'il nous a faite lui-même : la vie éternelle.
[2:26] Je vous ai écrit cela en vue de ceux qui vous égarent.
[2:27] Quant à vous, l'onction que vous avez reçue de lui reste en vous, et vous n'avez pas besoin qu'on vous instruise ; mais, comme son onction vous instruit de toutes choses et qu'elle est vraie, qu'elle n'est pas un mensonge, vous demeurerez en lui comme elle vous l'a enseigné.
[2:28] Désormais, mes enfants, demeurez en lui, afin que, s'il vient à paraître, nous soyons pleins d'assurance et que, lors de son avènement, nous n'ayons pas à nous éloigner de lui, couverts de honte.
[2:29] Si vous savez qu'il est juste, reconnaissez aussi que celui qui pratique la justice est né de lui.
[3:1] Voyez quel amour le Père nous a témoigné afin que nous fussions appelés enfants de Dieu ; et nous le sommes. Si le monde ne nous connaît pas, c'est que, lui non plus, il ne l'a pas connu.
[3:2] Mes bien-aimés, nous sommes maintenant enfants de Dieu, et ce que nous serons n'a pas encore été manifesté, mais nous savons ceci : quand ce que nous serons sera manifesté, nous serons semblables à lui, parce que nous le verrons tel qu'il est.
[3:3] Quiconque fonde sur lui une telle espérance, se purifie lui-même comme lui est pur.
[3:4] Quiconque commet le péché, viole la Loi : le péché c'est la violation de la Loi.
[3:5] Vous savez qu'il est apparu pour enlever les péchés, et qu'il n'y a point de péché en lui.
[3:6] Quiconque demeure en lui ne pèche pas. Quiconque pèche ne l'a pas vu et ne l'a pas connu.
[3:7] Mes enfants, que personne ne vous égare! Celui qui pratique la justice est juste, comme lui est juste.
[3:8] Celui qui commet le péché est enfant du Diable, car le Diable pèche depuis le commencement. Voici pourquoi le Fils de Dieu est apparu : pour détruire les oeuvres du Diable.
[3:9] Quiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché, parce que la semence de Dieu demeure en lui, et il ne peut pas pécher, parce qu'il est né de Dieu.
[3:10] Voici comment se font reconnaître les enfants de Dieu et les enfants du Diable: quiconque ne pratique pas la justice n'est pas né de Dieu, et celui qui n'aime pas son frère non plus.
[3:11] Car voici le message que vous avez entendu dès le commencement : aimons-nous les uns les autres,
[3:12] et ne soyons pas comme Caïn qui était fils du Malin et qui égorgea son frère. Pourquoi l'égorgea-t-il? parce que ses oeuvres étaient mauvaises et celles de son frère justes.
[3:13] Ne vous étonnez pas, frères, si le monde vous hait.
[3:14] Nous, nous savons que nous sommes passés de la mort à la vie, parce que nous aimons les frères. Celui qui n'aime pas demeure dans la mort.
[3:15] Quiconque hait son frère est un homicide, et vous savez qu'aucun homicide n'a la vie éternelle demeurant en lui.
[3:16] Voici comment nous avons reconnu son amour : à ce qu'il a donné sa vie pour nous, et, nous aussi, nous devons donner notre vie pour les frères.
[3:17] Si quelqu'un possède les biens de ce monde et que, voyant son frère dans le besoin, il lui ferme son coeur, comment l'amour de Dieu peut-il demeurer en lui?
[3:18] Mes enfants, n'aimons pas par nos paroles et avec notre langue, aimons par nos actes et en vérité.
[3:19] Et voici comment nous reconnaîtrons que nous sommes de la vérité et comment, en sa présence, nous tranquilliserons notre coeur :
[3:20] c'est que, si notre coeur nous condamne, Dieu est plus grand que notre coeur et il sait tout.
[3:21] Bien-aimés, si notre coeur ne nous condamne pas, nous sommes pleins d'assurance pour nous approcher de Dieu,
[3:22] et tout ce que nous lui demandons, il nous l'accorde, parce que nous observons ses commandements et que nous faisons ce qui lui est agréable.
[3:23] Et voici son commandement : que nous croyions au nom de son fils Jésus-Christ, et que nous nous aimions les uns les autres, comme il nous l'a commandé.
[3:24] Celui qui observe ses commandements demeure en Dieu et Dieu en lui, et nous reconnaissons qu'il demeure en nous, à l'Esprit qu'il nous a donné.
[4:1] Mes bien-aimés, ne croyez pas à n'importe quel Esprit ; mais examinez les Esprits pour savoir s'ils viennent de Dieu, car un grand nombre de faux prophètes sont apparus dans le monde.
[4:2] Voici comment vous reconnaîtrez l'Esprit de Dieu : Tout Esprit qui reconnaît Jésus pour le Christ venu en chair est de Dieu,
[4:3] et tout Esprit qui ne reconnaît pas Jésus n'est pas de Dieu, mais il est l'Esprit de l'Antechrist dont vous avez entendu annoncer la venue, et il est déjà maintenant dans le monde.
[4:4] Pour vous, mes enfants, vous êtes de Dieu, et vous avez vaincu ces Esprits-là, parce que celui qui est en vous est plus grand que celui qui est dans le monde.
[4:5] Quant à eux, ils viennent du monde ; voilà pourquoi ils parlent selon le monde, et le monde les écoute ;
[4:6] nous, nous venons de Dieu ; celui qui connaît Dieu nous écoute ; celui qui ne vient pas de Dieu ne nous écoute pas. C'est ainsi que nous distinguons l'Esprit de la vérité de l'Esprit de l'erreur.
[4:7] Mes bien-aimés, aimons-nous les uns les autres, parce que l'amour vient de Dieu et quiconque aime est né de Dieu et connaît Dieu.
[4:8] Celui qui n'aime pas n'a pas connu Dieu : car Dieu est amour.
[4:9] Voici comment Dieu a manifesté son amour pour nous : Dieu a envoyé son Fils unique dans le monde pour que nous eussions la vie par lui.
[4:10] Voici en quoi consiste l'amour : ce n'est pas nous qui avons aimé Dieu, mais c'est lui qui nous a aimés et qui a envoyé son Fils, comme une propitiation pour nos péchés.
[4:11] Mes bien-aimés, si Dieu nous a ainsi aimés, nous aussi nous, devons nous aimer les uns les autres.
[4:12] Personne n'a jamais vu Dieu ; si nous nous aimons les uns les autres, Dieu demeure en nous et son amour est parfait en nous.
[4:13] Voici comment nous reconnaissons que nous demeurons en lui et lui en nous: à ce qu'il nous a donné de son Esprit.
[4:14] Et nous, nous avons vu et nous attestons que le Père a envoyé le Fils comme Sauveur du monde.
[4:15] Celui qui reconnaît que Jésus est le Fils de Dieu, Dieu demeure en lui, et lui en Dieu.
[4:16] Et nous, nous avons connu l'amour que Dieu manifeste en nous, et nous y avons cru. Dieu est amour, et celui qui demeure dans l'amour demeure en Dieu et Dieu demeure en lui.
[4:17] Voici comment l'amour devient parfait chez nous, afin que nous soyons pleins d'assurance au jour du jugement : tel qu'il est lui, tels nous sommes nous dans ce monde.
[4:18] La crainte n'est pas dans l'amour ; au contraire, l'amour parfait bannit la crainte, parce que la crainte suppose une punition, et celui qui craint n'est pas parfait dans l'amour.
[4:19] Nous devons aimer, parce qu’il nous a aimés le premier.
[4:20] Si quelqu'un dit : J'aime Dieu, et qu'il haïsse son frère, il est un menteur, car celui qui n'aime pas son frère qu’il a vu, ne peut pas aimer Dieu qu'il n'a pas vu.
[4:21] Et voici le commandement que nous tenons de lui : Que celui qui aime Dieu aime aussi son frère.
[5:1] Quiconque croit que Jésus est le Christ, est né de Dieu, et quiconque aime Celui qui l'a fait naître, aime aussi celui qui est né de lui.
[5:2] Voici comment nous reconnaissons que nous aimons les enfants de Dieu : quand nous aimons Dieu et que nous observons ses commandements.
[5:3] Car voici en quoi consiste l'amour de Dieu : que nous observions ses commandements. Et ses commandements ne sont pas pénibles,
[5:4] car tout ce qui est né de Dieu triomphe du, monde, et voici la victoire qui triomphe du monde: notre foi.
[5:5] Qui est-ce qui triomphe du monde, sinon celui qui croit que Jésus est le Fils de Dieu?
[5:6] C'est lui, Jésus-Christ, qui est venu au moyen de l'eau et du sang ; non pas avec l'eau seule, mais avec l'eau et le sang ; et c'est l'Esprit qui en rend témoignage, parce que l'Esprit est la vérité ;
[5:7] car ils sont trois à rendre témoignage,
[5:8] l'Esprit, l'eau et le sang, et tous trois sont d'accord.
[5:9] Si nous acceptons le témoignage des hommes, le témoignage de Dieu est supérieur ; car voici le témoignage de Dieu : il a rendu témoignage à son Fils.
[5:10] Celui qui croit au Fils de Dieu a ce témoignage en lui-même ; celui qui ne croit pas Dieu en fait un menteur, parce qu'il ne croit pas au témoignage que Dieu a rendu à son Fils.
[5:11] Et voici ce témoignage: Dieu nous a donné la vie éternelle et cette vie est dans son Fils.
[5:12] Celui qui a le Fils a la vie ; celui qui n'a pas le Fils de Dieu n'a pas la vie.
[5:13] Je vous ai écrit cela pour que vous sachiez que vous avez la vie éternelle, vous qui croyez au nom du Fils de Dieu.
[5:14] Voici l'assurance que nous avons en lui : si nous demandons quelque chose selon sa volonté, il nous écoute.
[5:15] Si nous savons qu'il nous écoute, quelles que soient nos demandes, nous le savons, parce que nous obtenons ce que nous lui avons demandé.
[5:16] Si quelqu'un voit un de ses frères commettre un péché qui ne soit pas un péché mortel, il priera, et Dieu donnera la vie à ce frère ; il la donnera à ceux qui n'ont point commis de péché mortel. Il y a un péché mortel ; ce n'est pas pour ce péché que je parle de prier.
[5:17] Toute iniquité est un péché, et il y a un péché qui n'est pas mortel.
[5:18] Nous savons que quiconque est né de Dieu ne pèche pas, mais celui qui est né de Dieu veille sur lui-même, et le Malin n'a aucune prise sur lui.
[5:19] Nous savons que nous sommes venus de Dieu et que le monde entier est au pouvoir du Malin.
[5:20] Mais nous savons aussi que le Fils de Dieu est venu et nous a donné l'intelligence pour que nous connaissions le véritable ; et nous sommes dans le véritable, dans son Fils Jésus-Christ. C'est lui qui est le Dieu véritable et la vie éternelle.
[5:21] Mes enfants, gardez-vous des idoles. 

### II John

[1:1] L'ancien à l'élue Cyria et à ses enfants (que j'aime véritablement) — et ce n'est pas moi seul qui les aime, mais aussi tous ceux qui ont connu la vérité —
[1:2] (je les aime à cause de la vérité qui demeure en nous et qui sera éternellement avec nous).
[1:3] Grâce, miséricorde et paix, venant de Dieu le Père et de Jésus-Christ, le Fils du Père, soient avec nous dans la vérité et dans l'amour.
[1:4] J'ai été bien heureux de trouver quelques-uns de tes enfants marchant dans la vérité, comme nous en avons reçu le commandement du Père.
[1:5] Et maintenant, je te demande, Cyria (non comme si je t'écrivais un nouveau commandement, mais celui-là même que nous avons reçu dès le commencement), de nous aimer les uns les autres. Voici en quoi consiste cet amour : marchons selon ses commandements.
[1:6] Et voici en quoi consiste ce commandement : marcher (comme vous l'avez appris dès le commencement), marcher dans l'amour.
[1:7] Il s'est répandu dans le monde un grand nombre de séducteurs qui ne reconnaissent pas que Jésus-Christ est venu en chair : oui, voilà le séducteur! voilà l'Antechrist!
[1:8] Faites attention à vous pour ne pas perdre le fruit de vos efforts, mais pour recevoir une pleine récompense.
[1:9] Celui qui va plus loin, qui ne reste pas attaché à la doctrine du Christ, n'a point Dieu ; celui qui reste attaché à cette doctrine, a le Père et a le Fils.
[1:10] Si quelqu'un vient à vous et n'apporte pas cette doctrine, ne le recevez pas dans votre maison et ne lui donnez pas le salut de paix.
[1:11] Car celui qui le lui donne prend part à ses mauvaises oeuvres.
[1:12] Je n'ai pas voulu, ayant bien des choses à vous dire, vous les faire savoir avec l'encre et le papier ; mais comme j'espère aller vous voir, je vous entretiendrai de vive voix, pour que notre joie soit complète.
[1:13] Les enfants de ta soeur l'élue te saluent. 

### III John

[1:1] L'ancien au bien-aimé Gaïus (que j'aime véritablement).
[1:2] Mon bien-aimé, je fais des voeux pour que tu prospères en toutes choses et que la santé de ton corps soit aussi bonne que celle de ton âme.
[1:3] J'ai été, en effet, bien heureux de voir des frères venir et rendre témoignage de la vérité qui est en toi ; je veux dire rendre témoignage que tu marches dans la vérité.
[1:4] Je n'ai pas de plus grande joie que d'apprendre que mes enfants marchent dans la vérité.
[1:5] Mon bien-aimé, tu te montres fidèle dans ce que tu fais pour les frères, et ce sont des étrangers.
[1:6] Ils ont rendu témoignage à ton amour devant toute l'Église. Tu feras bien de pourvoir à leur voyage d'une manière digne de Dieu ;
[1:7] car c'est pour le «nom» qu'ils sont partis sans rien recevoir des païens.
[1:8] Aussi devons-nous accueillir de tels hommes, afin de nous mettre à l'oeuvre avec eux pour la vérité.
[1:9] J'ai écrit quelques mots à l'Église, mais Diotréphès, qui affecte d'être leur chef, n'accepte rien de nous.
[1:10] Aussi, quand je viendrai, je signalerai les actes qu'il commet, comment il se répand contre nous en mauvais propos, et cela ne lui suffit pas, car non seulement il n'accueille pas les frères lui-même, mais il défend de les accueillir, et ceux qui seraient désireux de le faire, il les chasse de l'Église.
[1:11] Mon bien-aimé, n'imite pas le mal, mais le bien. Celui qui fait le bien est de Dieu. Celui qui fait le mal n'a pas vu Dieu.
[1:12] Quant à Démétrius, tous, et la vérité elle-même, lui rendent un bon témoignage. Nous aussi nous lui rendons un bon témoignage, et tu sais que notre témoignage est véridique.
[1:13] J'aurais bien des choses à t'écrire ; mais je ne veux pas te les faire savoir avec l'encre et la plume.
[1:14] J'espère te voir bientôt et nous nous entretiendrons de vive voix. La paix soit avec toi. Les amis te saluent. Salue les amis chacun en particulier. 

### Jude

[1:1] Jude, serviteur de Jésus-Christ et frère de Jacques, à ceux qui sont aimés en Dieu le Père, qui sont gardés pour Jésus-Christ, qui sont élus.
[1:2] Miséricorde, paix et amour vous soient de plus en plus donnés.
[1:3] Bien-aimés, je mettais beaucoup de soin à vous écrire concernant notre salut commun, quand je me suis trouvé forcé de vous adresser cette lettre pour vous prier de défendre la foi qui a été une fois pour toutes transmise aux fidèles.
[1:4] Car il s'est faufilé parmi nous certains personnages (des impies dont la sentence est déjà écrite et depuis longtemps) qui changent en orgie la grâce de notre Dieu, et qui renient notre seul maître et Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:5] Je veux vous rappeler (et c'est inutile, car vous savez tout): que le Seigneur, ayant délivré le peuple du pays d'Égypte, fit périr la seconde fois ceux qui furent incrédules ;
[1:6] que les anges qui n'ont pas su conserver leur rang et ont déserté leurs propres demeures, ont été mis par lui en réserve pour le jugement du grand jour, dans les ténèbres et retenus par des chaînes éternelles ;
[1:7] que Sodome, Gomorrhe et les villes voisines qui se prostituèrent comme ceux dont je parle et coururent aux crimes contre nature, sont devant nous comme un exemple, subissant la peine du feu éternel.
[1:8] Malgré cela, ceux dont je parle font de même ; dans leurs rêveries, ils souillent la chair, méprisent l'autorité, insultent les gloires!
[1:9] Or, même l'archange Michel, quand il discutait avec le Diable et lui disputait le corps de Moïse, n'osa pas l'insulter, en prononçant son jugement, il lui dit seulement : Que le Seigneur te punisse !»
[1:10] Eh bien, ceux dont il s'agit insultent tout ce qu'ils ne connaissent pas, et ce qu'ils savent naturellement comme des bêtes brutes, ils s'y perdent!
[1:11] Malheur à eux! car ils sont entrés dans la voie de Caïn! Ils se sont jetés, pour de l'argent, dans l'erreur de Balaam! Ils ont péri dans la révolte de Coré!
[1:12] Ces gens-là sont un écueil dans vos agapes ; ils s'y gorgent sans pudeur ; ils ne pensent qu'à se repaître ! Nuages sans eau emportés çà et là par les vents! Arbres de fin d'automne sans fruits! deux fois morts! déracinés!
[1:13] Flots sauvages de la mer, jetant l'écume de leurs turpitudes! Astres errants, auxquels le gouffre des ténèbres est réservé pour l'éternité!
[1:14] C'est d'eux qu'a prophétisé Hénoch, le septième patriarche depuis Adam, quand il a dit : «Voilà que le Seigneur vient avec ses saintes myriades,
[1:15] pour prononcer un jugement contre tous, et pour convaincre tous les impies de toutes les oeuvres d'impiété qu'ils ont commises et de toutes les dures paroles qu'ils ont prononcées contre lui, eux, ces pécheurs impies.»
[1:16] Ce sont des mécontents, toujours à gronder, guidés par leurs passions, dont la bouche est pleine d'emphase, qui flattent les gens par intérêt !
[1:17] Mais vous, bien-aimés, rappelez-vous les paroles prononcées, par les apôtres de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.
[1:18] Ils vous disaient qu'aux derniers temps paraîtraient des railleurs, guidés par leurs passions impies.
[1:19] Eh bien, il s'agit de ceux-là, de ces auteurs de schismes, de ces êtres sensuels, n'ayant pas l'Esprit.
[1:20] Mais vous, bien-aimés, édifiez-vous vous-mêmes sur le fondement de votre très sainte foi ; priez, dirigés par l'Esprit saint ;
[1:21] maintenez-vous vous-mêmes dans l'amour de Dieu ; attendez que la miséricorde de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ vous donne la vie éternelle.
[1:22] De ceux qui hésitent, réprimandez les uns,
[1:23] sauvez les autres en les arrachant du feu ; ayez des autres une pitié mêlée de crainte, haïssant jusqu'au vêtement souillé par la chair.
[1:24] A celui qui peut vous préserver de toute chute et vous faire comparaître devant sa gloire irréprochables et joyeux,
[1:25] au Dieu unique, notre Sauveur par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur, appartiennent la gloire, la grandeur, la force et la puissance de toute éternité, maintenant et dans tous les siècles! Amen. 

### Revelation of John

[1:1] Révélation de Jésus-Christ que Dieu lui a accordée pour montrer à ses serviteurs ce qui doit arriver bientôt, et que le Christ a transmise en envoyant son ange à son serviteur Jean,
[1:2] qui atteste, comme témoin oculaire, la parole de Dieu et le témoignage de Jésus-Christ.
[1:3] Heureux celui qui lira, heureux ceux qui entendront la parole de cette prophétie et qui observeront ce qui y est écrit, car le temps est proche!
[1:4] Jean aux sept églises d'Asie. Grâce et paix vous soient données par celui qui est, qui était et qui viendra, et par les sept esprits qui sont devant son trône,
[1:5] et par Jésus-Christ, le témoin fidèle, le premier-né des morts, le prince des rois de la terre. A celui qui nous aime, et nous a lavés de nos péchés dans son sang,
[1:6] et qui a fait de nous un Royaume, qui a fait de nous des prêtres de Dieu son Père, à lui la gloire et la force aux siècles des siècles! Amen.
[1:7] «Le voici, il vient sur les nuées et tout oeil le verra ; ceux mêmes qui l'ont percé le verront, et toutes les tribus de la terre se lamenteront à cause de lui.» —
[1:8] «Oui, amen! Je suis l'Alpha et l'Oméga», dit le Seigneur Dieu, «Celui qui est, qui était et qui viendra, le Tout-Puissant.»
[1:9] Moi, Jean, votre frère et votre compagnon dans les tribulations, dans la royauté et la ferme attente de Jésus, je me trouvai dans l'île qu'on appelle Patmos, à cause de la parole de Dieu et du témoignage de Jésus.
[1:10] Je tombai en extase, le jour du Seigneur, et j'entendis derrière moi une voix éclatante comme le son d'une trompette
[1:11] qui disait : «Ce que tu vas voir, écris-le dans un livre et envoie-le aux sept Églises, à Éphèse, à Smyrne, à Pergame, à Thyatires, à Sardes, à Philadelphie, à Laodicée.»
[1:12] Et je me retournai pour chercher la voix qui me parlait et, m'étant retourné, je vis sept chandeliers d'or ;
[1:13] au milieu était «un être qui ressemblait à un fils d'homme, revêtu d'une longue robe, et ceint» à la hauteur de la poitrine «d'une ceinture d'or.
[1:14] Sa tête et ses cheveux étaient blancs comme de la laine blanche, comme de la neige, ses yeux étaient comme la flamme,
[1:15] ses pieds comme le cuivre» rougi dans une fournaise ardente. «Sa voix ressemblait à la voix des grosses eaux.»
[1:16] A la main droite il avait sept étoiles ; de sa bouche sortait un glaive aigu à deux tranchants, et son aspect était celui du «soleil quand il brille dans tout son éclat.»
[1:17] A sa vue, je tombai comme mort à ses pieds, et il posa sa main droite sur moi, disant : «Ne crains point, je suis le Premier et le Dernier»
[1:18] le vivant ; j'ai été mort, et voilà que maintenant je vis aux siècles des siècles, et je tiens les clefs de la mort et de la Demeure-des-Morts.
[1:19] Écris donc ce que tu as vu et ce qui est et ce qui doit arriver après,
[1:20] écris le mystère des sept étoiles que tu as vues dans ma main et des sept chandeliers d'or. Les sept étoiles sont les anges des sept Églises, et les chandeliers sont les sept Églises.
[2:1] A l'ange de l'Église d'Éphèse écris : Voici ce que dit celui qui tient les sept étoiles dans sa main droite et qui marche au milieu des sept chandeliers d'or :
[2:2] Je sais tes oeuvres, et ton labeur, et ta patience, et que tu ne peux supporter les méchants ; et tu as mis à l'épreuve ceux qui se disent apôtres et qui ne le sont pas, et tu les as trouvés menteurs,
[2:3] et tu as de la patience ; et tu as tout supporté pour mon nom, et tu ne t'es point lassé.
[2:4] Mais j'ai contre toi que tu t'es relâché de ton premier amour.
[2:5] Souviens-toi donc d'où tu es tombé, et repens-toi, et reviens à tes premières oeuvres ; sinon je viens à toi, et je change ton chandelier de place, si tu ne te repens pas.
[2:6] Pourtant tu as en ta faveur que tu hais les oeuvres des Nicolaïtes que moi aussi je hais.
[2:7] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises : Au vainqueur je donnerai à manger «de l'arbre de vie qui est dans le Paradis de Dieu.»
[2:8] A l'ange de l'Église de Smyrne écris: Voici ce que dit «le Premier et le Dernier», qui était mort et qui est revenu à la vie :
[2:9] Je connais tes tribulations et ta pauvreté (pourtant tu es riche), et les injures de gens qui se disent Juifs sans l'être et qui ne sont autre chose qu'une synagogue de Satan.
[2:10] Ne t'effraye pas de ce que tu vas souffrir ; voilà que le Diable va jeter plusieurs des vôtres en prison pour que vous soyez éprouvés, et vous passerez par une tribulation de dix jours. Sois fidèle jusqu'à la mort, et je te donnerai la couronne de vie!
[2:11] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises : Le vainqueur n'aura rien à souffrir de la seconde mort.
[2:12] A l'ange de l'Église de Pergame écris: Voici ce que dit celui qui tient le glaive aigu à deux tranchants :
[2:13] Je sais que là où tu habites est le trône de Satan ; et tu gardes mon nom, et tu n'a pas renié ma foi, en ces jours où Antipas, mon témoin fidèle, a été tué chez vous, là où Satan habite.
[2:14] Mais j'ai contre toi quelque chose : tu as là des gens qui professent la doctrine de Balaam, qui enseigna à Balac à jeter le scandale devant les fils d'Israël, à manger des viandes consacrées aux idoles et à forniquer.
[2:15] C'est ainsi que tu as des tiens qui professent la doctrine des Nicolaïtes.
[2:16] Repens-toi donc ; sinon je viens à toi sans retard, et je combattrai contre eux avec le glaive de ma bouche.
[2:17] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises : Au vainqueur je donnerai de la manne cachée, et je donnerai une pierre blanche, et sur cette pierre un nom nouveau est écrit que nul ne connaît, sauf celui qui la reçoit.
[2:18] A l'ange de l'Église de Thyatires écris : Voici ce que dit le Fils de Dieu, celui qui a «les yeux comme la flamme et les pieds comme le cuivre!» :
[2:19] Je sais tes oeuvres, et ton amour, et ta foi, et tes services, et ta patience, et tes dernières oeuvres plus nombreuses que les premières.
[2:20] Mais j'ai contre toi que tu laisses faire la femme Jézabel, qui se dit prophétesse et qui séduit mes serviteurs, et leur enseigne à forniquer et à manger des viandes consacrées aux idoles.
[2:21] Et je lui ai donné du temps pour qu'elle se repente, et elle ne veut pas se repentir de sa fornication.
[2:22] Et voilà que je la jette sur un lit de souffrances ; et aux complices de ses adultères j'envoie une grande tribulation, s'ils ne se repentent pas de leurs oeuvres.
[2:23] Et je ferai mourir ses enfants, je les tuerai, et toutes les Églises apprendront que «Je suis, moi, celui qui sonde les reins et les coeurs» et «Je rendrai à chacun» de vous «selon ses oeuvres».
[2:24] Quant à vous autres de Thyatires qui ne professez pas cette doctrine et qui n'avez pas connu «les profondeurs de Satan», comme ils disent, je ne vous impose pas d'autre fardeau.
[2:25] Seulement ce que vous avez, tenez-le bien jusqu'à ce que je vienne.
[2:26] Et le vainqueur, et celui qui garde mes oeuvres jusqu'à la fin, «Je lui donnerai pouvoir sur les nations
[2:27] Et il les gouvernera avec une verge de fer Il les brisera comme des vases d'argile». Ainsi que j'en ai reçu moi-même le pouvoir de mon Père,
[2:28] et je lui donnerai l'étoile du matin.
[2:29] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises!
[3:1] A l'ange de l'Église de Sardes écris: Voici ce que dit celui qui a les sept Esprits de Dieu et les sept étoiles : Je sais tes oeuvres ; tu passes pour être vivant, mais tu es mort.
[3:2] Sois vigilant et fortifie ce qui reste, ce qui est près de mourir ; car je n'ai pas trouvé tes oeuvres parfaites devant mon Dieu.
[3:3] Souviens-toi donc comment tu as reçu et entendu la parole, et garde-la, et repens-toi. Si tu n'es pas vigilant, je viendrai comme un voleur, et tu ne sauras pas à quelle heure je viendrai à toi.
[3:4] Tu as cependant quelques personnes à Sardes qui n'ont pas souillé leurs vêtements ; elles marcheront avec moi en robes blanches, car elles en sont dignes.
[3:5] Le vainqueur sera ainsi paré de vêtements blancs, et je n'«effacerai» pas son nom du «livre de vie», et je confesserai son nom devant mon Père et devant ses anges.
[3:6] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises!
[3:7] A l'ange de l'Église de Philadelphie, écris : Voici ce que dit le Saint, le Vrai, qui a la clef de David, Qui ouvre et personne ne fermera, Qui ferme et personne n'ouvrira.
[3:8] Je sais tes oeuvres ; voici, j'ai ouvert devant toi une porte que personne ne peut fermer, parce que, malgré ta faiblesse, tu as gardé ma parole et n'as pas renié mon nom.
[3:9] Voici, je te donne des membres de la synagogue de Satan, qui se disent Juifs et qui ne le sont pas, mais qui mentent. Je ferai qu'ils viennent et se prosternent à tes pieds, et qu'ils sachent que je t'ai aimé.
[3:10] Parce que tu as gardé ma parole d'attente, moi aussi je te garderai de l'heure de l'épreuve qui va venir sur le monde entier, pour éprouver les habitants de la terre.
[3:11] Je viens bientôt: Tiens bien ce que tu as, pour que personne ne prenne ta couronne.
[3:12] Le vainqueur, je le ferai colonne dans le Temple de mon Dieu, et il n'en sortira plus, et j'écrirai sur cette colonne le nom de mon Dieu et le nom de la ville de mon Dieu, le nom de la nouvelle Jérusalem qui descend du ciel d'auprès de mon Dieu, ainsi que mon nom, mon nouveau nom.
[3:13] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises!
[3:14] A l'ange de l'Église de Laodicée écris : Voici ce que dit l'Amen, le témoin fidèle et vrai, le principe de la création de Dieu :
[3:15] Je sais tes oeuvres ; tu n'es ni froid, ni chaud. Que je te voudrais ou froid ou chaud!
[3:16] mais, puisque tu es tiède, puisque tu n'es ni chaud, ni froid, je vais te vomir de ma bouche.
[3:17] Tu te dis : «Je suis riche, je me suis enrichi, je n'ai besoin de rien», et tu ne vois pas que tu es malheureux et misérable, et pauvre, et aveugle, et nu.
[3:18] Je te conseille d'acheter de moi de l'or passé au feu pour devenir vraiment riche, et des vêtements blancs pour te couvrir et cacher la honte de ta nudité, et un collyre pour oindre tes yeux afin que tu voies.
[3:19] Ceux que j'aime, je les réprimande et les châtie. Aie donc du zèle, et repens-toi.
[3:20] Voici, je me tiens à la porte et je frappe ; si quelqu'un entend ma voix et m'ouvre la porte, j'entrerai chez lui, et je mangerai avec lui et lui avec moi.
[3:21] Le vainqueur, je lui donnerai de s'asseoir avec moi sur mon trône, de même que, moi aussi, j'ai vaincu et me suis assis avec mon Père sur son trône.
[3:22] Que celui qui a des oreilles écoute ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises!
[4:1] Après cela, je regardai, et voici, une porte était ouverte dans le ciel, et la première voix que j'avais entendue me parler comme le son d'une trompette, me dit : «Monte ici et je te montrerai ce qui doit suivre.»
[4:2] Immédiatement je tombai en extase : Et voici un trône était dans le ciel, et sur le trône quelqu'un assis.
[4:3] Et Celui qui y était assis avait l'éclat d'une pierre de jaspe et de cornaline ; et, en cercle autour du trône, un arc-en-ciel brillant comme l'émeraude ; et, en cercle autour du trône, vingt-quatre trônes,
[4:4] et sur ces vingt-quatre trônes des vieillards assis, vêtus de robes blanches et sur leurs têtes des couronnes d'or ;
[4:5] et du trône sortent des éclairs et des voix, et des coups de tonnerre ; et, devant le trône, brûlent sept lampes ardentes qui sont les sept Esprits de Dieu ;
[4:6] et, devant le trône, était comme une mer transparente semblable à du cristal ; et, au milieu du trône et autour du trône, quatre animaux ayant des yeux partout, devant et derrière.
[4:7] Et le premier animal a la forme d'un lion, et le deuxième animal, la forme d'un veau, et le troisième animal a comme un visage humain, et le quatrième animal a la forme d'un aigle aux ailes ouvertes.
[4:8] Et les quatre animaux ont chacun six ailes et sont couverts d'yeux autour du corps et sous le corps, et ils ne cessent de dire jour et nuit : «Saint, saint, saint est le Seigneur Dieu Tout-Puissant» qui était, qui est et qui viendra.
[4:9] Et quand les animaux rendent gloire, et honneur, et actions de grâces à Celui qui est assis sur le trône et qui vit aux siècles des siècles,
[4:10] les vingt-quatre vieillards se prosternent devant Celui qui est assis sur le trône et adorent Celui qui vit aux siècles des siècles, et ils mettent leurs couronnes au pied du trône,
[4:11] disant : «Tu es digne, ô notre Seigneur et notre Dieu, de recevoir la gloire et l'honneur et la puissance, parce que tu as créé toutes choses, et par ta volonté elles sont et ont été créées!»
[5:1] Je vis ensuite, à la droite de Celui qui était assis sur le trône, un livre écrit des deux côtés, fermé de sept sceaux ;
[5:2] et je vis un ange d'une force extraordinaire qui s'écriait d'une voix éclatante : «Qui est digne d'ouvrir le livre et d'en rompre les sceaux?»
[5:3] Et personne ne put, ni dans le ciel, ni sur la terre, ni sous la terre, ouvrir le livre ni le regarder.
[5:4] Et je versai bien des larmes, parce que personne n'était jugé digne d'ouvrir le livre ni de le regarder.
[5:5] Et l'un des vieillards me dit : «Ne pleure point, voici, le lion de la tribu de Juda, le rejeton de David a réussi à ouvrir le livre et à rompre les sept sceaux.»
[5:6] Et je vis, debout, au milieu du trône et des quatre animaux, et au milieu des vieillards, un agneau qui semblait égorgé ; il a sept cornes et sept yeux qui sont les sept Esprits de Dieu envoyés par toute la terre.
[5:7] Et il vint, et il prit le livre de la main droite de Celui qui était assis sur le trône.
[5:8] Et quand il le prit, les quatre animaux et les vingt-quatre vieillards se prosternèrent devant l'agneau, et chacun avait une harpe et des coupes d'or pleines de parfums (les prières des saints), et ils chantaient un cantique nouveau et disaient:
[5:9] «Toi, tu es digne de prendre le livre et d'en ouvrir les sceaux ; car tu as été égorgé, et, avec ton sang, tu as acheté pour Dieu des élus de toute tribu, de toute langue, de tout peuple, de toute race, et tu en as fait pour notre Dieu un Royaume, et tu en as fait des prêtres, et ils régneront sur la terre !
[5:10] Et je regardai, et j'entendis comme la voix d'une foule d'anges réunis autour du trône et des animaux et des vieillards,
[5:11] et il y en avait des myriades de myriades, des milliers de milliers qui disaient d'une voix éclatante:
[5:12] «Digne est l'agneau égorgé de recevoir la puissance, et la richesse, et la sagesse, et la force, et l'honneur, et la gloire, et la bénédiction!»
[5:13] Et j'entendis toute créature dans le ciel, sur la terre, sous la terre, sur la mer, j'entendis tout ce qu'ils contiennent qui disait : «A Celui qui est assis sur le trône et à l'agneau soient la bénédiction, et l'honneur, et la gloire, et la force aux siècles des siècles!» Et les quatre animaux dirent: «Amen.»
[5:14] Et les vieillards se prosternèrent et adorèrent.
[6:1] Et je regardai quand l'agneau ouvrit le premier des sept sceaux et j'entendis un des quatre animaux qui disait d'une voix de tonnerre: «Viens» ;
[6:2] et je regardai et voici un cheval blanc, et celui qui le montait tenait un arc, et il lui fut donné une couronne, et il partit en vainqueur pour remporter la victoire.
[6:3] Et quand il ouvrit le deuxième sceau, j'entendis le deuxième animal, disant: «Viens» ;
[6:4] et il parut un autre cheval, il était roux, et à celui qui le montait il fut donné d'enlever la paix de la terre et de faire que les hommes s'égorgent les uns les autres, et il lui fut donné une grande épée.
[6:5] Et quand il ouvrit le troisième sceau, j'entendis le troisième animal, disant : «Viens» ; et je regardai, et voici un cheval noir, et celui qui le montait avait une balance à la main.
[6:6] Et j'entendis comme une voix au milieu des quatre animaux disant : Un choenix de froment, un denier ; trois choenix d'orge, un denier ; l'huile et le vin, n'y touche pas !»
[6:7] Et quand il ouvrit le quatrième sceau, j'entendis la voix du quatrième animal, disant : «Viens» ;
[6:8] et je regardai, et voici un cheval jaune, et celui qui le montait s'appelait la Mort et la Demeure-des-morts le suivait et il leur fut donné puissance de tuer le quart de la terre par le glaive, par la faim, par la maladie et par les bêtes féroces.
[6:9] Et quand il ouvrit le cinquième sceau, je vis sous l'autel les âmes de ceux qui avaient été égorgés pour la parole de Dieu et pour le témoignage qu'ils avaient rendu.
[6:10] Et ils s'écriaient et disaient d'une voix éclatante: «Jusques à quand, ô Maître, saint et véridique, ne feras-tu point justice et ne redemanderas-tu point notre sang à ceux qui demeurent sur la terre?»
[6:11] Et il leur fut donné à chacun une robe blanche, et il leur fut dit de patienter encore un peu, jusqu'à ce que leurs compagnons de service et leurs frères qui devaient être tués comme eux, fussent venus compléter leur nombre.
[6:12] Et je regardai quand il ouvrit le sixième sceau, et il y eut un vaste ébranlement ; et le soleil devint noir comme un sac de crin ; et la lune prit une couleur de sang ;
[6:13] et les étoiles tombèrent du ciel sur la terre, comme les fruits verts d'un figuier agité par un violent coup de vent ;
[6:14] et le ciel se retira comme un livre qu'on roule ; et toutes les montagnes et toutes les îles furent jetées hors de leur place ;
[6:15] et les rois de la terre, et les grands, et les tribuns militaires, et les riches, et les forts, et tous les esclaves, et tous les hommes libres se cachèrent dans les cavernes et dans les rochers des montagnes,
[6:16] et dirent aux montagnes et aux rochers: «Tombez sur nous et cachez-nous du regard de Celui qui est assis sur le trône, et de la colère de l'agneau,
[6:17] car il est venu, le grand jour de sa colère, et qui peut subsister?»
[7:1] Et après cela, je vis quatre anges placés aux quatre angles de la terre, retenant les quatre vents de la terre afin qu'il ne souffle pas de vent ni sur la terre, ni sur la mer, ni sur aucun arbre.
[7:2] Et je vis un autre ange qui s'élevait de l'Orient, d'où vient le soleil, il tenait le sceau du Dieu vivant, et il s'écriait, parlant d'une voix éclatante aux quatre anges qui avaient reçu le pouvoir de sévir sur la terre et la mer:
[7:3] «Ne sévissez ni contre la terre, ni contre la mer, ni contre les arbres, avant que nous ayons marqué au front les serviteurs de notre Dieu.»
[7:4] Et j'entendis le nombre de ceux qui étaient marqués. Cent quarante-quatre mille étaient marqués, appartenant à toutes les tribus des enfants d'Israël:
[7:5] de la tribu de Juda, douze mille marqués ; de la tribu de Ruben, douze mille ; de la tribu de Gad, douze mille ;
[7:6] de la tribu d'Aser, douze mille ; de la tribu de Nephthali, douze mille ; de la tribu de Manassé, douze mille ;
[7:7] de la tribu de Siméon, douze mille ; de la tribu de Lévi, douze mille ; de la tribu d'Issachar, douze mille ;
[7:8] de la tribu de Zabulon, douze mille ; de la tribu de Joseph, douze mille ; de la tribu de Benjamin, douze mille marqués.
[7:9] Après cela je regardai et voici une foule immense que personne ne pouvait compter, de toute race, de toute tribu, de tout peuple, de toute langue, se tenant devant le trône et devant l'agneau, vêtus de robes blanches, portant des palmes à la main,
[7:10] et s'écriant d'une voix éclatante: «Le salut vient de notre Dieu assis sur le trône, et de l'agneau.»
[7:11] Et tous les anges se tinrent en cercle autour du trône et des vieillards et des quatre animaux, et ils se prosternèrent devant le trône la face contre terre et adorèrent Dieu,
[7:12] disant: «Amen. La bénédiction, et la gloire, et la sagesse, et l'action de grâces, et l'honneur, et la puissance, et la force à notre Dieu aux siècles des siècles! Amen.»
[7:13] Et alors un des vieillards, me parlant, me dit: «Ceux qui sont vêtus de robes blanches, qui sont-ils et d'où sont-ils venus?»
[7:14] Et je lui dis : «Mon Seigneur, c'est toi qui le sais.» Et il me dit: «Ceux-là sont venus de la grande tribulation, et ils ont lavé leurs robes et les ont blanchies dans le sang de l'agneau ;
[7:15] voilà pourquoi ils sont devant le trône de Dieu et ils l'adorent nuit et jour dans son Temple, et Celui qui est assis sur le trône établira sa demeure au-dessus d'eux.
[7:16] «Ils n'auront plus faim, ils n'auront plus soif, Ils ne souffriront plus ni du soleil, ni de la chaleur»
[7:17] car l'agneau qui est au milieu du trône «les fera paître et les conduira aux eaux, sources de la vie» et «Dieu essuiera toutes larmes de leurs yeux ;».
[8:1] Et quand il ouvrit le septième sceau, il se fit, dans le ciel, un silence d'environ une demi-heure.
[8:2] Et je vis les sept anges qui se tiennent devant Dieu, et sept trompettes leur furent données.
[8:3] Et un autre ange s'avança et se tint près de l'autel et il portait un encensoir d'or ; et il lui fut donné une quantité de parfums pour les offrir avec les prières de tous les saints sur l'autel d'or, qui est en face du trône.
[8:4] Et la fumée des parfums s'éleva, avec les prières des saints, de la main de l'ange devant Dieu.
[8:5] Et l'ange prit l'encensoir et le remplit des charbons embrasés de l'autel et les jeta sur la terre, et ils produisirent des coups de tonnerre et des voix, et des éclairs, et un grand ébranlement.
[8:6] Et les sept anges qui avaient les sept trompettes se préparèrent à en sonner.
[8:7] Et le premier sonna : et une grêle mêlée de feu et de sang tomba sur la terre ; et le tiers de la terre fut brûlé, et le tiers des arbres fut brûlé, et toute herbe verte fut brûlée.
[8:8] Et le deuxième ange sonna : et comme une grande montagne incandescente fut lancée dans la mer, et le tiers de la mer fut changé en sang ;
[8:9] et le tiers des créatures vivantes qui sont dans la mer mourut ; et le tiers des navires fut détruit.
[8:10] Et le troisième ange sonna : et il tomba du ciel une grande étoile, brûlant comme un flambeau, et elle tomba sur le tiers des rivières et sur les sources d'eaux.
[8:11] Et le nom de cette étoile est : «Absinthe», et le tiers des eaux se changea en absinthe, et beaucoup d'hommes moururent, parce que ces eaux étaient empoisonnées.
[8:12] Et le quatrième ange sonna : et furent frappés le tiers du soleil, et le tiers de la lune, et le tiers des étoiles, afin que le tiers de leur lumière s'éteignît, le tiers de la lumière du jour, et de même pour la nuit.
[8:13] Et je regardai, et j'entendis un aigle qui volait au zénith et disait d'une voix éclatante: Malheur! malheur! malheur aux habitants de la terre, à cause des autres coups de trompette des trois anges qui ont encore à sonner!
[9:1] Et le cinquième ange sonna : et je vis une étoile tomber du ciel sur la terre, et lui fut donnée la clef du puits de l'abîme.
[9:2] Et elle ouvrit le puits de l'abîme, et il sortit du puits de la fumée comme la fumée d'une grande fournaise ; et le soleil et l'air furent assombris par la fumée du puits ;
[9:3] et de cette fumée sortirent des sauterelles qui assombrirent la terre ; et il leur fut donné une puissance semblable à la puissance des scorpions de la terre ;
[9:4] et il leur fut dit de ne faire de mal ni à l'herbe de la terre, ni à la verdure, ni à aucun arbre, mais seulement aux hommes qui ne sont pas marqués au front du sceau de Dieu ;
[9:5] et il leur fut donné de ne pas les tuer, mais de les tourmenter pendant cinq mois ; et ce tourment ressemblait au tourment du scorpion quand il s'attaque à l'homme ;
[9:6] et, en ces jours-là, les hommes chercheront la mort, et ne la trouveront point ; et ils désireront mourir, et la mort les fuira.
[9:7] Et ces sauterelles ressemblaient à des chevaux équipés pour la guerre ; elles avaient sur la tête comme des couronnes qui auraient été en or ; et leurs visages étaient comme des visages d'hommes ;
[9:8] et leurs cheveux comme des cheveux de femme ; et leurs dents comme des dents de lions ;
[9:9] et elles avaient des cuirasses comme des cuirasses de fer ; et le bruit de leurs ailes était comme le bruit de chars attelés de nombreux chevaux s'élançant au combat ;
[9:10] et elles avaient des queues armées de dards comme les scorpions ; et dans ces queues était leur pouvoir de faire du mal aux hommes pendant cinq mois.
[9:11] Elles avaient à leur tête un roi, l'ange de l'abîme, qui s'appelle en hébreu Abbadon, et en grec Apollyon.
[9:12] Le premier «malheur» est passé ; voici il vient encore deux «malheurs» après celui-là.
[9:13] Et le sixième ange sonna : et j'entendis sortir une voix des quatre cornes de l'autel d'or qui est devant Dieu ;
[9:14] elle disait au sixième ange qui tenait la trompette: «Délie les quatre anges enchaînés sur le grand fleuve l'Euphrate»,
[9:15] et furent déliés les quatre anges qui étaient prêts pour l'heure, et le jour, et le mois, et l'année, afin qu'ils missent à mort le tiers des hommes.
[9:16] Et leur armée comptait deux cents millions de cavaliers ; j'entendis le chiffre.
[9:17] Et voici comment les chevaux m'apparurent, et ceux qui les montaient: ceux-ci avaient des cuirasses couleur de feu, d'hyacinthe et de soufre ; et les têtes des chevaux étaient comme des têtes de lions, et de leurs bouches sortaient du feu, et de la fumée, et du soufre.
[9:18] Par ces trois plaies fut mis à mort le tiers des hommes, par le feu, et par la fumée, et par le soufre qui leur sortaient de la bouche ;
[9:19] car la puissance de ces chevaux est dans leurs bouches et dans leurs queues. En effet, leurs queues ressemblent à des serpents: elles ont des têtes et c'est avec elles qu'ils font du mal.
[9:20] Et le reste des hommes, qui n'avaient pas été mis à mort par ces plaies ne se repentirent point des oeuvres de leurs mains, et ne cessèrent pas d'adorer les démons et les idoles d'or, et d'argent, et d'airain, et de pierre, et de bois, qui ne peuvent ni voir, ni entendre, ni marcher ;
[9:21] et ils ne se repentirent ni de leurs meurtres, ni de leurs sorcelleries, ni de leur fornication, ni de leurs rapines.
[10:1] Et je vis un autre ange d'une force extraordinaire qui descendait du ciel, entouré d'un nuage, la tête ceinte de l'arc-en-ciel, le visage comme le soleil, les pieds comme des colonnes de feu ;
[10:2] il tenait à la main un petit livre ouvert, et il posa le pied droit sur la mer, le gauche sur la terre,
[10:3] et d'une voix terrible comme le rugissement du lion, il jeta un cri ; et quand il jeta ce cri, les sept tonnerres firent retentir leurs voix.
[10:4] Et quand les sept tonnerres eurent parlé je voulus écrire, mais j'entendis une voix du ciel me dire : «Tiens secret ce qu'ont dit les sept tonnerres et ne l'écris point.»
[10:5] Et l'ange que je voyais debout sur la terre et sur la mer «leva la main droite vers le ciel,
[10:6] et jura par Celui qui vit aux siècles des siècles, qui a créé le ciel et ce qu'il renferme, et la terre et ce qu'elle renferme, et la mer et ce qu'elle renferme», qu'il n'y aurait plus de délai,
[10:7] mais qu'au jour où retentirait la voix du septième ange sonnant de la trompette, s'accomplirait le mystère de Dieu, comme il l'avait annoncé à ses serviteurs les prophètes.
[10:8] Et la voix que j'avais entendue venant du ciel me parla de nouveau : «Va, dit-elle, prends le petit livre ouvert dans la main de l'ange qui se tient debout sur la mer et sur la terre».
[10:9] Alors j'allai vers l'ange et lui demandai de me donner le petit livre. «Prends-le, me dit-il, et le dévore ; dans tes entrailles il te sera amer ; mais dans ta bouche tu le trouveras doux comme du miel.»
[10:10] Et je pris le livre de la main de l'ange, et je le dévorai. Dans ma bouche il fut doux comme le miel, mais quand il fut dévoré, il quand il fut dans mes entrailles, il me fut amer.
[10:11] Et on me dit : «Il faut que tu prophétises encore sur beaucoup de peuples, de races, de langues et de rois.»
[11:1] Et on me donna une mesure de la forme d'un bâton et on me dit:«Lève-toi et mesure le Temple de Dieu, et l'autel, et l'espace occupé par ceux qui adorent dans le Temple.
[11:2] Et la cour extérieure du Temple, n'en tiens pas compte, et ne la mesure point, car elle a été donnée aux païens, et ils fouleront aux pieds la ville sainte pendant quarante-deux mois.
[11:3] Et je donnerai une mission à mes deux témoins qui prophétiseront pendant douze cent soixante jours, revêtus de sac.»
[11:4] Ils sont «les deux oliviers» et les deux chandeliers «debout devant le Seigneur de la terre» ;
[11:5] et si quelqu'un essaye de leur faire du mal, un feu sort de leur bouche et dévore leurs ennemis ; oui, si quelqu'un essaye de leur faire du mal, c'est ainsi qu'il doit périr.
[11:6] Ils ont le pouvoir de fermer le ciel, et d'empêcher la pluie de tomber les jours où ils prophétisent ; et ils ont le pouvoir de changer l'eau en sang, et de frapper la terre de telle ou telle plaie et aussi souvent qu'ils le voudront.
[11:7] Et quand ils auront fini de rendre leur témoignage, la bête qui monte de l'abîme leur fera la guerre, les vaincra et les tuera ;
[11:8] et leurs corps resteront sur la place de la grande ville qui s'appelle symboliquement «Sodome», et «Égypte» et où leur Seigneur a été crucifié.
[11:9] Et des gens de tout peuple, de toute tribu, de toute langue et de toute race verront leurs corps pendant trois jours et demi, et ils ne permettront pas qu'on donne à ces corps la sépulture.
[11:10] Et les habitants de la terre seront dans la joie de leur mort, ils s'adresseront des félicitations, et s'enverront des présents, parce que ces deux prophètes ont fait le tourment des habitants de la terre.
[11:11] Mais, au bout de trois jours et demi, l'Esprit de vie venu de Dieu entra en eux, ils se retrouvèrent sur leurs pieds, et une grande terreur saisit ceux qui les virent.
[11:12] Et j'entendis une grande voix venant du ciel et leur disant: «Montez ici» ; et ils montèrent au ciel sur les nues, à la vue de leurs ennemis.
[11:13] Un terrible tremblement de terre se fit en ce moment, et le dixième de la ville tomba, et sept mille hommes périrent dans ce tremblement, et les autres, effrayés, rendirent gloire au Dieu du ciel.
[11:14] Le second «malheur» est passé ; voici venir bientôt le troisième.
[11:15] Et le septième ange sonna : et il y eut de grandes voix dans le ciel qui disaient: «Le Royaume du monde est remis à notre Seigneur et à son Christ, et il régnera aux siècles des siècles.»
[11:16] Et les vingt-quatre vieillards, assis devant Dieu sur leurs trônes, tombèrent sur la face et adorèrent Dieu,
[11:17] disant : «Nous te rendons grâces «Seigneur Dieu Tout-Puissant», qui es et qui as été, de ce que tu t'es emparé de ton grand pouvoir et as inauguré ta Royauté ;
[11:18] et les nations étaient en fureur, mais ta colère est venue ; et il est venu le moment de juger les morts et de donner leur récompense à tes serviteurs ;, les prophètes, et aux saints, et à ceux qui craignent ton nom, aux petits et aux grands, et de perdre ceux qui perdent la terre.»
[11:19] Alors s'ouvrit le Temple de Dieu dans le ciel, et on aperçut l'arche de l'Alliance dans son Temple, et il y eut des éclairs et des voix, et des coups de tonnerre, et un grand ébranlement, et une forte grêle.
[12:1] Et un grand prodige parut dans le ciel : une femme, vêtue du soleil, ayant la lune sous les pieds, et autour de la tête une couronne de douze étoiles ;
[12:2] elle était enceinte et jetait des cris dans le travail et les douleurs de l'enfantement.
[12:3] Et il parut dans le ciel un autre prodige: c'était un énorme dragon rouge, à sept têtes et à dix cornes ; sur les têtes, sept diadèmes ;
[12:4] et sa queue entraînait le tiers des étoiles du ciel et les jetait sur la terre. Et ce dragon se dressa devant la femme qui allait enfanter, afin de dévorer son enfant quand elle l'aurait mis au monde.
[12:5] Et elle mit au monde un fils, un enfant mâle, destiné «à gouverner toutes les nations avec une verge de fer» ; et cet enfant fut enlevé vers Dieu et vers son trône.
[12:6] Et la femme s'enfuit au désert, où Dieu lui a préparé une retraite, et où elle sera nourrie pendant douze cent soixante jours.
[12:7] Alors eut lieu dans le ciel un combat: Michael et ses anges combattant le dragon. Et le dragon combattit avec ses anges,
[12:8] et ils ne furent pas les plus forts, et il n'y eut plus de place pour eux dans le ciel.
[12:9] Et il fut précipité, le grand dragon, le Serpent antique, qui s'appelle le Diable et Satan, le séducteur du monde entier, il fut précipité sur la terre et ses anges avec lui furent précipités.
[12:10] Et j'entendis une grande voix dans le ciel disant: «Maintenant le salut et la puissance et la Royauté sont à notre Dieu et le pouvoir à son Christ, car il a été précipité de haut en bas, l'accusateur de nos frères qui ne cessait nuit et jour de les accuser devant notre Dieu.
[12:11] Et ils l'ont vaincu eux-mêmes, à cause du sang de l'agneau et à cause de la parole de leur témoignage, et ils ont poussé le sacrifice de leur vie jusqu'à la mort.»
[12:12] «Réjouissez-vous donc, ô cieux,» et vous leurs habitants! malheur à la terre et à la mer! car le Diable est descendu vers vous, plein de rage, sachant que ses jours sont comptés.
[12:13] Et quand le dragon se vit précipité sur la terre, il poursuivit, la femme qui avait mis au monde l'enfant mâle.
[12:14] Mais la femme reçut les deux ailes du grand aigle pour s'envoler au désert dans sa retraite, où elle est nourrie loin de la vue du serpent, aune période, et des périodes, et une demi-période.»
[12:15] Et le serpent vomit de sa bouche après la femme de l'eau, une sorte de fleuve pour la noyer et l'emporter ;
[12:16] mais la terre vint au secours de la femme ; elle s'entr'ouvrit et absorba le fleuve que le dragon avait vomi de sa bouche.
[12:17] Et le dragon, furieux contre la femme, s'en alla combattre le reste de sa race qui observait les commandements de Dieu et étaient fidèles au témoignage de Jésus ; et il se tint sur le sable de la mer.
[13:1] Et je vis sortir de la mer une bête qui avait dix cornes et sept têtes, et sur les cornes dix diadèmes, et sur chacune des têtes un nom blasphématoire.
[13:2] Et la bête que je vis ressemblait à un léopard ; ses pieds étaient comme ceux de l'ours, et sa bouche comme celle du lion ; et le dragon lui donna sa force, et son trône, et sa grande puissance.
[13:3] Et l'une de ses têtes avait comme reçu un coup mortel ; mais cette blessure mortelle avait été guérie. Et la terre entière tomba en admiration derrière cette bête,
[13:4] et tous les hommes se mirent à adorer le dragon, parce qu'il avait donné le pouvoir à la bête ; et ils adoraient la bête disant : «Qui est semblable à la bête, et qui peut combattre contre elle?»
[13:5] Et il lui fut donné «une bouche proférant des discours pleins d'orgueil» et de blasphème, et il lui fut donné le pouvoir d'agir ainsi pendant quarante-deux mois.
[13:6] Et elle ouvrit la bouche pour vomir des blasphèmes contre Dieu, des blasphèmes contre son nom, contre son tabernacle, contre ceux qui demeurent dans le ciel.
[13:7] Et il lui fut donné de faire la guerre aux saints et de les vaincre, et la puissance lui fut accordée sur toute tribu, tout peuple, toute langue et toute race.
[13:8] Et tous les habitants de la terre l'adoreront, tous ceux dont le nom n'est pas écrit depuis le commencement du monde dans le livre de vie de l'agneau qui a été égorgé.
[13:9] Que celui qui a des oreilles entende!
[13:10] «Celui qui fait des captifs est captif à son tour» ; celui qui, frappe de l'épée périra par l'épée. C'est ici que se montrent la patience et la foi des saints.
[13:11] Et je vis une autre bête sortir de la terre ; elle avait deux cornes semblables à celle d'un agneau, et elle parlait comme un dragon ;
[13:12] et elle exerçait toute la puissance de la première bête en sa présence ; et elle faisait que la terre et ses habitants adoraient la première bête (celle dont la blessure mortelle avait été guérie).
[13:13] Elle faisait de grands prodiges, jusqu'à faire descendre le feu du ciel sur la terre sous les yeux des hommes.
[13:14] Et elle séduisait les habitants de la terre par les prodiges qu'il lui était donné de faire en présence de la bête. Elle disait aux habitants de la terre de faire une image en l'honneur de la bête (de cette bête qui a reçu un coup d'épée et qui a repris vie),
[13:15] Il lui fut donné d'introduire le souffle de vie dans l'image de la bête, si bien que cette image parla et fit que tous ceux qui ne l'adoreraient pas, elle, l'image de la bête, fussent mis à mort.
[13:16] Et elle fit que tous les hommes, petits et grands, riches et pauvres, libres et esclaves, portaient un signe sur leur main droite ou sur leur front ;
[13:17] que personne ne pouvait acheter ni vendre s'il ne portait le signe de la bête, soit son nom, soit le chiffre de son nom. Ici est la sagesse!
[13:18] Que celui qui a de l'intelligence calcule le chiffre de la bête ; car c'est le chiffre d'un homme ; voici son chiffre: 666
[14:1] Et je regardai, et je vis l'agneau debout sur le mont Sion, et avec lui cent quarante-quatre mille personnes qui avaient son nom et le nom de son Père écrits sur leurs fronts.
[14:2] Et j'entendis une voix venant du ciel ; c'était comme le bruit des grandes eaux et comme le bruit d'un fort coup de tonnerre ; et la voix que j'entendais était aussi comme le son des harpes quand elles sont jouées par des harpistes.
[14:3] Et la voix chantait un cantique nouveau devant le trône et devant les quatre animaux, et devant les vieillards. Et personne ne pouvait apprendre ce cantique, si ce n'est les cent quarante-quatre mille rachetés de la terre.
[14:4] Ceux-là ne se sont point souillés avec des femmes ; car ils sont vierges ; ceux-là suivent l'agneau partout où il les conduit ; ceux-là ont été rachetés d'entre les hommes comme des prémices consacrées
[14:5] à Dieu et à l'agneau ; et dans leur bouche il ne s'est point trouvé de mensonge ; car ils sont sans taches.
[14:6] Et je vis un autre ange qui volait au zénith, tenant l'Évangile éternel pour l'annoncer à tous ceux qui habitaient la terre, et à toute race, tribu, langue et peuple.
[14:7] Il disait d'une voix éclatante: «Craignez Dieu, et rendez-lui gloire, car l'heure de son jugement est venue, et adorez Celui qui a fait le ciel, et la terre, et la mer, et les sources d'eaux.
[14:8] Et un autre ange encore, un second, le suivit, disant : «Elle est tombée, elle est tombée la grande Babylone» qui a enivré toutes les nations du vin de feu de sa fornication.»
[14:9] Et un autre ange encore, un troisième, le suivit, disant d'une voix éclatante: «Celui qui adorera la bête et son image, qui prendra le signe» de la bête sur son front ou sur sa main,
[14:10] boira du vin brûlant de Dieu, du vin pur apprêté dans la coupe de sa colère, et il sera tourmenté dans le feu et le soufre devant les saints anges et devant l'agneau ;
[14:11] et la fumée de leur tourment monte aux siècles des siècles, et ils n'ont de repos ni jour ni nuit, ceux qui adorent la bête et son image, et qui prennent sur eux le signe» de son nom!
[14:12] C'est ici que se montre la patience des saints qui gardent les commandements de Dieu et la foi de Jésus!
[14:13] Et j'entendis une voix venant du ciel qui disait : «Écris: Heureux dès à présent les morts qui meurent dans le Seigneur!» —«Oui, dit l'Esprit, c'est pour qu'ils se reposent de leurs travaux ; car leurs oeuvres les suivent.»
[14:14] Et je regardai et voici, un nuage blanc, et sur ce nuage était assis «comme un fils de l'homme» ayant sur la tête une couronne d'or et dans la main une faux aiguë.
[14:15] Et un autre ange sortit du Temple criant d'une voix éclatante à celui qui était assis sur le nuage: «Lance ta faux et moissonne, car l'heure est venue de moissonner ; la moisson de la terre est mûre!»
[14:16] Alors celui qui était assis sur le nuage lança sa faux sur la terre, et la terre fut moissonnée.
[14:17] Et un autre ange sortit du Temple qui est dans le ciel, tenant lui aussi, une faux aiguë.
[14:18] Et un autre ange sortit de l'autel, il avait pouvoir sur le feu, et il appela d'une voix éclatante celui qui tenait la faux aiguë et lui dit: «Lance ta faux aiguë et vendange les grappes de la vigne de la terre, car ses raisins sont mûrs.»
[14:19] Et l'ange lança sa faux sur la terre, et il vendangea la vigne de la terre, et il jeta tout dans la grande cuve de la colère de Dieu.
[14:20] Et la cuve fut foulée aux pieds hors de la ville, et le sang qui sortit de la cuve monta jusqu'à la hauteur des freins des chevaux, sur un espace de seize cents stades.
[15:1] Et je vis un autre prodige dans le ciel, un grand, un merveilleux prodige: sept anges ayant en main les sept dernières plaies par lesquelles doit se consommer la colère de Dieu.
[15:2] Et je vis comme une mer cristalline, mêlée de feu, et ceux qui avaient été vainqueurs de la bête, et de son image, et du chiffre de son nom, placés sur cette mer cristalline, tenaient les harpes de Dieu.
[15:3] Et ils chantaient le cantique de Moïse, le serviteurs de Dieu, et le cantique de l'agneau en disant : «Grandes et merveilleuses sont tes oeuvres, Seigneur Dieu Tout-Puissant Justes et vraies sont tes voies »,
[15:4] roi des nations, Qui ne craindrait, ô Seigneur, qui ne glorifierait ton nom? Car toi seul es saint Et toutes les nations viendront se prosterner devant toi,» car tes jugements se sont manifestés.
[15:5] Et après cela je regardai, et le Temple du tabernacle céleste du témoignage s'ouvrit,
[15:6] et les sept anges ayant en main les sept plaies en sortirent vêtus de lin pur et éclatant et ceints sur la poitrine de ceintures d'or.
[15:7] Et l'un des quatre animaux donna aux sept anges sept coupes d'or pleines de la colère du Dieu qui vit aux siècles des siècles ;
[15:8] et le Temple se remplit de la fumée de la majesté et de la puissance divine, et personne ne pouvait entrer dans le sanctuaire tant que les sept plaies des sept anges ne s'étaient pas accomplies.
[16:1] Et j'entendis une grande voix qui sortait du Temple et disait aux sept anges : «Allez verser sur la terre les sept coupes de la colère de Dieu.»
[16:2] Et le premier ange partit et versa sa coupe sur la terre, et un ulcère mauvais et pernicieux frappa les hommes qui portaient le signe de la bête et qui adoraient son image.
[16:3] Et le deuxième versa sa coupe dans la mer, et la mer se changea en sang, comme le sang d'un mort, et tous les êtres qui vivent dans la mer moururent.
[16:4] Et le troisième versa sa coupe sur les fleuves et sur les sources d'eaux ; et elles se changèrent en sang
[16:5] et j'entendis l'ange des eaux qui disait: «Tu es juste, Être saint, qui es et qui étais, d'avoir ainsi jugé,
[16:6] car ils ont versé le sang des saints et des prophètes, et tu leur as donné du sang à boire: ils en sont dignes.»
[16:7] Et j'entendis l'autel qui disait : «Oui, «Seigneur, Dieu Tout-Puissant», tes jugements sont vrais et justes.»
[16:8] Et le quatrième versa sa coupe sur le soleil, et il fut donné au soleil de brûler les hommes comme un feu.
[16:9] Et la grande chaleur brûla les hommes, et ils blasphémèrent le nom de Dieu qui a le pouvoir de frapper de telles plaies, et ils ne se repentirent pas pour lui rendre gloire.
[16:10] Et le cinquième versa sa coupe sur le trône de la bête, et le royaume de la bête fut plongé dans les ténèbres, et les hommes se mordaient la langue de douleur
[16:11] et blasphémaient le Dieu du ciel à cause de leur souffrances et de leurs ulcères, et ils ne se repentirent pas de leurs oeuvres.
[16:12] Et le sixième versa sa coupe dans le grand fleuve l'Euphrate, et ses eaux se desséchèrent pour préparer la voie aux rois venant de l'Orient.
[16:13] Et je vis sortir de la bouche du dragon, et de la bouche de la bête, et de la bouche du faux prophète, trois Esprits impurs semblables à des grenouilles.
[16:14] Ce sont des Esprits de démons faisant des miracles, qui vont trouver les rois de toute la terre et les rassemblent pour la bataille du grand jour du Dieu Tout-Puissant.
[16:15] («Voici, je viens comme un voleur: Heureux celui qui veille et qui garde ses vêtements, de peur qu'il ne soit réduit à courir nu, et qu'on ne voie sa honte.»)
[16:16] Ils les rassemblent, dis-je, dans le lieu qui est appelé en hébreu Harmagédon.
[16:17] Et le septième versa sa coupe dans l'air et une grande voix sortit du Temple près du trône et dit : «C'en est fait!»
[16:18] et il y eut des éclairs, des voix, des coups de tonnerre, et un grand ébranlement comme jamais il n'y en avait eu depuis que l'homme est sur la terre ; non ; on ne vit jamais un aussi terrible ébranlement.
[16:19] La grande ville se brisa en trois morceaux, et les villes des nations s'écroulèrent, et la. grande Babylone revint en mémoire devant Dieu pour lui faire boire la coupe du vin brûlant de sa colère.
[16:20] Et toutes les îles s'enfuirent, et les montagnes disparurent,
[16:21] et des grêlons énormes du poids d'un talent tombèrent du ciel sur les hommes, et les hommes blasphémèrent Dieu, à cause de la plaie de la grêle ; car c'était une terrible plaie.
[17:1] Et l'un des sept anges qui tenaient les sept coupes s'approcha de moi et me dit: «Viens ; je vais te montrer le jugement de la grande prostituée, qui est assise sur de grandes eaux,
[17:2] avec laquelle ont forniqué les rois de la terre, et qui a enivré les habitants de la terre du vin de sa fornication.»
[17:3] Et il m'emmena en esprit dans un désert, et je vis une femme assise sur une bête écarlate, couverte de noms de blasphème, ayant sept têtes et dix cornes.
[17:4] Et cette femme était vêtue de pourpre et d'écarlate, couverte d'or, de pierres précieuses et de perles ; elle tenait à la main une coupe d'or pleine des abominations et des impuretés de sa fornication.
[17:5] Et sur son front était écrit un nom, un mystère: «La grande Babylone!, la mère des prostituées et des abominations de la terre!»
[17:6] Et je vis la femme enivrée du sang des saints et du sang des martyrs de Jésus ; et je fus frappé, à sa vue, d'un étonnement extrême.
[17:7] Et l'ange me dit: Pourquoi t'étonnes-tu? Je vais t'expliquer le mystère de la femme et de la bête qui la porte, la bête à sept têtes et à dix cornes.
[17:8] La bête que tu as vue a été et n'est plus, et elle va remonter de l'abîme, puis aller à la perdition. Et les habitants de la terre, dont le nom n'est pas écrit dans le livre de vie depuis la création du monde, seront frappés d'étonnement en voyant reparaître la bête qui a été et qui n'est plus.
[17:9] (C'est ici qu'il faut un esprit intelligent!) Les sept têtes sont sept montagnes sur lesquelles la femme est assise ;
[17:10] elles sont aussi, sept rois ; cinq sont tombés ; l'un vit ; l'autre n'est pas encore venu ; et quand il sera venu, il doit durer peu de temps.
[17:11] Et la bête qui a été et qui n'est plus est elle-même un huitième roi, et, en même temps, elle est du nombre des sept, et elle va à la perdition.
[17:12] Et les dix cornes que tu as vues sont dix rois qui n'ont pas encore reçu la royauté, mais qui reçoivent pour une heure une puissance égale à celle des rois, et l'exercent avec la bête.
[17:13] Ils n'ont tous qu'un même avis et mettent au service de la bête leur puissance et leur force.
[17:14] Ils combattront contre l'agneau, et l'agneau les vaincra ; car il est le Seigneur des seigneurs et le Roi des rois ; et les appelés, et les élus, et les fidèles qui sont avec lui les vaincront aussi.
[17:15] Et il me dit: Les eaux que tu as vues, sur lesquelles la prostituée est assise, sont des peuples, des nations, des races et des langues.
[17:16] Et les dix cornes que tu as vues, et la bête elle-même haïront la prostituée et la rendront déserte et nue, et ils mangeront ses chairs, et ils la brûleront.
[17:17] Car Dieu leur a mis au coeur d'exécuter sa volonté, d'exécuter une volonté unique, de donner leur Royaume à la bête jusqu'à ce que les paroles de Dieu soient accomplies.
[17:18] Et la femme que tu as vue est la grande ville qui exerce la royauté sur les rois de la terre.
[18:1] Après cela, je vis descendre du ciel un autre ange qui avait une grande puissance, et la terre était illuminée de sa gloire,
[18:2] et il cria d'une voix formidable: «Elle est tombée, elle est tombée, la grande Babylone, elle est devenue une demeure de démons, un refuge d'Esprits impurs, un refuge d'oiseaux immondes et détestés,
[18:3] parce que toutes les nations ont bu du vin de feu de sa fornication, et que les rois de la terre ont forniqué avec elle, et que les marchands de la terre se sont enrichis de son opulence.»
[18:4] Et j'entendis une autre voix qui venait du ciel et disait: «Sortez d'elle, ô mon peuple, pour ne pas vous rendre complices de ses péchés et pour n'être pas atteints par les plaies qui vont la frapper.
[18:5] Ses péchés se sont accumulés jusqu'au ciel, et Dieu s'est souvenu de ses iniquités.
[18:6] Faites-lui ce qu'elle a fait aux autres ; payez-la au double de ses oeuvres, versez-lui à boire le double de la coupe qu'elle a versée aux autres.
[18:7] Autant elle a eu de gloire et d'opulence, autant donnez-lui de tourment et d'affliction. «Je suis assise en reine, dit-elle en son coeur, je ne suis pas' veuve, et je ne connaîtrai jamais le deuil.»
[18:8] Voilà pourquoi toutes ses plaies viendront en un même jour, mort, et désolation, et famine, et destruction par le feu, car puissant est le Seigneur Dieu qui l'a jugée.»
[18:9] Et l'on verra pleurer et se lamenter sur elle les rois de la terre qui ont forniqué avec elle et ont eu leur part de son opulence. A la vue de la fumée de son embrasement
[18:10] et se tenant à distance par crainte de ses tourments: «Malheur! malheur! diront-ils, Quoi! la grande ville! Babylone! la puissante ville! en une heure est venu ton jugement!»
[18:11] Et les marchands de la terre pleureront et se désoleront sur elle, car personne n'achète plus leurs marchandises:
[18:12] marchandises d'or et d'argent, et pierres précieuses, et perles, et fin lin, et pourpre, et soie, et écarlate, et bois de thuia, et objets en ivoire, et objets en bois précieux, et en bronze, et en fer, et en marbre ;
[18:13] et cinname, et amome, et parfums, et huiles aromatiques, et encens, et vin, et huile, et fleur de farine, et froment, et boeufs, et brebis, et chevaux, et chars, et corps et âmes d'hommes.
[18:14] Et toute cette moisson de choses que convoitait ton âme s'en est allée loin de toi, et toutes ces choses brillantes et magnifiques sont perdues pour toi, et tu ne le trouveras plus jamais.
[18:15] Les marchands de toutes ces choses qui se sont enrichis par elles, se tenant à distance par crainte de ses tourments, pleurant
[18:16] et se désolant : «Malheur! malheur! diront-ils, Quoi! la grande ville vêtue d'écarlate, et de pourpre, et de fin lin, parée d'or et de pierres précieuses et de perles!
[18:17] En une heure ont péri tant de richesses!» Et les pilotes et les marins qui venaient vers elle, et les matelots, et tous ceux qui trafiquent de la mer, s'arrêtant à distance,
[18:18] se répandent en cris à la vue de la fumée de son incendie: «Quelle ville, disent-ils, égalait la grande ville?»
[18:19] et ils jettent de la poussière sur leur tête et se répandent en cris, en pleurs, et en lamentations. «Malheur! malheur! disent-ils, grande ville qui enrichissait de ses trésors tous ceux qui avaient des vaisseaux sur la mer ; en une seule heure elle a été changée en désert!»
[18:20] Réjouis-toi de sa ruine, ô ciel ; et vous, les saints, et les apôtres, et les prophètes, réjouissez-vous, car Dieu a vengé votre cause sur elle.»
[18:21] Et un ange d'une force extraordinaire prit une pierre grosse comme une meule et la lança dans la mer en disant : «C'est avec cette violence que sera précipitée Babylone, la grande ville, et on ne la retrouvera plus jamais.
[18:22] Et la voix des joueurs de harpe, et des musiciens, et des joueurs de flûte et de trompette ne résonnera plus dans tes murs ; ni artisan, ni métier ne se trouvera désormais chez toi ;
[18:23] le bruit de la meule ne s'y fera point entendre ; la lumière de la lampe n'y brillera plus jamais ; et la voix du fiancé et celle de la fiancée ne s'y feront plus entendre ; car tes marchands étaient les grands de la terre, et ce sont tes enchantements qui ont égaré toutes les nations,
[18:24] et c'est là qu'on a trouvé le sang des prophètes, et des saints, et de tous ceux qui ont été égorgés sur la terre.
[19:1] Après cela, j'entendis dans le ciel une grande voix comme celle d'une multitude innombrable disant : «Alléluia! Salut, et gloire, et puissance à notre Dieu,
[19:2] car ses jugements sont vrais et justes, et il a jugé la grande prostituée qui corrompait la terre par sa prostitution, et il a vengé le sang de ses serviteurs versé par sa main!»
[19:3] Et une seconde fois, ils dirent : «Alléluia! la fumée de son incendie monte aux siècles des siècles!»
[19:4] Alors les vingt-quatre vieillards et les quatre animaux se prosternèrent et adorèrent Dieu, assis sur le trône, disant: «Amen! alléluia!»
[19:5] Et une voix sortit du trône qui disait : «Louez notre Dieu, vous tous qui êtes ses serviteurs, et qui le craignez, petits et grands.»
[19:6] Et j'entendis une voix comme celle d'une multitude innombrable, et comme la voix des grandes eaux, et comme le bruit de forts coups de tonnerre disant : «Alléluia! car le Seigneur notre Dieu, le Tout-Puissant est entré dans son règne.
[19:7] Réjouissons-nous, et livrons-nous à l'allégresse, et rendons-lui gloire, car voici l'heure des noces de l'agneau, et son épouse s'est parée,
[19:8] et il lui a été donné de revêtir une robe de fin lin, brillant du plus pur éclat.» (Le fin lin symbolise les actes de vertu des saints.)
[19:9] Et il me dit: «Écris: Heureux les invités au festin des noces de l'agneau.» Et il me dit: «Ce sont là les véritables paroles de Dieu.»
[19:10] Et je me prosternai à ses pieds pour l'adorer, et il me dit : «Garde-toi de le faire! je suis un serviteur comme toi, et tes frères qui gardent le témoignage de Jésus. Adore Dieu.» (En effet, le témoignage de Jésus c'est l'esprit de la prophétie.)
[19:11] Et je vis le ciel ouvert, et voici, un cheval blanc ; et celui qui le montait s'appelle fidèle et véridique, et il juge et combat avec justice.
[19:12] Ses yeux étaient une flamme ardente et, sur sa tête, plusieurs diadèmes. Il portait écrit un nom que nul ne conne que lui-même,
[19:13] et il était vêtu d'un manteau teint de sang, et son nom est : «La Parole de Dieu.»
[19:14] Et les armées du ciel le suivaient sur des chevaux blancs, revêtus d'un fin lin, blanc et pur.
[19:15] Et de sa bouche sort une épée aiguë dont il doit frapper les nations. Et il les «gouvernera avec une verge de fer», et il foulera le cuve du vin brûlant de la colère du Dieu Tout-Puissant.
[19:16] Et sur son manteau et sur sa cuisse est écrit le nom : Roi des rois et Seigneur des seigneurs.
[19:17] Et je vis un ange debout dans le soleil, et il cria d'une voix éclatante à tous les oiseaux qui volaient au zénith : «Venez, assemblez-vous pour le grand festin de Dieu ;
[19:18] venez manger la chair des rois, et la chair des tribuns, et la chair des forts, et la chair des chevaux et de leurs cavaliers, et la chair de tous, hommes libres et esclaves, petits et grands!»
[19:19] Et je vis la bête, et les rois de la terre, et leurs armées réunies pour faire la guerre à celui qui était assis sur le cheval et à son armée.
[19:20] Et la bête fut saisie, et avec elle le faux prophète qui avait fait des miracles devant elle, par lesquels il avait séduit ceux qui avaient accepté le signe de la bête et qui avaient adoré son image ; tous deux furent jetés vivants dans l'étang de feu ardent et de soufre.
[19:21] Et les autres furent tués par le glaive qui sortait de la bouche de celui qui était assis sur le cheval, et tous les oiseaux se rassasièrent de leur chair.
[20:1] Et je vis descendre du ciel un ange, tenant à la main la clef de l'abîme et une grande chaîne.
[20:2] Et il saisit le Dragon, le Serpent antique, c'est-à-dire le Diable, Satan, et le lia pour mille ans,
[20:3] et le précipita dans l'abîme, et en ferma l'entrée sur lui, et la scella d'un sceau pour qu'il n'égarât plus les nations jusqu'à ce que les mille ans fussent accomplis. Après cela, il doit être délivré pour quelque temps.
[20:4] Et je vis des trônes, et sur eux s'assirent des personnages qui furent chargés d'un jugement. Et je vis les âmes de ceux qui avaient été frappés de la hache à cause du témoignage de Jésus et de la parole de Dieu, et les âmes de ceux qui n'avaient adoré ni la bête ni son image et qui n'avaient point reçu son signe ni sur leur front ni sur leurs mains. Et ils vécurent et régnèrent mille ans avec le Christ.
[20:5] (Les autres morts ne vécurent pas avant que les mille ans fussent accomplis.) C'est la première résurrection.
[20:6] Heureux et saints ceux qui participent à la première résurrection. Sur eux la seconde mort n'a point de pouvoir ; mais ils seront prêtres de Dieu et du Christ et régneront mille ans avec lui.
[20:7] Et quand les mille ans seront accomplis, Satan sera délivré de sa prison,
[20:8] et il en sortira pour égarer les nations aux quatre coins de la terre, Gog et Magog, et les conduire au combat, armées aussi nombreuses que le sable de la mer.
[20:9] Et elles se répandirent sur la surface de la terre, et assiégèrent le camp des saints, la cité aimée ; mais le feu du ciel descendit sur elles et les dévora ;
[20:10] et le Diable qui les séduisait fut jeté dans l'étang de feu et de soufre, où sont aussi la bête et le faux prophète, et ils y seront tourmentés nuit et jour aux siècles des siècles.
[20:11] Et je vis un grand trône blanc et Celui qui y était assis. A sa vue le ciel et la terre s'enfuirent, et il n'y eut plus nulle part de place pour eux.
[20:12] Et je vis les morts, grands et petits, comparaissant devant le trône, et des livres furent ouverts. On ouvrit aussi un autre livre, le livre de vie. Et les morts furent jugés selon leurs oeuvres, d'après ce qui était écrit dans ces livres.
[20:13] Et la mer rendit les morts qu'elle renfermait ; et la Mort et la Demeure-des-morts rendirent les morts qu'ils renfermaient, et tous furent jugés selon leurs oeuvres.
[20:14] Puis la Mort et la Demeure-des-morts furent jetés dans l'étang de feu ; cet étang de feu est la seconde mort.
[20:15] Et ceux dont les noms ne sont pas trouvés écrits dans le livre de vie sont jetés dans l'étang de feu.
[21:1] Et je vis un ciel nouveau et une terre nouvelle ; car le premier ciel et la première terre avaient disparu, et il n'y avait plus de mer.
[21:2] Et je vis la cité sainte, la Jérusalem nouvelle descendre du ciel d'auprès de Dieu, vêtue comme une fiancée parée pour son époux.
[21:3] Et j'entendis une grande voix qui sortait du trône, disant : «Voici le tabernacle de Dieu avec les hommes! et il habitera avec eux ; et «les hommes seront son peuple, et Dieu lui-même sera avec eux »,
[21:4] «et il essuiera toute larme de leurs yeux ;» et la mort ne sera plus, et il n'y aura plus ni douleurs, ni cris, ni peine, car tout ce qui était a disparu.»
[21:5] Et Celui qui était assis sur le trône dit : «Voilà que je renouvelle toutes choses.» Et il dit : «Écris, car ces paroles sont sûres et vraies» ;
[21:6] et il me dit : «C'en est fait! Je suis l'Alpha et l'Oméga, le commencement et la fin. Celui qui a soif, je le ferai boire gratuitement à la source de vie.
[21:7] Le vainqueur possédera toutes ces choses: et «je serai son Dieu et il sera mon fils.»
[21:8] Quant aux timides, et aux incrédules, et aux abominables, et aux meurtriers, et aux fornicateurs, et aux auteurs de maléfice, et aux idolâtres, et à tous les menteurs, leur part c'est l'étang ardent de feu et de soufre, la seconde mort.
[21:9] Et l'un des sept anges qui avaient tenu les sept coupes pleines des sept dernières plaies, vint à moi et me parla : «Viens, dit-il, je vais te montrer la fiancée, l'épouse de l'agneau.»
[21:10] Et il me transporta en esprit sur une grande et haute montagne, et il me montra la cité sainte, Jérusalem, qui descendait du ciel, d'auprès de Dieu, pénétrée de la gloire de Dieu.
[21:11] Son éclat était celui d'une pierre précieuse, une pierre de jaspe cristallin.
[21:12] Elle avait une grande et haute muraille percée de douze portes, et sur les portes douze anges, et des noms écrits qui sont les noms des douze tribus des enfants d'Israël.
[21:13] A l'Orient, trois portes ; et au Nord, trois portes ; et au Midi, trois portes ; et à l'Occident, trois portes ;
[21:14] et la muraille de la ville avait douze assises de pierre, et sur elles les douze noms des douze apôtres de l'agneau.
[21:15] Et celui qui me parlait tenait une mesure, un bâton en or, pour mesurer la ville, ses portes et sa muraille.
[21:16] Et la ville formait un carré, la longueur égale à la largeur. Et la ville mesurée avec le bâton avait douze mille stades ; la longueur, la largeur et la hauteur étaient égales.
[21:17] Et il mesura la muraille, elle avait cent quarante-quatre coudées (c'est d'une mesure ordinaire que l'ange se servait).
[21:18] Et la muraille était construite en jaspe, et la ville était d'un or pur semblable à un verre transparent.
[21:19] Les assises de la muraille de la ville étaient ornées de pierres précieuses de toute espèce: la première de jaspe, la seconde de saphir, la troisième de calcédoine, la quatrième d'émeraude,
[21:20] la cinquième de sardoine, la sixième de cornaline, la septième de chrysolithe, la huitième de béryl, la neuvième de topaze, la dixième de chrysoprase, la onzième d'hyacinthe, la douzième d'améthyste.
[21:21] Et les douze portes étaient douze perles ; chaque porte composée d'une seule perle. Et la place de la ville était en or pur comme du verre transparent.
[21:22] Et je n'y vis point de Temple, car le «Seigneur Dieu Tout-Puissant» en est le Temple ainsi que l'agneau.
[21:23] Et la ville n'a besoin ni de soleil, ni de lune pour l'éclairer, car la gloire de Dieu l'éclairait et son lustre était l'agneau.
[21:24] Et les nations marcheront à sa lumière, et les rois de la terre lui feront hommage de leur gloire ;
[21:25] et ses portes ne se fermeront jamais le jour ; quant à la nuit, il n'y en aura plus ;
[21:26] et l'on y portera les richesses et les trésors des nations ;
[21:27] et il n'y entrera jamais rien de profane, personne qui se livre à l'abomination et au mensonge ; seuls ceux qui sont inscrits au livre de vie de l'agneau.
[22:1] Et l'ange me montra le fleuve de vie, transparent comme le cristal, sortant du trône de Dieu et de l'agneau.
[22:2] Au milieu de la place de la ville et sur les bords du fleuve, des deux côtés, se trouve l'arbre de vie, qui produit douze espèces de fruit, qui donne chaque mois une de ces espèces, et les feuilles de cet arbre servent à la guérison des nations ;
[22:3] et il n'y aura plus d'anathème ; et là sera le trône de Dieu et de l'agneau, et ses serviteurs l'adoreront
[22:4] et verront sa face, et son nom sera écrit sur leurs fronts.
[22:5] Et la nuit ne sera plus ; et on n'aura besoin ni de la lumière d'une lampe, ni de la lumière du soleil, parce que le Seigneur Dieu les éclairera, et ils régneront aux siècles des siècles.
[22:6] Et il me dit: «Ces paroles sont sûres et vraies. Et le Seigneur, le Dieu des esprits des prophètes, a envoyé son ange pour montrer à ses serviteurs ce qui doit arriver bientôt.»
[22:7] «Et voici je viens bientôt.» «Heureux celui qui garde les paroles de la prophétie de ce livre.»
[22:8] Et c'est moi, Jean, qui vis et entendis ces choses et, après les avoir vues et entendues, je tombai aux pieds de l'ange, qui me les montrait, pour l'adorer.
[22:9] Et il me dit: «Garde-toi de le faire! Je suis un serviteur comme toit, et comme tes frères les prophètes, et comme ceux qui gardent les paroles de ce livre. Adore Dieu!»
[22:10] Et il me dit : «Ne scelle pas les discours de la prophétie de ce livre, car le temps est proche!»
[22:11] «Que l'injuste devienne plus injuste encore! que celui qui est il souillé se souille encore! que le juste pratique encore plus la justice! que le saint se sanctifie encore!»
[22:12] Voici je viens bientôt ; et j'apporte avec moi ma rémunération. «Je la décernerai à chacun selon ses oeuvres.»
[22:13] Je suis l'Alpha et l'Oméga, le premier et le dernier, le commencement et la fin.
[22:14] Heureux ceux qui lavent leurs robes pour avoir droit à l'arbre de vie, et pour passer par les portes et entrer dans la ville.
[22:15] Dehors, les chiens, et les artisans de maléfices, et les fornicateurs, et les meurtriers, et les idolâtres, et quiconque aime et commet le mensonge !
[22:16] Moi, Jésus, j'ai envoyé mon ange pour vous attester ces choses dans les Églises. Je suis la tige et le rejeton de David, l'étoile brillante du matin.
[22:17] «Viens», disent l'Esprit et l'épouse. — Que celui qui entend cet appel dise aussi : «Viens.» Que celui qui a soif vienne. Que celui qui le veut reçoive gratuitement de l'eau qui donne la vie.
[22:18] (Je déclare ceci à quiconque entend les paroles de la prophétie renfermée en ce livre : Si quelqu'un y ajoute quoi que ce soit, Dieu le frappera des plaies décrites en ce livre.
[22:19] Et si quelqu'un retranche quoi que ce soit aux discours du livre de cette prophétie, Dieu lui ôtera sa part de l'arbre de vie et de la ville sainte, décrits en ce livre.)
[22:20] «Oui, je viens bientôt», dit celui qui atteste ces choses. «Amen! viens, Seigneur Jésus !»
[22:21] La grâce du Seigneur Jésus soit avec les fidèles.
